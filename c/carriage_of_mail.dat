25|$|In 2011, about 81% {{of revenue}} was from {{passenger}} traffic and only 5% from cargo. Another 7.8% was from {{food and beverage}} sales. The remaining 6% was from various sources including excess baggage charges; air charter services; aircraft maintenance engineering services; ground handling and related services; and <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{official}} <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> by rail {{was by the}} United Kingdom's General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting of mail en route first occurred in the United Kingdom {{with the introduction of}} the Travelling Post Office in 1838 on the Grand Junction Railway following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantages}} of the new technology {{and the removal of}} delays caused by the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> and the elimination of refreshment stops (with the inclusion of a buffet car) became apparent instantly, with the travel time between Christchurch and Dunedin cut by almost an hour from 7 hours 9 minutes to 6 hours 14 minutes. [...] Typically, two DJ diesels hauled the train, and when a third was added to increase power on the rugged, difficult line between Oamaru and Dunedin, another 19 minutes was slashed from the schedule.|$|E
50|$|A further serious {{strategic}} {{mistake was}} {{the refusal of}} the SER to accept {{the terms of the}} contract for the cross-channel <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> in 1862, as this stipulated the use of Dover rather than Folkestone. This enabled the London Chatham and Dover Railway which had only reached Dover in 1861 to secure the contract and the following year would give it leverage when it came to negotiating the Continental Traffic Agreement.|$|R
50|$|A key {{objective}} of the promoters of the line was to connect southern Ireland by ferry from Fishguard to a harbour near Wexford. It was hoped that the Post Office contract for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> between London and Dublin could be secured for the Great Western Railway and its allies. In Ireland, the Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin Railway Company was to handle the traffic. Brunel also hoped that a transatlantic shipping business using Fishguard might be developed.|$|R
50|$|In 1857 the Portpatrick Railway was authorised, {{its primary}} {{objective}} was to connect Portpatrick and Carlisle for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails,</b> passenger and goods. When {{it became obvious that}} Portpatrick Harbour {{was not going to be}} improved, it concentrated on Stranraer as its ferry port. Stranraer is at the southern end of Loch Ryan; although the passage to Irish ports is longer, Stranraer was a more spacious and better-sheltered location, thus it became the dominant port for transits to northern Ireland.|$|R

50|$|The {{impact of}} the two {{locomotives}} colliding forced the Garratt {{into the side of}} the silo and reared up its boiler section on to its leading water unit. 3817 was derailed and pushed over on to its side. Three <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Mail</b> train were also derailed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1895, a tree blew {{down near}} to the station, and it fell on the rear <b>of</b> the sorting <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> a <b>mail</b> train from Inverness to [...] The sorter was unhurt as he {{was working in the}} front half <b>of</b> the <b>carriage</b> at the time.|$|R
50|$|On 27 April 1892, eight {{passengers}} {{were killed by}} a derailment <b>of</b> the rear <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> a western-bound <b>mail</b> train caused by a broken rail.|$|R
50|$|In 1880, <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{was made}} {{mandatory}} for any ship calling at Stanley, and regular service was contracted to the German Kosmos Line, which operated steamships on a route from Hamburg to Callao, Peru.|$|E
50|$|The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company {{received}} its Royal Mail Warrant for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> on 12 July 1831, and Monas Isle took the title Royal Mail Ship {{for the first}} time on 19 July.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century passenger traffic occupied an increasingly important position in rail transport in the region. The line between Odessa and Chisinau via Tiraspol operated passenger and freight trains, including the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1836, {{the canal}} {{was used as}} a Star Route for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> from Georgetown to Shepherdstown, West Virginia using canal packets. The {{contract}} was held by Albert Humrickhouse at $1,000 per annum for a daily service of 72 book miles. The canal approached Hancock, Maryland by 1839. In 1843, the Potomac Aqueduct Bridge was constructed near the present-day Key Bridge to connect the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal to the Alexandria Canal which led to Alexandria, Virginia.9 By the time the canal reached Cumberland in 1850, it had already been rendered obsolete; the B&O Railroad had reached Cumberland eight years previously.10 Debt-ridden, the company dropped its plan to continue construction of the next 180 mi of the canal into the Ohio valley.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a {{shunting}} {{engine and}} three carriages were travelling {{through the tunnel}} away from the station having been warned by the station master about the runaway mail train. The last two carriages {{were still in the}} tunnel when they were struck by the mail train, as were the first six <b>carriages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> train, which began to burn, their wood construction being ignited by the train's gaslighting.|$|R
5000|$|Ludington was {{a founder}} and first {{president}} of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association He was also founder and associate director of the aviation wing of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He was a technical advisor from time to time for National Air Transport, Keystone Aircraft, Fairchild Aviation, North American Aviation, Jacobs Aviation Engine Company, Kellett Autogiro Corporation, and Curtiss Flying Service. He was also connected with lighting that helped bring about night flying capabilities for the regular <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> air <b>mail.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1850, the Government disbanded the Packet Service. Instead, the Post Office {{contracted}} for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{with companies}} running other regularly timetabled services. Ships with {{the contract to}} carry mail were designated Royal Mail Ship. This change was administered by Admiral Parry.|$|E

50|$|Originally mail {{was carried}} on an {{irregular}} basis as ships called. A datestamp was in use from February 1858, and in 1863 the Union Steamship Co. began regular <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> continuing until 1977. On 3 March, 1867 British postage stamps became valid for Ascension mail, and continued in use until 1922, when Ascension became a dependency of Saint Helena.|$|E
50|$|The Chester and Holyhead Railway was {{incorporated}} {{out of a}} proposal to link Holyhead, the traditional port for the Irish Mail, with London {{by way of the}} existing Chester and Crewe Railway, and what is now the West Coast Main Line. Indeed, the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the Irish <b>Mail</b> was always the primary objective of the founding Directors.|$|R
50|$|In 1853, El Salvador {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Central American Steam Navigation Company (CASNC) to permit mail steamers to call at Acajutla, La Libertad, and La Union. This company ran a line of steamers once a month between Iztapa (Guatemala) and Panama, touching in turn at Acajutla, La Libertad, La Union, Amapala (Honduras), El Realejo and San Juan del Sur (Nicaragua) for the conveyance <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> passengers, and freight. Each government paid a subsidy for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mail.</b> Service began in 1854 and later was continued by the Panama Canal Railway Company steamers, and subsequently, by the steamers <b>of</b> the Pacific <b>Mail</b> Steamship Company. It can be assumed that because of these circumstances, post offices were opened in the three ports where the CASNC called (Acajutla, La Libertad, and La Union).|$|R
50|$|For centuries it {{was rare}} for {{messages}} {{to be carried}} by any means other than a relay of runners on foot. A runner ran from one village or relay post to the next, carrying the letters on a pole with a sharp point. His was a dangerous occupation: the relay of postal runners worked throughout the day and night, vulnerable to attacks by bandits and wild animals. These mail runners were used chiefly by the rulers, for purposes of gathering information and wartime news. They were subsequently used by merchants for trade purpose. It was much later that mail runners came {{to be in use}} for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> private <b>mail.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{postal service}} grew when railway {{connections}} were established {{with the other}} Presidencies in 1871. By 1874, there were nine post offices in the city. The internal <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> in Madras was by horse cart (jutkas) till 1918, though a beginning with motorised transport was made in 1915. The telegraph came to Madras in 1853 but was {{made available to the}} public only from 1 February 1855, when 41 offices covering a distance of 3,000 miles could be reached.|$|E
5000|$|As a way {{of raising}} capital to improve his flock, in 1850 he {{accepted}} a tender for the arduous task of the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> With {{the help of his}} station hands he also [...] "rode the post" [...] for the Geelong region, in addition to his pastoral duties. Later that year, he was then able to purchase the neighbouring property Ghirangemerajah, north of Lismore. Now with a sizable staff of station hands, he was able to effectively manage his second property from his base at Mopiamnum.|$|E
5000|$|The first Georgian mail {{transportation}} {{is related to}} the name of [...] "Georgian Carriage". [...] "Georgian Carriage" [...] is currently exhibited in the Central Museum of Communication named [...] "Popov" [...] (Saint-Petersburg) with the ancient mail transportation facilities. The bulls harnessed in the Carriage carried the big postal parcels. Two Georgians were at the front <b>of</b> the <b>Carriage.</b> Transportation <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> sent by post with the Georgian Carriage attracted attention in different countries. In 1900, the book translated from German into Russian - [...] "Technology and Industry" [...] (volume X) provides the description of several unique samples of the Berlin Postal Museum. One of the catalogues of the [...] "Popov" [...] museum informs that in Chicago, at the exhibition of the World Postal Mail, held in 1893, the model of the Georgian Postal Carriage and the painting <b>of</b> postal <b>mail</b> transportation in Caucasus was displayed in the section of Russia. In Georgia the development <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> service was directly connected to the improvement <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> transportation through the Caucasus - from Georgia to Russia.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the behest}} of American {{newspaper}} publisher William Randolph Hearst, whose media empire was the major commercial backer of the project with four staffers among the flight's nine passengers, the Grafs [...] "Round-the-World" [...] (Weltrundfahrt 1929) flight in August 1929 officially began and ended at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey. As {{with many of the}} airship's other flights, however, its expenses were also heavily offset by the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> souvenir <b>mail</b> to and/or from [...] Lakehurst, Friedrichshafen, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. A U.S. franked letter flown on the whole trip from Lakehurst to Lakehurst, for instance, required US$3.55 in postage or the equivalent of roughly $45 in current dollars if based on the Consumer price index. The $200,000 Hearst paid for exclusive media rights would currently be the equivalent of $2.5 million if figured on the same basis.|$|R
25|$|Link's first {{military}} sales came as {{a result}} <b>of</b> the Air <b>Mail</b> scandal, when the Army Air Corps took over <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Air <b>Mail.</b> Twelve pilots {{were killed in a}} 78-day period due to their unfamiliarity with Instrument Flying Conditions. The large scale loss of life prompted the Air Corps to look at a number of solutions, including Link's pilot trainer. The Air Corps was given a stark demonstration of the potential of instrument training when, in 1934, Link flew in to a meeting in conditions of fog that the Air Corps evaluation team regarded as unflyable. As a result, the Air Corps ordered the first six pilot trainers at $3,500 each.|$|R

50|$|From {{the late}} 1940s, mail planes became {{increasingly}} rare, as the increasing size of aircraft and economics dictated {{a move towards}} bulk <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> onboard airline flights, and this remains the primary method today. Parcel mail, overnight mail and priority mail, however, are still carried aboard what may be considered the spiritual successors of classic, pre-war mail planes; small, general aviation aircraft that have been adapted to the role, with the Cessna 208 and Piper PA-31 Navajo being among the most popular. Cargo airline operators, such as UPS and FedEx, also carry mail along with bulk cargo, aboard converted airliners.|$|E
50|$|During 1942, {{an order}} for 14 transport-orientated Warwicks, {{designated}} as the Warwick C.Mk.I and Vickers 456, was made for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), a civil operator. The prescribed operational requirements were the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> freight, and passengers (in order of priority) between Bathurst in South Africa and Cairo in Egypt, complementing BOAC's flying boat operations between England and Bathurst. The order was quickly met by converting existing B.Mk.I Warwicks, removing all military equipment, fairing over gun turret positions, along with the installation of cabin windows, a freight floor, long-range fuel tanks, and exhaust stack flame dampers (for night flights).|$|E
25|$|With the US {{already in}} the depths of the Great Depression, however, only about 7% of the very {{expensive}} stamps that had been produced had been distributed when the issue was withdrawn from sale on 30 June. The more than three million unsold stamps were promptly destroyed by the U.S. Post Office thus making the three Graf Zeppelin issues by far the USPOD's smallest of the 20th Century. Despite the poor sales of these issues, the U.S. Post Office Department nevertheless paid the Zeppelin Company $100,000 for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> U.S. franked <b>mail</b> on the flight.|$|R
50|$|On 28 February 1931 {{a weekly}} service began between London and Mwanza on Lake Victoria in Tanganyika {{as part of}} the {{proposed}} route to Cape Town. On 9 December 1931 the Imperial Airways’ service for Central Africa was extended experimentally to Cape Town for the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> Christmas <b>mail.</b> The aircraft used on the last sector, DH66 G-AARY City of Karachi arrived in Cape Town on 21 December 1931. On 20 January 1932 a mail-only route to London to Cape Town was opened. On 27 April this route was opened to passengers and took 10 days. In early 1933 Atalantas replaced the DH.66s on the Kisumu to Cape Town sector of the London to Cape Town route. On 9 February 1936 the trans-Africa route was opened by Imperial Airways between Khartoum and Kano in Nigeria. This route was extended to Lagos on 15 October 1936.|$|R
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> their <b>mail</b> on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|R
