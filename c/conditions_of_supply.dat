This produces a delicate relationship between civilian nuclear programs and nuclear weapon proliferation. This study explores how export competition affects suppliers’ <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> related to nuclear nonproliferation. We investigated three export cases (India, North Korea, and South Korea) and identified four effects that competition {{has on the}} <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> related to nonproliferation. First, under highly competitive conditions, suppliers might hesitate to enforce the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> to avoid negotiation conflicts with recipients. Second, suppliers focus on politically and economically attractive recipients while mostly ignoring unattractive ones, perhaps allowing proliferation problems to fester out of view in marginal states. Third, suppliers can build consensus on the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> to avoid being the only party experiencing negotiation conflicts. Fourth, suppliers can constrain others from relaxing the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> to maintain economic benefits and nonproliferation norms. The first two effects accelerate proliferation while the last two promote nonproliferation. Although the extent of these effects can vary with changes in nonproliferation norms, they can contribute {{to our understanding of}} the relationship between nonproliferation and civilian nuclear programs. clos...|$|E

40|$|Aims To examine {{changes in}} the use of amphetamines, measure current <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> and {{investigate}} harms related to amphetamine use, in New Zealand. Methods National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15 – 45 years were asked about their alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. In 2001, those who had used stimulants (uppers, speed, amphetamine, methamphetamine) within the previous year were asked a number of new questions about harms experienced from use and present <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Results Last-year use of stimulants increased from 2. 9 % in 1998, to 5. 0 % in 2001; use of ice (crystal methamphetamine) increased from 0. 1 % to 0. 9 %, while use of marijuana (19. 9 % and 20. 3 %) and LSD (3. 8 % and 3. 2 %) remained static. Forty one per cent of users thought stimulants were easier to obtain in 2001 compared to a year earlier, and 20 % thought the price was lower. One fifth of stimulant users reported harmful effects on ‘energy and vitality’, while one in ten reported harms to ‘financial position’, ‘health’, and ‘work opportunities’. Conclusions Stimulants moved from being the third most popular illicit drug type in 1998, to the second most popular by 2001. Additional research is required to adequately assess the extent of harms experienced by amphetamine users in New Zealand. A number of countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan experienced increased use and manufacture of powerful amphetamines, such as methamphetamine, in the late 1990 s. Similar patterns of amphetamine use were reported in Western Europe {{in the early part of}} the decade. 1 – 5 Methamphetamine is an addictive psychostimulant resembling cocaine but with a longer duration period (4 – 12 hours). 6, 7 Chronic high-dose use has effects including hostility, violence, hallucinations, and paranoid psychosis resembling schizophrenia, and can cause damage to cardiac, vascular and neurological systems. 6...|$|E

In most countries central banks influence short term interest rates through determining the equilibrium <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand in the market for bank reserves (liquidity). This article describes the {{liquidity management}} practice of the National Bank of Hungary in the period of 1998 - 2001. This period is characterized by two particular circumstances. First, there is a substantial liquidity surplus, therefore the Bank influences market interest rates using the liabilities side instruments of its balance sheet. Second, as a result of the narrow-band exchange rate regime and the fact that the Treasury Account is held with the Bank, the amount of liquidity is highly volatile and hard to forecast. The article explains how the Bank forecasts liquidity and the movements of overnight interest rate in these circumstances, and it describes the development of monetary policy instruments applied by the bank. monetary policy instruments, central bank liquidity management, interbank markets. ...|$|E

This paper investigates this phenomenon by examining the financial practices of low income people and in particular the social relational dimensions of debt that underlie these mobile money transactions. By contrasting the social relations involved in mobile money to those of informal groups and banks which are the next most used services, this evidence highlights a 'fiduciary culture' in which relationships of equality and 'negotiability' dominate and which are seamlessly facilitated by mobile money in contrast to relations with banks which tend towards relations of hierarchy. I argue that this reveals a competing emic vision that questions policy makers expectations that mobile money transfer will itself seamlessly facilitate engagement with the formal sector for savings and credit...|$|E
