When Kabila visited U.S. President George W.

The company is being supervised by Special Operations Command-Africa Command. The various international training programmes are not well integrated.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
