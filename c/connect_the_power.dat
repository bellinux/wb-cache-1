500|$|The {{addition}} of various power lines {{was needed to}} <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> stations to the National Grid. These included a 275kilovolt (kV) connection from Stella to West Melton, and another 275kV connection from Stella to Carlisle. The towers for these connections were to stand at , rather than the [...] towers of the existing grid system. The line from Stella to Carlisle, which was to consist of 250 towers spaced at 320 meters over a distance of around , came up against opposition when first proposed. The Northumberland County Planning Authority launched a public enquiry in 1951, and Hexham Rural District Council held a meeting. The Ministry of Agriculture and other outdoor associations voiced their concerns, as it was feared that the line would interfere with good farming land. An alternative route was proposed, but in view of its additional cost of £72,000 it was turned down, and the Ministry of Fuel and Power gave the line the go-ahead.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{generating}} capacity at Inga with the copper and cobalt mines {{located near the}} Zambian border in Shaba Province (now Katanga), a new project aimed to build the longest high-voltage direct current power line in existence, bypassing local communities and converting into alternating current at its final destination. [...] The various groups involved had economic {{as well as political}} agendas; while Western investors and the Congolese government wished to support the Shaba mines during a period of elevated copper prices, the government also wanted to consolidate its power over the secessionist southern province, and the West had an interest in seeing the Congo stay firmly in the anti-communist camp. [...] The cost for the project was constantly revised upward, eventually reaching $500 million over budget. [...] A mix of private and public groups provided the financing, notably Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and it was the storied Boise, Idaho-based company, Morrison-Knudsen, that was contracted to do the work.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{characteristic}} of El Greco's mature style {{is the use}} of light. As Brown notes, [...] "each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source". Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism. The later works of the painter turn this use of light into glowing colors. In The Vision of Saint John and the Fifth Seal of the Apocalypse the scenes owe their power to this otherworldly stormy light, which reveals their mystic character. The renowned View of Toledo (c. 1600) also acquires its visionary character because of this stormy light. The grey-blue clouds are split by lightning bolts, which vividly highlight the noble buildings of the city. His last landscape, View and Plan of Toledo, is almost like a vision, all of the buildings painted glistening white. According to Wethey, in his surviving landscapes, [...] "El Greco demonstrated his characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe". Professor Nicos Hadjinicolaou notes the manner in which El Greco could adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings and stresses the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern transmitting equipment {{is designed to}} operate with a resistive load fed via coaxial cable of a particular characteristic impedance, often 50 ohms. To <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> stage of the transmitter to this coaxial cable transmission line a matching network is required. For solid state transmitters this is typically a broadband transformer which steps up the low impedance of the output devices to 50 ohms. A tube transmitter will contain a tuned output network, most commonly a PI network, that steps the load impedance which the tube requires down to 50 ohms. In each case the power producing devices will not transfer power efficiently if the network is detuned or badly designed or if the antenna presents other than 50 ohms at the transmitter output. Commonly an SWR meter and/or directional wattmeter are used to check {{the extent of the}} match between the aerial system and the transmitter via the transmission line (feeder). A directional wattmeter indicates forward power, reflected power, and often SWR as well. Each transmitter will specify a maximum allowable mismatch based on efficiency, distortion, and possible damage to the transmitter. Many transmitters have automatic circuits to reduce power or shut down if this value is exceeded.|$|E
