5000|$|In 1984 the Road Development Authority of Tangalle built a {{causeway}} called Kapuhenwela {{across the}} outlet canal; around 700 m from the lagoon mouth to the inland. Water passes under the causeway through twenty three, 23 cm diameter pipes which greatly reduce {{the volume and}} speed of water entering and leaving the lagoon system. This causeway has prevented flushing of the lagoon by natural water flow, causing continues sedimentation in the lagoon. In 1999 a bridge of 6.2 m in length was constructed {{in place of the}} part of the causeway in order to improve free water flow. After the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, minor damage was inflicted on the causeway and it was renovated and replaced with eight cylindrical culverts with an average diameter of 79 cm in 2005.. Causeway itself and its modifications provoked concern over local resource users and environmentalists as the lagoon hydrology (ex; reduced flushing), salinity and there by the ecology (ex; reduction in shrimp catch) showed drastic changes and variations Before the construction of causeway, the effective <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> section was [...] which was then reduced to 25 m with the introduction of existing causeway structure with the bridge, a drop of 71% of effective <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> section.|$|E

5000|$|Closure of the {{hyperbolic}} {{system of}} equations (...) - (...) is obtained from the geometry of cross sections - by providing a functional relationship between the cross-sectional area A and the surface elevation ζ at each position x. For example, for a rectangular cross section, with constant channel width B and channel bed elevation zb, the cross sectional area is: A [...] B (ζ − zb) [...] B h. The instantaneous water depth is h(x,t) [...] ζ(x,t) − zb(x), with zb(x) the bed level (i.e. elevation of the lowest point in the bed above datum. For non-moving channel walls the cross-sectional area in equation (...) can be written as: A [...] b(x,h) h(x,t), with b(x,h) the effective width of the <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> section at location x with fluid depth h (b(x,h) [...] B(x) for rectangular channels), leading {{to other forms of}} the equation.|$|E
50|$|Glaciers erode {{predominantly}} {{by three}} different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, {{in addition to}} the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of overdeepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.|$|E

50|$|Mayall et al. (2006) {{provides}} the best summary that discusses the causes of sinuosity. Factors involve: flow dynamics such as flow density and flow velocity; {{and the depth of}} the current relative to topography; and topographic and morphological controls such; shape <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> section, slope topography, erosive base at flow onset and the effects of both lateral stacking and lateral accretion. Compared to their terrestrial cousins, the scale of submarine systems observed in seismic sections, aerial photos and rock outcrops are in no way comparable. As expected with this significant difference in scale, the dynamics of turbid current flows within submarine channels are significantly different from fluvial systems. These differences in dynamics and scale are due to the much lower density contrast between the flow and the host fluid is much lower in submarine channels than that of open channel flows with a free surface. This causes the flow to be significantly super-elevated about the channel margin causing overspill and building the levees.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1937, Diamond Motors {{produced}} {{their first}} battery-electric road vehicle, a four-wheeled van with the cab {{in front of}} the front wheels, suitable for a payload of 8-10 cwt.

The vehicle was fitted with a [...] motor manufactured by the Electric Power Engineering Co., and powered from a 60-volt battery.

40|$|Abstract: The general {{problem of}} solving for normal flow dcplh in open-chan nel flow has a {{complication}} in that {{some types of}} <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> sections do not always have a unique solution. This paper analyzes an alternative iterative pro cedure for quickly and accurately solving the implicit problem of determining the normal flow depth in complex channel sections. Conditions that guarantee a unique solution and guarantee that the iterative procedure will converge to the solution are developed. A computer program for quickly and accurately finding the unique solution, using the Chezy or Manning flow resistance equations, is available. Test runs for a rectangular, a triangular, a trapezoidal, and two complex <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> sections are {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the procedure. The test results show that the iterative procedure presented here meets the requirements of guar anteed convergence, computational efficiency (speed and accuracy), and the ability to handle both trapezoidal and complex <b>channel</b> <b>cross</b> sections...|$|E
