5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E

As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations.

5|$|Humans {{arrived in}} the Florida {{peninsula}} approximately 15,000years ago. Paleo-Indians came to Florida probably following large game that included giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, and spectacled bears. They found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions. However, 6,500years ago, <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> brought a wetter landscape; large animals became extinct in Florida, and the Paleo-Indians slowly adapted and became the Archaic peoples. They conformed to the environmental changes, and created many tools with the various resources available. During the Late Archaic period, the climate became wetter again, and approximately 3000 BCE the rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity. Florida Indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for the bodies of water near where they were located: Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Glades.|$|E

Large animals became extinct in Florida around 11,000 years ago. <b>Climate</b> <b>changes</b> 6,500years ago brought a wetter landscape. The Paleo-Indians slowly adapted to the new conditions. Archaeologists call the cultures that resulted from the adaptations Archaic peoples.

It lists articles, reports, conference papers and website information published about <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and Australian tourism from 1996 to 2010. It includes sections on <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> issues relevant to accommodation and aviation, carbon footprints of Australian tourism, carbon offsets in Australian tourism, conference papers and journal articles relating to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and tourism, along with {{research by the}} Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre (STCRC) about <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> impacts on destinations and reducing emissions in tourism accommodation. Further sections list <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and tourism information produced by government tourism agencies and industry tourism organisations, followed by <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> impacts on the Australian Alps and Great Barrier Reef. The final section lists <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and tourism items for each state or territory. This bibliography on <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and Australian tourism has been compiled to assist researchers, lecturers, students, consultants and government staff to locate resources on <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> topics. It considers both <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> adaptation and mitigation responses by the tourism industry. ‘Adaptation to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> consists of initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems against actual or expected <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> effects’ while ‘mitigation of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> involves taking actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance sinks’ (STCRC, 2009 b, p. 5). Adaptation actions aim to lessen the effects of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> by building business and environmental resilience while mitigation actions aim to moderate the extent of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> by reducing emissions and improving carbon sequestration (e. g. by planting trees). Australian tourism responses to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> include both adaptation and mitigation strategies. <b>Climate</b> <b>change</b> adaptation includes increased use of air conditioning or heating, artificial snow making, rock walls and groynes on eroding beaches, risk management plans and tourism workshops. Mitigation includes energy, water and waste management to reduce emissions, and carbon offsetting. The next sections review the government, industry and research responses to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> impacts on Australian tourism.

5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic <b>climate</b> <b>changes.</b> This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992.

Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
