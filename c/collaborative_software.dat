25|$|Wikipedia {{became the}} most famous wiki site, {{entering}} the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s (decade), wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as <b>collaborative</b> <b>software.</b> Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some companies use wikis as their only <b>collaborative</b> <b>software</b> and {{as a replacement for}} static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance group learning. There may be greater use of wikis behind firewalls than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, the word wiki was listed in the online Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

25|$|Wiki {{software}} {{is a type}} of <b>collaborative</b> <b>software</b> that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing web server, or as a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a file system, and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system. A commonly implemented software package is MediaWiki, which runs Wikipedia. Alternatively, personal wikis run as a standalone application on a single computer. WikidPad is an example. One application, TiddlyWiki, simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.|$|E

Two decades of research has extended its capabilities and expanded its applications to include group undo, locking, conflict resolution, operation notification and compression, group-awareness, HTML/XML and tree-structured document editing, collaborative office productivity tools, application-sharing, and collaborative computer-aided media design tools (see [...] ). In 2009 OT was adopted as a core technique behind the collaboration features in Apache Wave and Google Docs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{low cost}} and nearly {{instantaneous}} sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made collaborative work dramatically easier, {{with the help}} of <b>collaborative</b> <b>software.</b> Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the free software movement, which has produced, among other things, Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and OpenOffice.org (later forked into LibreOffice). Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. [...] Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.|$|E
