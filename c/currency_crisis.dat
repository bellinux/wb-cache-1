5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new <b>currency</b> <b>crisis,</b> and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an {{extremely}} poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian <b>currency</b> <b>crisis,</b> 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

40|$|Sovereign {{credit ratings}} play an {{important}} part in determining countries’ access to international capital markets and the terms of that access. In principle, {{there is no reason to}} expect that sovereign credit ratings should systematically predict <b>currency</b> <b>crises.</b> In practice, however, in emerging market economies there is a strong link between <b>currency</b> <b>crises</b> and default. Hence if credit ratings are forward-looking and <b>currency</b> <b>crises</b> in emerging market economies are linked to defaults, it follows that downgrades in credit ratings should systematically precede <b>currency</b> <b>crises.</b> This article presents results suggesting that sovereign credit ratings systematically fail to predict <b>currency</b> <b>crises</b> but do considerably better in predicting defaults. Downgrades in credit ratings usually follow <b>currency</b> <b>crises,</b> possibly suggesting that currency instability increases the risk of default. ...|$|R

The UK benefited from the American Marshall Aid program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly.

In 1990, with a gradual deregulation promoted by the Federal Government, VASP and Transbrasil were authorized to fly to international destinations, breaking an almost-monopoly held by Varig since 1965 (Cruzeiro do Sul was the only exception). More international carriers were also authorized to fly to Brazil, greatly increasing competition. Slowly Varig began to lose its financial health, aggravated by the early 1990s world recession and administration problems. In 1988, a few years after the inauguration of São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, Varig decided to move its operational hub from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo.|$|E

Using the combined data of exchange rate regimes and the existence of capital controls, we also find that hard pegs with capital account liberalization have a significantly lower probability of <b>currency</b> <b>crises</b> than intermediate regimes with capital controls and free floats with capital controls. Hence, the bipolar view does not strictly hold in the sense that intermediate regimes are significantly more prone to <b>currency</b> <b>crises</b> than the two extreme regimes.

[...] One faction dominated by landowners proposed a land bank, while merchants proposed a bank that would issue silver-backed paper. [...] The proposals polarized the Massachusetts political establishment, and Belcher was unable to take sides for fear of alienating supporters on either side. [...] He instead sought without success to browbeat the assembly into passing a currency retirement scheme acceptable to London. [...] In 1740 elections land bank supporters swept into office, and the bank began issuing notes. [...] Merchant interests opposed to the land bank began widespread lobbying in London for Parliamentary relief (which came in 1741, when it passed legislation extending the 1720 Bubble Act, which disallowed unchartered companies, to the colonies) likely abetted by John Thomlinson.|$|E
