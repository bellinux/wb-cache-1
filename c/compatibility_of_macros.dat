40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Shapiro and Sober (2007) defend two claims {{with respect to}} the master {{argument}} for epiphenomenalism, which is designed to rebut non-reductive physicalism: (i) relative to an interventionist account of causation, as most elaborately presented in (Wood-ward 2003), the master argument turns out to be invalid; and (ii) interventionism provides a means to experimentally uncover micro effects <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> causes. The first part of this paper takes issue with both of these claims by showing that Woodward’s intervention-ism and non-reductive physicalism are incompatible—contrary to Shapiro’s and Sober’s assessment. The second part then discusses two possible modifications of Woodward’s theory, both of which ensure the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> interventionism and non-reductive phys-icalism. Nonetheless, it shall turn out that neither of those modifications suits the purposes of non-reductive physicalists. ...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate turnout {{rates are}} among the central {{indicators}} of democratic performance in the American polity. Despite the considerable implications <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> turnout, however, most studies of turnout focus in-stead on the micro level. As a consequence, we know little about how local, political, and historical in-fluences have impacted turnout {{over the course of}} American political development. The result is a somewhat impoverished conception of turnout that often removes the political from political participa-tion. In this article, I argue for a new, macro-level perspective that highlights the political dimension of turnout by placing turnout in the local political settings in which it has taken place. I contrast two com-peting explanations <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> turnout variation across local electorates, a political account and Elazar’s cultural thesis, and discuss their implications for the political geography <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> turnout in American electoral history. I then examine this political geography by employing a local indicator of spatial asso-ciation (a LISA statistic) to identify the spatial structuring <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> turnout in the United States from 1828 through 2000. I demonstrate that a political perspective provides greater leverage than Elazar’s cul-tural perspective in explaining the political geography <b>of</b> <b>macro</b> turnout in the United States...|$|R
