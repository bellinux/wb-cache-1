5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (<b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohabitation}} {{lifestyle is}} becoming more popular in today's generation. It is more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> couples not to get married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in society, the desire to get married is less attractive for couples uncertain of their long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

These languages can be <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> specifying {{positions of}} Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E

5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} {{the matter to}} the negotiation table with the Soviets and on opening {{an investigation by the}} International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> the Allied leaders.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen {{had already begun to}} consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned in the discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.|$|E

In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others. Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> storytelling purposes. Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E

5|$|Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was {{the gold}} eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed {{out of the}} United States for {{economic}} reasons {{for much of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, {{who was one of the}} Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|Despite DuPont's grand {{boulevard}} {{not coming}} to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative {{as one of the}} earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing MilfordDover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title Caged Heat. Cinematographer John Toll opted {{to for the}} first time in his career work with digital cameras, as he found them more <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film {{primarily}} on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn. A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock. The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.|$|E

5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{engaged in}} a {{strategy}} of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} built on a site of the medieval steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It was built by the South Eastern Railway {{in order to have}} a railway {{terminal}} in the City and compete with their rivals, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The City location of the station necessitated a new bridge across the River Thames, which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was <b>convenient</b> <b>for</b> travel between the City and the West End, until the construction of the District Railway. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson, while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the Thameslink Programme development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.|$|E
