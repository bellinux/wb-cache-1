5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including <b>celluloid,</b> Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was <b>celluloid</b> billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|William Friese-Greene {{experimented with}} <b>celluloid</b> and motion {{pictures}} {{in his studio}} in the 1870s, developing {{some of the earliest}} movie camera technology. He is credited as being one of the inventors of cinematography.|$|E
5|$|Quinceañera premiered on January 23, 2006, at the Sundance Film Festival, {{where it}} won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award in the {{dramatic}} feature category. Its U.S. distribution rights were bought by Sony Pictures Classics while its international rights were purchased by <b>Celluloid</b> Dreams. The film was later screened at the Berlin International Film Festival before its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the <b>celluloid.</b> When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|As with {{at least}} 4% of Méliès's output (including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies, The Impossible Voyage, and The Barber of Seville), some prints of A Trip to the Moon were {{individually}} hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and <b>celluloid</b> products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of a book salesman and homemaker, O'Neill was raised in rural Nebraska. She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City at age fifteen. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, were later manufactured as bisque dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and <b>celluloid</b> versions. The dolls were wildly popular {{in the early twentieth}} century, and are considered {{to be one of the}} first mass-marketed toys in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. The <b>Celluloid</b> Couch does not include any credits and only a brief summary of the film in its filmography listing. It is also listed in Psychotherapists on Film without further detailing onto the cast or credits. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the actors of Deering and his daughter.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at <b>Celluloid</b> Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} marketed internationally through <b>Celluloid</b> Nightmares, a {{partnership}} between US-based XYZ Films and France's <b>Celluloid</b> Dreams.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>celluloid</b> as a bulk {{material}} for forming objects is invented in 1856 by Alexander Parkes. Many years later, {{and with the}} recognition of <b>celluloid</b> as a format for making photographic film, an American court declares Parkes as the true inventor of <b>celluloid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coupled {{with all}} this, {{materials}} such as <b>celluloid</b> have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage, and acts such as the <b>Celluloid</b> and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and test them for flammability {{even though they were}} not the enforcing authority.|$|E

25|$|Later he {{appeared}} in several documentaries discussing Hollywood in general and Alfred Hitchcock in particular. In 1995 he was interviewed on camera for The <b>Celluloid</b> Closet, discussing the depiction of homosexuality in film {{and the use of}} subtext in various films, including his own.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Thomas B Lambert {{was granted}} a patent that {{described}} a process for mass-producing cylinders made from <b>celluloid,</b> an early hard plastic (Henri Lioret of France was producing <b>celluloid</b> cylinders as early as 1893, but they were individually recorded rather than molded). That same year, the Lambert Company of Chicago began selling cylinder records made of the material. They would not break if dropped and could be played thousands of times without wearing out, although {{the choice of the}} bright pink color of early cylinders was arguably a marketing error. The color was changed to black in 1903, but brown and blue cylinders were also produced. The coloring was purportedly done because the dye reduced surface noise. Unlike wax, the hard inflexible material could not be shaved and recorded over, but it had the advantage of being nearly permanent.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, 41 films {{opened and}} 16 new {{directors}} debuted. In 1939, the number increased to 51 films. Argentine cinema was very popular. In Mexico, almost all Argentine films were shown. In 1940, 49 films opened, despite {{the shortage of}} <b>celluloid</b> due to the war. In 1941, there were 47 openings and in 1942, 57.|$|E
25|$|Western Culture is {{a studio}} album by English avant-rock group Henry Cow, {{recorded}} at Sunrise Studios in Kirchberg, Switzerland in January, July and August 1978. It was their last album {{and was released}} on Henry Cow's own private label, Broadcast, in 1979. Later editions appeared on Interzone in the US and <b>Celluloid</b> in France. Only the UK Broadcast pressing used the custom label artwork design.|$|E
25|$|A doll is a {{model of}} a human (often a baby), a {{humanoid}} (like Bert and Ernie), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include cornhusks, bone, stone, wood, porcelain (sometimes called china), bisque, <b>celluloid,</b> wax, and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{field of}} {{numismatics}} (study of money), or more specifically exonumia (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even metal tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards. Early credit cards {{were made of}} <b>celluloid</b> plastic, then metal and fiber, then paper, and are now mostly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic.|$|E
25|$|Barker horror adaptations and spinoffs in comics {{include the}} Marvel/Epic Comics series Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Pinhead, The Harrowers, Book of the Damned, and Jihad; Eclipse Books' series and graphic novels Tapping The Vein, Dread, Son of <b>Celluloid,</b> Revelations The Life of Death, Rawhead Rex and The Yattering and Jack, and Dark Horse Comics' Primal, among others. Barker {{served as a}} {{consultant}} and wrote issues of the Hellraiser anthology comic book.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using both fag and faggot in popular culture, usually in {{reference}} to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's 1995 documentary The <b>Celluloid</b> Closet, based on Vito Russo's book of the same name notes the use of fag and faggot throughout Hollywood film history. The Think Before You Speak campaign has sought to stop fag and gay being used as generic insults.|$|E
25|$|During the 1900s, <b>celluloid</b> {{gradually}} replaced bone handles. Natural animal bristles {{were also}} replaced by synthetic fibers, usually nylon, by DuPont in 1938. The first nylon bristle toothbrush made with nylon yarn {{went on sale}} on February 24, 1938. The first electric toothbrush, the Broxodent, was invented in Switzerland in 1954. By {{the turn of the}} 21st century nylon had come to be widely used for the bristles and the handles were usually molded from thermoplastic materials.|$|E
25|$|The group first {{featured}} Fier, singer-guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonist John Zorn, bass guitarist Bill Laswell and violinist/guitarist Fred Frith. Their self-titled {{debut album}} {{was released on}} New York's <b>Celluloid</b> Records in 1983, and featured guest appearances by bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, guitarist Nicky Skopelitis, percussionist David Moss, turntablist M.E. Miller and others. The album {{has some of the}} first recorded turntable scratching outside of rap music, courtesy of Laswell and M.E. Miller. M.E. Miller also used vocal splitting technique to create harmony on the song he sings.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of <b>celluloid,</b> which he then taped to the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|Substances in the {{environment}} {{can also lead to}} false BAC readings. For example, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a common gasoline additive, has been alleged anecdotally to cause false positives in persons exposed to it. Tests have shown this to be true for older machines; however, newer machines detect this interference and compensate for it. Any number of other products found in {{the environment}} or workplace can also cause erroneous BAC results. These include compounds found in lacquer, paint remover, <b>celluloid,</b> gasoline, and cleaning fluids, especially ethers, alcohols, and other volatile compounds.|$|E
25|$|Max Nivelli (January 1, 1878 - February 27, 1926) was a film {{producer}} in Berlin during the Weimar Republic era. He {{was among the}} first to examine the issues of anti-Semitism and prejudice in his films. Nivelli died at an early age (48) and worked in the film industry for less than 10 years, yet he produced 19 films, most of them full-length feature films. As most films of that era, his films were silent, black-and-white and shot on <b>celluloid.</b> Only segments of three of his films exist today.|$|E
25|$|Charge {{coins and}} other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with {{materials}} made out of <b>celluloid</b> (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, {{and other types of}} whitish metals. Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.|$|E
25|$|The {{other type}} of sitar, the {{instrumental}} style, is most often made of seasoned toon wood, but sometimes made of (Burma) teak. It is often fitted with a second resonator, a small tumba (pumpkin or pumpkin-like wood replica) on the neck. This style is usually fully decorated, with floral or grape carvings and <b>celluloid</b> inlays with colored (often brown or red) and black floral or arabesque patterns. It typically has thirteen sympathetic strings. It is said that the best Burma teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations. Therefore, instrument builders look for old Burma teak {{that was used in}} old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} not {{generally}} such as to provide riches. Neither is it one which used to require large towns as other than external markets in which to sell. The population is therefore dispersed. The exception to this is the town of Oyonnax, in the Ange valley which is parallel with the Ain. According to the legend, St Léger gave the monopoly of comb making to Oyonnax in 630. The traditional small products of the region, wood-turning, horn combs and trinkets {{led to the development}} of a specialism in the injection moulding, vacuum forming and so on of plastics, beginning with <b>celluloid</b> in 1880. The town's population in 1999 was 24,636 but it is the exception for the river basin (ext links).|$|E
25|$|Joe and Silvia {{continue}} their battle against Gedow through an adventure film {{in an ancient}} temple, where a narcoleptic golem named Flinty Stone guards the second Rainbow Oscar, and then journey into a futuristic film where Gedow's top scientist Dr. Cranken and his creation Cameo Leon reveal the Black Emperor's plan to combine the Oscars with an evil reel of <b>celluloid</b> called the Black Film. Later, Joe's rival Alastor interferes during a samurai movie and tries to steal the spotlight. Jet changes films after Alastor is defeated, but unwittingly puts on the Black Film and sends its evil into Movieland, which also transforms Alastor into a murderous beast. After Joe defeats Alastor a second time, Jet destroys the Black Film.|$|E
25|$|The company's rise to {{prominence}} {{was fueled by}} the industry switch from film to videotape. In the late 1970s a feature-length porn film shot on <b>celluloid</b> might have {{cost as much as}} $350,000. In 1983 the VCR had been recently introduced, and producers were beginning to make pornographic films on videotape. A film using video could be made for as little as $5,000, compared to a minimum of $40,000 for a movie shot on film. Into the 1990s, by shooting its productions with video cameras, Evil Angel could still make films for $8,000. Stagliano initially had little knowledge of film making, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983: Bouncing Buns, starring Stacy Donovan. For the next six years he made films for other companies to manufacture and distribute.|$|E
25|$|Tomlin has {{received}} numerous awards, including: four primetime Emmys; a special 1977 Tony {{when she was}} appearing in her one-woman Broadway show, Appearing Nitely; a second Tony as Best Actress, two Drama Desk Awards and an Outer Critics Circle Award for her one-woman performance in Jane Wagner's The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe; a CableACE Award for Executive Producing the film adaptation of The Search; a Grammy Award for her comedy album, This is a Recording (a collection of Ernestine the Telephone Operator routines) as well as nominations for her subsequent albums Modern Scream, And That's the Truth, and On Stage; and two Peabody Awards — the first for the ABC television special, Edith Ann's Christmas: Just Say Noël and the second for narrating and executive producing the HBO film, The <b>Celluloid</b> Closet.|$|E
25|$|In post colonial India, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was {{the first}} – {{at the time the}} only – party to take {{advantage}} of visual movie media. Actors and writers of guerrilla theatre, who were inspired by the ideologies of Periyar, brought the philosophies of Tamil nationalism and anti-Brahminism to <b>celluloid</b> media. The movies not only made direct references to the independent Dravida Nadu that its leaders preached for but also at many times displayed party symbols within the movie. Murasoli Maran, former central minister from DMK, considered that the DMK movies reflected the faces of both the past (demonstrating the rich language and culture of Tamils) and the future (with social justice). The DMK films espoused Dravidian ideologies through use of lengthy dialogues in its initial movies. Nevertheless, as the party's political aspirations grew, the movies based on Dravidian social reformation themes were replaced with stories that would enhance star popularity.|$|E
25|$|Before he had {{a chance}} to start with the band, however, he nearly lost his life when the caravan he and his wife lived in caught fire when he knocked over a candle on his way to bed. His wife made {{artificial}} flowers from extremely flammable <b>celluloid.</b> They caught fire, engulfing the wagon in flames almost immediately. Reinhardt dragged himself and his wife through the fire to safety, but suffered extensive burns on his left hand and other areas. He received first- and second-degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralyzed, and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.|$|E
25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style beaded and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with <b>celluloid</b> sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.|$|E
