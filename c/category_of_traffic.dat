40|$|Traffic sign recognition, {{including}} sign {{detection and}} classification, {{is essential for}} advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based sign recognition scheme. In the proposed scheme, detection and classification are realized through learning in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on the observation that signs {{in the same category}} share some common attributes in appearance, the proposed scheme first distinguishes each individual sign category from the background in the coarse learning stage (i. e. sign detection) followed by distinguishing different sign classes within each category in the fine learning stage (i. e. sign classification). Both stages are realized through machine learning techniques. A complete recognition scheme is developed that is effective for simultaneously recognizing multiple <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> signs. In addition, a novel saliency-based feature extraction method is proposed for sign classification. The method segments salient sign regions by leveraging the geodesic energy propagation. Compared with the conventional feature extraction, our method provides more reliable feature extraction from salient sign regions. The proposed scheme is tested and validated on two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> Chinese <b>traffic</b> signs from Tencent street view. Evaluations on the test dataset show reasonably good performance, with an average of 97. 5 % true positive and 0. 3 % false positive on two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> signs...|$|R

For detecting and classifying multiple <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> signs, multiple independent one-against-all classifiers are leveraged, where each is trained to detect one <b>traffic</b> sign <b>category</b> <b>of</b> interest. Once these models are learned in the training process, the candidate windows are placed into these classifiers, and the label from the classifier, which results in the maximum classification score is returned.|$|R

40|$|Telecommunications {{services}} are for long subject to privacy regulations. At stake are traditionally: {{privacy of the}} communication {{and the protection of}} traffic data. Privacy of the communication is legally founded. Traffic data subsume under the notion of data protection and are central in the discussion. The telecommunications environment is profoundly changing. The traditionally closed markets with closed networks change into an open market with open networks. Within these open networks more privacy sensitive data are generated and have to be exchanged between growing numbers of parties. Also telecommunications and computer networks are rapidly being integrated and thus the distinction between telephony and computing disappears. Traditional telecommunications privacy regulations are revised to cover internet applications. In this paper telecommunications issues are recalled to aid the on-going debate.

40|$|Introduction Traffic safety {{literature}} has traditionally focused on identification of location profiles where “more crashes {{are likely to}} occur” {{over a period of}} time. The analysis involves estimation of crash frequency and/or rate (i. e., frequency normalized based on some measure of exposure) with geometric design features (e. g., number of lanes) and traffic characteristics (e. g., Average Annual Daily Traffic [AADT]) of the roadway location. In the recent past, a new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> safety studies has emerged, which attempts to identify locations where a “crash is more likely to occur. ” The distinction between the two groups of studies is that the latter group of locations would change based on the varying traffic patterns {{over the course of the}} day or even within the hour. Method Hence, instead of estimation of crash frequency over a period of time, the objective becomes real-time estimation of crash likelihood. The estimation of real-time crash likelihood has a traffic management component as well. It is a proactive extension to the traditional approach of incident detection, which involves analysis of traffic data recorded immediately after the incident. The units of analysis used in these studies are individual crashes rather than counts of crashes. Results In this paper, crash data analysis based on the two approaches, collective and at individual crash level, is discussed along with the advantages and shortcomings of the two approaches...|$|E

40|$|More {{attention}} has been paid to congestion control in the emerging area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

The work presented here applies a robust sliding mode learning control (SMLC) algorism to congestion control in WSNs.

40|$|Abstract—Long term {{evolution}} (LTE) {{has become}} one of the dominating communication standards for 4 G cellular systems. It employs the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technique to enhance the efficiency of downlink transmissions, which divides the communication spectrum into multiple resource blocks. How to efficiently distribute these resource blocks among user equipments (UEs) is a challenging issue, which also significantly affects the system performance of LTE. Furthermore, in order to provide different quality of service (QoS) for various types <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flows, LTE defines two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flows: guaranteed bit rate (GBR) and non-guaranteed bit rate (non-GBR). In the paper, we develop an efficient resource management mechanism to allocate downlink resource blocks to UEs so as to support QoS for GBR traffic flows while avoid starving non-GBR traffic flows. Our mechanism takes into account various network conditions such as channel quality, head-of-line (HOL) packet delay, QoS class identifier (QCI) value, and buffer length. Through the LTE-Sim network simulator, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can reduce both packet dropping and delay <b>of</b> GBR <b>traffic</b> flows. In addition, non-GBR traffic flows can still keep relatively high throughput to improve system performance.
