Micro-turbine generators, highspeed electric motors, and electrically driven <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blowers</b> {{are a few}} examples of products available in today's commercial marketplace.

A significant volume of component level research has led to recent acceptance of gas foil bearings in several specialized applications, including those mentioned above.

5000|$|As a {{two stroke}} cycle Diesel engine cannot {{naturally}} aspirate, or draw {{in its own}} intake air, the blower is necessary to provide air in an amount sufficient both for scavenging of exhaust gasses from the cylinder and to support combustion. Initial versions of the 6-110 engine used a centrifugal-type supercharger. This was very practical for fixed-speed applications such as marine or generator service, but proved a failure in automotive applications. [...] "The engine was developed on the dyno and was never operated above rated RPM. The first application was in Euclid mining trucks, where the driver's income depends on how fast he drives the empty truck {{back down into the}} pit. The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blower</b> ran about 10 times engine speed. Exceeding that RPM was fatal, and in a truck a single missed downshift could mean a failed engine." [...] For that reason a Roots type blower was made available as an option after about 1952. Later high performance versions were available with turbochargers.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the two earlier engines, {{which could}} use either a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}, the 710 engine is offered only with turbocharging. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design {{that uses a}} gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor. This system acts as a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blower,</b> during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine, the clutch disengages, and acts as a true centrifugal turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement. But, unlike the earlier 645 and 567, which offered both Roots-blown and turbocharging, EMD's turbo-compressor {{is an integral part}} of all 710 models, therefore this 50 percent increase is already incorporated into the maximum rated power of all 710 models.

By positioning the completely rough wall between R= 1. 2 and 1. 6 on the hub side diffuser wall alone, the flow rate of rotating stall inception was decreased by 42 % at a small pressure drop less than 1 % of the blower pressure rise. This is based on that the local reverse flow occurs firstly at the hub side in most <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blowers</b> with backswept blade impeller mainly depending on the distortion of tangential component of inlet main-flow velocity. The 3 -D boundary layer calculation shows that the local reverse flow is decreased remarkably {{by an increase in}} wall friction, and it disappears if the friction coefficient is 0. 01 about twice of the smooth wall. By analyzing the effect of wall friction and turbulence induced by the rough wall, it is clearly shown that the rough wall positioned in the limited region, where the wall-limiting streamline flow angle shows the negative maximum, is quite effective to suppress the rotating stall at a small drop of the diffuser pressure recovery...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline a semi-empirical {{procedure}} for predicting the broadband sound power spectrum radiated by {{any member of}} a family of geometrically similar, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blowers.</b> The prediction scheme is based on the use of a normalized sound power spectrum that is obtained by measuring the sound power radiated by one member of the blower family. In the present instance, a low noise blower design has been identified by conducting a large scale parametric study of blower noise as a function of geometrical design parameters and operating point; the resulting optimum design served to define the geometrical parameters of the blower family considered here. The prediction procedure allows calculation of either 1 / 3 -octave band spectral levels or overall A-weighted levels. In addition it is possible to calculate 2 ̆ 2 noise surfaces, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., plots of A-weighted sound power level versus design parameters and operating condition; in this way it is easy to identify optimally quiet blower designs that satisfy specified pumping requirements.

40|$|The present work is an {{experimental}} investigation of turbulent mixing of two co-axial jets with low annular to core area ratio in a non-separating confinement. Experiments {{were conducted in}} a newly designed set-up having a duct to nozzle diameter ratio of 1. 19. Two <b>centrifugal</b> <b>blowers</b> driven by motors of 30 kW power each generated the air flow. Influence of chute geometry on the turbulent mixing of two co-axial streams is studied by using two chute mixer configurations having 10 degrees and 20 degrees angles of penetration of the annular stream towards the core region at a velocity ratio of 1. 8. Contours of mean velocity and streamwise and transverse turbulence intensities were obtained by making measurements close {{to the point of}} injection with a very fine grid. The results show an improved mixing due to chutes. A stronger transverse turbulence component (w') is observed close to the injection points, which seems to enhance mixing. Profiles at the downstream locations show a faster approach towards uniform mean velocity and homogeneous turbulence intensity. With the chute model having 20 degrees angle of penetration, nearly complete mixing is achieved at a distance of 2. 2 duct radii itself, suggesting feasibility of shortening of the duct by about 50 %. However, a higher total pressure loss of about 1. 7 % is the penalty to be paid for enhanced mixing of the jets...|$|R
