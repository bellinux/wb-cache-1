5|$|In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah {{to conquer}} Yemen and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi {{wrote that the}} {{reasoning}} behind the conquest of Yemen was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and executed its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden {{was taken from the}} Shia Banu Karam tribe. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of Yemen, although the official capital of Ayyubid Yemen was Ta'iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its <b>commercial</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the establishment of new institutions, and the minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a <b>commercial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

25|$|A wooden structure, {{the bridge}} {{connected}} the northwestern end of Harkers Island {{to the small}} town of Straits directly to the north. The location of the bridge was a matter of some local controversy at the time.

Local politics and the shorter distance to Straits likely dictated the final location of the bridge.

2500|$|In 634, Byzantine {{forces were}} {{defeated}} by the Muslim army of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab and the city was renamed Baysan. The day of victory {{came to be known}} in Arabic as Yawm Baysan or [...] "the day of Baysan." [...] The city was not damaged and the newly arrived Muslims lived together with its Christian population until the 8th century, but the city declined during this period. Structures were built in the streets themselves, narrowing them to mere alleyways, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point by the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of marble for producing lime, the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery. Some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline, however. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s, Baysan's <b>commercial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—on the basis of a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating {{from the time of the}} Umayyad caliph Hisham (r. 724–43).

40|$|Integration of Rural and Urban Cooking Banana Markets in the South-East of Rwanda Southern Province. This study {{consists}} of the analysis of spatial integration of rural and urban markets of cooking banana iin the South-East of Southern province of Rwanda. It uses time series of 2001 - 2006 period resulting from a survey on agricultural products commercialization in rural and urban markets. The analysis used the methods of co-integration and error correction model (ECM). The {{results of the study}} show that there is, in general, weak price transmission between rural and urban markets of cooking banana. Hence rural and urban markets of cooking banana are weakly integrated. The weak integration of markets means that there exist unexploited opportunities of arbitration that would have {{led to the creation of}} "geographical monopolies" because, on each rural market, there are traders who collect the cooking banana to sell it only on the same market. This weak spatial integration of rural and urban markets can result from poor <b>commercial</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (roads and communication infrastructures) and the lack of information on market (supply, demand and price). It would be necessary to develop and improve the <b>commercial</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for improving the spatial integration of cooking banana rural and urban markets in the South-East of the Southern province of Rwanda. Market integration can in turn lead to the specialization of producers of cooking banana and to the increase of cooking banana production...|$|R

All the same, writers like Sung Bok Kim, in an article entitled "Is Fashion Art?" have pointed out that the aesthetic nature of garments is often overlooked. [1...|$|R
