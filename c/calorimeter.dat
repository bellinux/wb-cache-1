5|$|After {{decades of}} {{planning}} and construction the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton collider (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17mi (27km) circular underground tunnel near Geneva, Switzerland at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation. Florida State faculty contributed to several areas of the CMS, especially the electromagnetic <b>calorimeter</b> and the hadron <b>calorimeter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{experimental}} particle physics, liquid krypton is used {{to construct}} quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the <b>calorimeter</b> of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since liquid argon is less expensive. The advantage of krypton is a smaller Molière radius of 4.7cm, which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are: radiation length of X0=4.7cm, and density of 2.4 g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{guinea pigs}} in {{scientific}} experimentation dates {{back at least}} to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the <b>calorimeter,</b> a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the <b>calorimeter,</b> showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.|$|E
50|$|Both {{concepts}} have barrel <b>calorimeters</b> {{and tracking}} detectors located inside a superconducting solenoid. The particle energy measurement is performed by electromagnetic silicon-tungsten sampling <b>calorimeters</b> and highly granular hadronic sampling <b>calorimeters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{reaction}} <b>calorimeters</b> {{can be used}} as controlled lab reactors (indeed some <b>calorimeters</b> {{are based}} on CLR's).|$|R
50|$|Neutral particles, i.e. photons are {{detected}} with electro-magnetic <b>calorimeters.</b> The {{energy of}} produced hadrons are determined with hadronic <b>calorimeters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another {{assumption}} is that heat loss from the <b>calorimeter</b> maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the <b>calorimeter.</b> This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the <b>calorimeter</b> would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} laboratories, {{benzoic acid}} {{is a common}} standard for calibrating a bomb <b>calorimeter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Electromagnetic <b>Calorimeter</b> (ECAL) is {{designed}} to measure with high accuracy the energies of electrons and photons.|$|E
30|$|We found <b>calorimeters</b> were {{generally}} poor predictors of thermocouple metrics. While {{these results are}} similar to those found by Wally et al. (in press), they contrast with those of Perez and Moreno (1998) who found <b>calorimeters</b> more accurate than pyrometers. In our study, <b>calorimeters</b> were not useful for comparing small differences in fire intensity, partly due to the confounding effects of small-scale variation in ambient evaporation. Water condensation from smoke may have been another source of error. Another disadvantage is that <b>calorimeters</b> cannot distinguish low fire intensities, making them useful only for coarse scale differences in fires of higher intensity than our study. Because {{the size and shape of}} cans and the amount of water used will affect the heat budget of <b>calorimeters,</b> comparing values from different <b>calorimeters</b> across studies is also unreliable.|$|R

25|$|The Hadron <b>Calorimeter</b> (HCAL) {{measures}} {{the energy of}} hadrons, particles made of quarks and gluons (for example protons, neutrons, pions and kaons). Additionally it provides indirect measurement {{of the presence of}} non-interacting, uncharged particles such as neutrinos.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{physical}} or chemical analyses {{to determine the}} handling and pollutant profile of a coal, the energy output of a coal is determined using a bomb <b>calorimeter</b> which measures the specific energy output of a coal during complete combustion. This is required particularly for coals used in steam generation.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{also did}} early {{research}} in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace. They used a <b>calorimeter</b> {{to estimate the}} heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.|$|E

Mathematical Analysis: The half-life determination from the third set of Unit III counting room data was completed; the formula developed by the Calorimetry Group for the speed of <b>calorimeters</b> was evaluated; and text books and articles treating the theory of probability and its application, especially counting techniques, have been studied...|$|R
40|$|ATLAS, a {{multi-purpose}} detector {{built at}} the LHC at CERN, requires an extensive commissioning campaign {{to be ready for}} proton-proton collisions. In this work, we focus on the commissioning of the liquid Argon (LAr) <b>calorimeters,</b> with emphasis on commissioning with cosmic rays. First we outline one phase of the commissioning work, which involves testing of the front-end electronics of the two endcap <b>calorimeters.</b> We then describe two cosmic ray generators as input to a Monte-Carlo simulation of cosmic rays in ATLAS, and compare their results. Finally, we explain a technique developed for this work which uses information from the Tile <b>calorimeters</b> to predict the timing of cosmic rays within the LAr <b>calorimeters,</b> because cosmic rays occur randomly in time whereas the electronics are clocked at 1 / 40. 08 MHz. The results from this analysis tool are compared to default tools, using both simulated and real cosmic ray data in the <b>calorimeters...</b>|$|R
25|$|Kuhn {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} an exemplar in a postscript to the second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term 'exemplars' for 'paradigm', meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, physicists might have as exemplars the inclined plane, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, or instruments like the <b>calorimeter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use {{of animals}} in {{research}} dates back to ancient Greece, with Aristotle (384–322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304–258 BCE) {{among the first to}} perform experiments on living animals. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier's use of a guinea pig in a <b>calorimeter</b> to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{was developed by}} E. S. Watson and M. J. O'Neill in 1962, and introduced commercially at the 1963 Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy. The first adiabatic differential scanning <b>calorimeter</b> {{that could be used}} in biochemistry was developed by P. L. Privalov and D. R. Monaselidze in 1964 at Institute of Physics in Tbilisi, Georgia. The term DSC was coined to describe this instrument, which measures energy directly and allows precise measurements of heat capacity.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1960s, {{interpretation}} of the igneous rock record was largely qualitative. Ian Carmichael wanted to determine quantitative information such as the temperature and pressure of the magma when crystals were formed as well as dissolved water and oxygen content. For this, thermodynamic models were needed. Although attempts to apply rigorous thermodynamics to igneous processes go back to at least 1949, they were hindered {{by a lack of}} experimental data. Using tools such as a drop <b>calorimeter</b> and wet chemistry, Carmichael and colleagues set out to systematically explore thermodynamic properties of magma at high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The first {{substantial}} experimental {{challenges to}} caloric theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, {{when he showed}} that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, and his work {{was among the first}} to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice <b>calorimeter</b> following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water.|$|E
25|$|The tracker and <b>calorimeter</b> {{detectors}} (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly {{inside the}} magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure {{that surrounds the}} magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this “return yoke” reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment’s structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of the signal feedthroughs for the barrel and endcap ATLAS liquid argon <b>calorimeters</b> is described.

40|$|Electromagnetic <b>calorimeters</b> which {{sample the}} Cherenkov {{radiation}} of shower particles in optical fibers {{operate in a}} markedly different manner from <b>calorimeters</b> which rely on the dE/dx of shower particles.

25|$|More {{quantitative}} {{studies by}} James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, {{and helped to}} place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, {{was still trying to}} explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of the}} 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the <b>calorimeter,</b> a subject which became known as thermochemistry.|$|E
25|$|One {{assumption}} made by Fleischmann and Pons is {{that the}} efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible resistive heating and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged. This assumption gives {{the amount of energy}} expended converting liquid D2O into gaseous D2 and O2. The efficiency of electrolysis is less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the <b>calorimeter.</b> Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolysis experiments.|$|E
25|$|Brau {{joined the}} physics {{faculty at the}} University of Oregon in 1988, {{establishing}} the first Oregon experimental particle physics group to collaborate with Oregon's existing particle theory group.

He led the design, construction and operation of an innovative silicon-tungsten electromagnetic <b>calorimeter</b> luminosity monitor. During the active period of the Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) Brau joined the GEM detector project.
