5000|$|The Achilles tendon or heel cord, {{also known}} as the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> ( [...] Tendo calcaneus), is a tendon {{of the back of the}} leg, and the {{thickest}} in the human body. It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone. These muscles, acting via the tendon, cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle, and (except soleus) flexion at the knee.|$|E

40|$|The {{source of}} pain and the {{background}} to the pain mechanisms associated with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy {{have not yet been}} clarified. Intratendinous degenerative changes are most often addressed when present. However, it is questionable if degeneration of the tendon itself is the main cause of pain. Pain is often most prominent on the medial side, 2 - 7 cm from the insertion onto the calcaneus. The medial location of the pain has been explained to be caused by enhanced stress on the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> due to hyperpronation. However, on this medial side the plantaris tendon is also located. It has been postulated that the plantaris tendon might play a role in these medially located symptoms. To our knowledge, the exact anatomy and relationship between the plantaris- and <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> at the level of complaints have not been anatomically assessed. This was the purpose of our study. One-hundred and seven lower extremities were dissected. After opening the superficial fascia and paratendon, the plantaris tendon was bluntly released from the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> moving distally. The incidence of the plantaris tendon, its course, site of insertion and possible connections were documented. When with manual force the plantaris tendon could not be released, it was defined as a 'connection' with the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon.</b> In all specimens a plantaris tendon was identified. Nine different sites of insertion were found, mostly medial and fan-shaped onto the calcaneus.

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} 106 patients {{after treatment}} for spontaneous rupture of the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon,</b> and assessed the clinical results including {{the power of}} plantarfiexion.

40|$|An {{experimental}} protocol {{was designed to}} study the survival and behaviour of an allograft of amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) in an ovine model. The study was conducted on three healthy adult sheep. A core lesion was created in both <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendons</b> under ultrasound (US) guidance by injecting 400 UI of Type 1 A collagenase diluted in 0. 6 ml saline. The AECs were obtained from a 60 - 80 -day-old fetus and cultured under standard conditions. After 15 days of collagenase treatment, 2 x 10 (6) AECs stained with a vital membrane fluorescent probe (PHK 26) were injected under US guidance in 500 mu l saline solution into the lesion of one limb.

Herein, we evaluated the effect of two types of physical activities on tendon morphology and matrix metalloproteinase activities in the proximal and distal regions of rat <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon,</b> separately. Adult male Wistar rats from control, water-adapted, vertical-jumping, and treadmill-running groups were sacrificed after 1 or 4 days of physical exercise, 6 hr after the end of that day's exercise session. Tendons were processed for histology, morphometry, and gelatin zymography. Tendons from adapted and trained animals showed active secretory cells and increased thickness, cellularity, and blood vessel volume fraction of peritendinous sheath, but without inflammatory process. In the proximal region, both pro- and active MMP- 2 were increased after vertical jumping, but only pro-MMP- 2 was increased after treadmill running. In contrast, in the distal region, both exercise types increased the {{activity of}} pro- and active MMP- 2, especially treadmill running, which increased the active MMP- 2 by about 11 - and eightfold, respectively, after 1 and 4 days of training.

40|$|Background: Amniotic {{epithelial}} cells (AEC) have potential applications in cell-based therapy. Thus far {{their ability to}} differentiate into tenocytes has not been investigated although a cell source providing a large supply of tenocytes remains a priority target of regenerative medicine in order {{to respond to the}} poor self-repair capability of adult tendons. Starting from this premise, the present research has been designed firstly to verify whether the co-culture with adult primary tenocytes could be exploited in order to induce tenogenic differentiation in AEC, as previously demonstrated in mesenchymal stem cells. Since the co-culture systems inducing cell differentiation takes advantage of specific soluble paracrine factors released by tenocytes, the research has been then addressed to study whether the co-culture could be improved by making use of the different cell populations present within tendon explants or of the high regenerative properties of fetal derived cell/tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings: Freshly isolated AEC, obtained from ovine fetuses at mid-gestation, were co-incubated with explanted tendons or primary tenocytes obtained from fetal or adult <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendons.</b> The morphological and functional analysis indicated that AEC possessed tenogenic differentiation potential. However, only AEC exposed to fetal-derived cell/tissues developed in vitro tendon-like three dimensional structures with an expression profile of matrix (COL 1 and THSB 4) and mesenchymal/tendon related genes (TNM, OCN and SCXB) similar to that recorded in native ovine tendons. The tendon-like structures displayed high levels of organization as documented by the cell morphology, the newly deposited matrix enriched in COL 1 and widespread expression of gap junction proteins (Connexin 32 and 43). Conclusions/Significance: The co-culture system improves its efficiency in promoting AEC differentiation by exploiting the inductive tenogenic soluble factors released by fetal tendon cells or explants. The co-cultural system can be proposed as a low cost and easy technique to engineer tendon for biological study and cell therapy approach. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of my earlier paper (Dwyer 1955) describing the treatment of pes cavus in children by osteotomy of the calcaneum, many more patients have been operated upon and the procedure has been extended to embrace the more severe deformities encountered in older patients. Over five years have now elapsed since the first operation was performed, and the late {{results indicate that the}} procedure is sound. In children pes cavus develops at any time after the age ofthree, the age ofonset depending on whether the condition is idiopathic or neurological in origin. In the earlier stages what {{is little more than a}} high arch is well controlled by a metatarsal bar, but in many cases the deformity progresses to embrace the following characteristics: 1) dropping of the forefoot; 2) contracture of the plantar fascia; 3) clawing of the toes and callosity formation; 4) the gradual development of a varus deformity of the heel and forefoot. It should be appreciated that, contrary to some text-book descriptions and as pointed out by Todd (1935), contracture of the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> is not a usual accompaniment of uncomplicated pes cavus; equinus is confined to the forefoot, and the heel is usually well developed. Operations such as those described by Steindler (1921), Lambrinudi (1932), Todd (1935) and others for the relief of pes cavus have, on the whole, proved disappointing, especially for well established deformity in adolescents (Fig. 1). Whatever the underlying etiology, it is certain that, with the onset of varus, the deformity rapidly becomes worse. With adduction of the heel three deforming influences appear. First the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> becomes an active invertor and, since its pull is concentrated largely on the inner border of the heel, much of its force is transmitted to the thick medial portion of the plantar fascia (Fig. 2). In consequence the forefoot is pulled towards the heel. Secondly, the child walks on the outer border of the foot, thus increasing the varus deformity. FIG. 2 With inversion of the heel, weight bearing and the pull of the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> become deforming forces, allowing the plantar fascia to contract with resultant approximation of heel and forefoot...|$|E

Methods: The right <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendons</b> (plantar flexor of the hind paw) of 36 rabbits of the New Zealand breed (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{were used in the}} analysis. This sample presents similar size to human flexor tendon that has approximately 4. 5 mm (varying from 2 mm). The selected sample showed the same mass (2. 5 to 3 kg) and were male or female adults (from 8 ½ months). For the flexor tendons of the hind paws, sterile and driven techniques were used in accordance to the Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (CETEA) of the University of the State of Santa Catarina (UDESC), municipality of Lages, in Brazil (protocol # 1. 33. 09). Results: In the biomechanical analysis (deformity) carried out between tendinous stumps, there was no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 01). There was no statistical difference in relation to surgical time in all three suture techniques with a mean of 6. 0 minutes for Tsai (6 - strands), 5. 7 minutes for Indiana (4 -strands) and 5. 6 minutes for Brazil (4 -strands) (p> 0. 01).

In the present research, the role exerted of AECs on macrophages (Mφ) polarization from pro-inflammatory M 1 Mφ to anti-inflammatory M 2 Mφ phenotype were studied and related to the early phases of tendon healing. Ovine PKH- 26 labeled AECs were transplanted into experimentally induced <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendons</b> defects (3). Control (CTR) and AEC-tendon explants were explanted at 7, 14, and 28 days for morphological/molecular analyses. Tendon healing was described using Hematoxylin and Eosin stain and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to detect the expression of collagen type I an extracellular matrix protein (COL 1). IHC and RT-PCR analyses were carried out to identify Mφ (PanMφCD 68) and the incidence of pro-inflammatory M 1 Mφ (CD 86, IL 12) and anti-inflammatory M 2 Mφ (CD 206, YM 1, IL 10) sub-populations. AECs were always retrieved within the host tissue enhancing the early phase of tendon healing. In parallel, tendons displayed a different evolution in inflammatory events. PanMφCD 68 expression indicated that inflammation progressively decreased in both tendons. However, while polarized Mφ and cytokines were similarly expressed in AECs and CTR tendons until day 7, the M 2 Mφ became prevalent {{in the presence of}} AECs at day 14 when the tissue started to recover its microarchitecture displaying COL 1 parallel oriented fibers. Analogously, the mRNA content of M 2 Mφ anti-inflammatory cytokines YM 1, IL 10, CD 206 increased, while M 1 Mφ pro-inflammatory markers IL 12 and CD 86 decreased. Mφ and cytokine expression were considerably reduced in regenerated AEC-tendons after 28 days, while they were still expressed in CTR tendons that maintained a disorganized tissue structure. In summary, these findings suggest that AECs modulate macrophage recruitment enhancing the M 2 Mφ regenerative phenotype and down regulating M 1 Mφ, pro-inflammatory phenotype contributing to tendon healing. The present results suggests novel insights into potential mechanisms underlying tendon regeneration, associated with extracellular matrix remodeling amelioration, induced by exogenous ovine amnios epithelial layer stem cells delivery...|$|R
40|$|Many {{options are}} {{available}} in literature {{for the management of}} delayed reconstruction following calcanectomy. In cases of low-grade tumor lesions, conservative surgery can be considered. We describe a case of delayed reconstruction by calcaneal allograft after calcanectomy for low-grade chondrosarcoma. At 12 -month follow-up, the patient had no pain; MSTS score and AOFAS score were satisfactory. Subtalar nonunion was observed with no secondary displacement or graft necrosis. The aim of conservative treatment for this patient was to restore normal gait with plantigrade locomotion and function of the Achilles <b>tendon.</b> <b>Calcaneal</b> reconstruction by total allograft is an alternative approach following calcanectomy for calcaneal tumors. We also discussed other options of calcaneal reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} complete ruptures of the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> were treated by external fixation. The patients were assessed both objectively and subjectively, {{and the results}} classified as excellent, good, fair and poor. In 30 patients the result was excellent or good. There were no infections or re-ruptures. Two patients with fair results had sural nerve injury. The only patient with a poor result had Sudeck’s atrophy. It is felt that this operation satisfies {{the need for a}} new technique which is simple and combines the advantages of both surgical and non-surgical treatment without their major complications. There has been considerable debate concerning the appropriate treatment of fresh ruptures of the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon,</b> and that debate continues (Nistor 1981). Con-servative treatment with a plaster cast in an equinus posi-tion for two months, popularised by Lea and Smith (1968). may be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of re-rupture, which was more than 30 % in one series of 20 patients (Persson and Wredmark 1979) (Table I). In addition, dynamometric and calibrated load cell measurements have shown that the ultimate force of calf contraction is lower with conservative treatment than after operative repair (Jacobs et al. 1978, Nistor 1981). Proponents of surgical repair describe a much lower incidence of re-rupture, varying from zero in 74 cases (Percy and Conochie 1978) to four out of 92 cases (Amer and Lindholm 1959). Surgical treatment may, however, be associated with significant complications, such as deep wound infection, skin slough, sinus formation, tendinocutaneous adhesions and sural nerve injury; such complications may occur in as many as one in three patients (Amer and Lindholm 1959; Nistor 1981) (Table II). Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus have been reported with both methods of treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{determine}} the occurrence of feet and ankle deformities in trampoline and artistic gymnasts. Methods. Ten acrobatic gymnasts (trampolinists) and 10 artistic gymnasts aged 6 - 14 years were recruited. The calcaneal-tibial (rearfoot) angle was determined as the angle of the upper <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> and the longitudinal heel axis while Clarke angles were determined by podoscopy. Results. The trampolinists showed significantly greater medial angulation (calcaneal valgus) than the group of gymnasts. Right and left foot Clark’s angles in both the trampoline and artistic gymnasts were above 55 °. Conclusions. Trampolinists exhibit significantly more pronounced calcaneal valgus than artistic gymnasts. The prevalence of foot and ankle deformities in both populations should be addressed by coaches in the gymnastics training of young children...|$|E
40|$|During routine {{anatomical}} dissection a {{rare case}} of a flexor digitorum accessorius longus muscle was observed. This muscle arose with a well-formed muscular belly from {{the lower part of}} the lateral intermuscular septum, and then passed obliquely downward and medially deep to the <b>calcaneal</b> <b>tendon</b> in the canal of the flexor hallucis longus. In the sole region the aberrant muscle prolonged in a thin tendon that divided into two parts: superficial and deep. The superficial part attached to the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus for the second toe; the deep part of the tendon joined the tendon of the quadratus plantae and also an additional portion of the flexor hallucis longus tendon to the second toe. The possible clinical implications of this muscle in practical surgery and also in imaging radiology are reviewed. © IJAV. 2009; 2 : 108 – 110...|$|E
40|$|The {{applications}} of CT examination {{in the diagnosis}} of the acute Achilles tendon rupture (AATR) were investigated. A total of 36 patients with suspected acute Achilles tendon rupture were tested using physical examination, ultrasound, and 3 DCT scanning, respectively. Then, surgery was performed for the patients who showed positive result {{in at least two}} of the three tests for AATR. 3 DVR, MPR, and the other CT scan image processing and diagnosis were conducted in PACS (picture archiving and communication system). PACS was also used to measure the length of distal broken ends of the Achilles tendon (AT) to <b>tendon</b> <b>calcaneal</b> insertion. Our study indicated that CT has the highest accuracy in diagnosis of acute Achilles tendon complete rupture. The length measurement is matched between PACS and those actually measured in operation. CT not only demonstrates more details directly in three dimensions especially with the rupture involved calcaneal insertion flap but also locates the rupture region for percutaneous suture by measuring the length of distal stump in PACS without the effect of the position of ankle. The accuracy of CT diagnosis for Achilles tendon partial rupture is yet to be studied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plantar calcaneal spurs are common, however their {{pathophysiology}} {{is poorly}} understood. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} prevalence and correlates of plantar calcaneal spurs in a large sample of older people. Methods Weightbearing lateral foot radiographs of 216 people (140 women and 76 men) aged 62 to 94 years (mean age 75. 9, SD 6. 6) were examined for plantar <b>calcaneal</b> and Achilles <b>tendon</b> spurs. Associations between the presence of spurs and sex, body mass index, radiographic measures of foot posture, self-reported co-morbidities and current or previous heel pain were then explored. Results Of the 216 participants, 119 (55 %) {{had at least one}} plantar calcaneal spur and 103 (48 %) had at least one Achilles tendon spur. Those with plantar calcaneal spurs {{were more likely to have}} Achilles tendon spurs (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 to 3. 5). Prevalence of spurs did not differ according to sex. Participants with plantar calcaneal spurs were more likely to be obese (OR = 7. 9, 95 % CI 3. 6 to 17. 0), report osteoarthritis (OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 4. 8) and have current or previous heel pain (OR = 4. 6, 95 % CI 2. 3 to 9. 4). No relationship was found between the presence of calcaneal spurs and radiographic measures of foot posture. Conclusion Calcaneal spurs are common in older men and women and are related to obesity, osteoarthritis and current or previous heel pain, but are unrelated to radiographic measurements of foot posture. These findings support the theory that plantar calcaneal spurs may be an adaptive response to vertical compression of the heel rather than longitudinal traction at the calcaneal enthesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Use of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) color volume-rendered (VR) images {{has been}} reported to be more time-efficient compared to that of cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images for the diagnosis of peroneal tendon dislocation. However, the diagnostic performance of this technique has not been studied. Purpose: To test diagnostic accuracy of 3 D color VR CT images of ankle for peroneal tendon dislocation in patients with acute calcaneal fractures. Material and Methods: The study consisted of 121 ankle CT studies from 105 consecutive patients (85 men, 20 women; mean age, 42 years; age range, 16 - 75 years) with acute <b>calcaneal</b> fractures. Peroneal <b>tendon</b> dislocation was diagnosed on multiplanar CT images by consensus of two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, which served as the reference standard. Three other musculoskeletal radiologists independently reviewed 3 D images alone on a work-station. The readers determined {{whether or not there was}} peroneal tendon dislocation using three degrees of certainty (definite, probable, and possible). Diagnostic performance of 3 D images for peroneal tendon dislocation was evaluated by calculating the sensitivities, specificities, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Forty-eight (40 %) out of 121 studies showed peroneal tendon dislocation based on the expert readings using multiplanar reformatted images. Sensitivities/specificities of 3 D images measured 0. 92 / 0. 81, 0. 88 / 0. 90, and 0. 81 / 0. 92 for three readers, respectively. The area under the proper binormal ROC curve based on all three readers (0. 93, 0. 94, and 0. 92) measured 0. 93 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 89 - 0. 98. Conclusion: Diagnostic accuracy of 3 D images is comparable to, but not as good as that of MPR images for the diagnosis of peroneal tendon dislocation in patients with acute calcaneal fractures...|$|R
