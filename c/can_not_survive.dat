2500|$|The Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle {{was first}} {{listed on the}} {{endangered}} species list on September 16, 1988. Threats to the beetle include loss of habitat due to urban development, invasive species, and mining. Urban development is the number one threat to the beetle and affects their karst environment in many different ways. For instance, urban development may lead to the filling in or collapse of caves, alteration of drainage patterns, alteration of surface plant and animal communities, as well as contamination and human visitation. Many caves are filled in or collapsed during road and building construction. A solid foundation is required for construction to take place so if there is a cave in the way it will be collapsed and filled for a sturdy foundation. Road development destroys a majority of the karst habitats where the beetles live. It is estimated that 10% of all caves in Travis County are destroyed every ten years. Some ranchers even lead to the problem. Many of them fill the entrances to the caves so their livestock do not roam into the caves. This blocks the air movement in the cave changing the conditions in the cave. If conditions are not just right the beetle will die. Large paved areas and drainage systems that are put in during urban development alter the natural drainage patterns causing major problems to karst environments. This environment depends on air filled gaps and infiltration from water above, diverting water away from a cave can dry it up killing all the species inside. If water is diverted into a cave it can flood and alter living conditions. Altering surface plant and animal communities affects karst environments as well. When these communities are removed for development many of the nutrients that originally entered the cave are now lost. Without nutrients the beetle and other karst invertebrates <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive.</b> If a substantial amount of vegetation is removed, infiltration will increase changing their delicate habitat. The caves also face the threat of contamination when developing close to their habitat. Karst is very susceptible to groundwater contamination so when sewer and drainage systems are put in contaminated water can enter the caves. Many of the caves in Travis County are used for disposal of refuse and have probable killed most organisms within the cave. Farming as well leads to the contamination of habitat. Fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural waste can infiltrate through the ground contaminating the groundwater that enters the cave. The final way urban development has increased the loss of habitat is by increased human visitation. When humans build close to a species habitat it likely that visitation to the cave will increase. Some species are scared off by this new visitation. If one species leaves it often affects the whole chain of that ecosystem. Some caves are vandalized so much so that it changes the environment in which the beetle lives.|$|E

Watermark embedding is known difficult for binary images due to their binary nature. For frequency domain approach to binary image watermarking, a post-embedding binarization is a necessary step {{to ensure that the}} watermarked image is still a binary image. This step disturbs the watermark embedded and is likely to remove the watermark. We have succeeded in combating this interference by embedding watermarks in the DC components of DCT and employing a biased binarization threshold. This algorithm can be applied to binary images in general and experiments show that the embedding algorithm proposed <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>survive</b> binarization, but also provide some degree of robustness against common image processing.

Camptocormia was first an illness occurring among soldiers in World Wars I and II, and was regarded as a sign of hysteria. Ankylosing spondylitis is a more frequent cause.

Previous investigations of localized systems coupled to baths operated in regimes where the back action of the system on the bath is negligible, and concluded that the bath generically thermalizes the system. In this work we show that when the system is strongly localized and the bath is only weakly ergodic, the system can instead localize the bath. We demonstrate this both in the limit of weak coupling between system and bath, and in the limit of strong coupling, and for two different types of `weak' bath - baths which are close to an atomic limit, and baths which are close to a non-interacting limit. The existence of this `many body localization proximity effect' indicates that many body localization is more robust than previously appreciated, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>survive</b> coupling to a (weak) heat bath, but can even destroy the bath...|$|R

50|$|Deforestation is {{a threat}} to forests {{according}} to foresters. Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests and woodlands. Deforestation is brought about by commercial logging, conversion of woodlands to agricultural land, and the felling of trees for firewood and building material. Commercial logging is that harvest of timber products for the profit that is gained from selling the product. Illegal logging {{is a threat}} to forests. Illegal logging is the harvest of timber for economic gain without permission. This method is a threat because it impedes plans and upkeep of a forest. Forests are lost to urban development and building projects. When forest are cleared for these reasons, it creates problems that foresters are concerned with. When heavy machinery is used to clear forests or develop land, the soil becomes compacted. When the soil is compacted, the soil particles are packed tightly together. Soil compaction results in water supply not being absorbed by tree roots and can be deadly to the growth of trees. Soil compaction also can create flooding. Compacted soil can not filter the groundwater into the soil, therefore water can build up on the surface creating flooding as a result. Species extinction is another threat to our forests. With the removal of forests, animal and plant species suffer. Animal species <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> without the adequate needs of their lifestyle. Animals need cover, food, and safe areas for the reproduction process. Altering their environment disrupts the life cycle of animal species and they are oftentimes not able to adapt. Food sources are lost to deforestation. Animal species tend to consume plant life to maintain themselves. With the removal of forests this can result in animals not being able to find food in order to survive. Unmanaged recreational use is also a threat to forests. Unmanaged reacreational use is the use of the forested lands by the public at an uncontrolled rate. As recreational use as increased among forests, foresters have noticed an increase in land management that is needed. Invasive species threaten forests ecosystems. Invasive species are any species that is not native to that ecosystem and economic harm along with harm to the environment. Invasive species cause disruptions in the function of the ecosystem. These species not only affect the plants within a forest, but they can affect the animals within an ecosystem as well. The financial impact cause by invasive species is 138 billion dollars per year with economic loss and control costs.|$|E

40|$|Raising the {{persistence}} question about architectural entities consists in asking {{what is necessary}} and sufficient for a past or future architectural entity, like a building, to exist now. In this paper I investigate how {{the persistence}} question about buildings is affected by their spatial relocation. Why do we normally doubt that Notre Dame can survive its meticulous stone-by-stone transfer to Las Vegas? I argue that, since architectural plans are not capable of specifying all the constitutive properties of a building, the source of differentiation among constitutive and non-constitutive properties for buildings lies in a property’s being eligible or not eligible to be aesthetically relevant in the aesthetic judgements about them. As a matter of fact, our aesthetic judgements about buildings often concern, and are grounded on, extrinsic contextual properties. This explains why buildings <b>can</b> usually <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> relocation: because normally there is no basis for ruling out any extrinsic contextual feature of the building as inessential.

This paper seeks to investigate whether a strategy of critical mass can really work in the engineering sector. The data are based on research funded by the ESRC, and problematise critical mass theory through semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups with female students from a range of engineering disciplines. The findings demonstrate that women engineering students accept gender discrimination, view the industry positively, value their ‘‘novelty’’ status, and are critical of other women. While these attitudes may be a result of women’s assimilation into the existing engineering culture, they do little to further women’s cause in engineering. Furthermore, it points to both the necessity, and difficulties, of transforming the engineering culture to ensure that the engineering professions are a place where women <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>survive</b> but also thrive.
