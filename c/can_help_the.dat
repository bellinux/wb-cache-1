5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage.

5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person perspective, focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Aside from the main story, Batman <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins {{introduces}} the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game {{is the first in}} the series with multiplayer capability. WB Games Montréal took over development duties for Arkham Origins from series creators Rocksteady Studios.|$|E
5|$|From Dust {{is a god}} video game, {{designed}} by Éric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E

5|$|Training <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> user {{make use}} of their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at the {{electric}} chair, the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's heartbeat to charge the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> city. In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals; after the credits, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.|$|E
5|$|The second {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action {{platformer}} for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993. It {{is one of two}} video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.|$|E
