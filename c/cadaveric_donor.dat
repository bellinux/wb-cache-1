25|$|Liver {{transplantation}} or hepatic transplantation is {{the replacement}} of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (allograft). Liver transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. The most common technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic position as the original liver. The surgical procedure is complex, requiring careful harvest of the donor organ and meticulous implantation into the recipient. Liver transplantation is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians and supporting medical team. The duration of the surgery ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipient, {{as well as a}} well-calibrated live or <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donor</b> match.|$|E
25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donor</b> liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E

40|$|The lack of pricing data {{coupled by}} the {{presence}} of altruism creates challenges to estimating substitution patterns in the organs market. This paper proposes using variation in traffic safety laws an instrumental variable for the supply of <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors.</b> These instruments are then used to identify substitution patterns between living and <b>cadaveric</b> kidney <b>donors.</b> Using panel data from 1988 - 2008, we find that a 1 % decrease in the supply of <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> per 100, 000 individuals increases the supply of living donors per 100, 000 individuals between 0. 36 % to 0. 54 %.

A mean lowest creatinine level of 2. 0 mg/dL, (range 1. 1 - 3. 0 mg/dL), the rate of postoperative dialysis (22 %), and a 1 -year graft survival rate of 76 % for kidneys from NHB-donated kidneys compare favorably to expected results achieved nationally from brain-dead <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Nonheartbeating donor kidneys can yield acceptable graft function and be of no disadvantage to recipients of cadaver transplants...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, {{penetrating}} keratoplasty, or full thickness corneal transplantation, was {{the treatment}} of choice for irreversible endothelial failure. More recently, new corneal transplant techniques {{have been developed to}} enable more selective replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium. This approach, termed endokeratoplasty, is most appropriate for disease processes that exclusively or predominantly involve the corneal endothelium. Penetrating keratoplasty is preferred when the disease process involves irreversible damage not just to the corneal endothelium, but to other layers of the cornea as well. Compared to full-thickness keratoplasty, endokeratoplasty techniques are associated with shorter recovery times, improved visual results, and greater resistance to wound rupture. Although instrumentation and surgical techniques for endokeratoplasty are still in evolution, one commonly performed form of endokeratoplasty at present is Descemet's Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK DSAEK). In this form of endokeratoplasty, the diseased host endothelium and associated Descemet's membrane are removed from the central cornea, and in their place a specially harvested layer of healthy donor tissue is grafted. This layer consists of posterior stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium that has been dissected from <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donor</b> corneal tissue, typically using a mechanized (or [...] "automated") instrument.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{techniques}} of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) developed {{rapidly in the}} 1990 s to compensate for a severe deficiency in the availability of liver grafts from <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> {{for the treatment of}} patients with end‐stage liver disease. This tendency was particularly prominent in East Asia, as brain‐death donors have remained largely unavailable for a variety of reasons. Thanks to refinements in surgical technique and postoperative management for LDLT, the cumulative total of LDLTs in East Asian countries has exceeded 2000 and, importantly, donor mortality has yet to be encountered. Moreover, indications for LDLT have been successfully expanded from paediatric to adult cases, following the introduction of right lobe graft. The significance of LDLT under conditions of limited opportunities for cadaveric liver transplantation, as experienced in these countries, differs significantly from that seen with the numerous opportunities for <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> in Europe and the USA. This review describes not only the experiences of East Asia, but also the specific differences from Western countries, such as indications, graft size issues and ABO blood type combinations, to shed light on the future of liver transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Renal {{transplant}} is {{the best}} therapeutic alternative for chronic renal failure, {{although it is not}} exempt of risks. Aim: To report the survival of renal transplant recipients and grafts and the main complications at a public hospital in Chile. Patients and methods: This is a non experimental, open historical cohort study, with reposition of the first 100 transplants in 94 patients, performed at the Carlos van Buren Hospital between 1984 and 1998. Seventy grafts came from <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> and 30 from live donors. As immunosuppressive therapy, prednisone + azathioprine was used in 48 transplants and the same regimen plus cyclosporine in 52. Results: Mean age of recipients was 36 ± 23 years old. Ten years actuarial survival of patients was 80. 5 % in transplants from <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> and 86 % in transplants from live donors. Ten years graft survival was 57. 5 % in transplants from <b>cadaveric</b> <b>donors</b> and 42 % in transplants from live donors. The period in which the transplant was performed (first or second half of the observation period), type of donor, HLA B-DR compatibility and sensitization (% PRA) had no effect on survival. Twenty five subjects lost their graft, 12 due to acute steroid resistant rejection, 10 due to chronic graft nephropathy and three due to renal artery thrombosis. Fifteen subjects died with a functioning graft, 10 due to infections, two due to an acute myocardial infarction, two due to an acute pancreatitis and one due to a brain tumor. Conclusions: Survival of grafts and renal transplant recipients was not influenced by the type of donor, period of transplantation and immune variables.

Definition of ECD was: (1) donor age 60 years, (2) donor age 50 to 59 years, and (3) the presence of 2 among the following criteria: hypertension, serumcreatinine > 1. 5 mg/dL, or death from cerebrovascular accident.
