5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat.</b> The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E

25|$|Gelatin {{also can}} be {{prepared}} in the home. Boiling certain cartilaginous <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> or bones results in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting stock (when cooled) will form a jelly or gel naturally. This process is used for aspic.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivation}} {{and use of}} many {{agricultural products}} in the United States, such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, grits, indigo dyes, and cotton, {{can be traced to}} African influences. African-American foods reflect creative responses to racial and economic oppression and poverty. Under slavery, African Americans were not allowed to eat better <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> and after emancipation many were often too poor to afford them.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} {{study by the}} Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as they did on bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind the shops, and the blood often flowed out into the streets. The better <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by regrattiers who specialized in this trade.|$|E
5000|$|Pork loin is a <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> from a pig, {{created from}} the tissue {{along the top}} of the rib cage.|$|R

2500|$|... badal: <b>Cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{from the}} back and ribs of cattle, close to the neck. From Andalusi Arabic bad'a [...] "Calf muscle" [...] derived from {{classical}} Arabic bad'ah [...] "piece".|$|R
25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat.</b> It can be made from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has less fat than the belly.|$|E
25|$|The sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, meanwhile, are {{behaving}} wickedly, {{for example}} by taking for themselves all the prime <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> from sacrifices, and by committing adultery {{with the women}} who serve at the sanctuary entrance. Eli is aware of their behavior but he rebukes them too lightly and ultimately does not stop them. The sons continue in their sinful behavior, and so, according to the text, a man of God prophesies to Eli that Eli and his family will be punished for this, with all male descendants dying before reaching old age and being placed in positions subservient to prophets from other lineages. The curse alludes to a previous (not appearing elsewhere in the Bible) promise from God of Eli's lineage continuing eternally (c.f. similar promises to King David and Jehonadab). While this continuation is not revoked, a curse is placed on all of Eli's male descendants forever. As {{a sign of the}} accuracy of this future, Eli is told by the man of God that his sons will die on the same day.|$|E
25|$|The retail {{environment}} {{not only}} affects quality perceptions, {{but can also}} impact on the way that customers navigate {{their way through the}} retail space during the retail service encounter. Layout, directional signage, the placement of furniture, shelves and display space along with the store's ambient conditions all affect patron's passage through the retail service system. Layout refers to how equipment, shelves and other furnishings are placed and the relationship between them. In a retail setting, accessibility is an important aspect of layout. For example, the grid layout used by supermarkets with long aisles and gondolas at the end displaying premium merchandise or promotional items, minimises the time customers spend in the environment and makes productive use of available space. The gondola, so favoured by supermarkets, {{is an example of a}} retail design feature known as a merchandise outpost and which refers to special displays, typically at or near the end of an aisle, whose purpose is to stimulate impulse purchasing or to complement other products in the vicinity. For example, the meat cabinet at the supermarket might use a merchandise outpost to suggest a range of marinades or spice rubs to complement particular <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat.</b> As a generalisation, merchandise outposts are updated regularly so that they maintain a sense of novelty.|$|E
5000|$|Although butchers may label top round steak or roast [...] "London broil", {{the term}} does {{not refer to}} a {{specific}} <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> but to a method of preparation and cookery.|$|R
5000|$|Meatpacking {{executive}} Richard C. Banfield {{notes that}} the term [...] "short ribs" [...] {{comes from the fact}} that the <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> contains only a portion of each long beef rib.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} variants of sauerbraten. Many of the variations {{are in the}} ingredients used for the marinade in which the <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> is immersed for several days before cooking.|$|R
500|$|Compared {{with normal}} breeds of beef cattle, North American Piedmontese cattle are more {{proficient}} in converting feed into lean muscle. They also produce {{a higher percentage}} of the most desirable <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat.</b> They average 20% more muscle with less bone and fat. Research indicates that there is less connective tissue within the muscle of [...] "double-muscled" [...] cattle; this would imply less background toughness and therefore more tender meat.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} earlier {{instances}} of meat {{being used as}} clothing in art. Seafood outfits, including a lobster bikini, were featured at Salvador Dalí's The Dream of Venus pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair. [...] The cover of The Undertones' November 1983 compilation album, All Wrapped Up, showed a female model wearing <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> held in place with plastic wrap. The clothes are mostly bacon, with a sausage necklace. In 2010, singer Lady Gaga attended an awards show wearing a meat dress similar to Sterbak's in style.|$|E
500|$|Dark meat, which avian myologists {{refer to}} as [...] "red muscle", is used for {{sustained}} activity—chiefly walking, {{in the case of}} a chicken. The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus, the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark, while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout. [...] Some <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colouration.|$|E
5000|$|Stuffed {{dishes are}} usually served on festive occasions, {{as they take}} {{quite a bit of}} time to prepare. Almost any {{vegetable}} or <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> is a candidate for stuffing. Examples are: ...|$|R
50|$|Pork steaks, {{sometimes}} referred to as a Boston butt or pork blade steak, are steaks cut from the shoulder of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the <b>meat.</b> Because <b>of</b> this, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beefsteak, and are often stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking. Pork steaks are considered a cheaper <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> and they are often found on sale.|$|R
50|$|The same <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> {{but from}} a calf, is used for Cotoletta alla milanese, which {{consists}} <b>of</b> 1.5 cm-thick <b>cuts</b> which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.|$|R
500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and on about how amazing the pig is for the variety of <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> that come from it.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method. The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out stewing hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|E
500|$|Another {{controversy}} surrounding {{the dress was}} the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was [...] "derived" [...] from Incarnation, {{a painting of a}} white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album All Wrapped Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> (mostly bacon) held in place with plastic wrap and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together {{in the same way as}} the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.|$|E
50|$|A primal <b>cut</b> or <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{is a piece}} <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{initially}} {{separated from}} the carcass of an animal during butchering. Examples of primals include the beef round, loin, rib, and chuck or the swine ham, loin, Boston butt, and picnic.|$|R
50|$|Recipes include lesser <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meats</b> such as tongue, {{head and}} shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in Lent. These fish recipes are simple, {{including}} poaching, broiling, grilling and frying after marination.|$|R
5000|$|In Spanish cuisine, in Spain, a bone-attached rib steak {{is called}} chuletón, while the same <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> when its bone is removed, is called, in Spain, entrecot, a word {{originated}} in the French entrecôte.|$|R
2500|$|The word [...] "humble" [...] may {{be related}} to feudal England where the lowest <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> or 'umbles' ,' that is to say {{whatever}} was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen. [...] The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station may derive from this definition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to a rich musical heritage, Memphis also boasts a long culinary legacy dominated by regional barbecue. Memphis barbecue is rendered distinct by its sole usage of pork (as opposed to beef), focus on rib and shoulder <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> and multiple locally owned barbecue restaurants. Celebration of this local culinary tradition reaches its climax each year in May, when the Memphis in May Festival holds its annual [...]|$|E
2500|$|Thermostatically {{controlled}} methods, such as sous-vide, {{can also}} prevent overcooking by bringing {{the meat to}} the exact degree of doneness desired, and holding it at that temperature indefinitely. [...] The combination of precise temperature control and long cooking duration {{makes it possible to}} be assured that pasteurization has been achieved, both on the surface and the interior of even very thick <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> which can not be assured with most other cooking techniques. [...] (Although extremely long-duration cooking can break down the texture of the meat to an undesirable degree.) ...|$|E
50|$|Tri-tip {{has also}} become a popular <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> for {{producing}} chili con carne on the competitive chili-cooking circuit, supplanting ground beef because the low fat content produces little grease, for which judges take off points.|$|R
5000|$|Manchettes were {{originally}} of practical use: they allowed a <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{to be held}} with one hand securely and without the hand becoming greasy, leaving the other hand free to carve meat from the bone.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most of the}} chuck, the 7-bone roast or [...] "steak" [...] is {{generally}} considered a rather tough <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> and is most suitable for a long cooking in liquid at a low heat such as braising.|$|R
