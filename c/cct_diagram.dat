50|$|Above 900 °C {{a typical}} {{low-carbon}} steel is composed entirely of austenite, a high temperature phase of iron (the other being delta-ferrite at even higher temperatures). Below around 700 °C (727 °C in eutectic iron) the austenite is thermodynamically unstable and, under equilibrium conditions, it will undergo a eutectoid reaction and form pearlite - an interleaved mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). In {{addition to the}} thermodynamic considerations indicated by the phase diagram, the phase transformations in steel are heavily influenced by the chemical kinetics. This leads {{to the complexity of}} steel microstructures which are strongly influenced by the cooling rate. This can be illustrated by a continuous cooling transformation (<b>CCT)</b> <b>diagram</b> which plots the time required to form a phase when a sample is cooled at a specific rate thus showing regions in time-temperature space from which the expected phase fractions can be deduced for a given thermal cycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{continuous}} cooling transformation (<b>CCT)</b> <b>diagrams</b> in numerical welding simulations is state of the art. Nevertheless, specifications provide limits in chemical composition of materials which result in different CCT behavior and <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams,</b> respectively. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} analyze the influence of variations in <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> on the developing residual stresses. In the present paper, four <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> and their effect on numerical calculation of residual stresses are investigated for the widely used structural steel S 355 J 2 + N welded by the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. Rather than performing an arbitrary adjustment of CCT behavior, four justifiable data sets were used as input to the numerical calculation: data available in the Sysweld database, experimental data acquired through Gleeble dilatometry tests, and TTT/CCT predictions calculated from the JMatPro and Edison Welding Institute (EWI) Virtual Joining Portal software. The performed numerical analyses resulted in noticeable deviations in residual stresses considering the different <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Furthermore, possibilities to improve the prediction of distortions and residual stress based on CCT behavior are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Quenching and {{tempering}} {{of precision}} forged components using their forging heat leads to reduced process energy and shortens the usual process chains. To design such a process, neither the isothermal transformation diagrams (TTT) nor the {{continuous cooling transformation}} (<b>CCT)</b> <b>diagrams</b> from literature {{can be used to}} predict microstructural transformations during quenching since the latter diagrams are significantly influenced by previous deformations and process-related high austenitising temperatures. For this reason, deformation <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> for several tempering steels from previous works have been investigated taking into consideration the process conditions of precision forging. Within the scope of the present work, these diagrams are used as input data for predicting microstructural transformations by means of artificial neural networks. Several artificial neural network structures have been examined using the commercial software MATLAB. Predictors have been established with satisfactory capabilities for predicting <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> for different degrees of deformation within the analyzed range of data...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the TTT or <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> of steels is an {{important}} factor in the thermo-mechanical processing of steels. Much experimental work has been undertaken to determine such diagrams. However, the combination of wide alloy specification ranges, coupled with sharp sensitivity to composition changes plus a dependency on grain size, means that it is impossible to produce enough diagrams for generalised use. To this end significant work has been undertaken over recent decades to develop models that can calculate TTT and <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> for steels. Almost without exception, these models have been shown to be limited in applicability to carbon and low alloy steels. The aim of the present work is to develop a model that can provide accurate TTT and <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> for general steels, including medium to high alloy types, tool steels, 13 %Cr steels etc., for inclusion in the software programme JMatPro. This aim has been achieved and the present paper provides a background to the calculation method and present results of an extensive validation of the model against experiment...|$|R

In the current work one dilatometer is used to characterize the precipitation reactions of the AA 7020 alloy. Precipitation and dissolution reactions resulted in changes in the rate of change in the coefficient of thermal expansion. This was used to determine the start and finish temperatures of the MgZn 2 precipitation reaction and produce the <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram.</b> Good agreement was found between the results of this technique and DSC results from the literature...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Present work {{corresponds}} to the research on the kinetic of phase transformation of undercooled austenite of 37 MnNiMo 6 - 4 - 3 hypoeutctoid steel. The kinetic of phase transformation of under cooled austenite of investigated alloy was presented on <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram</b> (continuous cooling transformation). Also the methodology of a dilatometric samples preparation and the method of the critical points determination were described. Design/methodology/approach: The austenitising temperature was defined in a standard way i. e. 30 - 50 °C higher than Ac 3 temperature for hypoeutectoid steels. The technology of full annealing was proposed for the iron based alloy. The <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram</b> was made {{on the grounds of}} dilatograms recorded for samples cooled with various rates. The microstructure of each dilatometric sample was photographed after its cooling to the room temperature and the sample hardness was measured. Also EDS analysis was performed using scanning microscope. Findings: The test material has been hypoeutectoid steel. These steels represent a groups of alloy steels for quenching and tempering. The microstructure of test 37 MnNiMo 6 - 4 - 3 hypoeutectoid steel on <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram</b> changes depending on the cooling rate. Research limitations/implications: The new hypoeutectoid steel and new <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram.</b> Practical implications: The paper contains a description of one from a group of iron based model alloys with 0. 35 - 0. 40 % carbon content.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of Portland cement {{are closely related}} to the chemical composition of the clinker and particularly to the concentration of tricalcium silicate, C 3 S. In the industrial production process, the clinker must be rapidly quenched, to avoid its decomposition into dicalcium silicate and lime and also to avoid the transformation from higher temperature phases to lower temperature phases. This study investigated the kinetics of thermal decomposition of the C 3 S. Samples of laboratory-made C 3 S were thermally treated under specific conditions to determine the continuous cooling transformation (<b>CCT)</b> <b>diagram</b> of the material. The <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram</b> of the C 3 S showed decomposition rates with values that were much higher than the values traditionally accepted in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} cooling transformation (CCT) {{behaviors of}} three low carbon pipeline steels containing the different carbon and alloy additions such as Mn, Nb, V, Ti and/or Mo were investigated in the undeformed and deformed conditions, respectively. The corresponding static (without hot deformation) and dynamic (with hot deformation) <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> were constructed, which almost involved the formation curves of bainitic ferrite, acicular ferrite, polygonal ferrite, and pearlite. It was found that {{with the exception of}} V, the aforementioned alloy additions {{played a significant role in}} suppressing the formation of polygonal ferrite and promoting the formation of acicular ferrite. Furthermore, hot deformation could also strongly promote the formation of acicular ferrite, that is, the temperature zone of acicular ferrite transformation was enlarged from 400 - 600 degreesC in the static <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams</b> to 450 - 700 degreesC in the dynamic <b>CCT</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The corresponding cooling rate range of acicular ferrite transformation was significantly increased, and the island constituents in acicular ferrite became finer due to hot deformation.

40|$|The phase {{transformation}} and precipitation in a {{high-strength low-alloy steel}} have been studied over a large range of cooling rates, and a continuous cooling transformation (<b>CCT)</b> <b>diagram</b> has been produced. These experiments are unique because the measurements were made from samples cooled directly from the melt, rather than in homogenized and re-heated billets. The purpose of this experimental design was to examine conditions pertinent to direct strip casting. At the highest cooling rates which simulate strip casting, the microstructure was fully bainitic with small regions of pearlite. At lower cooling rates, the fraction of polygonal ferrite increased and the pearlite regions became larger. The <b>CCT</b> <b>diagram</b> and the microstructural analysis showed that the precipitation of NbC is suppressed at high cooling rates, {{and is likely to}} be incomplete at intermediate cooling rates...|$|E
