5000|$|European health {{agencies}} have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, {{one of the}} four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. [...] Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals. However, the BFR only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin. Its report specifically states that <b>Ceylon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (Cinnamomum verum) contains [...] "hardly any" [...] coumarin.|$|R
40|$|Since 1988 {{there has}} been a {{statutory}} maximum level for coumarin in Europe of 2 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) food. Discussions are currently ongoing on the European level about which values should be laid down for coumarin in the forthcoming amendment to the flavourings legislation. The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection had asked BfR to submit corresponding proposals. Coumarin can harm the liver and higher levels trigger cancer in animal experiments. Hence a dose was established that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without any negative effects on health. This TDI value is 0. 1 mg/kg body weight. Measurements by the regional health control bodies from 2006 had detected high levels of coumarin in many cinnamon-containing foods. In some cases they were far higher than the currently valid maximum level of 2 mg/kg food and were caused by the predominant use of Cassia cinnamon. An exposure assessment by BfR showed that consumers {{with a high level of}} consumption of cinnamon and cinnamon-containing foods exceed the safe coumarin dose based on the levels detected. Four action options (options A-D) were proposed which either envisaged the exclusive use of low-level coumarin <b>Ceylon</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (A), the laying down of a general maximum level for coumarin in cinnamon (B), the raising of the existing maximum level to 4 mg/kg food (C), or – option D – the laying down of maximum levels for individual food categories.
