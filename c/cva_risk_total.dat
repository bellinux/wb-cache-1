To decrease {{the incidence of}} embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) during support with the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS), an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) inflow conduit has been developed and introduced clinically. METHODS: Using clinical data from Europe and Canada, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of embolic CVA with the ePTFE inflow conduit (n= 88) {{in comparison with the}} previously used polyester inflow conduits (n= 310, including Vascutek n= 155 and Cooley n= 155). We calculated freedom from embolic <b>CVA,</b> <b>risk</b> reduction for embolic CVA, and linearized rates of embolic CVA. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the incidence of embolic CVA was demonstrated with the ePTFE conduit (ePTFE 10 % vs polyester 23 %, p= 0. 002). Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from embolic CVA at 180 days after implantation was 86 % for the ePTFE group vs 72 % for the polyester group (log-rank test, 0. 0185). We also found an associated risk reduction of 55 % in CVA occurrence in the ePTFE group when compared with the Polyester group (hazard ratio, 0. 445; 95 % confidence limit, 0. 222 - 0. 890; p= 0. 0221). Linearized CVA rates also were decreased at all time intervals after implantation in the ePTFE group. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical results with the newly introduced ePTFE inflow conduit provide compelling evidence that the ePTFE conduit material significantly decreases thromboembolic complications during mechanical circulatory support with the Novacor LVAS. status: publishe...|$|R

The subjects were comprised of 206 elderly Japanese aged 60 or older (37 males, 169 females) who participated in an exercise class, approved by the local government, once a week for 6 months. Physical fitness and ADL capability were evaluated by the physical fitness test of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Fall risk was evaluated using the Fall Assessment Chart. Subjects were divided into two groups, high fall <b>risk</b> (<b>total</b> fall <b>risk</b> score ≥ 5) and low fall <b>risk</b> (<b>total</b> fall <b>risk</b> score < 5), and the percentage of subjects in the high risk group was calculated.

Significant differences between fall risk groups were found in balance and ADL capabilities of walking, holding and changing posture and muscular strength.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} bank equity risk and credit risk {{as well as providing}} an analysis of the change in bank equity risk following the formation of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It is motivated by the increasing interest in bank risk research particularly since the formation of EMU and the global financial crisis. The study considers a range of financial institutions across 36 countries from the period of 1995 - 2006. In terms of methodology, the primary estimation method for the regression equations was pooled-OLS and two stage least squares (2 SLS) with robust standard errors. The robustness of the findings was also tested by other estimation methods such as random effects and fixed effects panel data analysis. The findings on European bank analysis show: (i) off-balance sheet activities are positively associated with equity <b>risk</b> (<b>total</b> <b>risk,</b> systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk) and credit risk; (ii) charter value is positively associated with equity risk but negatively related to credit risk; (iii) bank capital is non-linearly related with systematic risk and credit risk; (iv) uninsured deposits are negatively associated with systematic risk while positively related to credit <b>risk,</b> <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> and idiosyncratic risk; (v) large banks exhibit greater systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> but lower credit risk and idiosyncratic risk. While these bank characteristics are important in explaining bank risk, the findings also confirm that civil-law country banks tend to be less risky than common-law country banks over the period of the study. Similar findings are also evident in separate world and regional analysis. As to the possibility of structural change between the pre-EMU and post-EMU periods, the results show the magnitude of charter value fell dramatically in the post-EMU period with regard to equity risk and credit risk. The findings generally show an increase in the importance of off-balance sheet activities in the post-EMU period. These results were robust to various estimation specifications. In addition, the findings reveal that, with the exception of Germany, there was a decline in bank risk across the euro zone countries. <b>Total</b> <b>risk</b> decreased for 70 % of the euro zone banks with a statistically significant decline in <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> observed for 51 % of the sample. A similar result is evident for systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk. These findings are robust to financial crisis effect and test specifications. Moreover, this study finds evidence of a decrease in bank equity risk for a sample of neighbouring non-euro zone European countries, consistent with the existence of some spill-over effects. This study contributes to the existing bank risk literature by showing that bank regulation, off-balance sheet activities and market discipline are important determinants of bank equity risk and credit risk. In addition, {{it is one of the}} first studies to provide evidence of changes in the importance of factors affecting bank risk between the pre-and post-EMU periods. This is also one of the first studies to provide empirical evidence of bank capital non-linearity for European banks as well as for the broader world bank analysis...|$|R

Consistent with Pillar 3, Basel II and Basel III, we also find that bank risk is negatively associated with market discipline. Further, our results provide evidence that market discipline complements bank capital while market discipline substitutes bank self-disciplinary tools such as charter value.
