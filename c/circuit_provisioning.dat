In such applications, circuits are provisioned for end hosts to accomplish data-intensive or QoS-stringent communication tasks. Existing provisioning methods provide point-to-point connectivity for end hosts, that is, an established circuit connects one end host to another, {{and during the}} lifetime of the circuit, only communication tasks between the connected end hosts can be served. This inhibits circuits from being used in more general cases, where each end host communicates with different remote parities simultaneously through a single network interface. We propose V-STONES — a data flow-based VLAN tagging and switching technique to increase the connectivity of end host network interfaces in circuit-switched networks. With V-STONES, not only can an IP end host communicate with different remote systems concurrently through bandwidth guaranteed connections, but also protocol entities at different stack layers can talk to their counterparts through dedicated bandwidth pipes.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{multiple}} connection method for a optical switching architecture and discuss the control plane to connection. In optical network, there are three function planes and every plane has its important role. Fast provisioning enables bandwidth on demand service, where a user or its proxy can directly request a connection by using appropriate signaling via the user-network interface. A call may embody any number of underlying connections, including zero. Benefits of this separation include supporting such optical services as scheduled bandwidth on demand, diverse <b>circuit</b> <b>provisioning,</b> or bundled connection. Optical networking has become a key technology in accommodating the rapidly expanding Internet traffic. New optical networks are expected to support the increasing network load by employing both sophisticated transmission (wavelength division multiplexing division (WDM)) and switching technologies (optical switches and cross-connects) [1, 2].

40|$|Telecommunication {{networks}} are experiencing {{a dramatic increase}} in demand for capacity, much of it related to the exponential takeup of the Internet and associated services. To support this demand economically, transport {{networks are}} evolving to provide a reconfigurable optical layer which, with optical cross-connects, will realize a high-bandwidth flexible core. As well as providing large capacity, this new layer will be required to support new services such as rapid provisioning of an end-to-end connection under customer control. The first phase of network evolution, therefore, will provide a circuit-switched optical layer characterized by high capacity and fast <b>circuit</b> <b>provisioning.</b> In the longer term, it is currently envisaged that the bandwidth efficiency associated with optical packet switching (a transport technology that matches the bursty nature of multimedia traffic) will be required to ensure economic use of network resources. This article considers possible network application scenarios for optical packet switching. In particular, it focuses on the concept of an optical packet router as an edge network device, functioning as an interface between the electronic and optical domains.

In such a model, the generalized MPLS protocol suite could provide the IP centric control plane component {{that will be used}} to deliver rapid and dynamic <b>circuit</b> <b>provisioning</b> of end-to-end optical light paths between the routers. This is called an automatic switched optical (transport) network (ASON). An ASON enables reconfiguration of the logical IP topology by setting up and tearing down light paths. This allows to up- or downgrade link capacities during a router failure to the capacities needed by the new routing of the affected traffic. Such survivability against (single) IP router failures is cost-effective, as capacity to the IP layer can be provided flexibly when necessary. We present and investigate a logical topology optimization problem that minimizes the total amount or cost of the needed resources (interfaces, wavelengths, WDM line-systems, amplifiers, etc.) in both the IP and the optical layer. A novel optimization aspect in this problem is the possibility, {{as a result of the}} ASON, to reuse the physical resources (like interface cards and WDM line-systems) over the different network states (the failure-free and all the router failure scenarios). We devised a simple optimization strategy to investigate the cost of the ASON approach and compare it with other schemes that survive single router failures...|$|E
40|$|As Internet traffic {{continues}} to grow unabated at an exponential rate, {{it is unclear whether}} or not the existing packet routing network architecture based on electronic routers will continue to scale at the necessary pace. On the other hand, optical fiber and switching elements have demonstrated an abundance of capacity that appears to be unmatched by electronic routers. In particular, the simplicity of circuit switching makes it well-suited for optical implementations. Therefore, given the rapidly increasing traffic and optical transport capabilities, and the growing disparity between optical capabilities and Moore's Law, we would like to bridge this gap for future optical networks. In this thesis, we present a new approach to optical networking based on a paradigm of "coarse optical circuit switching by default" and "adaptive rerouting over circuits with spare capacity". We consider the provisioning of long-duration quasi-static optical circuits between edge routers at the boundary of the network to carry the traffic by default. When the provisioned circuit is inadequate, excess traffic demand is rerouted through circuits with spare capacity. In particular, by adaptively load-balancing across circuits with spare capacity, excess traffic is routed on their final destinations without the need to create circuits "on-the-fly". We call this new network architecture COPLAR, which stands for "[C]oarse [OP]tica[L] circuit switching with [A]daptive [R]erouting". Specifically, we first formulate the problem of <b>circuit</b> <b>provisioning</b> as a multipath utility max-min bandwidth allocation problem, which considers routing as an optimization parameter rather than input. The optimal and local algorithms proposed in the thesis are the first solutions to this problem. For traffic that cannot be handled by the default provisioned circuits, we apply an adaptive routing algorithm based on game theory to adaptively reroute the excess traffic over circuits with spare capacities. To evaluate COPLAR, we conducted extensive experiments using two separate real large-ISP PoP (point of presence) -level topologies, Abilene and GEANT. The results show that coplar has the ability to improve network throughput while significantly reducing electronic router overhead and the number of O/E/O conversions in the network. Finally, we show that our utility max-min bandwidth allocation algorithm can be extended to other network problems. In particular, we present a network security application called PSP (Proactive Surge Protection) that provides a defense against bandwidth-based distributed denial-of-service attack...|$|E
