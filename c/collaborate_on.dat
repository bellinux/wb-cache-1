5|$|In 1838 Planché was to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> {{an opera}} with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn {{originally}} approved of Planché's choice of topic, Edward III's siege of Calais in the Hundred Years War, and responded positively {{to the first}} two acts of the libretto. But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters. The opera was never realised.|$|E
5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E

Harisu played Lisu, a murdered pop singer who becomes a vengeful ghost, and also performed the films theme song, though it was necessary for her dialogue to be spoken in Korean and later dubbed. She was praised by director Bjarne Wong for her hard work and professionalism, and has hinted that they may <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> another film in the future.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman {{confirmed}} to Variety {{that they are}} no longer going to work together on film projects but will still <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> television.

5|$|Kurosawa {{entered the}} Japanese film {{industry}} in 1936, following a brief {{stint as a}} painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's {{reputation as one of}} the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> another 15 films.|$|E
5|$|Legal & General {{worked with}} the local {{community}} to secure support for the project, establishing the St Giles Renaissance Forum in 2002 as {{a focal point for}} local residents, community groups and stakeholders to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> plans to regenerate St Giles. Plans for the development were unveiled in February 2004 and in January 2005 Legal & General made a planning application to begin construction. The scheme was opposed by a number of local residents' groups which complained that it would constitute an overdevelopment of the site, would put too much strain on local transport and that there was too little residential accommodation on the site.|$|E
5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> mitigation projects.

The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business.|$|E

5|$|The tomb {{monument}} was {{the first}} collaboration between Donatello and Michelozzo, {{who went on to}} <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> the tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci in the Church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples, the tomb of Papal Secretary Bartolomeo Aragazzi in what is now the Duomo of Montepulciano, and the external pulpit of the Duomo of Prato. At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and Orsanmichele, while Michelozzo was more obscure. Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.|$|E
5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} the drawings made by Yuu Kamiya's wife, Mashiro Hiiragi, in second light novel volume, his editor suggested the two <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> a manga adaptation of No Game No Life for Monthly Comic Alive. Due to Kamiya's {{work on the}} third light novel volume, the manga serialization was delayed by a volume; the volume {{it was supposed to}} premiere in contained an apology page illustrated by Hiiragi. The series premiered in the March 2013 volume of Monthly Comic Alive and since then, is published irregularly in the magazine. Media Factory collected the individual chapters for the tankōbon release; there is currently a single volume which was released on November 22, 2013. In March 2014, Seven Seas Entertainment announced its licensing of the manga series and released the first tankōbon volume in October 2014; the title is stylized as No Game, No Life. The series has also been localized in Brazil, Taiwan and Russia.|$|E

5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Crimewave is a 1986 American comedy film {{directed}} by Sam Raimi, written {{by him and}} the Coen brothers, and starring Louise Lasser, Paul L. Smith, Brion James, Sheree J. Wilson, Edward R. Pressman, Bruce Campbell, and Reed Birney, with Campbell also serving as a producer. Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because of continued interference by the studio.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to <b>collaborate</b> <b>on</b> the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E
