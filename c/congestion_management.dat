40|$|Building and {{maintaining}} modern transportation infrastructure demands considerable expenditure for any nation. These terrestrial route corridor zones include road, rail {{and to a}} lesser extent waterways. Road networks range from the large highways and motorways covering hundreds of kilometres down to smaller street networks that may only be few hundred meters in length. These route networks attract their own unique set of spatial information requirements in terms of overall management. These include transportation planning, engineering and operation. High quality, timely spatial information is required of the entire route corridor which now extends past the narrow confines of the road surface and includes the area adjacent to the road edge as well as areas above and below the road surface. Comprehensive 3 D spatial information is required, not only, of the network itself but also objects occurring along these route corridors. This information can be used to address the day to day engineering problems as well as more strategic issues such as road safety, <b>congestions</b> <b>management</b> and noise modelling. LiDAR systems are widely available and now used to record data from both aerial and terrestrial survey platforms. LiDAR outputs X,Y,Z points enabling reliable 3 -D measurements as well as 2. 5 -D geometric surface to be produced. High quality imagery is also collected from similar airborne and terrestrial mobile mapping platforms. This paper examines the integration of road survey imagery and airborne LiDAR data-streams within a GIS in order to satisfy these spatial information requirements...|$|R

The AAP is relevant information in the case of <b>congestions</b> <b>management,</b> down-regulation due to negative prices at the spot market or for the provision of control reserve. Until now only few methods for the estimation of the AAP are available. In this paper five different methods are described and compared. Therefore four criteria are defined: accuracy under normal operation, accuracy under curtailment, consideration of changes in the wind farm's composition and costs. For the test 10 -minutes averaged data from a wind farm in Brandenburg (Eastern Germany) that were measured over 21 months was used. Four of the five methods show high accuracy under normal operation, only the last measured value method is less accurate. Under curtailment the accuracy of the adjusted power curve method and the site-specific power curve decreases with increasing curtailment leve ls whereas the reference wind turbine method's and physical model's accuracy stays the same. Under additional consideration of the two other criteria the physical model seems to be most suitable for the estimation of the AAP. Further research will test the most promising methods also with three seconds data which is crucial for the provision of control reserve by wind farms. The provision of control reserve by wind farms using the AAP will be shown in a field test in the middle of 2013...|$|R

40|$|Abstract“Congestion costs” {{occur in}} the {{electricity}} market when the power flows, equivalent to a projection mapping of energy injection and withdrawal, established by the “electricity stock exchange” and by “bi-lateral contracts”, are incompatible with the transfer capacity guaranteed by the power grid, in required security conditions. Transfer restrictions in the national and transboundary transmission grid can potentially determine the market segmentation in different geographical areas, preventing the producers to compete freely to satisfy the overall demand in those areas. As a result of power congestions, those producers that have reduced limitations in the power transfer are obviously favored, also if {{in the presence of}} high marginal production costs and prices, leading to the constitution of pools of producers that de facto control the local market. In particular this paper aims at describing and discussing the problem of power congestions, electricity price formation and <b>congestion</b> risk <b>management...</b>|$|R
