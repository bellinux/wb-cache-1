5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} as a <b>character</b> <b>to</b> provide a non-human perspective for {{the theme of}} meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the <b>character</b> <b>to</b> share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a <b>character</b> <b>to</b> die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead <b>character</b> <b>to</b> be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E
