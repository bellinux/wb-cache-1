25|$|The low {{pressure}} area began forming in the Southern states a few days prior to the Blizzard striking, eventually merging with a northern stream system. A trough on the East Coast brought the system up the coast, and <b>cold</b> <b>high</b> pressure to the north eventually slowed the system to a crawl. As the system completed bombing, or rapid decrease in central pressure (a common measure {{of the strength of}} a storm), mesoscale banding features (areas of significant snowfall associated with smaller scale physical phenomena) impinged on the entire I-95 Corridor.|$|E
25|$|In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles {{became the}} only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and {{southern}} Ontario, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and {{snow on the ground}} {{at the start of the}} blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter <b>cold,</b> <b>high</b> winds, and blowing snow paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect.|$|E

60|$|Charles Seaforth, who was {{apparently}} younger, and certainly a trifle more fastidious about his attire than his comrade, shouldered a flour bag, and {{twenty minutes later}} he and Alton tramped out of the settlement with three loaded beasts splashing and floundering in front of them. It was almost dark now, though a line of snow still glimmered white and <b>cold</b> <b>high</b> up beyond the trees until the trail plunged into the blackness of the forest. Then {{the lights of the}} settlement were blotted out behind them, the hum of voices ceased, and they were alone in the primeval silence of the bush. The thud and splash of tired hoofs only served to emphasize it, the thin jingle of steel or creak of pack-rope was swallowed up and lost, for the great dim forest seemed to mock at anything man could do to disturb its pristine serenity. It had shrouded all that valley, where no biting gale ever blew, from the beginning, majestic in its solitary grandeur and eternally green. Pine and hemlock, balsam and cedar, had followed in due succession others that had grown to the fulness of their stature only in centuries, and their healing essence, which brings sound sleep to man's jaded body and tranquillity to his mind, had doubtless risen like incense when all was made very good.|$|E
