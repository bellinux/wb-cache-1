25|$|Meerut {{is one of}} the {{important}} industrial towns of western Uttar Pradesh with several traditional and modern industries. It is traditionally known for handloom works and scissors industry. Meerut {{was one of the first}} cities in northern India where publishing was set up during the 19th century. It was a major center of <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> during the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
25|$|However, as a niche <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> {{industry}} for machine-printed illustrated envelopes subsequently developed in Britain and elsewhere, {{it is likely}} that it was the sentiment of the illustration that provoked the ridicule and led to their withdrawal. Indeed, in the absence of examples of machine-printed illustrated envelopes prior to this it may be appropriate to recognise the Mulready envelope as a significant innovation in its own right. Machine-printed illustrated envelopes are a mainstay of the direct mail industry.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, {{the number}} of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The Great Depression forced the library into a rigid austerity, {{resulting}} in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> house Druckhaus Klepzig on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set up at an alternative site at Döbeln in 1944.|$|E

25|$|The University of Chicago {{declined}} the offer, viewing {{the mission of}} the university as not entirely consistent with a large <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> house; however it continues even today to be involved in its production, offering editorial advice and allowing its name {{to be associated with the}} Britannica. Thus, in 1943, the wealthy and powerful William Benton, a former U.S. senator and advertising executive, obtained exclusive control of the Britannica, which he published until his death in 1973. His widow Helen Hemingway Benton continued to publish the Britannica until her own death in 1974. After their deaths, the Benton Foundation continued to manage the Britannica until it was sold to Jacqui Safra in 1996.|$|E
500|$|As Boyce traveled, {{he often}} started a {{newspaper}} wherever he went. His first venture into <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> was compiling a city directory. He also worked briefly for a publisher in Columbus, Ohio, and a newspaper publisher in Kensington, Pennsylvania, part of Philadelphia. He then boarded a train for Chicago {{and worked as}} a secretary and salesman for [...] "Western" [...] magazine. Restless again, he moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in Fargo, North Dakota, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Further north in Canada, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he and local resident James W. Steen co-founded [...] "The Commercial" [...] in 1881, a newspaper that lasted for 70 years. He sold his share of [...] "The Commercial" [...] to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter. In December 1882, Boyce moved to Lisbon, North Dakota, where he bought the Dakota Clipper.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King, in his {{introduction}} to Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas, has called the novella [...] "an ill-defined and disreputable literary banana republic"; King notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers.

2500|$|Historically, {{publishing}} {{has been}} handled by publishers, {{with the history}} of self-publishing progressing slowly until the advent of computers brought us electronic publishing, which has been made evermore ubiquitous from the moment the world went online with the Internet. The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant medium of publishing, as websites are easily created by almost anyone with Internet access. The history of wikis started shortly thereafter, followed closely by the history of blogging. [...] <b>Commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> also progressed, as previously printed forms developed into online forms of publishing, distributing online books, online newspapers, and online magazines.|$|E
2500|$|As of 1990, seven Japanese {{publishers}} included BL {{content in}} their offerings - which kickstarted the <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> market of the genre. [...] By 2003, 3.8% of weekly manga magazines were dedicated to BL. A 2008 assessment {{estimated that the}} Japanese commercial yaoi market grossed approximately 12 billion yen annually, with novel sales generating 250 million yen per month, manga generating 400 million yen per month, CDs generating 180 million yen per month, and video games generating 160 million yen per month. [...] As of this time, magazines for BL included BE-BOY, GUSH, CHARA and CIEL. A 2010 report estimated that the yaoi market was worth approximately 21.3 billion yen in both 2009 and 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, {{people of}} all ages read manga. The medium {{includes}} works in a broad range of genres: action-adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, historical drama, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, sexuality, sports and games, and suspense, among others. [...] Many manga are translated into other languages. Since the 1950s, manga has steadily become {{a major part of the}} Japanese publishing industry, representing a ¥406 billion market in Japan in 2007 (approximately $3.6 billion) and ¥420 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) in 2009. Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience. In Europe and the Middle East the market was worth $250 million in 2012. In 2008, in the U.S. and Canada, the manga market was valued at $175 million. Manga represent 38 % of the French comics market, nearly 260 million Euros which is equivalent to approximately ten times to that of the United States. Manga stories are typically printed in black-and-white, although some full-color manga exist (e.g., Colorful). In Japan, manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines, often containing many stories, each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue. If the series is successful, collected chapters may be republished in tankōbon volumes, frequently but not exclusively, paperback books. A manga artist (mangaka in Japanese) typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a <b>commercial</b> <b>publishing</b> company. If a manga series is popular enough, it may be animated after or even during its run. Sometimes manga are drawn centering on previously existing live-action or animated films.|$|E
