5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Smith, Sr. and Cowdery's father, William, {{may have}} been members of a Congregationalist sect known as the New Israelites, {{organized}} in Rutland County, Vermont.

According to Cesarani and Götz Aly, although Jews who survived the deportations claimed that they had not been informed by their leaders, that no one had told them, there is plenty of evidence that Hungarian Jews <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pytheas was {{a central}} source of {{information}} on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were Dicaearchus, Timaeus, Eratosthenes, Crates of Mallus, Hipparchus, Polybius, Artemidorus and Posidonius. Notably the list does not include Strabo or Tacitus, though Strabo discusses him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him through other writers or have read his work in the original.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Bleichrodt {{was held}} by the Allies on war crimes charges {{pertaining}} to {{the sinking of the}} City of Benares. Bleichrodt was accused of sinking the ship with the full knowledge that it had been transporting evacuees. He reaffirmed the German position {{that there was no way}} that he or the crew of the submarine <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> who was on board. It was upheld and he was acquitted. However, Bleichrodt refused to apologise to the survivors, despite several crew members of U-48, including the radio operator, expressing their shock and regret once the facts became known.|$|E
25|$|In capital {{punishment}} cases, {{in order to}} {{rule out the possibility that}} police may have forced a confession, the secret must be something that the police investigation did not discover at the time of the confession. Moreover, supervision by the prosecutor, in order to maintain the record of investigation, is considered the cornerstone of validity of confession as evidence. Due to its reliance on confession as evidence and proof of guilt, Japanese police put enormous pressure on the suspect to confess a guilty secret as this kind of confession is regarded as strong as forensic evidence. The vast majority of miscarriage of justice cases, in Japanese {{capital punishment}} cases, involve police faking the investigative record to make it appear as if the suspect confessed certain guilty secrets, which only the perpetrator of the crime <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> and it later became apparent that the suspect was being forced to sign a completely blank confession paper which the investigative police filled in for their convenience.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{motive for}} the novel, {{or at least one}} political inspiration, was Behn's view that Surinam was a fruitful and potentially wealthy settlement that needed only a true noble to lead it. Like others sent to investigate the colony, she felt that Charles was not properly informed of the place's potential. When Charles gave up Surinam in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda, Behn was dismayed. This dismay is enacted in the novel in a graphic fashion: if the English, with their aristocracy, mismanaged the colony and the slaves by having an insufficiently noble ruler there, then the democratic and mercantile Dutch would be far worse. Accordingly, the passionate misrule of Byam is replaced by the efficient and immoral management of the Dutch. Charles had a strategy for a united North American presence, however, and his gaining of New Amsterdam for Surinam was part of that larger vision. Neither Charles II nor Aphra Behn <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> how correct Charles's bargain was, but Oroonoko {{can be seen as a}} royalist's demurral.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 1688, Leopold I's forces {{under the}} Elector of Bavaria secured Belgrade for the Empire. With the Ottomans {{appearing}} close to collapse Louis XIV's ministers, Louvois and Colbert de Croissy, felt it essential {{to have a}} quick resolution along the German frontier before the Emperor turned from the Balkans to lead a comparatively united German Empire against France on the Rhine and reverse the Ratisbon settlement. On 24 September Louis published his manifesto, his Mémoire de raisons, listing his grievances: he demanded that the Truce of Ratisbon {{be turned into a}} permanent resolution, and that Fürstenburg be appointed Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis's control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands 'buffer-zone' would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to investing Philippsburg, the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns. This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.|$|E
500|$|A {{key issue}} was whether Bamber {{received}} a call from his father that night to say Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with a gun. Bamber said that he did, that he alerted police, and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it—indeed, the only way he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were the parent of a Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no way they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2004, child {{pornography}} {{charges were dropped}} in exchange for Reubens' guilty plea to a lesser charge. For the next three years, he was required to register his address with the sheriff's office {{and he could not}} be in the company of minors without the permission of a parent or legal guardian. Reubens later stated that he was a collector of erotica, including films, muscle magazines and a sizable collection of mostly homosexual vintage erotica, such as photographic studies of teen nudes. Reubens said that what the city attorney's office viewed as pornography, he considered to be innocent art and that what they described as people underage engaged in masturbation or oral copulation was, in fact, a judgmental {{point of view of the}} nudes that Reubens described as people [...] "one hundred percent not" [...] performing sexual acts. Being an avid collector, Reubens had often purchased bulk lots, and one of his vintage magazine dealers declared that [...] "there's no way" [...] he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the content of each page in the publications he bought and that he recalled Reubens asking for [...] "physique magazines, vintage 1960s material, but not things featuring kids".|$|E
500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results {{would not have happened}} without an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no way}} anyone who wasn't in on the fix <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.|$|E
500|$|Reasonable Doubt {{has often}} been {{considered}} by many fans to be Jay-Z's best record. He himself deemed it his best. According to Birchmeier, it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking [...] "pop-crossover" [...] songs and hits. Shaheem Reid of MTV explained, [...] "Reasonable Doubt might not have the radio hits or club bangers {{of many of his}} other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical—and certainly at his most honest, according to him". Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay-Z's [...] "effortless, unaffected cool" [...] flow, [...] "disarming honesty", and knack for [...] "writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time". According to Huey, this [...] "helped Reasonable Doubt rank as one of the finest albums of New York's hip-hop renaissance of the '90s". Birchmeier, on the other hand, believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album's reputation as a classic more so than Jay-Z. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the album was [...] "designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it," [...] finding it [...] "richer than any outsider <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> and benefiting from everything we've since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth was. You can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes".|$|E

500|$|Instead, Raucher {{decided to}} focus on the first major adult {{experience}} of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. On the night memorialized in the film, Raucher randomly came to visit her, unaware his arrival was just minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. She was confused and upset, had been drinking heavily, and repeatedly called Raucher by her husband's name. Although both ultimately [...] disrobed, contrary to popular opinion, sexual intercourse did not occur. Raucher admitted this in a 2002 interview saying it was mostly holding, but in the movie [...] "We let you think what you want." [...] The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him (which is read {{at the end of the}} film and reproduced in the book). He never saw her again; his last [...] "encounter" [...] with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be [...] "his" [...] Dorothy. Raucher recognized the [...] "real" [...] Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she was glad he turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.|$|E
