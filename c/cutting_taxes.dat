5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes,</b> improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E

2500|$|In their {{economics}} textbook Principles of Economics (7th edition), economists Karl E. Case of Wellesley College and Ray Fair of Yale University stated “The Laffer curve {{shows the}} relationship between tax rates and tax revenues. Supply-side economists use it to {{argue that it is}} possible to generate higher revenues by <b>cutting</b> <b>tax</b> rates, but evidence does not appear to support this. [...] The lower tax rates by the Reagan administration decreased tax revenues significantly and contributed to the massive increase in federal debt during the 1980s.”.|$|R

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
25|$|The Adam Smith Institute prefers <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> on {{the poor}} and middle class instead of raising wages as an {{alternative}} to the minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly's Senate {{campaign}} also {{focused on}} closing tax loopholes for corporations, <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> on small businesses, investing in American energy production, and cutting spending {{to balance the}} national budget. Donnelly was endorsed by every major newspaper in Indiana, and the Louisville Courier Journal, whose readership extends into southern Indiana.|$|E
25|$|Alliance for Sweden {{proposed}} {{to address the}} problem by <b>cutting</b> income <b>tax</b> for the lowest paid (by increasing the tax-free allowance), <b>cutting</b> the payroll <b>tax</b> (and abolishing it for parts of the service sector), and making wages paid for household work tax-deductible. Critics of the proposed tax cuts said that, because they are funded by reducing unemployment benefit and sick pay, they would attack the most needy in society rather than helping them as Alliance for Sweden claimed.|$|R
5000|$|CTJ’s {{most visible}} impact on U.S. tax policy was {{its role in}} {{bringing}} about {{the enactment of the}} Tax Reform Act of 1986. In addition to <b>cutting</b> <b>tax</b> rates, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 also simplified and broadened the tax base, and eliminated numerous tax shelters. CTJ described the Act as [...] "path-breaking federal legislation that curbed tax shelters for corporations and the rich and cut taxes for poor and middle-income families." [...] The Tax Foundation, a group generally considered to be on {{the opposite end of the}} political spectrum from CTJ, has described the Act as [...] "one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever passed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The United States in the 1970s {{underwent}} [...] "stagflation"—a wrenching {{period of}} low economic growth, high inflation and {{high interest rates}} and intermittent energy crises. Reagan was an adherent of supply-side economics, which argues that economic growth can be most effectively created using incentives for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates. Accordingly, Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population. Reagan theorized that <b>cutting</b> <b>tax</b> rates would actually increase tax revenues because the lower rates would cause people to work harder as {{they would be able}} to keep more of their money.|$|R
25|$|On 16 October 2013 Jensen was {{appointed}} Minister of Finance as the Progress Party joined a minority coalition government {{led by the}} Conservative Party, the party's first ever government participation. Jensen's first national budget included proposals of <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes,</b> and spending more of Norway's oil wealth, and she also appointed a committee to consider changes to the 4% budgetary rule of Oil Fund spending.|$|E
25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: {{to keep people}} fully employed, governments have to run deficits {{when the economy is}} slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending and/or <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
25|$|On taxation, Leahy has {{consistently}} supported progressive rates. He has rejected proposals {{to remove the}} Estate Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax, and he has spoken out strongly against <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> for the wealthy. Leahy has strongly supported the rights of employees, and has voted to increase the minimum wage and allow for more union organization. He has voted against a free trade proposal, CAFTA, but supported normalizing trade relations with China.|$|E
30|$|Compared to {{reducing}} social security payment rate, <b>cutting</b> individual income <b>tax</b> {{does not offer}} as many benefits. One reason is that <b>cutting</b> individual income <b>tax</b> does not help the {{large portion of the}} population who do not pay individual income tax anyway because their income is below the exemption threshold, while cutting social security payment rate helps low-income participants proportionately more.|$|R

25|$|In Europe, right-wing {{populism}} {{often takes}} the form of distrust of the European Union and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values. In the United States, the Tea Party movement states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes,</b> reducing government spending and balancing the budget.|$|E
25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through economic deregulation and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, who would rather see higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{has been}} the world's largest {{national}} economy in terms of GDP {{since at least the}} 1920s. For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when danger of recession appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes</b> so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the New Deal era that began in 1933, to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence the economy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} political trust, ideology, and public support for <b>tax</b> <b>cutting.</b> Conceptualizing <b>tax</b> cuts as government action under conditions of risk, I argue that political trust should increase rather than decrease public support for <b>tax</b> <b>cutting,</b> partic-ularly among those for whom endorsement of tax cuts entails ideological sacrifice. The results show that political trust increases support for a va-riety of tax cut initiatives, but only among liberals. The results further suggest that trust is an instrumental resource that can bolster support for a conservative {{as well as a}} liberal policy agenda. This bill is more than just tax relief. It is more than just preventing Washington from growing the size of government. This bill reflects a philosophy that says, we trust the American people more than we trust government –George W. Bush, June 4, 2001, Office of the Press Secretary Throughout the 2000 campaign and the early months of his presidency, George W.

In releasing the budget, Ryan stated: [...] "We have to stop spending money we don't have."

40|$|While {{there is}} a large and growing number of studies on the {{determinants}} of corporate tax rates, the literature has so far ignored the fact that the behavior of governments in setting tax rates is often best described as a discrete choice decision problem. We set up an empirical model that relates a government's decision whether to cut its corporate tax rate to the country's own inherited tax and taxes in neighboring countries. Using comprehensive data on corporate tax reforms in Europe since 1980, we find evidence suggesting that the position in terms of the tax burden imposed on corporate income relative to geographical neighbors strongly affects the probability of rate <b>cutting</b> <b>tax</b> reforms. Countries are particularly likely to cut their statutory tax rate if the inherited tax is high and if they are exposed to low-tax neighbors. [...] Tax reform,tax competition,corporate taxes...|$|R
500|$|Brownlee {{advocated}} austerity despite surpluses. [...] In November 1927, at a First Ministers' conference, {{he complained}} of increased public demand for spending {{in areas of}} provincial jurisdiction, such as education, health, and welfare. [...] In the meantime, the federal government's relatively reduced role in public spending allowed it the political credit that comes with running surpluses, reducing its debt, and <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes.</b> [...] The following year he recommended that Alberta not opt into the new federal-provincial old age pension program because he felt that Alberta's share was too onerous. [...] The legislature accepted his recommendation for one year, to give him time to persuade {{the federal government to}} take on a greater share of the cost, but opted into the program after that even though no greater commitment from the federal government was forthcoming.|$|E

Following Cuomo's 1982 New York State Governors general election victory, Eve became critical of Cuomo's supply side approach to budget balancing, and was acknowledged by Cuomo as a voice of opposition which represented interests such as public housing. [...] Eve also served as an adviser to Jesse Jackson during his 1984 presidential campaign, and after Jackson named his two delegates to the 1984 Democratic Party platform committee, he named Eve as his first alternate. [...] In 1984, Eve was among those involved in a controversy over the use of a state plane to attend a dinner for Paterson. [...] Questions arose about whether it was a community event or a political event due to the possibility that the funds raised at the dinner might be used for a Mayoral campaign. Even after Cuomo was succeeded by Pataki, Eve continued to voice opposition to any attempts to balance the state's budget by <b>cutting</b> <b>taxes.</b> In 1985, Eve sponsored legislation to provide scholarships for the underprivileged and to fund precollege enrichment programs that was described by President of the Associated Medical Schools of New York Dr. Robert Friedlander as landmark.|$|E

[...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the issue of race when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the Republican Party has [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E
