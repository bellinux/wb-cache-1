When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved <b>children</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the}} {{opportunities}} for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked {{as soon as they}} could, were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not attend school.|$|E
5|$|Goblet of Fire was {{the first}} book in the Harry Potter series to be {{released}} in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so <b>children</b> <b>did</b> {{not have to worry about}} school conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfill book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.|$|E

5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old <b>children</b> <b>did</b> so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E
5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E

25|$|However, a {{panel of}} EFSA experts noted that this review's {{conclusions}} were partially based on Internet sources and therefore were not scientifically robust. These experts also concurred with a critique that significant scientific errors {{were made in the}} critical review that led to unsubstantiated and misleading interpretations. A review of studies on <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not show any significant findings for safety concerns with regard to neuropsychiatric conditions such as panic attacks, mood changes, hallucinations or with ADHD or seizures.|$|E
25|$|Most of Smith's work is {{primarily}} concerned with children and motherly love. Many reviewers say Smith was continually trying to recreate the image of love she had desperately needed as a child. Smith preferred to use real children as opposed to child actors, because she found professional <b>children</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the same}} soul, or will to explore, as amateur child models. She would invite her friends to visit, and watch their children play, to use as her inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metal {{toxicity}} {{has been}} proposed as a hypothetical etiology of autism, and dysfunction of MT synthesis and activity {{may play a role}} in this. Many heavy metals, including mercury, lead, and arsenic have been linked to symptoms that resemble the neurological symptoms of autism. However, MT dysfunction has not specifically been linked to autistic spectrum disorders. A 2006 study, investigating children exposed to the vaccine preservative thiomersal, found that levels of MT and antibodies to MT in autistic <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not differ significantly from non-autistic children.|$|E
30|$|Frequency of the {{communicative}} {{interaction between}} parents and children was low, and there was a cycle of closed communication, as mentioned by Palacios and Sanchez-Sandoval (2005): parents do not talk because <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not ask questions and <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not ask questions because they do not feel enough communication openness on behalf of the parents.|$|R

25|$|In The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart's Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance (2012), {{a variant}} of the forbidden-toy paradigm, {{indicated}} that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance. Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy; however, in the variable group, classical music played in the background, while the children played alone. In that group, the <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that reduce cognitive dissonance.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz devoted {{considerable}} {{intellectual and}} diplomatic effort {{to what would}} now be called ecumenical endeavor, seeking to reconcile first the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches, and later the Lutheran and Reformed churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke John Frederick—both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of Brunswick remained Lutheran because the Duke's <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with the French bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|During his {{academic}} years Larramendi met a sister of his university colleague Mariano de Montiano, María de Montiano y Uriarte (1886-1976), originating from Bilbao. Daughter of a physician, descendant to a noble prestigious family {{and considered the}} most handsome girl in the city, she was also fanatically Basque. They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended to be quiet and unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls. The oldest son, Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, became known nationwide as longtime manager and the moving spirit behind MAPFRE, a corporate insurance giant; other <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not grow to prominence nationwide. Luis' grandson, Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Martínez, {{is one of the}} current Carlist leaders.|$|E

25|$|In preindustrial times, deaths {{at young}} and middle age were {{more common than}} they are today. This is not due to genetics, but because of {{environmental}} factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common for women, and many <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, we do find many examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 85 years or greater, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Cato the Elder, Thomas Hobbes, Eric of Pomerania, Christopher Polhem, and Michelangelo. This was also true for poorer people like peasants or laborers. Genealogists will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s, 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Don Javier {{suffered}} life-threatening injuries {{resulting from}} a traffic accident and formally transferred all political authority to Carlos Hugo. In 1974, upon childless death of his step-nephew Roberto Bourbon-Parma, Don Javier ascended to head of the Bourbon-Parmas and assumed the Duke of Parma title. On the one hand, he was in position to enjoy family life; though his 4 younger <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not marry, the older 2 did, the marriages producing 8 grandchildren (born between 1960 and 1974). On the other hand, family relations were increasingly subject to political tension. While Hugues, Marie-Thérèse, Cécile and Marie des Neiges formed one team advancing the progressist agenda, the oldest daughter Françoise Marie, the youngest son Sixte and their mother Madeleine opposed the bid. Sixte, in Spain known as Don Sixto, openly challenged his brother; he declared himself the standard-bearer of Traditionalism and started building own organization.|$|E
25|$|Europe's {{cultural}} makeover {{marked a}} period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose {{with the fall of}} the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of oblation, whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned <b>children</b> <b>did</b> not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning of a shift toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.|$|E
