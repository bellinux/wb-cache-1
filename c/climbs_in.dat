The roadway follows the terrain {{through a series of}} hairpin turns as it <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.|$|E
5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E
5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most difficult <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas.

5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Most {{stages of the}} race included one or more categorised <b>climbs,</b> <b>in</b> which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Fourth-category awarded 1 rider with 1 point; third-category awarded 2 riders, the first with 2 points; second-category awarded 4 riders, the first with 5 points; and first-category awarded 6 riders, the first with 10 points; and hors catégorie awarded ten riders, the first with 25 points. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 1, 11 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking {{a minute and a}} half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders in the top of the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

5|$|The 1907 Tour de France was {{the fifth}} running of the annual Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. From 8 July to 4 August, the 93 cyclists cycled 4488km (2,788mi) in {{fourteen}} stages around France. The winner, Lucien Petit-Breton, completed the race at an average speed of 28.47km/h (17.69mi/h). For the first time, <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the Western Alps {{were included in the}} Tour de France. The race was dominated at the start by Émile Georget, who won five of the first eight stages. In the ninth stage, he borrowed a bicycle from a befriended rider after his own broke. This was against the rules; initially he received only a small penalty and his main competitors left the race out of protest. Georget's penalty was then increased and Lucien Petit-Breton became the new leader. Petit-Breton won two of the remaining stages and the overall victory of the Tour.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classification, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} mountain before other cyclists. There were twelve recognised <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the race, and unlike most other races, the climbs were not separated into categories– each awarded the same points to the first four riders over its summit, on a scale of 5, 3, 2, and 1 in succession.|$|E
25|$|Most of the climbs {{are located}} in a {{relatively}} small area, causing the roads to turn constantly and often abruptly, which explains the winding and irregular trajectory of the finale. The Oude Kwaremont is the longest climb at 2.2km: an atypical hill {{because it is not}} very steep, but {{considered one of the most}} arduous <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> Flanders because of its length and cobbled surface. The steepest of all is the fully cobbled Koppenberg, 600meters in length with grueling stretches of 22% over a poorly paved narrow road.|$|E

There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey.

25|$|The Giro d'Italia {{is known}} for its steep and {{difficult}} climbs. Each race features a few stages that contain many climbs of high severity. The race traditionally passes through the Alps with some of the longest <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the Dolomites. The first Alpine pass included was the Sestriere in 1911. The Dolomites were first included in the Giro in 1937, when the race crossed over the Rolle Pass and the Passo di Costalunga. Some of the most famous mountains used in the Giro are the Passo dello Stelvio, Passo Pordoi, and the Passo di Gavia. Since 1965 the highest point in the Giro d'Italia has been dubbed the Cima Coppi in honor of the great Italian climber Fausto Coppi.|$|E
25|$|In the 2012 Tour de Suisse, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses in intermediate sprints {{and at the}} finish in mass-start stages, the leader received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered {{the most important of}} the 2012 Tour de Suisse, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey.

25|$|The twentieth stage {{featured}} several high <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the Alps, {{including the}} Passo Pordoi, also {{the sight of}} the stage's conclusion. As the race entered the Marmolada, the day's breakaway had been captured and a select group featuring the likes of Olano, Berzin, Zaina, race leader Tonkov, Ivan Gotti, and Ugrumov led the way. Zaina made the first move from the group, which managed to only drop Berzin. Zaina attacked repeatedly and was able to rider alone until the finish atop the Pordoi to gain his second stage win of the race. Behind, Gotti gave chase, finishing 47 seconds down. In a dash to the line, Bugno edged out Olano for third place and the accompanying time bonus; however Olano did establish a one-second margin between himself and Tonkov, allowing him to take the pink jersey by 46 hundredths. The penultimate stage was filled with more <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the Alps, including the Passo di Gavia and the Tonale Pass. Serious attacks by race contenders began on the penultimate climb of the Mortirolo where Zaina started attacking first. Gotti, Tonkov, and Ugrumov followed Zaina's moves, while Olano was unable to follow. By the time Olano reached the summit of the Mortirolo, he was two minutes behind the leading riders. Gotti and Tonkov eventually dropped Ugrumov and Zaina on the final climb into Aprica. Gotti won the day, while Tonkov finished three seconds later and regained the lead by over two minutes. Olano's time loss during the stage moved him into third position overall. The race's final stage resulted in a sprint finish that was won by Serguei Outschakov. Tonkov won his first Grand Tour, and was the second Russian to win the race.|$|E
