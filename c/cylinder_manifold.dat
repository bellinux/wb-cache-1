5000|$|A <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> is a {{group of}} large gas cylinders, {{commonly}} used to supply gases via a pipeline to a building such as a hospital. Cylinders are often arranged into two groups; a primary and secondary group.

50|$|A <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> is a tube which connects two {{cylinders}} {{together so}} that the contents of both can be supplied {{to one or more}} regulators.There are three commonly used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is attached to the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E

50|$|Oxygen may be {{used for}} {{patients}} requiring supplemental oxygen via mask. Usually accomplished by a large storage system of liquid oxygen at the hospital which is evaporated into a concentrated oxygen supply, pressures are usually around 345-380 kPa (50-55 psi), or in the UK and Europe, 4-5 bar. This arrangement is described as a vacuum insulated evaporator (VIE) or bulk tank. In small medical centers with a low patient capacity, oxygen is usually supplied by a manifold of multiple high-pressure cylinders. In areas where a bulk system or high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> is not suitable, oxygen may be supplied by an oxygen concentrator. However, on site production of oxygen is still a relatively new technology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We derive all {{possible}} causality conditions for conformally flat Lorentzian metrics on the two-dimensional cylinder. Let Z = S 1 × R be the two-dimensional cylinder furnished with natural global coordinates x ∼ x + 1 ∈ S 1 and y ∈ R. A non-degenerate metric g on Z with signature (−,+) makes (Z, g) a Lorentzian <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold.</b> Then also (Z,−g) is a Lorentzian <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> (see e. g [1, § 3. 4]). The Lorentzian metric can be given—with {{respect to the}} natural coordinates—as g = −Edx 2 + 2 Fdxdy + Gdy 2 with apt functions E,F,G: Z → R. Definition 1. A Lorentzian <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> (Z, g) such {{that there is a}} globally defined timelike vector field V: Z → TZ (i. e. g(V, V) < 0 on all of Z) will be called a Lorentzian cylinder spacetime. The condition in the Definition above is called time orientability and is necessary do develop causality theory on the Lorentzian spacetime (see e. g. [4]). Definition 2. A Lorentzian cylinder spacetime (Z, g) will be called conformally flat if there is a function Ψ: Z → R and constants E,F,G such that the Lorentzian metric takes the form g = e 2 Ψ(−Edx 2 + 2 Fdxdy+Gdy 2). With h: = e− 2 Ψg which is a Lorentzian metric, too, we call the spacetime (Z, h) a flat Lorentzian cylinder. As all causality conditions are conformally invariant we can perform all derivations concerning causality of a conformally flat Lorentzian metric by using the conformally transformed flat metric. A flat Lorentzian cylinder admits the following properties. Lemma 1. Let (Z, g) be a flat Lorentzian cylinder then the following conditions hold: (i) For all p, q ∈ Z there is an isometry Φ: Z → Z, Φ(p) = q such that (Φ∗g) |p = g|q. (ii) The Riemannian curvature tensor vanishes identically. (iii) (Z,−g) is a flat Lorentzian cylinder, too. Proof: (i) As the coefficients E,F,G of the metric are constant it can be easily calculated that ∂x and ∂y are Killing vector fields, i. e. L∂xg = 0 and L∂yg = 0. Moving p to q be a suitable combination of the flows of ∂x and ∂y gives the desired isometry. This is a standard result (see e. g. [2]). 1 a...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an alternative}} evaluation of quantum entanglement by measuring maximum violation of Bell's inequality without performing a partial trace operation in an $n$-qubit system by bridging maximum violation of Bell's inequality and a generalized concurrence of a pure state. We {{show that this}} proposal is realized when one subsystem only contains one qubit and a quantum state is a linear combination of two product states. We also use a toric code model with smooth and rough boundary conditions on a <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> and a disk manifold with holes {{to show that a}} choice of a generalized concurrence of a pure state depends on boundary degrees of freedom of a Hilbert space. A relation of a generalized concurrence of a pure state and maximum violation of Bell's inequality is also demonstrated in a $ 2 n$-qubit state. Finally, we apply our theoretical studies to a two-qubit system with a non-uniform magnetic field at a finite temperature as well as a Wen-Plaquette model with four and six qubits at zero temperature.

50|$|The {{fourth-generation}} engine uses {{a proprietary}} CT15B turbocharger. This generation {{was used in}} the 1997-2002 ST215 Caldina GT-T AWD Wagon. The exhaust housing is actually cast into the <b>cylinder</b> exhaust <b>manifold,</b> rather than the normal practice of a separate turbine housing after the <b>cylinder</b> exhaust <b>manifold.</b> Due to this, the CT15 is backwards compatible with the third-generation 3S-GTE cylinder head only, not either the first or second generation. Intake charge was cooled by an air-to-air top-mounted intercooler fed through a new side-feed intake manifold. This generation utilizes a coil-on-plug ignition system and 550cc injectors. Boost remains at 13-14psi, however overboost fuel cut is increased to 21psi. Compression is increased to 9:1 and produces 260PS (256 hp) and 324N·m (239 lb-ft).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{turbocharged}} diesel engine operation is analyzed {{by means of}} a second law based method.

Examples of availability balances are compared for different values of some parameters which influence the combustion and the exhaust process, or for several arrangements of the engine and turbomachine system. The availability analysis of the engine transient development will show the amounts of mechanical energy employed for both in-cylinder storage and turbocharger acceleration and of those available for conversion into external output. These amounts will be compared with the fuel availability and with those destroyed during the several processes (i. e. combustion, gas exchange, turbocharger operation) ...|$|R
5000|$|Most gases {{are sold}} in gas {{cylinders}} and some sold as liquid in appropriate containers (e.g. Dewars) or as bulk liquid delivered by truck. The industry originally supplied gases in cylinders to avoid the need for local gas generation; but for large customers such as steelworks or oil refineries, a large gas production plant may be built nearby (typically called an [...] "on-site" [...] facility) to avoid using large numbers of <b>cylinders</b> <b>manifolded</b> together. Alternatively, an industrial gas company may supply the plant and equipment to produce the gas rather than the gas itself. An industrial gas company may also offer to act as plant operator under an operations and maintenance contract for a gases facility for a customer, since it usually has the experience of running such facilities for the production or handling of gases for itself.|$|R
40|$|In a {{cryogenic}} establishment, {{helium gas}} {{is an expensive}} consumable. Conservation of helium is important not only for saving on cost, but also for ensuring supply {{at the time of}} need. During laboratory experiment, helium gas is often contaminated with air impurities (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, moisture etc.) which must be removed before the spent gas is reused for liquefaction. Therefore, a helium purifier {{is an integral part of}} any cryogenic establishment to conserve helium gas by providing grade 4. 5 helium or 99. 995 % pure helium to liquefier after separating air contaminants from impure helium. 					The helium purification is based on two principles, one is cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities, on heat exchangers at appropriate temperature and other one is cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN¬ 2 temperature and at high pressure of about 150 bar. The purifier has been designed for purifying impure helium upto 40 % of impurity by running 6 hours non-stop operation with the mass flow rate of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of impure helium to purifier at a pressure of 150 bar(a),which is ensured by a 3 -stage reciprocating compressor. In the helium purifier for cryocondensation and cryosorption process the components are moisture collector vessel, three heat exchangers, liquid air separator vessel and adsorber columns. Other major components are gas bag, compressor, LN 2 vessel and <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold.</b> Where, all cryogenic components are housed in Superinsulated LN 2 vessel. Purification of helium involved two phase, one is regeneration phase and second is purification phase. For complete removal of moisture from charcoal beds regeneration should be done before purification, by heating and evacuation with purging of pure helium to whole system. And in purification phase we have taken 95 % of pure helium and 5 % of impurity i. e. dry nitrogen contaminants. Experiment was carried out for one session and four samples are taken in sample cylinder at different interval of time. Sample analysis by Linde Multi Component Detector reveals that the total impurity, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and moisture is less than 5 ppm be volume, thus making the purified gas much better than grade 4. 5 helium...|$|E
40|$|Most helium liquefiers today {{operate on}} {{modified}} Claude cycle {{with at least}} two high speed turbo expanders. Impure gas cannot be fed to these liquefiers as air impurities solidify at low temperature, and damage the turbo expanders and choke the tubes. Therefore, a helium purifier {{is an integral part of}} any cryogenic establishment to conserve helium gas by providing Grade 4. 5 helium or 99. 995 % helium to the liquefier after separating air contaminants from impure helium. At present, research and academic centres in India, import helium purifiers which are very expensive in terms of foreign exchange. National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, has taken up a project for development of cryosorption based helium purifier funded by the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, Mumbai, which primarily aims at developing helium purifier and studying its performance. This dissertation details the design, fabrication and performance analysis of a prototype helium purifier. The purifier is based on the principle of cryocondensation of moisture and air impurities on heat exchangers at appropriate temperatures and cryosorption on activated charcoal to yield Grade 4. 5 helium from 60 % pure helium at LN 2 temperature. The purifier has been designed for 6 hours nonstop operation with throughput of 20 nm 3 /hr and delivery of pure helium at a pressure of 150 bar(a), which is ensured by a reciprocating compressor. The vital component, adsorber columns, was packed with Indian manufactured granular coconut shell activated charcoal in 50 NB Sch 80 SS 316 L pipe. Other major components include moisture collector vessel, liquid air separator vessel, three heat exchangers, snow filter, gas bag, <b>cylinder</b> <b>manifold</b> and superinsulated LN 2 vessel housing all cryogenic components of purifier. Helium gas bag, made of textile reinforced rubber has been successfully developed. All the components were fabricated, assembled and commissioned at NIT, Rourkela. Conditioning of the system was carried out by heating with six 1000 W tubular heaters, followed by evacuation. The system was back filled with Grade 4. 5 helium. Experiment was carried out for one session by feeding the purifier with 5 % dry nitrogen contaminant in helium as input gas, and four samples of purified gas were collected in sample cylinders at different intervals. Sample analysis by Linde Multi Component Detector reveals that the total impurity, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and moisture, is less than 5 ppm by volume, thus making the purified gas much better than Grade 4. 5 helium...|$|E
