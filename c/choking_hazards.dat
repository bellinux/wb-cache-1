2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, New Jersey {{residents}} Heung Ju Yi and Kyung Hee brought their 3-year-old son, Ethan, to the zoo to visit the popular [...] "Dinosaur Safari" [...] exhibit. After buying their tickets, {{each member of the}} family was given a free souvenir pressed penny as a gift promoting the exhibit. Soon afterward, Ethan swallowed the coin and began choking. His mother, Kyung, said she'd, [...] "thought he'd died." [...] Unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the coin from his throat were followed by rushing the boy to an emergency medical clinic, where X-rays showed it had entered his stomach. The next day, further X-rays revealed that the coin was not passing naturally, and surgery was required to remove it. Two days later, Ethan was put under general anesthesia, and the coin was removed via endoscopy. The surgery revealed that the zinc in the coin had reacted with his stomach acid and begun to dissolve, creating jagged edges that cut the inside of his stomach. The family, which did not have health insurance, were charged over $50,000 for this. In early 2014, the family pressed charges against the zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society for unspecified damages. They claimed the zoo endangered their son since the employee who handed them the coins handed Ethan's directly to him and gave no warning about the <b>choking</b> <b>hazards</b> of small coins.|$|E

50|$|Infants are {{introduced}} to solid foods at different ages. Breast milk alone is sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. For these very young infants water, juice, and other foods are generally unnecessary. Even when babies enjoy discovering new tastes and textures, solid foods should not replace breastfeeding, but merely complement breast milk as the infant’s main source of nutrients throughout the first year. Beyond one year, as the variety and volume of solid foods gradually increase, breast milk remains an ideal addition to the child’s diet. Parents and caregivers can reduce <b>choking</b> <b>hazards</b> in a child's environment. Special attention {{should be given to}} food and nonfood items (e.g., candy, nuts, and coins) commonly involved in choking. Younger children are particularly at risk because of their tendency to place objects in their mouths, poor chewing ability, and narrow airways compared with those of older children (1,2). Recommendations are available to guide parents and caregivers about the types of food items that are inappropriate for children aged <4 years (6,7). Removal of nonfood <b>choking</b> <b>hazards</b> also is important for infants and children aged <4 years because approximately one third of all choking episodes involve nonfood items.|$|E
50|$|Brain Licker {{is a type}} of {{confectionery}} {{manufactured by}} Key Enterprises. It is typically sold in small bottles plugged with a ball which revolves when licked, delivering its sour liquid content. It is about as acidic as lemon juice and excessive consumption can lead to burns, blisters or small cuts in children's mouths. In 2003 the British Food Standards Agency issued warnings to parents regarding this as well as possible <b>choking</b> <b>hazards.</b> There are several different flavours of Brain Licker, the most popular of which are strawberry, peach, apple, blue raspberry, grape, blackberry, lemon, watermelon and cola.|$|E
5000|$|Choking is {{the number}} one reason for accidents, but {{chemicals}} such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ and system in the human body, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic to the brains of young children. [...] In the US, the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection are responsible for screening children's products imported into the country. Just less than 10% of products screened are stopped for violations. Nearly two thirds are stopped for lead violations and 15% are stopped for <b>choking</b> <b>hazards.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of {{the more}} common {{concerns}} of child safety {{is the potential for}} electrocution or serious injury when an object, such as a key or metal paper clip, is inserted into an electrical outlet. Many childproofing devices exist that block access to the electrical outlets. These devices may be as simple as plastic units that plug into each individual socket but this type could be removed by a toddler or parents might forget to re-insert them after using the outlet. Once removed from the outlet, most plastic plug-in caps become potential <b>choking</b> <b>hazards.</b> Other devices such as sliding outlet covers replace the current outlet plate but still allow parents access to use the outlet.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} 3218 advertisements {{from the two}} parenting magazines with highest circulation in the United States. The authors compared each advertisement for a product for use by children, against all the published recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) {{on topics such as}} toy safety, helmet use, age-defined <b>choking</b> <b>hazards,</b> infant sleep safety, and others. Any advertisement with images or products which went against a published AAP recommendation was deemed as non-adherence and was categorized according to the statement it contradicted. Nearly one in six (15. 7 %) of the advertisements contained example(s) of non-adherence to AAP recommendations, with twelve categories of offense represented. Categories ranked by overall share from most to least include: non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical treatments, age-defined <b>choking</b> <b>hazards,</b> vitamins, cold medicine, formula, oral care, screen time, toy/playground safety, infant sleep, nutrition, water safety, and fall risk. Given that repeated exposure to messages in advertisements has been associated with changes in health decision-making, and parents often turn to parenting magazines for advice and ideas regarding their children, the publishers might consider screening the content in order to prevent confusing and potentially dangerous messages from being disseminated in the media...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: With 1. 9 million US {{children}} {{cared for}} in organized group child care, {{the safety of}} these children is a public health concern. In the absence of federal policy, each state has developed its own day care safety regulations. METHODS: After creating a set of 36 criteria from three sets of national guidelines, we assessed the safety regulations of 45 states. With a mailed survey of state day care regulatory personnel, we examined the processes of formulating and implementing safety policy in 47 states. RESULTS: For 24 of the 36 items, {{more than half the}} states' regulations were below the criteria or failed to mention the topic. Most notable is the inattention to playground safety, <b>choking</b> <b>hazards,</b> and firearms. CONCLUSION: The uneven quality of regulations may be a reflection of a regulatory process that is fragmented, with many different groups sharing authority and with limited involvement of injury prevention specialists...|$|E
40|$|Hazards {{occurring}} to the fallers and chokersetters (breaker-outs) within {{cable yarder}} (hauler) crews working in windthrow salvage conditions were recorded. Fallers {{were exposed to}} considerably more and potentially more serious hazards than fallers working under normal condi-tions. The most hazardous parts of the faller’s job were those of felling, clearing around the tree to be felled and clearing a path to the tree to be felled. The two most dan-gerous tree types to deal with were “hung-up ” and “rootball trees”. The choker setters were exposed to a similar number of hazards per cycle as choker setting in normal condi-tions, {{but a number of}} previously undocumented hazards were recorded. The majority of <b>choking</b> <b>hazards</b> (70 %) occurred during the “wait ” phase of choking with the most frequent hazard being “standing within one tree length of the turn ”. The information contained in this article may assist other contractors and forest companies faced with the difficult task of harvesting windthrown trees...|$|E
40|$|Background Efficient {{effective}} child {{product safety}} (PS) responses require data on hazards, injury severity and injury probability. PS responses in Australia largely rely on reports from manufacturers/retailers, other jurisdictions/regulators, or consumers. The {{extent to which}} reactive responses reflect actual child injury priorities is unknown. Aims/Objectives/Purpose This research compared PS issues for children identified using data compiled from PS regulatory data and data compiled from health data sources in Queensland, Australia. Methods PS regulatory documents describing issues affecting children in Queensland in 2008 – 2009 were compiled and analysed to identify frequent products and hazards. Three health data sources (ED, injury surveillance and hospital data) were analysed to identify frequent products and hazards. Results/Outcomes Projectile toys/squeeze toys were the priority products for PS regulators with these toys having the potential to release small parts presenting <b>choking</b> <b>hazards.</b> However, across all health datasets, falls were the most common mechanism of injury, {{and several of the}} products identified were not subject to a PS system response. While some incidents may not require a response, a manual review of injury description text identified child poisonings and burns as common mechanisms of injuries in the health data where there was substantial documentation of product-involvement, yet only 10...|$|E
