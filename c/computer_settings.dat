40|$|Abstract:- In {{order to}} prevent the computer-related health {{problems}} in computer users, OSHA has developed a computer workstation checklist. This checklist is divided into six parts, including working postures, seat, keyboard/mouse, monitor, work area, and accessories. It {{can be used to}} check the health issues of the <b>computer</b> work <b>settings.</b> The developed intelligent software in this study was based on the OSHA’s checklist. We added actual pictures to enhance readability. Besides, text modifications were made for fitting the culture in Taiwan. Finally, specific recommendations were designed to be automatically provided by interactive interface after finishing the diagnosing. This software not only helps people to check their <b>computer</b> work <b>settings</b> by themselves but also assists in improvement of the computer-related risk factors while using a computer.

The Williams tube used the {{phosphorescent}} front of a single CRT to create small spots of static electricity on a plate arranged in front of the tube. However, the stability of these dots proved difficult to maintain in the presence of external electrical signals, which were common in <b>computer</b> <b>settings.</b> The Mellon system replaced the static charges with light, which was much more resistant to external influence.|$|E

50|$|On 11 February 1991, Interflug's {{scheduled}} Berlin-Moscow {{flight was}} involved in a go-around incident at Sheremetyevo Airport. The captain of the Airbus A310 (registered D-AOAC) disagreed with the flight <b>computer</b> <b>settings</b> for the go-around, and the resultant opposite control inputs from the flight computer caused a total of four stalls, including one that pitched up the aircraft to 88 degrees (nearly vertical). The pilots eventually recovered control and landed the aircraft. Along with the crash of an Airbus A320 during a 1988 demonstration flight, this incident demonstrates the dangers resultant from flight crews inadvertently or deliberately countermanding the automatic safety protocols built into some modern jetliners.|$|E

50|$|As the Internet {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} popular medium for marketers, vendors and marketers often presume that a user will prefer certain choices, such as receiving emails in the future, having specific <b>computer</b> <b>settings,</b> or preferring that specific {{programs will be}} operational when a computer is turned on. As a result, it is sometimes necessary for a user to unclick these choices to avoid exposure to unwanted advertising, or to avoid {{a situation in which}} a different website is chosen for one's home page. In Internet marketing, unclicking is often required for a user to avoid being billed automatically for unnecessary services, sometimes part of a deceptive business practice termed negative option billing. A user's Facebook privacy settings have often been chosen in advance by Facebook Inc., which presumes that a user would like particular settings, and to un-choose these options, a user may need to unclick or opt-out of the Facebook-determined choices by finding the right menus. According to behavioral economics, computer and Internet users have a general tendency to go along with a default setting.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{finite element}} {{analyses}} are usually done {{by means of}} commercial software tools. Accuracy of analysis and computational time are two important factors in efficiency of these tools.

40|$|Twelve {{individuals}} with medically refractory partial seizures had undergone EEG-video-audio (EVA) monitoring over 1 - 15 (mean 10. 5) days. We selectively reexamined available 15 -channel EEGs (video-cassettes) totaling 461 h and containing 253 EEG focal seizures. Computer analysis (CA) of these bipolar records were performed using a mimetic method of seizure detection at 6 successive <b>computer</b> <b>settings.</b> We determined the computer parameters at which this method correctly detected a reasonably {{large percentage of}} seizures (81. 42 %) while generating an acceptable rate of false positive results (5. 38 /h). These parameters were adopted as the default setting for identifying focal EEG seizure patterns in all subsequent long-term bipolar scalp and sphenoidal recordings. Factors hindering or facilitating automatic seizure identification are discussed. It is concluded that on-line computer detection of focal EEG seizure patterns by this method offers a satisfactory alternative to and represents a distinct improvement over the extremely time consuming and fatiguing off-line fast visual review (FVR). Combining CA with seizure signaling (SS) by the patients and other observers increased the correct detections to 85. 38 %. CA is best {{used in conjunction with}} SS...|$|E
