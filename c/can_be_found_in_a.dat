5|$|Throughout {{its wide}} range, the olive baboon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of {{different}} habitats. It is usually classified as savanna-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands. The grasslands, especially those near open woodland, do make up {{a large part of}} its habitat, but the baboon also inhabits rainforests and deserts. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, both support olive baboon populations in dense tropical forests.|$|E
5|$|The top {{screen of}} the Nintendo 3DS {{displays}} hearts, an energy gauge, and an action icon. Link's life energy decreases {{when he is}} hit by an enemy and can be replenished by collecting hearts that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of ways, such as defeating enemies or breaking pots. The energy gauge governs item and ability usage, it depletes on use and replenishes over time. The action icon notifies the player of interactive objects. A map of the kingdoms is displayed on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS, showing Link's current position and marked locations. The bottom screen {{is also used to}} view and select Link's gear and items.|$|E
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach {{did not find any}} immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States where it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The Baikal seal {{is the only}} freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes {{stay as long as}} a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both fast ice and drift ice.|$|E
5|$|During 2009, Steven Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{published}} two papers that found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, Goodman and Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (the site where the original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. Among the five species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from {{the eastern edge of the}} Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar. Two specimens of M.manavi differed by 1.3% in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2.5% from M.petersoni.|$|E

5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medical book {{that dates back}} to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It {{is also found in}} heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
