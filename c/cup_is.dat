On the other hand, if {{it happened to be}} the case that there was only one coffee cup left in the world, it would be true that All coffee <b>cups</b> <b>are</b> that <b>cup,</b> so I can validly infer from All coffee <b>cups</b> <b>are</b> that <b>cup,</b> to All coffee <b>cups</b> <b>are</b> <b>cups.</b> Here descent to disjunction fails, and descent to conjunction fails, but [...] "ascent from particulars" [...] is valid.

5|$|Each of the cover, main body, {{and foot}} of the <b>cup</b> <b>is</b> made of an inner and outer plate, and the {{enamelled}} medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou. High quality courtly work like the <b>cup</b> <b>is</b> conventionally assigned to Paris {{in the absence of}} other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.|$|E
