Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a <b>chipbreaker</b> and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{presented in this paper}} is to characterize the machinability of TOOLOX 44 during cutting with PALBIT inserts with focus on how different combinations of coatings and substrates influence the machining process in aspects such as tool life, cutting forces, temperature and chip forming process. The foremost result is that TOOLOX is machinable and when the right tool is chosen high productivity can be achieved. Using the right insert, equipped with <b>chipbreaker,</b> should allow to machine this hardened steel even at higher cutting speeds than the ones used in this investigation. QC 20101109 </p...|$|E
