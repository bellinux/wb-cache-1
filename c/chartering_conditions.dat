25|$|At the groundbreaking, {{there was}} still {{argument}} over {{the eastern end of}} the canal. The directors thought that Little Falls (at the downstream end of the Patowmack Little Falls Skirting Canal) was sufficient since that literally fulfilled the <b>charter's</b> <b>condition</b> of reaching the tidewater, but people in Washington wanted it to end in Washington, connecting to the Tiber Creek and Anacostia river. For that reason, the canal originally opened from Little Falls to Seneca, and the next year, was extended down to Georgetown.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1838 a bank charter {{could be}} {{obtained}} only by a specific legislative act, but in that year New York adopted the Free Banking Act, which permitted anyone to engage in banking, upon compliance with certain <b>charter</b> <b>conditions.</b> The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature. These banks could issue bank notes against specie (gold and silver coins) and the states regulated the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. Free banking spread rapidly to other states, and from 1840 to 1863 all banking business was done by state-chartered institutions.|$|R

The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.|$|R
5000|$|The free banking {{reforms were}} seen {{as a part of}} a greater {{struggle}} for liberty and hence much was expected from them. Free banking replaced special interest legislation with a systematic [...] "rule of law," [...] in a form of highly idiosyncratic, flexible, personalized <b>charter</b> <b>conditions.</b> It was expected that the elimination of the privilege associated with the Safety Fund System 1929 would decrease legislative corruption and log rolling, the number of banks would increase and they would be more rationally located, and the end effect of more available credit would encourage commercial and manufacturing businesses.A bulk of evidence suggests that the free banking laws indeed helped the growth of the number of banks. In 1800, there were only 25 banks in the United States and this number grew to 1,364 in 1860. The bank expansion varied significantly across the states; for example New York and Pennsylvania had 4 and 2 banks in 1800, and this number grew to 299 and 80 in 1860 respectively. Although the economic development in some areas might have had some influence on the discrepancies, the difference was most likely caused by different chartered policies in each state that controlled the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. Many banks, however, failed to survive the period and provide a stable source of banking services, and a safe currency. In Minnesota, for example, between 1852 and 1854, 57 banks or eighty percent of the state's financial institutions, ceased operation.|$|R

In their opinion, these Western powers were willing to pay any price to preserve their alliance with Stalin, which they thought fundamental to defeating the Third Reich.|$|R

Discussions are similar, but regulatory responses differ. In Switzerland a <b>charter</b> clarifies the <b>conditions</b> for online {{activities of the}} public broadcaster (SRG). This paper assesses the SRG’s compliance with these requirements. It (1) develops an analytical approach for such assessment, conducts (2) a content analysis to show the structure and functioning of its websites, and (3) a link analysis to capture the intensity of electronic linking and the pattern of interconnection. The paper shows to which extent the SRG complies with regulations and raises questions of regulatory implications, e. g., whether there is need for rules clarification or regulatory intervention...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} conceptually how charter market default risk will vary with freight market <b>conditions,</b> <b>charter</b> duration, and the financial situation of the charterer. The primary contribution is the development of a mathematical framework and numerical methodology to simulate the dynamic economic value of a period charter and the related risk of default, based on a fully functional stochastic spot freight rate model, which enables us to evaluate the sign and magnitude of the risk premium attributable to default risk. The results support the assertion that the risk premium attributable to charter default risk is positive and increasing in the spot freight rate level and period charter duration. The primary application is the evaluation of the economic value and financial risk inherent in period timecharters, for instance, by lending banks and credit rating agencies.

5000|$|Louis, in {{accordance}} with the Declaration of Saint-Ouen, granted a written constitution, the Charter of 1814, which guaranteed a bicameral legislature with a hereditary/appointive Chamber of Peers and an elected Chamber of Deputies - their role was consultative (except on taxation), as only the King had the power to propose or sanction laws, and appoint or recall ministers. The franchise was limited to men with considerable property holdings, and just 1% of people could vote. Many of the legal, administrative, and economic reforms of the revolutionary period were left intact; the Napoleonic Code, which guaranteed legal equality and civil liberties, the peasants' biens nationaux, and the new system of dividing the country into départments were not undone by the new king. Relations between church and state remained regulated by the Concordat of 1801. However, {{in spite of the fact}} that the <b>Charter</b> was a <b>condition</b> of the Restoration, the preamble declared it to be a [...] "concession and grant", given [...] "by the free exercise of our royal authority".|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the charters of the Worcester diocese from its foundation in approximately 680 to the tenth century. Bishops of Worcester, men is control of one of the wealthiest sees in Anglo-Saxon England, used charters to acquire land, obtain rights and privileges for their existing estates, and manage trade within limits imposed by the king. Rights associated with bookland, land held by charter, gave bishops and their agents the ability to direct settlement and field systems in order to maximize estate productivity and encourage trade through a system of urban and rural marketing of timber, salt, surplus foodstuffs, and other commodities. To isolate these processes, I study two aspects of charters from the Worcester archive. First, charters are responses to major political developments such as Viking invasions or the transition from Hwiccian to Mercian to West Saxon rule. Second, charters are legal instruments used to exert control over local land use and market <b>conditions.</b> <b>Charters</b> read from these perspectives enrich scholarship in a number of fields including political history, geography, archaeology, and textual studies. Charters written, copied, and archived by the religious community of Worcester linked all levels of Anglo-Saxons from the bishops and kings mentioned by name in the documents to the ordinary clerics, monks, and layfolk who managed and worked the land in ways that enrich our understanding of their daily lives...|$|R
40|$|Water has a {{prominent}} place in Turkish-Islam communities. Therefore, benefactors built public fountains, pools, waterways, cisterns and faucets {{and put them into}} service of the people and animals to meet their water needs. One way of charity pertaining water is building cisterns. Cisterns were widely used in Anatolia both in the Seljuk Era and Ottoman Era. As it is known, cisterns are underground water reservoirs which are dig and surrounded with stones to accumulate rain and snow waters. el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi ibn Mustafa is one of the benefactors from Küçük Sinanperâkende Quarter of Konya and he contributed to charities by having a cistern and a fountain built on Istanbul highway in the locality named as Buzlukbaşı and by donating money for their maintenance. Neither the benefactor nor the date of construction of the cistern which is now in Buzlukbaşı locality on Konya-Akşehir highway and in Prof. Dr. Erol Güngör Park which was designed by Konya Metropolitan Municipality was known. The only thing known about it is that it was built in 19 th century. Thanks to this study, we can now know who the benefactor is and the date on which it was built, we cannot find the constructor. This study about Buzlukbaşı cistern is based on two charters of donations found in Konya Şer’iye Sicil (records in Ottoman Era). The first of these two charters is recorded on page 90 of Konya Şer’iye Sicil with number 69 and dated on 15 Recep 1225 / 16 August 1810; the second one recorded on the page 8 of Konya Şer’iye Sicil numerated as 71 dated on 5 Zilhicce 1239 / 1 August 1824. el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi ibn Mustafâ had a cistern and a stone fountain by the cistern built by the Istanbul highway-today known as Buzlukbaşı- for the benefactions of the passersby and for the maintenance and sustenance of the service of the cistern and the faucet he donated 1. 500 guruş (an Ottoman denomination) from his own property and with the contributions from some other benefactors on 16 August 1810 and later on 1 August 1824 he donated 2. 500 guruş. By donating to the cistern and fountain he had built, el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi conditioned that he would be {{the chairman of the board}} trustee as long as he lived. He also wanted that his chairmanship pass on and to be shared by his male and female descendents Besides, he appointed the lecturers from Teacher School in Küçük Sinanperâkende Quarter-which was also founded by him-as the minister of the charity he established for the cistern. Moreover, he conditioned that the money he donated for the cistern and fountain to be given to reliable guarantors and righteous and reliable people at 15 % interest and the income from this is to be spend for the maintenance of the cistern and fountain, and the charity minister to be paid 5 akçes (an Ottoman denomination) daily, and half the remaining money-after maintenance and wage expenses- to be added to the capital of the charity and the other half to be shared by his children equally. It is seen that with the second charter of charity, el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi is improving the charity he founded with the first charter of donation. Accordingly, while Hâfız Mehmed Efendi has a cistern and fountain built for the benefaction of the passerby on Istanbul highway by donating 1. 500 guruş in cash, this time he donated 2. 500 guruş. Yet, whether this amount is a 1000 addition to previously donated 1. 500 guruş or a new donation of 2. 500 guruş is not stated in the charter. Besides Mehmed Efendi’s own money, this amount also includes donations from some other benefactors. In this charter, el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi did not make crucial changes in the conditions of the previous <b>charter.</b> Accordingly, he <b>conditioned</b> that he be the chairman of the charity and the conditions not be changed as long as he lives, and his child and his descendents to have equal austerity after his death, and his son-in-law es-Seyyid Mustafâ Efendi ibn Nasûh be the minister of the charity. Besides, he also wanted the money he donated to be lend at interest at 15 %, and the money gathered every year to be spent for the maintenance of not only the cistern and the fountain he consecrated but also the fountain in Bağıkutlu village on İstanbul Highway and the fountain by the caravanserai on Akyokuş way, the minister of charity to be given five akçe daily wage, and the half of the remaining money to be added to the capital of the charity, and the other half to be shared among his children equally. There is no more information about the identity of el-Hâc Hâfız Mehmed Efendi other than stated in the charter. However, the epithet “el-Hac” indicates that he is one of the outstanding richest people in the city, and the epithets “Hafız” and “Efendi” indicates that he is one the religious scholars of his time. At that time one’s being able to go to pilgrimage for such a long time as 8 to 9 months can be taken as his having enough economic power and being rich. It is known that the title “Hafız” is given to people who memorize and keep the whole Qur’an in their memory, and the title “Efendi” is mostly used for people who have received education and civilit...|$|R
