25|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>case</b> <b>method</b> some schools use a skills-based approach in teaching business. This approach emphasizes quantitative methods, in particular operations research, management information systems, statistics, organizational behavior, modeling and simulation, and decision science. The leading institution in this method is the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. The goal is to provide students a set of tools that will prepare them to tackle and solve problems.|$|E

25|$|Some {{business}} schools structure their teaching around {{the use of}} case studies (i.e. the <b>case</b> <b>method).</b> Case studies {{have been used in}} Graduate and Undergraduate business education for nearly one hundred years. Business cases are historical descriptions of actual business situations. Typically, information is presented about a business firm's products, markets, competition, financial structure, sales volumes, management, employees and other factors influencing the firm's success. The length of a business case study may range from two or three pages to 30 pages, or more.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Preservice teachers' {{beliefs and}} values develop due to their long "apprenticeship of observation" (Lortie, 1975) and often filter their teacher {{education}} experiences (Feiman-Nemser & Buchman, 1986; Pajares, 1992). <b>Case</b> <b>methods</b> may be one curricular tool by which to instill change in preservice teachers' {{beliefs and values}}. This study investigated the effects of <b>case</b> <b>methods</b> on preservice physical education (PETE) teachers' value orientations. Ten PETE students were interviewed and completed the Value Orientation Inventory- 2 (VOI- 2) four times over one academic year. Following a baseline phase students were grouped (n= 5 per group) according to orientation priority. Intervention consisted of reading and discussing eight cases in physical education focused in one value orientation (disciplinary mastery or social responsibility). Results indicated that <b>case</b> <b>methods</b> have differential effects on PETE students' value orientations. VOI- 2 and interview group data suggested an orientation priority shift toward the case theme; individual data gives a clearer picture as {{to the effects of}} <b>case</b> <b>methods.</b> PETE students' value orientations changed {{in the direction of the}} case focus at differing rates and not all students completely shifted their value orientation toward the case theme. Inconsistencies existed between VOI- 2 and interview data for some PETE students. Student interview statements were focused more on concepts of disciplinary mastery which is likely due to prior experiences in sport and physical education...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1870s, under Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell, HLS {{introduced}} {{what has}} become the standard first-year curriculum for American law schools – including classes in contracts, property, torts, criminal law, and civil procedure. At Harvard, Langdell also developed the <b>case</b> <b>method</b> of teaching law, now the dominant pedagogical model at U.S. law schools. [...] Langdell's notion that law could be studied as a [...] "science" [...] gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the <b>case</b> <b>method</b> had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the <b>case</b> <b>method.</b> The method was facilitated by casebooks.

40|$|The <b>case</b> study <b>method</b> as {{developed}} in the West demands that students participate actively in the learning process. Our paper discusses the feasibility of this approach in the Asian context. We begin with a literature review on the <b>case</b> study <b>method,</b> as well as, on the differences between Asian and Western students. Our literature review found some {{evidence to support the}} acceptance of the <b>case</b> study <b>method</b> by Asian students. Existing research shows that there are differences between Asian and Western students. For example, Asian students are more used to teacher-centered teaching styles and preferred learning to be more structured with detailed objectives and guidelines on project assignments. Relative to the Western students, many Asian students find it difficult to openly disagree with their peers in front of their teachers. We identify five pitfalls, which we believe can prevent the <b>case</b> study <b>method</b> from working the way it is intended to in the Asian context. These pitfalls include (1) unfamiliarity of the <b>case</b> study <b>method,</b> (2) cultural barriers, (3) lack of institutional support, (4) inappropriateness of Western cases, and, (5) resistance to the <b>case</b> study <b>method.</b> We share our observations of policies and infrastructure that our university has put in place, which we believe have dealt with some of these pitfalls to some extent. In particular, our university invests heavily in faculty training and infrastructure to promote the application of the <b>case</b> study <b>method</b> in class teaching. We conclude that the benefits of <b>case</b> study <b>method</b> learning, especially in a knowledge-based economy, cannot be ignored and put aside just because there are pitfalls to prevent it from working...|$|R

Similar to real world business situations, cases include both constraints and incomplete information.

2500|$|When Harvard Business School started {{operating}} in 1908, the faculty {{realized that there}} were no textbooks suitable for a graduate program in business. Their first solution to this problem involved interviewing leading practitioners of business and writing detailed accounts of what these managers were doing, based partly on the <b>case</b> <b>method</b> already in use at Harvard Law School. Of course, the professors could not present these cases as practices to be emulated, because there were no criteria available for determining what would succeed and what would not succeed. So the professors instructed their students to read the cases and to come to class prepared to discuss the cases and to offer recommendations for appropriate courses of action.

2500|$|Dwight {{believed}} that his method {{was superior to}} the <b>case</b> <b>method</b> because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching. In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: [...] "It {{is not out of}} place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries [...] [...] [...]The Roman jurists had [...] "cases" [...] to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and [...] "burning" [...] questions of their time.
