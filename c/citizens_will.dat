5|$|The game's plot {{develops}} as {{the player}} progresses through towns and dungeons. Town <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate side-quests. Dungeons {{appear as a}} variety of areas, including caves, sewers, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Some dungeons feature puzzles and mazes, which require the player to divide the characters into multiple parties.|$|E
5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> age and eventually die.|$|E

5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E

25|$|On 23 June 2016, the British {{electorate}} {{voted to}} leave the European Union in a nationwide referendum in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. The UK sent notification of their intention {{to leave the}} EU to the European Council through Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. After notifying the European Council, the UK has two years to negotiate with other member states until it leaves, and British <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> only then cease to be citizens of the European Union. British <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> still have the right of freedom of movement until the UK formally leaves. It has since been suggested that British citizens wishing to travel to EU countries may have {{to apply for a}} visa or apply online for an American style ESTA visa waiver and pay a fee in order to enter the country of destination.|$|E
25|$|Foreigners {{participating}} in events and athletes {{included in the}} lists of FIFA, will have to obtain visas, but in a simplified manner.

25|$|Under its {{eleventh}} Five-Year plan, the Indian {{government has}} made many strides {{similar to that of}} Nepal. Article 41 of the Indian Constitution states that elderly <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> be guaranteed Social Security support for health care and welfare. A section of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, alluding to its traditional background, mandates that children support their parents if they no longer can themselves. NGOs, however, are prevalent in Indian elderly care, providing homes and volunteer care, but governmental policies and organizations are accessible.|$|E
25|$|Education is {{also another}} {{way in which}} the <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> benefit. As a country becomes richer, it is able to build more schools and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the October Revolution. A better educated public leads to a more {{efficient}} workforce, and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in industry and manufacturing. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now that they are able to trade successfully on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|At many {{external}} border crossing points, there are special lanes for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (as {{well as their}} family members) and other lanes for all travellers regardless of nationality. At some {{external border}} crossing points, {{there is a third}} type of lane for travellers who are Annex II nationals (i.e. non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who are exempt from the visa requirement). Although Andorran and San Marinese citizens are not EU or EEA citizens, they are nonetheless able to use the special lanes designated for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens. British <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> not {{be able to use the}} EU lane after Brexit as the rules stand, unless such a right are negotiated into the Brexit agreement with the EU.|$|E

25|$|VA {{disability}} {{benefits for}} PTSD have evolved over time, {{in response to}} legislation, scientific advances, political pressure, revised diagnostic classification schemes, regulatory changes, case law, and administrative decisions. Veterans advocacy organizations, researchers, clinicians, politicians, administrators, and <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> no doubt continue to influence how the United States evaluates, adjudicates, and administers the program. For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on vocational rehabilitation and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; establishing a balance between efforts to decrease claims processing time (productivity) {{with the need for}} consistency and accuracy of examination results and rating decisions (quality); and considering a veteran's quality of life as a factor in determining the disability rating.|$|E
25|$|The city {{government}} is organized under a ] form. The City Council {{is responsible for}} appointing a City Manager, who is the Chief Administrative Officer of the city. The Manager supervises the administrative affairs {{of the city and}} carries out the policies established by the City Council. As the Chief Administrative Officer, the City Manager is responsible for the organization of the administrative branch and has the power to appoint and remove administrative officers who are responsible for the operation of departments which carry out specific functions. The City Council consists of seven elected officials—a mayor and six council members. Beginning with the 2011 election, <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> vote separately for Mayor and Council. Council members will serve staggered four-year terms and the Mayor will serve a two-year term. The current mayor is former city clerk, Pauline Repp. The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's ruling in Drayton, scholars have offered a range of opinions about the case's impact and significance. Some analysts have suggested that Drayton reflects a concern {{among members of the}} Court for [...] "ensuring that individuals retain the power to stand up for their rights". However, other scholars, such as Tracey Maclin, argue that Justice Kennedy improperly assumed that <b>citizens</b> <b>will</b> always feel free to refuse consent, and that many citizens cooperate with the police because of [...] "fear of police reprisal if they don't". Criminal law scholar Janice Nadler commented that Justice Kennedy's conclusions were products of [...] "intuitive reflections on [...] own experience and about the imagined experience of other citizens". Additionally, Ric Simmons criticized the Court's ruling for failing to reflect the realities of [...] "real-life confrontations occurring on the street" [...] between citizens and law enforcement. Other scholars, such as Thomas W. Hughes and Joshua Fitch, argued that the Court's decision in Drayton would impact the balance between individual liberties and heightened national security interests {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks.|$|E
