500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trees have}} now {{grown up on}} the once bare hillside. The windows {{at the front of}} the house look over a garden where King’s sculptures sit among the eucalypts and shrubs. Inside, the house is full of books and art works: small sculptures, paintings, prints, postcards, ceramics, {{aboriginal}} artefacts and bark paintings, cover every available surface. King said: “Robin Boyd used to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> say ‘This house should look awful, but it doesn't.’” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Corrie," [...] cried Bumpus, in surprise, [...] "that's {{the very}} thing I was a-thinkin' of w'en I <b>comed</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> found Miss Alice under the tree." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most notorious}} matchups {{of the era}} took place in 1993, 1995, and 1996, in which Ohio State entered the game each year undefeated. The Buckeyes had a 9–0–1 record heading into the 1993 game and were looking to claim an {{outright}} Big Ten title against a Michigan team that had already lost four times. Michigan receiver Mercury Hayes and running backs Jon Ritchie, Che Foster, and Ed Davis each scored a touchdown as the Wolverines shocked the Buckeyes, 28–0. After the game, Cooper said: [...] "This {{is one of the}} most embarrassing games I've ever been involved with." [...] "They outplayed us on offense, on defense, and in the kicking game. If you'd told me we would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get beat 28–0, I'd have probably stayed home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that fat, tow-headed boy that used to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> eat melons and ride my pony?" [...] inquired Robert. [...] "Howard Spence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Farmer Brown's boy {{has caught}} old Mrs. Chuck, and now I wouldn't wonder {{but what he}} will <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> catch you," [...] replied Reddy, turning a somersault.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} not {{more than a quarter}} of a mile away and are {{scattering}} among the bushes. No doubt they caught sight of us as we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> think it possible we may intend to defend the defile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you defend him!" [...] cried Mr. Flint. [...] "I thought so--I thought so. I {{take off}} my hat to him, he is a cleverer man even than I. His own father, whom he has ruined, <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> defends him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't very civil to {{him that}} night, but I've always been {{on the lookout for}} him. I sent him a pass once, <b>and</b> he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> gave me as insolent a talking to as I ever had in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall see}} {{you about the}} contracts. My first {{business}} is a private matter with these gentlemen. Will you <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> breakfast with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can begin}} the day with that. Use plenty of cold water, and I reckon the towels are coarse enough. Then get your breakfast, <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> go to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|He smiled unpleasantly. [...] "It is this to me: {{that if the}} bargelli were to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{discover}} a stolen mule in my stables, {{it would be an}} ill thing for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{looking over}} some old Story Club yarns. I wanted {{something}} to cheer AND inebriate. I'd studied until {{the world seemed}} azure. So I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> dug these out of my trunk. They are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} forget her. I saw her before I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> I have {{arranged}} {{to communicate with}} her to-night. Letters are not safe in the post-bag at Blackwater Park, and I shall have two to write to-day, in your interests, which must pass through no hands but Fanny's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I see. The Utes {{had come}} upon them, {{and they knew}} that if they stopped there they would lose their scalps sooner or later, so they <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> made north for a bit to hunt and fossick about in the hills, {{and then go back}} when the Utes had quieted down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A regular Paradise!" [...] he said. [...] "When {{this war}} is over, how I would like to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> knock around for a few weeks. I reckon I could make it well worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{came up from}} New Bedford. That there lawyer, Ranson, said I {{had better}} <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> wait till I heard from him. He was going to git a boat and go after the Spitfire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think I'm a pretty forward young person to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> beg for work. I don't {{care if you}} do," [...] she went on, {{swinging}} her foot back and forth. [...] "One has to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would almost}} rather remain as we are," [...] Field said. [...] "Hitherto I have felt rather {{proud of our}} appearance. As we only got our uniforms when we <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> have always had our tents to sleep in, we looked a great deal cleaner than the average. Now we shall be {{conspicuous}} for our dirtiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Espy Ransom," [...] said Phonny. [...] "He lives {{down by the}} mill. He {{is always}} setting traps for {{squirrel}}s. I suppose that this road goes down to the mill, <b>and</b> that he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> set his trap. But it won't do to leave the squirrel here," [...] continued Phonny, looking at Wallace in a very earnest manner. [...] "It never will do in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|And I listened well, <b>and</b> then <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> made {{a splendid}} {{contract}} for a Quaker City book of 5 or 600 large pages, with illustrations, the manuscript {{to be placed}} in the publishers' hands by the middle of July. My percentage is to be a fifth more than they have ever paid any author, except Horace Greeley. Beecher will be surprised, I guess, when he hears this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Li'l ministering angel, ain't you? You think you're awful good, don't you? <b>Come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> bother me. When I ain't well. Salvation Army. You----. Aw, lemme 'lone, will you?" [...] Bill Wrenn kept on sweeping. [...] "Get out, you----." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Tom {{was equal}} to the occasion, and after the first onslaught he turned, as if {{summoning}} help from the cliff. [...] "This way!" [...] he cried. [...] "Tell the company to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> the other company can surround the swamp!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sooner we}} start the better," [...] said Dave. And {{then he added}} in a whisper to Roger and Phil: [...] "If we don't, some other {{passengers}} from the train may <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> offer him more money for his turnout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I tell you, then, I wouldn't {{be bothered}} with your business? If you must <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> jawing <b>and</b> talking, can't you have it out with Thady there?" ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{few minutes}} of watching, the duck went into the grass again, and I started to creep down the hill, keeping my eyes intently on the pond. Halfway down, another duck appeared, and I dropped flat on the {{hillside}} in plain sight. Of course the duck noticed the unusual object. There was a commotion in the grass; heads <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. The next moment, to my great astonishment, fully fifty black ducks were swimming about in the greatest uneasiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I've ever come across any case of it myself, sir," [...] {{the old lady}} replied. [...] "I was {{housekeeper}} to the Duke of Merioneth for fifty years, and where we lived we didn't hear much about London and London ways. You see, I never came to the town house. But since I retired <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> took to reading the Sunday papers, I begin to be thankful that my ways have been country ways all my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ask that, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] Susan replied wrathfully. [...] "I {{have not been}} so upset in years. That--that--that pacifist has {{actually}} had the audacity to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and,</b> in my own kitchen, {{to ask me to}} marry him. HIM!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot come down," [...] {{replied the}} chief, after Ma-istequan {{had given the}} invitation. [...] "The Eskimos are in numbers like the stars; we are few. If the pale-faces are our friends, let them <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> take us {{by the hand and}} bring us down." ...|$|E
6000|$|Neelie's {{resolution}} {{gave way}} before her mother's. She looked aside uneasily {{at the things}} in the tray. [...] "I have been vexed," [...] she said, with an effort; [...] "and I didn't want to stop in the breakfast-room. I wanted to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> to speak to you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since 1983, {{the festival}} {{has offered a}} three-week summer program of dance {{training}} for adults. (In 1996 the Young Dancers Workshop was established {{to meet the demand}} for high-quality dance training for teens ages 14-18.) Choreographer Gabe Masson who has served on the BDF faculty, attended as a student in 1983. He remembers, [...] "It was my first time out of the South. I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> spent three weeks in this place and it was amazing…For some reason it just felt safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{they are}} dupes and fools," [...] Mr. Flint {{declared}} vehemently. [...] "I don't {{know how to}} explain it to you the subject is too vast, too far-reaching. One must have had some business experience to grasp it. I don't mean to say you're not intelligent, but I'm at a loss where to begin with you. Looked at from their limited point of view, it would seem as if they had a case. I don't mean your friend, Humphrey Crewe--it's anything to get office with him. Why, he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> begged me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Leaping Horse {{will go out}} {{to scout}} {{as soon as it}} is dark,' he said. 'Go to mouth of ravine. If Utes are in wood he will see their fires and come back again. Not likely <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> again <b>and</b> find his traces.' ...|$|R
