50|$|Both Mario Andretti (gearbox) and Al Unser, Jr. (<b>CV</b> <b>joint)</b> came to {{the pits}} for long repairs. Both cars re-entered the race several laps down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steering}} 'feel' is more numbed than a RWD car. This {{is due to}} {{the extra}} weight of drive shafts and <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> components that increase unsprung weight.|$|E
5000|$|... 1987: Early {{on in the}} race, a pit fire halts his run. He {{ultimately}} {{drops out}} because a <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> fails. Later in the year, Michael wins at the Michigan 500.|$|E
5000|$|Differential: Self-Locking {{with two}} shafts fitted with <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{geometry}} and packaging constraints, the <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> (constant-velocity joints) {{attached to the}} wheel hub {{have a tendency to}} wear out much earlier than the universal joints typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with independent rear suspension also employ <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> and half-shafts). The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Differential: ZF-Abarth type {{self-locking}} {{with two}} shafts fitted with <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{differential}} bearings {{are prone}} to collapsing on early build units, resulting in the driveshaft <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> grinding the gearbox casing away, and leading to complete failure. The early signs {{of this is that}} the speedometer drive fails.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{complement}} of genuine Traxxas accessories {{will be offered}} with the Slash 4x4 including a variety of aluminum upgrade parts, a center differential, <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> half shafts, sway bars, a stronger clutch, the Mamba Monster Brushless system, and more.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem with}} this system is once the spring or the top plate becomes worn, the driver of a car with this system may hear a loud [...] "clonk" [...] like noise at full lock when the spring jumps back into place. People often confuse this with <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> knock.|$|E
50|$|January 1973: Introduction of the rod change gearbox and pot <b>joint</b> inner <b>CV</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2). Used in <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> {{and space}} vehicles. Does lubricate in vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Constant-velocity joints (AKA homokinetic or <b>CV</b> <b>joints)</b> allow a {{drive shaft}} to {{transmit}} power through a variable angle, at constant rotational speed, without an appreciable increase in friction or play. They are mainly used in {{front wheel drive}} vehicles, and many modern rear wheel drive cars with independent rear suspension typically use <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> {{at the ends of}} the rear axle halfshafts and increasingly use them on the drive shafts.|$|R
50|$|Around the 100 mi mark, several {{cars were}} {{dropping}} out of contention. Kevin Cogan blew an engine, Randy Lewis dropped out, and Michael Andretti broke a <b>CV</b> <b>joint,</b> then had a pit fire. On lap 34, Bobby Rahal, who had been running as high as second, made an unscheduled, five-minute long pit stop due to an electrical problem. After several long stops, Rahal would eventually drop out.|$|E
50|$|The LM has an {{upgraded}} gearbox with gun drilled driveshaft {{from the}} Le Mans specifications, tripod <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> and straight cut gears, although the gear ratios are {{identical to the}} standard F1, i.e. 3.23:1, 2.19:1, 1.71:1, 1.39:1, 1.16:1, 0.93:1, with a final drive of 2.37:1. The magnesium casing for the gearbox that {{first appeared in the}} second generation GTR is not in the LM.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{front-wheel drive}} cars {{typically}} combine the transmission (gearbox and differential) and front axle {{into a single}} unit called a transaxle. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles. Each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>joint</b> which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically {{as well as to}} pivot when making turns.|$|E
50|$|Under the hood, a new {{aluminum}} radiator {{had been}} installed. Underneath, wheel bearings and <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> were now {{shared with the}} Zastava 10.|$|R
5000|$|Robustness â€” due to {{geometry}} and packaging constraints, the universal joints {{attached to the}} wheel hub {{have a tendency to}} wear out much later than the <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> typically used in front-wheel-drive counterparts. The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The cardan joints {{within the}} Thompson Coupling can use roller {{bearings}} for all bearing surfaces; this reduces friction and wear {{when compared to}} the sliding joints used in Rzeppa-type <b>CV</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|A double Cardan joint {{consists}} of two universal joints mounted back to back with a center yoke; the center yoke replaces the intermediate shaft. Provided that the angle between the input shaft and center yoke {{is equal to the}} angle between the center yoke and the output shaft, the second Cardan joint will cancel the velocity errors introduced by the first Cardan joint and the aligned double Cardan joint will act as a <b>CV</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
50|$|Retirements {{may also}} occur due to {{mechanical}} problems. If a car suffers mechanical problems, it will {{pull into the}} pits and remain there {{for the rest of}} the race. The problem that caused the car to retire are shown on the standings screen. Possible causes of retirement are: Bearing, Clutch, <b>CV</b> <b>Joint,</b> Engine, Gearbox, Ignition, Stalled, Valve, Vibration, Radiator and Oil Leak. Again, this only applies to computer-controlled cars; the player-controlled car does not suffer from random failures.|$|E
50|$|The year 2000 car {{marked the}} return to inboard suspension. However, the {{mounting}} posts for the bell cranks caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate <b>cv</b> <b>joint</b> failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{relative}} movement between the wheels and the differential is achieved {{through the use}} of swinging driveshafts connected via universal joints (U joints), analogous to the constant-velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>joints</b> used in front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Front {{and rear}} {{suspension}} {{may be of}} any type or configuration. No mid-board or out-board <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> allowed. Two shocks per wheel maximum. Maximum shock diameter 2.5 inches. No bypass (internal or external) shocks.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Hill {{pushed his}} team to make {{continuous}} improvements to the basic Rzeppa constant velocity joint and was rewarded in the 1960s when much of the world's motor industry switched to front wheel drive using Birfield <b>joints,</b> the <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> now made by GKN Driveline and currently installed in {{more than one-third of}} all new cars worldwide.|$|R
50|$|As {{defending}} champion in 1984, Sneva dueled with Mears only 32 laps from the finish, but his <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> failed, enabling Mears to win. The 1985 race was {{a testament to}} Sneva's ability as he drove an ill-handling Skoal Bandit Eagle/Cosworth to second place before exiting in a crash with the lapped car of Rich Vogler. It was this series of near misses combined with second-place finishes and hard-charging qualifying and racing style that made Sneva a fan favorite at Indianapolis.|$|E
50|$|Tony Bettenhausen {{brought out}} the second caution, when he stalled in lap 45. He was towed back to the pits, and would {{continue}} {{for a time in}} the race. On lap 63, Mario Andretti and Raul Boesel suffered engine failures, and oil was reported on the track. At the same time, Pancho Carter slowed down the backstretch with a broken <b>CV</b> <b>joint.</b> In turn four, he spun due to the bad handling, and tagged the wall in turn 4. Carter was uninjured.|$|E
50|$|Although hubless {{wheels are}} {{striking}} in appearance, their numerous practical disadvantages have precluded their widespread {{use as an}} alternative to conventional wheels. They are difficult and expensive to manufacture, requiring a great deal of precision machining, and the design leaves the bearings and other mechanical parts largely exposed to the elements. The drive system is especially problematic since a conventional axle and <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> cannot be used; options include using chain or belt drive. Another solution, developed by Sbarro, is to house the entire propulsion system inside the wheel itself.|$|E
5000|$|The Viggen {{included}} a turbocharged 2.3 L engine (B235R). Initially it was rated at [...] and later at [...] on [...] of boost from its Mitsubishi TD04-HL15-5 turbocharger. The cars were {{equipped with a}} higher capacity intercooler, performance tuned ECU, flow through muffler and tip, heavy duty clutch and pressure plate, stiffened and lowered springs, firmer dampers, as well as stronger <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> and driveshafts.|$|R
50|$|Borazon has {{a number}} of uses, such as: cutting tools, dies, punches, shears, knives, saw blades, bearing rings, needles, rollers, spacers, balls, pump, {{compressor}} parts, engine & drive train components (e.g. camshafts, crankshafts, gears, valve stems, drive shafts, <b>CV</b> <b>joints,</b> piston pins, fuel injectors, turbochargers, and aerospace and land-based gas turbine parts such as vanes, blades, nozzles, and seals), surgical knives, blades, scissors, honing, superfinishing, cylinder liners, connecting rods, grinding of steel and paper mill rolls, and gears.|$|R
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine too quickly can damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, half shafts, axles, and <b>CV</b> <b>joints.</b> Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage.|$|R
50|$|As {{front wheel}} drive systems became more popular, with cars such as the BMC Mini using compact {{transverse}} engine layouts, the shortcomings of universal joints in front axles {{became more and more}} apparent. Based on a design by Alfred H. Rzeppa which was filed for patent in 1927 (a <b>CV</b> <b>joint,</b> the Tracta joint, designed by Pierre Fenaille at Jean-Albert GrÃ©goire's Tracta company was filed for patent in 1926), constant velocity joints solved many of these problems. They allowed a smooth transfer of power despite the wide range of angles through which they were bent.|$|E
5000|$|Turning circle â€” FF layouts {{almost always}} use a Transverse engine ("east-west") installation, which limits the amount {{by which the}} front wheels can turn, thus {{increasing}} the turning circle of a front-wheel-drive car compared to a rear-wheel-drive one with the same wheelbase. A notable example is the original Mini. It is widely misconceived that this limitation {{is due to a}} limit on the angle at which a <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> can be operated, but this is easily disproved by considering the turning circle of car models that use a longitudinal FF or F4 layout from Audi and (prior to 1992) Saab ...|$|E
50|$|With several contenders {{dropping}} out in quick succession, the race {{came down to}} two drivers in the final 100 miles...Rick Mears and Tom Sneva. Scott Brayton stalled on the track on the leader's lap 163, bringing out the caution. With 33 laps to go, Sneva's crew debated pitting, hoping {{to make it to}} the finish on one more stop. They planned on pitting with 30 laps to go. On lap 168, however, sparks came from the back of Sneva's car in turn 3 as the field was preparing to go back to green. Sneva immediately ducked into the pits with a broken <b>CV</b> <b>joint,</b> and he climbed from the car.|$|E
50|$|Fordâ€™s Len Bailey {{was hired}} to inspect the {{proposed}} build and engineer any changes he thought prudent to ensure the car was safe, as well as minimize problems experienced in the past. Baily changed the front suspension to Alan Mann specifications, which minimized nose dive under breaking. Zinc coated steel replaced the previous uncoated rust prone sheet metal. The vulnerable drive donuts were replaced with <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> and the leak prone rubber gas tanks were replaced with aluminum tanks. The GT40 chassis was upgraded without making any major changes.|$|R
40|$|In thi {{study the}} Swedish Occupational Fatigue INventory-Spanish version (SOFI-S) was applied {{in order to}} {{identify}} the symptoms of fatigue between Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) operators in Mexico. A total of 121 Computerized Nmeric Control (CNC) lathe operators were surveyed in a manufacturer of Constant Velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>joints</b> located in Celaya, GUanajuato in central Mexico. Typical tasks performed by operators incluaded loading, unloading and machine programming. Results show that the dimension 2 Ì† 2 lack of energy 2 Ì† 2 obtained the highest score, while 2 Ì† 2 lack of motivation 2 Ì† 2 obtained the lowes scor eof fatigue...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{front wheel}} drive systems such as those used on the CitroÃ«n Traction Avant and the front axles of Land Rover and similar four wheel drive {{vehicles}} used universal joints, where a cross-shaped metal pivot sits between two forked carriers. These are not <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> as, except for specific configurations, they result in {{a variation of the}} angular velocity. They are simple to make and can be tremendously strong and are still used to provide a flexible coupling in some propshafts, where there is not very much movement. However, they become [...] "notchy" [...] and difficult to turn when operated at extreme angles.|$|R
