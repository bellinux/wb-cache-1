30|$|After the {{successful}} implementation of VSC-HVDC transmission systems for conventional power grids, there is increasing interest toward considering the application of this technology {{in the field of}} RES for high-speed railways. A few articles have considered the use of modular multi-level converters (MMCs) for catenary voltage stabilization [7, 8, 9, 10]. Certain fundamental concepts and the framework of the VSC-based medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) RES for high-speed railways are available in [2, 11, 12, 13]. Such MVDC systems consist of several VSC-based traction substations (TSSs) along the <b>catenary</b> <b>line,</b> providing energy to the system according to the requirement of the train loads. The catenary becomes a continuous network without neutral sections. Moreover, the VSC TSSs consume electricity from the main high voltage feeders as well as from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) stations, and energy storage systems distributed along the traction line. Thereby, the whole RES becomes an MVDC grid in which each VSC-based substation contributes its share of power to the system.|$|E

For main-line railways, the power transmission is realized via pantograph-mounted sliding contacts from the overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>line.</b> This transmission system is characterized by some operational disadvantages. First, the contact system is subject to wear. Second, wear, noise emission and aerodynamic resistance of the pantograph grow with increasing speed. Consequently, the transmission system contributes substantially to the overall system life cycle cost due to contact wear. Furthermore the periphery is impacted negatively by noise emission and additional aerodynamic drag results in higher CO 2 emissions. Especially at low temperatures, icy contact wires lead to increased arcing, which has a strong influence on the wear of the system. In general the costs for operating complications are high.

In our country, the {{increase}} in the investments and interest in rail transit systems comes with a developing technology. Railway system solutions are friendship to environment and makes transportation easier for years. In this thesis, electrification systems for railways were examined and one of them rigid catenary system was modeled and made electrostatic and magneto static analysis with finite element method.   At first chapter, the history of railway electrification was explained. This term occurred at the late of 19 th century. The first electrical locomotive was made in 1837. Many countries of Europe have been met with electrification from 1923 to 1960.   At second chapter, Alternative and direct current feeding systems were explained. Feeding systems based alternative current are used commonly for long way transportation. DC feeding systems are used for short distance transportation. An example dc feeding systems’ structure was given and explained how to work and then was mentioned power regeneration how to work. Electrification classification in Europe as a table was given. Towards late of this chapter, was expressed to be used cables properties and their roles on an overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>line.</b>   In third chapter pantographs’stracture, components and specifications were explained. The pantograph is a device used in order to collect current from overhead lines. Nowadays {{the most common type of}} pantograph is named Z shaped (half pantograph). Pantograph easily can be adapted for various heights.   In the final section of third chapter trolley pole and its working were mentioned. Especially modern trolley poles are used on the roof of electrical trolleybus and nowadays have still been used.   In fourth chapter, third rail electrification method was introduced. Third rail provides electrical energy to a railway train through a continuous rigid conductor. Mostly third rail systems supply direct current electricity. Trains have equipments to provide energy named shoes that make contact with conductor rail. The structure of these shoes was shown and explained. In fifth chapter, overhead rigid conductor system was introduced. An overhead rigid conductor is formed by an aluminum alloy profile and copper wire attached it. Firstly, some terms interested in rigid catenary system were explained. Then components of this structure and advantages comparing the others electrification methods are introduced. An example used system was explained with structual specifications.   In sixth chapter, firstly finite element method and its basic approaching were explained and then femm programme used in this thesis for analysis was introduced. Theorical basics of the finite element method with formulas were expressed.   How to use Femm programme was introduced. Firstly, an example magnetic problem was modeled on the programme. Aluminum alloy and copper wire were modeled with them width length and then its electrical conductivity described measure in Megasiemens over meter. The model was scratched measure in millimeter. The cross sectional area of copper wire is 150 square millimeters. Nominal current goes from wire is 1200 ampers. Frequency O Hz was taken seeing that DC feeding was applied. Depth of the problem is 11 meters. Outside and inside of aluminum alloy includes air. Aluminum alloy and copper wire were described as a series circuit. Together with these values, magnetic analysis was made and found results from the points of current density, magnetic flux density and field intensity.   On the next section of this chapter was taken width is 3 meters, length is 4, 7 meters. Ground level was described as zero voltage. For electrostatic analysis, the boundary conditions were described with voltage information. Respectively for 750 V, 1000 V, 1500 V and 3000 V DC voltages, analyses were made and found distribution of voltage, electrical flux density and field intensity. The results of analyses were given with the graphics. In the next section, a passenger has been waited on the platform in the height of 1 meter from level of rails at the underground stations.   The height of passenger is 1, 86 meters. In this section, two different conditions were exanimated. First of them, when train has been not come to the station yet. Secondly when train came to the station. Due to simux railway simulation program, Kadıköy-Kartal line was modeled and given some information about drawn maximum and rms currents for a minute from this line. Train which includes eight rolling stocks, works at two minutes operating range.   For different parts of body, the magnetic permeability of human body was taken between 0, 99999096 and 0, 99999221 being too close to 1. Then along the all line, the locations of stations were determined. In the light of this information, the moment that train takes passengers, maximum currents drawn from line were determined. By use of this information that a passenger is exposed to how much magnetic flux density and field intensity were determined. All line is 21 kilometers and there are 16 stations on the line. As return conductor, a third rail in parallel with other two carrier rails was drawn. The passenger has been waited on the concrete platform. The carrier rails were made of steel. Third rail was made of copper and ceramic isolator was founded at its below. It was supposed that were at same values but reverses direction of drawn currents from overhead rigid conductor and return conductor. The carrier rails’ gauge is 1, 3 meters.   The biggest value of the maximum currents was measured in Cevizli station. For each station, repeatedly analyses were made and found magnetic flux density and field intensity values at head and foot regions. Currents drawn by trains change depending on geometry of the line. The reason of current drawn at values less is giving back current to mutual dc bus bar system. Also in these systems, regenerative power acquired during the breaking is transferred to line. Others trains near in the related region can use transferred back currents. For a better consideration in next section, using rms values of currents, analyses had been repeated. Firstly, for this purpose, rms values of currents in the region at a minute had been determined by the aid of simux programme. The biggest value of rms currents is in Cevizli station and then second biggest value had been seen in Ayrılıkcesme station. According to currents, exposed magnetic flux densitys’gap is between 100 and 250 T values. In the next section, according to second situation: when train came to the station, using the same current values. Analyses have been repeated. It has been researched whether was dangerous of results for human health. The properties of this model are same such as previous one. Differently this model includes a train which its made of pure iron and was modeled such as a cage which its inside was air.   Trains’ height is 3, 5 meters and its weight is 1, 5 meters. Aluminum alloy and copper wire are as a series circuit and current of this circuit changes in accordance with stations. Firstly for maximum currents and then for rms values of currents in a minute period analyses had been made. Results had given as a table.   When we evaluated these results, at the head region was the nearest part of the body to <b>catenary</b> <b>line,</b> magnetic flux density and field intensity have increased further by comparison with previous condition (no train). At foot region was the longest part of the body to rigid line, magnetic flux density and field intensity have decreased by comparison with previous condition (no train). The reason is that train makes a shielding. Iron is a powerful ferromagnetic material and because of this reason, it has been increased flux density and field intensity values for the upper part of body in the region near to <b>catenary</b> <b>line.</b>   In the next section, electrostatics analyses were made for different situations (there is train in the station and no train in the station). According to standards, for 1500 Volts nominal voltage, lowest permanent voltage is 1000 Volts, highest permanent voltage is 1800 Volts. Respectively, it was supposed to these values were on the bus bar and the return conductors’ voltages were 60 Volts for 1500 Volts on the rigid bus, 100 Volts for 1800 Volts on the rigid bus, 40 Volts for 1000 Volts on the rigid bus. In this model the return conductors’ below exists porcelain isolator. The carrier rails and waiting platform were grounded. After analyses, it was determined between head and foot, distribution of voltage, electrical flux density and field intensity values. These results were given as graphics and tables. When we have evaluated these results, if voltage increase, electrical field intensity increase, too. For 1800 Volts on the rigid bus, the highest field intensity value is near to 562, 2 V/m. In the next section, there is a train in the station and others modeling features are same as previous one. The biggest value of field intensity is 47 V/m for 1800 Volts highest permanent voltage. In seventh section, static fields had described and its properties mentioned. Natural origin and artificial fields and non-ionizing fields had mentioned. ICNIRP has published some standards about static fields. If there is a train in the station, magnetic flux density on the body is near 497 µT, if there is no train, flux density on the body is near 362 µT. These values are below of standards published by ICNIRP and Council of European Union. However, these values can be dangerous for humans who are wearing implanted ferromagnetic and electronic medical devices sensitive to magnetic fields. Especially for a better assessment of the effects of DC railway systems to human health must be done more studies. Technical personals work in railway sector should be well trained. Magnetic fields measurement and controls should be done effectively. In our world developing in same speed with technology, we should protect the public health. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The {{main objectives}} of this $10 Million dollar project were to widen (13' track centers), strengthen and lengthen the viaduct {{with a new}} cantilevered, precast, prestressed concrete deck, replace the concrete deck arches and institute electrification via <b>catenary</b> <b>lines.</b> Voltage for the 25 kV AC lines {{is provided by the}} electrical substation {{at the south end of}} the viaduct. The original iron fence was also removed, refurbished and attached to the new deck. The new deck was 8' wider, with 4' walkways on each side that eliminated the need for the jump-out platforms. The concrete roadway portal was refinished and the USCGS benchmark was replaced.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} {{modeling the}} tension distribution and geometric deformation along <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>line,</b> including touchdown effect and nonlinear drag, are developed. The motions of a <b>catenary</b> mooring <b>line</b> in the horizontal plane are studied thoroughly. Due {{to the complexity}} of the modeling equations, solution can be achieved only by iterative methods. Approximate values for recursion in the solution of the horizontal tension in the catenary are derived based on the first order approximation of the geometric properties of the line. Expressions for the nonlinear drag in the horizontal plane of the catenary are derived based on energy dissipation principles. The resulting analytical expressions serve to calculate the forces in the catenary due to drag in the horizontal plane. The nonlinear drag forces are then recast into a form suitable for mooring applications...|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 Mannheim {{adopted a}} {{prototype}} light-rail vehicle (LRV) using the MITRAC Energy Saver system from Bombardier Transportation to store mechanical braking energy with a roof-mounted supercapacitor unit. It contains several units each made of 192 capacitors with 2700 F /2.7 V interconnected in three parallel lines. This circuit {{results in a}} 518 V system with an energy content of 1.5 kWh. For acceleration when starting this [...] "on-board-system" [...] can provided the LRV with 600 kW and can drive the vehicle up to 1 km without catenary supply integrating the LRV into the urban environment by driving without <b>catenary</b> <b>lines.</b> Compared to conventional LRVs or Metro vehicles that return energy into the grid, onboard energy storage saves up to 30% and reduces peak grid demand by up to 50%.|$|R
