500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, [...] "Benedict {{was the only person}} we actually saw for [...] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John —and I think you get it as soon as they <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E

2500|$|When Nicholas {{manages to}} escape from the house, he goes to Louisa's home, where he finds Jo's {{encyclopedia}} (which Jo had brought through the mirror to show to Louisa and her brother Titus when they have to write an essay about the Roman Empire). Intrigued by colour photographs, Nicholas checks for information about the Russian Royal Family. To his horror, he reads that Nicholas II, the Tsar of Russia, and his family, had been executed. When Jo and Louisa <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Nicholas asks Jo where she got the book and demands that she tell him if the information is correct. Jo says that the book was given to her by her Dad and that the information is correct. Nicholas reveals to Jo and Louisa that he is Alexei Nikolaevich, the son of the Tsar, and that it is his family who had been executed. Sir Ivor's treachery is finally revealed. Instead of caring for Nicholas, Sir Ivor had actually brought Nicholas to New Zealand so that he could 'sell' Nicholas to the highest bidder [...] Russian Bolsheviks, who want to take Nicholas back to Russia with them so that Nicholas, the last surviving member of the Russian Royal Family, can be publicly executed.|$|E

2500|$|Further August 2007 dates were {{postponed}} for unclear reasons; Hoppus {{stated the}} band {{had decided to}} re-enter the studio in preparation of a second studio album. Hoppus and Barker spent {{the remainder of the}} year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see release via Interscope Records. According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album: [...] "As for +44, there had been months slipping by with no real work on that one aside from writing snippets here and there, although there were also reports flying about that the next tour would take in a lot more of the world including South America." [...] Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo studio album. [...] "I see him in our studio every week, and we'll be in the room of the studio he's working in, listening to stuff he's recorded, or he'll <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where I'm working and check out my songs," [...] said Hoppus. The duo continued to work together, and Hoppus noted that Barker had laid down drums on several of his tracks.|$|E
