5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> which do not grow wool at all. <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> of Caribbean origin {{have become}} an {{important}} part of the U. S. sheep industry. Their lack of wool eliminates a number of health concerns and drastically reduces the cost of production. More importantly, Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> demonstrate robust production performance even in the presence of drug-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes, a rising concern to the industry. Despite the growing importance of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> in the Americas their genetic origins have remained speculative. Prior to this report no genetic studies were able to identify a unique geographical origin of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> in the New World. Our study clarifies the African and European ancestry of Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep.</b> Whole-genome structural analysis was conducted on four established breeds of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> from the Caribbean region. Using breeds representing Africa and Europe we establish an objective measure indicating Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are derived from Iberian and West African origins. Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> result from West African introgression into established ecotypes of Iberian descent. Genotypes from 47, 750 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 290 animals were used to characterize the population structure of the St. Croix, Barbados Blackbelly, Morada Nova, and Santa Ines. Principal components, admixture, and phylogenetic analyses results correlate with historical patterns of colonization and trade. These patterns support co-migration of these sheep with humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the American <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> is diverse with likely early {{introductions}} from the Canary Islands, followed by introductions from the African and European continents. Using 14 microsatellite loci, we studied 3 American <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> (St. Croix, Barbados Blackbelly, and Gulf Coast Native), 6 European wool <b>sheep,</b> 6 African <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> and 2 Asian wool sheep populations. The genetic diversity for all populations was high (with {{the exception of the}} Barbados Blackbelly where n= 10). Phylogenetic and principal component analyses as well as genetic distance values indicated that the American <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> were more closely related to the European Merino sheep than to the West African <b>hair</b> <b>sheep.</b> Today, the main genetic influence in the 3 American populations studied is therefore of European origin...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess: (a) the genetic relationships between the Cuban Pelibuey and both the Hair-Mexican and Hair-Canarian sheep populations; and (b) the influence of African <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> {{in the formation of the}} Cuban Pelibuey breed. A total of 146 individuals of Cuban Pelibuey <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> breed were sampled and genotyped for 26 microsatellites together with 26 Hair-Mexican and 24 Hair-Canarian individuals. Additionally, the same microsatellites set was typed on 110 West African <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> and on 41 individuals belonging to the Wooled-Canarian (23) and the Wooled-Palmera (18) sheep breeds to be used as outgroup. Genetic distance, correspondence and STRUCTURE analyses pointed out that the Cuban Pelibuey has a particular genetic background. This population has relatively high levels of gene diversity (0. 685 ± 0. 006) and rarefacted allelic richness (5. 9). No signals of genetic bottleneck in the Cuban Pelibuey sheep were detected. The Hair-Canarian and the Hair-Mexican populations are closely related. This is likely to be due to a major role of the Cuban Pelibuey sheep in their formation. The influence of African <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> into the Cuban Pelibuey could be limited and recent in historical terms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The coat {{characteristic}} of yak mainta-ined in {{conditions of the}} Gdańsk zoological gar-den. The investigation concerned the analysis of chosen coat features of yak maintained in totally different environment than they naturally exists. The study {{has been carried out}} on all adult yak in-dividuals (4 females and 4 males) kept in Gdańsk zoological garden The coat samples have been ta-ken in autumn form middle of the left side of ani-mal to determine the proportion of hair fractions, length and fi bre thickness within fraction, fi bre surface features and cross section. The fractions were separated based on the length of the fi bre wi-thin sample. Proportion of fraction was calculated from the fi bre number within it. Fibre diameter of each fraction has been measured using micropro-jection method. The fraction length was determi-nated measuring fi bre bunches with accuracy to 0. 5 cm. The scales on the fi bre surface as well as shape of cross-section were observed using scan-ning microscope. Two fi bre fractions were deter-minated: <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> (25 %) and mid-type fi bres (75 %). The down fi bres has not been found. The diameter of <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> and mid-type fraction ave-raged out 58. 21 μm and 36. 52 μm respectively. The <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> thickness in males was greater than in females (P < 0. 01). Fibres belonging to mid-type fraction were characterized by clear sca-les and more regular, circular shape. In <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> disappearance of scales, medullation and eliptical cross section has been recorded. The <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> fraction was much longer than mid-type fi bres (P ≤ 0. 01). There was not statistical difference in fraction length depending on sex of animals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Blood agar is {{used for}} the {{identification}} and antibiotic susceptibility testing of many bacterial pathogens. In the developing world, microbiologists use human blood agar because of the high cost and inhospitable conditions for raising wool sheep or horses to supply blood. Many pathogens either fail to grow entirely or exhibit morphologies and hemolytic patterns on human blood agar that confound colony recognition. Furthermore, human blood can be hazardous to handle due to HIV and hepatitis [1, 2]. This study investigated whether blood from <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> a hardy, low-maintenance variety of sheep adapted for hot climates, was suitable for routine clinical microbiology studies. Methods and Findings: <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was anticoagulated by either manual defibrination or collection in human blood bank bags containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose. Trypticase soy 5 % blood agar was made from both forms of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> blood and commercial defibrinated wool sheep blood. Growth characteristics, colony morphologies, and hemolytic patterns of selected human pathogens, including several streptococcal species, were evaluated. Specialized identification tests, including CAMP test, reverse CAMP test, and satellite colony formation with Haemophilus influenzae and Abiotrophia defectiva were also performed. Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates prepared from the three blood types were compared in antibiotic susceptibility tests by disk diffusion and E-test. Conclusions: The results of all studies showed that blood agar prepared from citrated <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> blood is suitable fo...|$|R
50|$|In some regions, {{the mixed}} mass of down and <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> is removed by {{hand with a}} coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The {{collected}} fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, <b>coarse</b> guard <b>hair</b> is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, interfacings and other non-apparel uses. Animals in Iran, Afghanistan, New Zealand, and Australia are typically shorn of their fleece, resulting in a higher <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, {{it is possible to}} comb the fibers out in about a week.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: BackgroundHair sheep breeds are a new, {{cost-effective}} {{option for}} the diversification of livestock in the Midwest region of Brazil. They are grazed extensively with cattle {{as well as in}} isolation in small areas. <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> breeds are vulnerable to infestation by parasites such as the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, which causes various types of damage and can transmit diseases. MethodsIn this study, Santa Inês <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> were naturally infested in an area contaminated by infested cattle and then monitored to determine the ability of these animals to maintain the local tick population in the absence of cattle. After engorged tick females of each generation fell off, the animals were placed in another pasture and were returned only after larvae reappeared in the original pasture. ResultsTick counts were performed every ten days for three generations of sheep, and average infestations per animal of 34, 12 and 4 ticks were observed for each successive generation. These numbers suggest the acquisition of resistance; however, additional studies are needed to ensure resistance is achieved. The average length of the parasitic phase for each generation of ticks was 25 days. ConclusionWe concluded that this <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> breed, even if kept separate from cattle, is able to maintain tick populations for at least three generations, although a gradual decrease in the population levels of R. microplus over three generations was observed. We also detected two positive cases of Anaplasma spp. Therefore, it appears that the Santa Inês <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> breed contributes to the circulation of this bacterium among other ruminants. 201...|$|R
40|$|Feed efficiency, growth rates, carcass evaluation, {{cholesterol}} {{level and}} sensory evaluation were compared in six lambs {{from each of}} the following breeding groups: St. Croix (<b>hair</b> <b>sheep),</b> St. Croix×wool sheep, Callipyge wool×St. Croix, Dorper (<b>hair</b> <b>sheep)</b> ×St. Croix, Dorper×wool, Callipyge wool×wool, and wool×wool. Feeding efficiency varied from 5. 20 to 6. 87, with the highest efficiency in St. Croix lambs. Standardized daily live weight gain ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 55 kg, with the highest rate of gain in the Callipyge wool×St. Croix lambs. Weight of wholesale cuts (kg) was the highest in the Callipyge wool×wool (19. 3) and lowest in the St. Croix (15. 4). Quality grade among the seven breeding groups of lambs ranged from 5. 5 to 7. 6, with the St. Croix and St. Croix×wool lambs having the higher values. The highest value for the percent wholesale body weight was observed in the Callipyge wool×wool lambs (64. 1), while the value for St. Croix was the lowest (55. 6). Percent loin eye depth of carcass weight was the highest in the Callipyge wool×wool (4. 5) and the lowest is the St. Croix (3. 0). Cholesterol levels were the highest in the <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> and lowest in the Callipyge crosses. The overall sensory acceptance rating was the highest in the St. Croix (6. 8) and the lowest in the Callipyge wool×wool (5. 0). In conclusion, the value of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> is its overall meat quality and may be used in terminal cross breeding programs to compete with standard breed for market lamb production...|$|R
