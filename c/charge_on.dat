5|$|Many Canadian {{naval ships}} of World War II adopted an {{unofficial}} coat of arms, and Fredericton was no exception. Her badge, which was {{displayed on the}} front of the bridge, was a flying tiger dropping a depth <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> a U-boat.|$|E

50|$|Where {{commission}} is <b>charged</b> only <b>on</b> wins, the {{commission is}} often deducted from the winning payoff—a winning $25 buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance. The house edges stated in the table assume {{the commission is}} <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> all bets. They are reduced by at least a factor of two if commission is <b>charged</b> <b>on</b> winning bets only.|$|R

5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the phosphate group and a positive <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|A hollow {{conducting}} body carries all its <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> {{its outer}} surface. The field is therefore zero at all places inside the body. This is the operating {{principal of the}} Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} resonance {{structures for}} the same molecule, usually those with the fewest formal charges contribute more to the overall resonance hybrid. When formal charges are necessary, resonance structures that have negative <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> the more electronegative elements and positive <b>charges</b> <b>on</b> the less electronegative elements are favored.|$|R

5|$|Although NAD {{is written}} with a {{superscript}} plus sign {{because of the}} formal <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> a particular nitrogen atom, at physiological pH {{for the most part}} it is actually a singly charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released free of <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> 30 August 2012. The game requires players {{to use a}} knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that {{made it difficult to}} see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E

5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2016, Allardyce {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} to become {{manager of the}} England national team. He won his first and only game in <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> 4 September, as an Adam Lallana goal deep into injury-time was enough to beat Slovakia on {{the opening day of}} qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Following allegations of malpractice, Allardyce left the role by mutual consent on 27 September, having managed the team for just 67 days and one match.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare.

5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground that}} he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E

5|$|When the 13th Parachute Battalion {{advanced}} {{close enough}} to Hill 13, they carried out a bayonet <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> the summit. However, {{they arrived at the}} same time as a battalion of German reinforcements, who immediately counter-attacked, forcing the battalion back, inflicting several casualties. A follow-up attack by the Germans on the withdrawing British was stopped by an artillery barrage. During this time the 12th Parachute Battalion captured Putot-en-Auge, taking 160 prisoners and several heavy weapons.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sun rose}} on 14 September, pockets of Japanese {{soldiers}} remained scattered along {{both sides of the}} ridge. But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more <b>charge</b> <b>on</b> Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.|$|E
