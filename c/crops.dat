5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. <b>Crops</b> damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these <b>crops</b> or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root <b>crops</b> are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other <b>crops</b> may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

The system uses two methods of monitoring, which are real-time <b>crop</b> growth monitoring and <b>crop</b> growing process monitoring. Real-time <b>crop</b> growth monitoring could get the <b>crop</b> growing status for certain period by comparing the remote sensed data (NDVI, for example) of the period with the data of the period in the history (last year, mostly).
