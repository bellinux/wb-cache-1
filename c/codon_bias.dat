50|$|The second {{explanation}} for codon usage {{can be explained}} by mutational bias, a theory which posits that <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> exists because of nonrandomness in the mutational patterns. In other words, some codons can undergo more changes and therefore result in lower equilibrium frequencies, also known as “rare” codons. Different organisms also exhibit different mutational biases, and there is growing evidence that the level of genome-wide GC content is the most significant parameter in explaining <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> differences between organisms. Additional studies have demonstrated that codon biases can be statistically predicted in prokaryotes using only intergenic sequences, arguing against the idea of selective forces on coding regions and further supporting the mutation bias model. However, this model alone cannot fully explain why preferred codons are recognized by more abundant tRNAs.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} roles of {{translational}} accuracy, translational efficiency, and the Hill-Robertson effect in <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias,</b> we studied the intragenic spatial distribution of synonymous <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> in four prokaryotic (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Sulfolobus tokodaii, and Thermotoga maritima) and two eukaryotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster) genomes. We generated supersequences at each codon position across genes in a genome and computed the overall <b>bias</b> at each <b>codon</b> position. By quantitatively evaluating the trend of spatial patterns using isotonic regression, we show that in yeast and prokaryotic genomes, <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> increases along translational direction, {{which is consistent with}} purifying selection against nonsense errors. Fruit fly genes show a nearly symmetric M-shaped spatial pattern of <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias,</b> with less bias in the middle and both ends. The low <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> in the middle region is best explained by interference (the Hill-Robertson effect) between selections at different codon positions. In both yeast and fruit fly, spatial patterns of <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> are characteristically different from patterns of GC-content variations.

5000|$|... === Mutational bias versus {{selection}} === Although {{the mechanism}} of <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> selection remains controversial, possible explanations for this bias fall into two general categories. One explanation revolves around the selectionist theory, in which <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> contributes to the efficiency and/or accuracy of protein expression and therefore undergoes positive selection. The selectionist model also explains why more frequent codons are recognized by more abundant tRNA molecules, {{as well as the}} correlation between preferred codons, tRNA levels and gene copy numbers. Although {{it has been shown that}} the rate of amino acid incorporation at more frequent codons occurs at a much higher rate than that of rare codons, the speed of translation has not been shown to be directly affected and therefore the bias towards more frequent codons may not be directly advantageous. However, the increase in translation elongation speed may still be indirectly advantageous by increasing the cellular concentration of free ribosomes and potentially the rate of initiation for messenger RNAs.|$|E
50|$|Specialized <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> {{is further}} seen in some {{endogenous}} genes {{such as those}} involved in amino acid starvation. For example, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes preferentially use codons that are poorly adapted to normal tRNA abundances, but have codons that are adapted to tRNA pools under starvation conditions. Thus, codon usage can introduce an additional level of transcriptional regulation for appropriate gene expression under specific cellular conditions.|$|E
50|$|To {{reconcile}} {{the evidence from}} both mutational pressures and selection, the prevailing hypothesis for <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> {{can be explained by}} the mutation-selection-drift balance model. This hypothesis states that selection favors major codons over minor codons, but minor codons are able to persist due to mutation pressure and genetic drift. It also suggests that selection is generally weak, but that selection intensity scales to higher expression and more functional constraints of coding sequences.|$|E

However, the quantitative relationship between <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> and GC composition across species has not been reported. Results Based on an informatics method (SCUO) we developed previously using Shannon informational theory and maximum entropy theory, we investigated the quantitative relationship between <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> and GC composition. The regression based on 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes showed that in bacteria, SCUO = - 2. 06 * GC 3 + 2. 05 *(GC 3) 2 + 0. 65, r = 0. 91, and that in archaea, SCUO = - 1. 79 * GC 3 + 1. 85 *(GC 3) 2 + 0. 56, r = 0. 89. We developed an analytical model to quantify synonymous <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> by GC compositions based on SCUO. The parameters within this model were inferred by inspecting the relationship between <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> and GC composition across 70 bacterial and 16 archaeal genomes. We further simplified this relationship using only GC 3. This simple model was supported by computational simulation. Conclusions The synonymous <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> could be simply expressed as 1 + (p / 2) log 2 (p / 2) + ((1 -p) / 2) log 2 ((l-p) / 2), where p = GC 3.

All seven Epichloë species contained a peramine-coding gene cluster. Interestingly, <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> of peramine-coding genes were not affected by natural selection or mutation pressure. There were 13 codons more frequently found in Epichloë genome sequences, peramine-coding gene clusters and orthologous peramine-coding genes, all of which had a bias to end with a C nucleotide. In the seven genomes analyzed, <b>codon</b> usage was <b>biased</b> in highly expressed coding sequences (CDSs) with shorter length and higher GC content. Genes in the peramine-coding gene cluster had higher GC content at the third nucleotide position of the codon, and highly expressed genes had higher GC content at the second position. In orthologous peramine-coding CDSs, high expression level was not significantly correlated with CDS length and GC content. Analysis of selection pressure identified that the genes orthologous to peramine genes were under purifying selection.

In this study they measured the Codon Adaptation Index, which is the geometric weight of the specific codon over the whole geometric weight of the genome, and found the CAI's for every codon among separate sets of organisms, namely humans, zebrafish, mice, and chickens. The results indicated that the codons with the highest CAI's represented the preferred codon, or the codon that receives the bias, and that these were codons rich in Guanine and Cytosine. The most apparent evidence of this was in Leucine which showed that the two codons which began with Uracil represented a much smaller percentage than the codons that began with Cytosine. This and many other examples set forth in the research demonstrated a tend toward Guanine and Cytosine in the genome and that these bases were evolutionarily superior and that held constant across all genomes.|$|E

By modifying the firefly luciferase gene, Loros was able to achieve several orders more of light production in Neurospora, revolutionizing transcription measurements in N. cell cultures. Moreover, her modification to this reporter allowed the FRQ/WCC feedback loop to be monitored in real time without disturbing the overt rhythms of the system.

40|$|The nonrandom use of synonymous codons (<b>codon</b> <b>bias)</b> is a {{well-established}} phenomenon in Drosophila. Recent reports suggest that levels of <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> differ among genes that are differentially expressed between the sexes, with male-expressed genes showing less <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> than female-expressed genes. To {{examine the relationship}} between sex-biased gene expression and level of <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> on a genomic scale, we surveyed synonymous codon usage in 7276 D. melanogaster genes that were classified as male-, female-, or non-sex-biased in their expression in microarray experiments.

In contrast, female-biased genes do not differ from non-sex-biased genes in their level of <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> and show a significantly positive correlation between <b>codon</b> <b>bias</b> and degree of sex-biased expression. These observations cannot be explained by differences in chromosomal distribution, mutational processes, recombinational environment, gene length, or absolute expression level among genes of the different expression classes.

For the two eukaryotes, the distribution of effective number of codons was different in short genes (300 - 500 bp) compared with longer genes; this was not observed in E. coli. Both positive and negative correlations can be explained by translational selection. Energetically costly longer genes have higher <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> to maximize translational efficiency. Selection may also be acting {{to reduce the size of}} highly expressed proteins, and the effect is particularly pronounced in eukaryotes. The different relationships between <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> and gene length observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes may be the consequence of these different types of selection...|$|R
40|$|<b>Codon</b> usage <b>bias,</b> as a {{combined}} interplay from mutation and selection, has been intensively studied in Escherichia coli. However, codon usage analysis in an E. coli pangenome remains unexplored {{and the relative}} importance of mutation and selection acting on core genes and strain-specific genes is unknown. Here we perform comprehensive codon usage analyses based on a collection of multiple complete genome sequences of E. coli. Our results show that core genes that are present in all strains have higher <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias</b> than strain-specific genes that are unique to single strains. We further explore the forces in influencing codon usage and investigate the difference of the major force between core and strain-specific genes. Our results demonstrate that although mutation may exert genome-wide influences on codon usage acting similarly in different gene sets, selection dominates as an important force to shape <b>biased</b> <b>codon</b> usage as genes are present in an increased number of strains. Together, our results provide important insights for better understanding genome plasticity and complexity as well as evolutionary mechanisms behind <b>codon</b> usage <b>bias...</b>|$|R
