Methods: The alkaloid <b>castanospermine</b> was prepared from the seeds of Castanospermum austral consistently achieving purity. Rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation and mixed lymphocyte reactivity were done using genetically inbred strains of PVG (donor) and DA (recipient). For the mixed lymphocyte reaction stimulator cells were irradiated with 3000 rads using a linear accelerator. Cyclosporin A was administered by gavage and venous blood collected 2 h later (C 2). The blood levels of CsA (Neoral) were measured by immunoassay which consisted of a homogeneous enzyme assay (EMIT) on Cobas Mira.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>castanospermine</b> on the {{processing}} of N-linked oligosaccharides was examined in the parent mouse lymphoma cell line and in a mutant cell line that lacks glucosidase II. When the parent cell line was grown {{in the presence of}} <b>castanospermine</b> at 100 micrograms/ml, glucose-containing high-mannose oligosaccharides were obtained that were not found in the absence of inhibitor. These oligosaccharides bound tightly to concanavalin A-Sepharose and were eluted in the same position as oligosaccharides from the mutant cells grown in the absence or presence of the alkaloid. The castanospermine-induced oligosaccharides were characterized by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P- 4, by h. p. l. c. analysis, by enzymic digestions and by methylation analysis of [3 H]mannose-labelled and [3 H]galactose-labelled oligosaccharides. The major oligosaccharide released by endoglucosaminidase H in either parent or mutant cells grown in <b>castanospermine</b> was a Glc 3 Man 7 GlcNAc, with smaller amounts of Glc 3 Man 8 GlcNAc and Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc.

40|$|Introduction: In {{this study}} we aimed to {{determine}} whether <b>Castanospermine,</b> a transplant immunosuppressive agent, impaired mononuclear/endothelial cell binding and expression of their cell adhesion molecules. Methods: The binding of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was measured by a binding assay using Chromium 51 label; the membrane expression of cell adhesion molecules was measured by flow cytometry expressed as mean fluorescence intensity ratios. Results: <b>Castanospermine</b> decreased mononuclear/endothelial cell binding if and only if both cell types were treated with Castanospermine: this impairment occurred if endothelial cells were treated with a range of doses of <b>Castanospermine</b> and mononuclear cells were treated with a constant dose of <b>Castanospermine</b> (p < 0. 001 versus untreated p = 0. 978) or vice versa (p = 0. 004 versus untreated p = 0. 582). Upon human umbilical vein endothelial cells <b>Castanospermine</b> reduced the mean fluorescence intensity ratios of E-selectin (p = 0. 003), ICAM- 1 (p < 0. 001), ICAM- 2 (p = 0. 004) and PECAM- 1 (p < 0. 001) but increased it for P-selectin (p < 0. 001). Upon peripheral blood mononuclear cells <b>Castanospermine</b> reduced the mean fluorescence intensity ratios of L-selectin (P < 0. 001), LFA- 1 α (p < 0. 001), VLA- 4 (p < 0. 001), Mac- 1 (P < 0. 001) and CR 4 (p < 0. 001) but increased the mean fluorescence intensity ratios of PSGL- 1 (p < 0. 001) and PECAM- 1 (p = 0. 001). Similar changes in mean fluorescence intensity ratios were found in the subset of lymphocytes and monocytes but the reductions in LFA- 1 α and VLA- 4 on lymphocytes and Mac- 1 and CR 4 on monocytes were greater.

40|$|We used inhibitors of {{four steps}} of the {{glycosylation}} pathway to examine the contribution of carbohydrate moieties to the ligand-binding activity, cell-surface expression and apparent molecular mass of the human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor. Human melanoma IGR 39 cells, incubated for 60 h with the inhibitors tunicamycin, <b>castanospermine,</b> swainsonine or deoxymannojirimycin, under conditions where cell viability and protein synthesis were not affected, expressed VIP receptor species with different VIP-binding properties. The most pronounced effects on VIP binding were obtained with tunicamycin and deoxymannojirimycin, which respectively caused 80 % and 67 % inhibition. Treatment with either swainsonine or <b>castanospermine</b> resulted in only a 25 - 32 % decrease in VIP specific binding. Based on Scatchard analyses of data from competition experiments, the decrease in VIP-binding activity in either swainsonine- or deoxymannojirimycin-treated cells was due to a decrease in ligand affinity; the cell-surface number of VIP-binding sites remained unchanged. In contrast, tunicamycin and <b>castanospermine</b> caused decreases in the cell-surface number of functional VIP receptors without affecting affinity. Besides, the drug-treated cells produced VIP-binding proteins with different molecular masses and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivities. When compared with their counterpart synthesized in control cells, VIP-binding proteins produced by deoxymannojirimycin- or swainsonine-treated cells were smaller in size and exhibited the expected sensitivity to Endo H.

This material was analysed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P- 4 before and after treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. <b>Castanospermine</b> caused an accumulation of high-mannose oligosaccharides, by 70 - 75 % over control. The major accumulated product, which could also be labelled with [3 H]galactose and was only partially susceptible to alpha-mannosidase digestion, was identified by h. p. l. c. as a Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc. Thus the alkaloid inhibits glucosidase I in the human hepatoma cells. Analysis of total glycoproteins secreted by the cells into the medium revealed the presence of only complex oligosaccharides in both control and treated cultures, and the amount of the oligosaccharides labelled with radioactive mannose, galactose or N-acetylmannosamine, secreted by treated cells, was decreased by about 60 %. The rate of secretion of total protein labelled with [35 S]methionine and precipitated from the medium with trichloroacetic acid was inhibited by up to 40 % in the presence of <b>castanospermine.</b> Pulse-chase studies utilizing [35 S]methionine labelling were performed to study {{the effect of}} the alkaloid on secretion of individual plasma proteins.

After 28 days, the mice were euthanized, necropsied, and examined using light and electron microscopy. The high-dose swainsonine?treated mice developed neurologic disease with neuro-visceral vacuolation typical of locoweed poisoning. Castanospermine- and calystegines-treated mice were clinically normal; however, high-dose castanospermine?treated mice had thyroid, renal, hepatic, and skeletal myocyte vacuolation. Histochemically, swainsonine- and castanospermine-induced vacuoles contained mannose-rich oligosaccharides.

40|$|The general aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesise}} novel B-ring-modified analogues of <b>castanospermine</b> with the longer term view of creating selective glucosidase inhibitors. A minor aspect was to begin the synthesis of casuarine 114 from <b>castanospermine</b> 1. Various approaches were tried to introduce a leaving group at the 1 -position of <b>castanospermine</b> 1, {{with a view to}} elimination across the C 1 -C 2 bond, although without success. All B-ring-modifying studies required the synthesis of the hydroxyallyl piperidine 115. Synthesis of the TBDMS and TMS protected allylpiperidines 155 and 156 from <b>castanospermine</b> 1 was achieved in 6 steps and with 49 % and 46 % overall yields respectively. A model tetrahydroisoquinoline intermediate 116, containing the principal amine and alkene functional groups for subsequent reactions, was prepared from 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline in 51 % over 2 steps. Ring closing metathesis studies with the tetrahydroisoquinoline system allowed for formation of the benz-fused quinolizine 177 and the azepine-fused isoquinoline derivative 178. Attempts to cyclise related amide dienes using this reaction were unsuccessful. Application of the ring closing metathesis reaction to the castanospermine-derived system produced the novel trimethoxyhydroxy quinolizine 117 with a synthetically useful alkene moiety in the ring-expanded B-ring. Free-radical cyclisation of allyl o-bromoamides was first investigated with the model system to produce exclusively the 5 -exo-trig cyclised product as a mixture of diastereomers. Separation of these diastereomers and debenzoylation led to the benzfused tropane ring system 200, constituting a short and convenient approach to this ring system. Application of this reaction to the <b>castanospermine</b> derived system was carried out with both the hydroxy amide 201 and the TBDMS-protected amide 202. Cyclisation with these derivatives gave mixtures of the 5 -exo 204 and 6 -endo 205 products, with the 5 -exo favoured for 201, although at the expense of diastereoselectivity, and 6 -endo favoured for 202. Demethylation of 204 has led to isolation of a mixture of di-demethylated products, representative of a new range of poly-oxygenated tropane derivatives which could act as possible glucosidase enzyme inhibitors. Synthesis of several 1, 3 -dipoles, and their attempted subsequent intramolecular cyclisation, was undertaken on the model 1 -allyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline-based system. Isolation of several nitrones and oximes was successful but no cycloaddition could be observed. A novel pyrido-fused 1, 4 -thiazinone 243 was also prepared from the castanosperminederived carbamate 153...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{modification}} of oligosaccharide moieties of the cell surface glycoproteins modulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of several cancerous cell lines. Based on this knowledge, the anti-metastatic property of Daphne mucronata crude extract and one of its newly characterized active component, Gnidilatimonoein, were evaluated in wehi- 164 cells by measuring their adhesion to fibronectin coated plates, relative to <b>Castanospermine</b> and Tunicamycin treated cells. Twenty four hours after treatment of the cells with the plant crude extract (equivalent to 0. 54 mg of the plant leaves powder/ml), Gnidilatimonoein (0. 94 nM), <b>Castanospermine</b> (2. 6 µM) and/or Tunicamycin (2. 4 µM), their attachment to fibronectin-coated wells were depressed, by 24 %, 30 %, 26 % and 58 %, respectively.

40|$|Calnexin is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) -associated molecular chaperone proposed to promote folding and assembly of glycoproteins that traverse the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells. In {{this study we}} examined if calnexin interacts with the ER-associated luminal (VP 7) and transmembrane (NSP 4) proteins of rotavirus. Only glycosylated NSP 4 interacted with calnexin and did so in a time-dependent manner (half-life, 20 min). In vitro translation experiments programmed with gene 10 of rhesus rotavirus confirmed that calnexin recognizes only glycosylated NSP 4. <b>Castanospermine</b> (a glucosidase I and II inhibitor) experiments established that calnexin associates only with partly deglucosylated (di- or monoglucosylated) NSP 4. Furthermore, enzymatic removal of the remaining glucose residues on the N-linked glycan units was essential to disengage the NSP 4 -calnexin complex. Novel experiments with <b>castanospermine</b> revealed that glucose trimming and the calnexin-NSP 4 interaction were not critical for the assembly of infectious virus...|$|E
40|$|Human hepatic lipase (HL) is a {{glycoprotein}} {{with four}} N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. The importance of glycosylation for the secretion of catalytically active HL was studied in HepG 2 cells by using inhibitors of intracellular trafficking, N-glycosylation and oligosaccharide processing. Secretion of HL was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), monensin, brefeldin A (BFA), tunicamycin, <b>castanospermine</b> and N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, {{but not by}} 1 -deoxymannojirimycin. Secretion of alpha 1 -antitrypsin, an unrelated N-glycoprotein, was also inhibited by monensin, BFA and tunicamycin, but not by CCCP, <b>castanospermine</b> or N-methyldeoxynojirimycin. Intracellular HL activity decreased with CCCP, tunicamycin, <b>castanospermine</b> and N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, but increased with monensin and BFA. In the absence of protein synthesis de novo, HL activity secreted into the medium was 7. 8 +/- 2. 1 -fold higher (mean+/-S. D., n= 7) than the simultaneous fall in intracellular HL activity. In cells pretreated with monensin or BFA, this factor decreased to 1. 3 +/- 0. 5, indicating that the apparent increase in HL activity had already occurred within these cells. After chromatography on Sepharose-heparin, the specific triacylglycerol hydrolase activity of secreted HL was only 1. 7 +/- 0. 3 -fold {{higher than that of}} intracellular HL, indicating that the secretion-coupled increase in HL activity is only partly explained by true activation. We conclude that oligosaccharide processing by glucosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum is necessary for the transport of newly synthesized human HL, but not alpha 1 -antitrypsin, to the Golgi, where the catalytic activity of HL is unmasked...|$|E
40|$|Polyanionic {{compounds}} [i. e. pentosan polysulphate, dextran sulphate, heparin, suramin, and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) ] and <b>castanospermine</b> {{were examined}} for their inhibitory effect on {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) strains (HIV- 1 (IIIB), HIV- 1 RF, HIV- 2 ROD and HIV- 2 EHO) in two different assays (HIV cytopathicity in MT- 4 cells and HIV antigen expression in CEM cells). In the MT- 4 assay dextran sulphate and pentosan polysulphate were more active against HIV- 2 ROD, suramin was more active against HIV- 1 RF, and ATA more active against HIV- 2 EHO. Heparin was less, but <b>castanospermine</b> was more, active against the two HIV- 2 strains. In the CEM assay dextran sulphate and suramin were equally active against all HIV strains, pentosan polysulphate was more active against both HIV- 2 strains, whereas heparin was less active against HIV- 2 ROD and ATA again was more active against HIV- 2 EHO. The compounds and soluble CD 4 (sCD 4) were also tested in the HIV-induced syncytium formation assay, where chronically infected HUT- 78 cells were mixed with uninfected MOLT- 4 or CEM cells. The inhibitory effect of suramin and ATA on syncytium formation was independent of the virus strain or cell type. For dextran sulphate and pentosan polysulphate, it was dependent on virus strain, and for heparin, <b>castanospermine,</b> and sCD 4, it was dependent on both the virus strain and cell type. status: publishe...|$|E
