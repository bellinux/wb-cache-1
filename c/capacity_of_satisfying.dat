40|$|Natural {{disasters}} may be {{of significant}} impact on overhead transmission lines and cause communication outage related to pilot protection. This paper aims at reconstructing communication channels and maintaining functions of pilot-wire differential protections after the main channel fails. With the development of smart grids {{as well as new}} communication technologies, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been potential means for realizing reconstructed communication channels (RCCs) without further installation. For a reliable design, system arrangement and the communication structure were presented. Theoretical planning of sensor nodes was formulated, which enjoys advantages such as high reliability, cost optimization, and <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfying</b> the connectivity of the communication network. To meet the need of time delay, a novel routing protocol for WSNs was proposed with three stages including route establishment, route discovery and route maintenance, which ensured the directional propagation of data packets. Practical experiments and simulation results indicate that the proposed RCC scheme can satisfy time delay of protection relaying in emergency communication channel, as well as guarantee the connectivity of networks when some WSN nodes are damaged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{rigorous}} and efficient {{determination of the}} global solution of a nonconvex MINLP problem arising from product portfolio optimization introduced by Kallrath (2003) is addressed. The objective of the optimization problem {{is to determine the}} optimal number and <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> reactors <b>satisfying</b> the demand and leading to a minimal total cost. Based on the model developed by Kallrath (2003), an improved formulation is proposed, which consists of a concave objective function and linear constraints with binary and continuous variables. A variety of techniques are developed to tighten the model and accelerate the convergence to the optimal solution. A customized branch and bound approach that exploits the special math-ematical structure is proposed to solve the model to global optimality. Computational results for two case studies are presented. In both case studies, the global solutions are obtained and proved optimal very efficiently in contrast to available commercial MINLP solvers...|$|R
40|$|The wafer probing {{scheduling}} problem (WPSP) is {{a variation of}} the parallel-machine problem, which carries with the objective to minimize the total workload to enhance the utilization rate <b>of</b> machine <b>capacity.</b> However, to minimize the maximum completion time for the wafer probing {{scheduling problem}} (WPSP) is very important for equally utilizing the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> parallel-machine, while <b>satisfying</b> the requirements <b>of</b> product types, product family, sequence dependent setup time, product-type dependent processing time, due dates <b>of</b> jobs, and <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> machines. To solve such a complicated problem efficiently and effectively, we adopt the hybrid genetic algorithm approach, which generates initial population with the insertion and savings algorithms for WPSP and provide a new crossover operator to generate better solutions. Considering the disturbance of due dates of jobs in scheduling, we design a new crossover which makes each machine keep the critical sub-schedule in the generation of offspring. The performance of the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm is evaluated by two real-world problems and the solution quality of the proposed approach is analyzed under five levels of mutation rates and four levels of number of generations. Computational results reveal that the hybrid genetic algorithm can efficiently solve the considered problem and the reduction of makespan is related to the mutation rates and the number of generations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel routing {{approach}} for multichannel cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Our approach {{is based on}} probabilistically estimating the available <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> every channel over every CR-to-CR link, while taking into account primary radio (PR). Our routing design consists of two main phases. In the first phase, the source node attempts to compute the most probable path (MPP) to the destination (including the channel assignment along that path) whose bandwidth has the highest probability <b>of</b> <b>satisfying</b> a required demand D. In the second phase, we verify whether the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the MPP is indeed sufficient {{to meet the demand}} at confidence level delta. If that is not the case, we judiciously add channels to the links of the MPP such that the augmented MPP satisfies the demand D at the confidence level delta. We show through simulations that our protocol always finds the best path to the destination, achieving in some cases up to 200 % improvement in connection acceptance rate compared to the traditional Dijkstra...|$|R

40|$|Voltage sag {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} power quality problems challenging the utility industry. Voltage sags can be compensated for by voltage and power injection into the distribution system. By injecting voltage with a phase advance with respect to the sustained source-side voltage, reactive power can be utilized to help voltage restoration. Hence, the consumption of real power, from the perspective of the energy supply device, can be reduced. This energy-saving voltage injection comes at the expense of an increased voltage injection magnitude, load power swing, phase shift, and discontinuity of voltage wave-shape. For this reason, several proposed compensation strategies are examined, in terms <b>of</b> <b>satisfying</b> custom power while taking into consideration the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the energy-storage device and the voltage injection constraint of dynamic voltage restorer. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies...|$|R
