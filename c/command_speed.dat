40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) scheme for speed control of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive {{over a wide}} speed range. The speed control of IPMSM becomes a complex issue due to the nonlinear nature as well as coupling among its winding currents and the rotor speed particularly at high speeds. Therefore, in this paper a BELBIC is designed for simplicity and insensitivity to disturbances and ability to control the IPMSM in the whole speed range. The proposed BELBIC is designed based on maximum torques per ampere operation below the rated speed and the field weakening operation above the rated speed, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed BELBIC is investigated for a 40 kW IPMSM and simulated using MatLab/Simulink. The simulation results are compared to those obtained from the conventional PI controller based drive at various conditions such as: step change of <b>command</b> <b>speed</b> and load torque, the disconnection of one phase and parameter variations.
