Both use bifunctional agents, such as glutaraldehyde. For enzymologists, the use of immobilized enzymes can lead to various important lines of research. For our purposes, the following six main axes of research can be defined, all of which exploit the same techniques, and are therefore on close interdependence [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Tea, one of {{the most}} popular {{consumed}} worldwide beverages, is known to be rich in polyphenols, more particularly in catechins. An amperometric biosensor based on tyrosinase was developed in order to monitor the phenolic content in black and green teas. The enzyme was immobilised by <b>coreticulation</b> with glutaraldehyde on carbon screen-printed electrodes (CSPE). Initially, the performances of the biosensor were evaluated referring to catechol as a model substrate. This analytical tool exhibits a high sensitivity (217 nA/μM), low limit of detection (LOD) = 0. 03 μM, good intra-electrode and inter-electrode reproducibilities with RSD lower than 3 % (n = 5 injections) and RSD = 8. 14 % (n = 12 sensors) respectively. The storage stability was also studied; the biosensor retained successively 85 % and 70 % of its initial response after 34 and 53 days. Subsequently, several catechin derivatives frequently found in teas were tested and classified relatively to their sensitivities. For tea samples, the results obtained with the biosensors were compared to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. A good correlation between the two methods was obtained. The calculated recovery was between 90 % and 96 %, proving that the proposed tyrosinase biosensor can be an alternative analytical tool for global determination of catechin derivatives in tea. </p...|$|E
