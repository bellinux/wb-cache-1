40|$|In {{the design}} process of vehicles, <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> are very {{critical}} to determine the safety measures. Every motor manufacturing company has to maintain certain standards for their autos. This {{will lead to the}} design optimization of safety measures utilizing the data available from <b>crash</b> <b>tests.</b> The engineers perform various experiments to generate data from <b>crash</b> <b>testing</b> of vehicles in their manufacturing facility. With the help of simulators; they create a virtual environment to perform design changes. Hence the data obtained from the <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> is vital in design optimization of safety systems. The present study deals with the technologies involved in analyzing data obtained from these experiments to ensure the prediction of data from <b>crash</b> <b>tests</b> being accurate. Current approach compares Multiple Regression Analysis and Principal Component Analysis for the prediction of data. The present work successfully derived methods for predicting data mere accurately to help the engineers reducing their efforts in conducting real time <b>crash</b> <b>tests.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The 1960s pop group The Guess Who {{was formed}} in Manitoba, and later became the first Canadian band to have a No. 1 hit in the United States; Guess Who guitarist Randy Bachman later created Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO) with fellow Winnipeg-based {{musician}} Fred Turner. Fellow rocker Neil Young, lived {{for a time in}} Manitoba, played with Stephen Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and again in supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.

5|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{was officially}} {{launched}} on November 30, 2010 at a ceremony at the Hamtramck plant, where the first production unit for retail sale came off the assembly line. The first retail vehicle was delivered to a customer in Denville, New Jersey on December 15, 2010. GM reported it had built 12,400 Volts in total through December 2011. This includes dealers' demo vehicles in North America and Amperas in dealerships in Europe, <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> vehicles and other unavailable Volts owned by GM.|$|E
5|$|To {{help promote}} {{the song and}} album, Yankovic {{directed}} a music video that was a direct parody of the <b>Crash</b> <b>Test</b> Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented {{as if they are}} one-act plays before an audience of people. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento and Judy Tenuta.|$|E

5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt {{to the same}} test {{that led to the}} original fire, with no signs of the damage that {{is believed to have been}} the cause. The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost.|$|E
5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. <b>Crash</b> <b>test</b> results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E

25|$|A <b>crash</b> <b>test</b> dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and {{articulation of the}} human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The <b>Crash</b> <b>Test</b> Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury {{of a human being}} in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E
