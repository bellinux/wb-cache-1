A total of 249 goat <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> were systematically collected and examined for the presence of Salmonella following the standard techniques and procedures. Out of the total of 249 <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> samples, 44 (17. 7 %) were positive to Salmonella.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the major}} sources of human Salmonella infections is meat. Therefore, {{efficient}} and rapid monitoring of Salmonella in the meat production chain is necessary. Validation of alternative methods is needed {{to prove that the}} performance is equal to established methods. Very few of the published PCR methods for Salmonella have been validated in collaborative studies. This study describes a validation including comparative and collaborative trials, based on the recommendations from the Nordic organization for validation of alternative microbiological methods (NordVal) of a same-day, non-commercial real-time PCR method for detection of Salmonella in meat and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs.</b> Results The comparative trial was performed against a reference method (NMKL- 71 : 5, 1999) using artificially and naturally contaminated samples (60 minced veal and pork meat samples, 60 poultry neck-skins, and 120 pig <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs).</b> The relative accuracy was 99 %, relative detection level 100 %, relative sensitivity 103 % and relative specificity 100 %. The collaborative trial included six laboratories testing minced meat, poultry neck-skins, and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> as un-inoculated samples and samples artificially contaminated with 1 – 10 CFU/ 25 g, and 10 – 100 CFU/ 25 g. Valid results were obtained from five of the laboratories and used for the statistical analysis. Apart from one of the non-inoculated samples being false positive with PCR for one of the laboratories, no false positive or false negative results were reported. Partly based on results obtained in this study, the method has obtained NordVal approval for analysis of Salmonella in meat and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs.</b> The PCR method was transferred to a production laboratory and the performance was compared with the BAX Salmonella test on 39 pork samples artificially contaminated with Salmonella. There {{was no significant difference in}} the results obtained by the two methods. Conclusion The real-time PCR method for detection of Salmonella in meat and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> was validated in comparative and collaborative trials according to NordVal recommendations. The PCR method was found to perform well. The test is currently being implemented for screening of several hundred thousand samples per year at a number of major Danish slaughterhouses to shorten the post-slaughter storage time and facilitate the swift export of fresh meat. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{intensified}} {{control program}} for Salmonella at Danish slaughterhouses was imple-mented in May 2002 {{in order to}} identify slaughterhouses that have an increased prevalence of Salmonella in pork over a period of time. These slaughterhouses must intensify their efforts to reduce the Salmonella prevalence. The surveillance is based upon <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> samples. The results of the samples are evaluated for each slaughterhouse every month, and the evaluation is based upon results from the latest 12 months. Slaughterhouses with a Salmonella prevalence of 2. 2 % or more on individual carcasses are noted, and if a slaughterhouse is noted 4 times during a 6 months period, it is obliged to start an intensified Salmonella control program. The intensified program has so far lead to a reduction of the Salmonella prevalence in pork from 1. 7 % to 1. 4 %. Introduction In Denmark an ongoing surveillance of Salmonella in pork has been implemented since 1993. The surveillance has been optimised and extended in order to further reduce the Salmonella prevalence in pork. In 2001 the Danish pork industry made an agreement with the Danish authorities, {{that by the end of}} 2006 the Salmonella prevalence in pork must be reduced with 27 % compared to the prevalence in 2001.

40|$|Abstract Campylobacter {{excretion}} {{and diversity}} {{was investigated in}} three cohorts of 20 pigs from three different pig herds, respectively. Feces were collected from all pigs in the herd and after transport during lairage. <b>Carcass</b> <b>swab</b> samples were collected from all pigs pre- and post-chilling. All pigs (n= 60) excreted Campylobacter in the herd and in the lairage. The typical excretion levels were between log 4 /g and log 5. 5 /g feces. Pre-chilling more than 90 % of carcasses were positive for Campylobacter. Post-chilling Campylobacter was isolated from only 17. 5 % of carcasses. Excretion levels of Campylobacter did not increase during transport and lairage. Twenty C. coli serotypes and three C. jejuni serotypes were identified. Indistinguishable C. jejuni serotype 2 iso-lates were detected in pigs from one farm at all sampling occasions, indicative of carcass contam-ination. C. jejuni was isolated more often post-chilling, relative to C. coli.

A subset of 40 isolates representing 10 pigs and eight carcass samples were further genotyped by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Phenotypic diversity of C. coli isolates at the four fold minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels within the same sample was detected in 39 % (n = 192) pigs and 40. 2 % (n = 58) <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> with no significant difference between the two sources (P = 0. 721).

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study of the infection dynamics of Salmonella enterica was carried out with three Danish farrow-to-finish swine herds. To account for variations in Salmonella shedding over time, litters from each herd {{were divided into two}} cohorts. Each cohort consisted of 30 pigs, for a total of 180 pigs. Pigs were individually monitored by monthly bacteriologic and serologic examinations from weaning to slaughter. At weaning, individual sows were examined bacteriologically and serologically. At slaughter, cecal contents, ileocecal lymph nodes, and <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> samples were obtained from 131 pigs. A total of 88 pigs were found to be shedding Salmonella on one or more occasions. Only the Salmonella serotype Typhimurium was detected during the study period. At weaning, no sows or piglets were found to be shedding, but a serological reaction was detected in 11 sows. The prevalence in culture peaked in the nursery and subsequently declined to undetectable levels before slaughter. The seroprevalence peaked approximately 60 days after the peak prevalence in culture. Salmonella was detected in individual fecal samples at least once in 53 % of the pigs, and 62 % of the pigs were seropositive more than once. Only 3. 7 % of all pigs were found to be culture positive on more than one occasion. Piglets from seroreacting sows had a significantly (P = 0. 0339) lower probability of shedding in the nursery. Under the assumption that shedding lasted at least 1 or 2 weeks, the average shedding time was estimated to have been 18 or 26 days. An association between serology, on-farm bacteriology, and Salmonella prevalence in culture at slaughter was shown. Marked differences in prevalence in sera and prevalence in culture between cohorts and within herds were observed. These differences emphasize the need for caution when using point estimates in on-farm interventions and surveillance in subclinically infected swine herds...|$|E

The serotypes of the isolated strains were determined, and the antibiotic resistance of these strains to six antibiotics was also investigated. Feeds were found to be more contaminated than expected (10. 2 %, 34 of 332 samples). The percentage of positive fecal samples for pregnant sows (8. 1 %, 11 of 135 samples) was significantly higher than that for young and lactating sows (2. 9 %, 11 of 378 samples) (P< 0. 05). The percentage of positive samples for colon contents collected at the slaughterhouse (47. 3 %, 88 of 186 samples) was significantly higher than that for feces collected during the fattening stage (5. 6 %, 18 of 320 samples) (P< 0. 001). For <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> samples, the observed prevalence was 11. 2 % (17 of 152 samples). On farms, Salmonella recovery levels were higher for overshoe samples than for fecal samples, except for pregnant sows. Salmonella Typhimurium was the most frequently isolated serotype (32. 2 %, 55 of 171 samples), while Salmonella Brandenburg was predominant in the colon contents collected at the abattoir (21. 4 %, 18 of 84 samples). Feeds harbored a wide diversity of serotypes of minor epidemiological significance. Of 55 isolated strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, 11 (20 %) were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, choramphenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprim, and nalidixic acid (R Type TeAmCSNa), while 12 (21. 8 %) were resistant to all of these antibiotics except nalidixic acid (R Type TeAmCS). The majority of Salmonella Typhimurium strains that exhibited resistance to more than four antimicrobial agents were characterized as Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 or as being closely related to Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 (7 of 12 isolates).

A total of 235 samples were collected from cecal contents, carcass and environment sample (slaughter house worker’s hand, knife and carcass wash water) as 93, 93 and 49, respectively through the months of January and April. E. coli O 157 :H 7 was identified by the method slightly modified to ISO 16654 : 2001. The samples were initially enriched in modified trypticase broth containing novobiocin supplement, followed by plating onto sorbitol MacConkey agar. Consequently, the suspected non-sorbitol fermenting (NSF) colonies were confirmed as E. coli biochemically using indole test and selected for serotyping. Out of 235 samples collected, the overall prevalence of 2. 55 % (comprising of 2. 15 %, 3. 22 % and 2. 04 of cecal contents, <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> and environmental samples respectively) had positive results for Dryspot E. coli O 157 latex test kit (Oxoid, DR 120 M).

We collected 216 samples from 72 pig farms (floor swab, drinking and waste water), 545 samples from 49 slaughterhouses (<b>carcass</b> <b>swab,</b> lymph node, rectal feces, floor swab and washing water) and 514 samples from 220 pork retailed shops at informal markets (pork cuts, ground pork and cutting board swab) in Hung Yen and Nghe An provinces in the north and central of Vietnam. These 1275 samples were analyzed to detect qualitatively and quantitatively for Salmonella and E. coli. Chemical hazards (antibiotic, growth promoters, and heavy metal residues) in 190 pork samples from informal markets were also analyzed. Pork consumption behavior and cross-contamination modalities during pork preparation were assessed. Findings and interpretations: Overall prevalence of Salmonella combined from all types of above mentioned samples at pig farms, slaughterhouses and pork shops were 35 %, 30 % and 37 %, respectively. Salmonella contamination in the final product (pork at market) was 45 % and an average concentration of 9 MPN/g was recorded. E. coli average loads along different points of the chain were 5. 3 ± 1. 4 (farm floor swabs), 2. 9 ± 0. 9 (carcass swabs), 3. 1 ± 1. 0 (slaughterhouse floor swabs), and 3. 3 ± 1. 1 (market shop cutting board swabs) logCFU/cm 2, whereas pork from market had 3. 4 ± 0. 9 logCFU/g. Demonstrated high levels of Salmonella in the final product (pork at market) induces the potential health risks for the consumers. High values for E. coli indicates general poor hygiene along the chain. 50 % and 16. 7 % pooled samples were positive with sulfamethazine and chloramphenicol, with average residue levels of 156 µg/kg and 0. 54 µg/kg, respectively. A quantitative risk model is being developed and integrates information on contamination along the pork value chain to characterize the health risk caused by Salmonella. Appropriate hygiene practices and management are required to achieve better pork quality and reduce the risk for the consumers...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the occurrence, distribution and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella serovars in slaughter beef cattle, slaughterhouse environment and personnel engaged in flaying and evisceration during slaughtering process. A total of 800 samples (each sample type, n = 100) consisting of swabs from hides, slaughterhouse personnel hands at flaying and evisceration, rumen and caecal contents, mesenteric lymph nodes, carcasses and holding pens were collected. Of the total 100 beef cattle examined, 14 % were Salmonella positive in caecal content and/or mesenteric lymph nodes. Of the various samples analysed, Salmonella was detected in 31 % of hides, 19 % of rumen contents, 8 % of mesenteric lymph nodes, 6 % of caecal contents, 2 % of <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs,</b> 9 % of palm swabs taken {{from the hands of}} personnel in the slaughterhouse during flaying (7 %) and evisceration (2 %), and in 12 % of holding pen swabs. The Salmonella isolates (n = 87) belonged to eight different serovars of which S. Anatum (n = 54) and S. Newport (19) were the major serovars and both serovars were detected in all sample sources except in <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs.</b> Eighteen of the 87 (20. 7 %) Salmonella serovars consisting of Newport (n = 14), Anatum (n = 3) and Eastbourne (n = 1) were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Among the antimicrobial resistant Salmonella serovars, S. Newport was multidrug resistant (15. 6 %) and exhibited resistance to streptomycin, sulphisoxazole and tetracycline...|$|R

40|$|At the European {{level the}} control of {{foodborne}} diseases {{is defined by the}} new zoonoses legislation (Directive 20031991 EC and Regulation (EC) No 2160 / 2003), which points out the necessity to establish surveillance programmes for zoonotic agents in animal populations. Recently Commission Decision 2006 / 6681 EC concerning a baseline study on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs has been published. Many different strategies have been developed and applied by EU Member States in order to Implement momtoring and/or control programmes for Salmonella in pigs; these strategies are mamly based on bacteriological analysis (performed on caecal content, ileo caecal lymph nodes or <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> collected at slaughterhouse) and/or on serological analysis (mainly performed on meat juice obtained from diaphragm muscle) ...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyMichael W. SandersonShiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), {{of which}} enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are a {{pathogenic}} sub-group, are foodborne pathogens of significant public health {{importance in the}} United States. STEC belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae commonly found in the large intestine of humans and other warm-blooded animals. EHEC harbors shiga toxin (stx 1 and/or stx 2) and eae genes which confers the ability to cause human illnesses. The U. S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service declared seven STEC (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 121, O 145, and O 157) as adulterants in ground beef and non-intact beef products to reduce/eliminate {{the burden of the}} pathogens in the beef production chain. STEC control efforts in the U. S. include the development of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to identify mitigation strategies that are effective and economical in reducing exposure and reduce occurrence and public health risk from STEC in the beef chain. Collection of accurate and unbiased data is critical {{for the development of a}} QMRA that is valid for decision making. Determining the prevalence and concentration of the seven STEC in the different cattle types and seasons is valuable for the development a valid QMRA for STEC in beef production in the U. S. Our systematic review and meta-analysis study of the prevalence and concentration of E. coli O 157 along the beef production chain indicated differences in the fecal prevalence of E. coli O 157 among cattle types and seasons, revealed decreasing prevalence and concentration of E. coli O 157 on cattle hides and carcass surfaces from pre-evisceration to the final chilled carcass stage, and identified study setting, detection method, hide or <b>carcass</b> <b>swab</b> area, and study design as significant sources of heterogeneity among studies reporting prevalence of E. coli O 157 along the beef production chain. Bayesian estimation of the diagnostic performance of three laboratory methods (culture, conventional PCR [cPCR], and multiplex quantitative PCR [mqPCR]) used for the detection of the seven STEC in the feces of cattle is necessary to estimate true prevalence of EHEC in cattle. The analysis revealed highest sensitivity of mqPCR, followed by cPCR, and culture for the detection of E. coli O 157; the cPCR and mqPCR had comparable specificity, but specificity of mqPCR method was heavily dependent on prior specification. The mqPCR method was the most sensitive for the detection O 26, O 45, and O 103 serogroups. The cPCR method was more sensitive than the culture method for serogroups O 26, and O 121, but comparable for serogroups O 45, O 103, O 111, and O 145. The cPCR method showed higher specificity than mqPCR within serogroups O 45, O 121, and O 145 but no apparent differences within serogroups O 26, O 103, and O 111. A second order quantitative microbial risk assessment was developed to quantify the prevalence and concentration of the seven STEC on pre-evisceration beef carcasses and evaluate the impact of peri-harvest interventions. Simulation scenarios of current industry peri-harvest intervention practices showed variable effectiveness in reducing STEC contamination on pre-evisceration beef carcass, however, a scenario of increased adoption of peri-harvest interventions was more effective at reducing STEC contamination. Fecal-to-hide transfer and hide-to-carcass transfer had a large effect on prevalence and concentration of STEC on pre-evisceration carcasses...|$|E
40|$|Background: Toxigenic E. coli is an {{important}} cause of gastroenteritis in developing countries. In Ethiopia, gastroenteritis due to foodborne disease is {{a leading cause of}} death. Yet, there is no surveillance for E. coli O 157 and {{little is known about the}} carriage of this pathogen in Ethiopia’s livestock. Also, antimicrobial resistance patterns are not well known in this part of the world. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 to determine the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of E. coli O 157 in goat meat, caecal content, and environmental samples collected at a large abattoir in the Somali region of Ethiopia. The samples were enriched in modified tryptone broth containing novobiocin, and plated onto sorbitol MacConkey agar. Isolates were confirmed using indole test and latex agglutination. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the disc diffusion method. Results: A total of 235 samples, including 93 goat <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs,</b> 93 caecal contents, 14 water, 20 hand and 15 knife swabs were collected. Overall, six (2. 5 %) samples were contaminated with E. coli O 157 of which two (2. 1 %) were isolated from caecal contents, three (3. 2 %) from <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> and one (7. 1 %) from water. All isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics. Two isolates (33. 3 %) were resistant to over five antimicrobials tested. Abattoir facilities and slaughter technique were conducive to carcass contamination. Conclusions: This study highlights how poor hygiene and slaughter practice can result in contaminated meat, which is especially risky in Ethiopia because of the common practice of eating raw meat. The presence of multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli O 157 in goats in a remote pastoralist system may be due to natural resistance and/or transfer of resistance from humans...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} adding organic acids to the drinking water of finishing pigs 2 weeks prior to slaughter on the shedding and prevalence rate of Salmonella at slaughter. Approximately 600 animals from four Belgian pig herds infected with Salmonella were included. At two herds, the study was conducted twice. Before the start of the study, overshoes were taken at the different herds. Two weeks prior to the expected slaughter date, the pigs were randomly divided into two groups (treatment and control group) each containing on average 50 animals within each herd. The treatment group received from this day onwards acidified drinking water (pH = 3. 6 - 4. 0), the control group received non-treated water (pH = 7. 8 - 8. 5). All other housing, feeding and management factors were identical in both groups. At the slaughterhouse, 10 pigs of each group (20 pigs for each group of study group 6) were randomly selected and sampled (blood, contents of ileum and rectum, mesenteric lymph nodes and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs).</b> All samples were immediately transported to the laboratory and submitted to Salmonella isolation. Salmonella was isolated out of 11. 9 % (66 / 554) of the samples taken at the slaughterhouse, with the highest frequency found in the content of the ileum (18. 7 %), followed by 17. 8 % in the lymph nodes, 7. 2 % in the content of the rectum and 3. 6 % in the <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs.</b> The results did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} treatment and control groups for the different slaughterhouse samples. The study documented that the investigated control strategy namely, the strategic application of organic acids during the last 2 weeks prior to slaughter was insufficient to decrease Salmonella shedding and contamination shortly before and during slaughter...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a duplex real-time PCR assay {{for the detection}} of vtl and vt 2 genes in ovine <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs,</b> ovine fleece, bovine hide swabs and bovine faecal samples, using TaqMan probes. Sample matrices were spiked with a cocktail of VTEC (E. coli 0157, 026, 0111, 0103 and 0145) and enriched for 6 h in mTSB. The resultant DNA was extracted and real-time PCR performed using specific primer/TaqMan probe sets for vti and vt 2 genes. Detection was achieved for both low level (approximately 10 cfu/sample) and high level (approximately 10, 000 cfu/sample) in all four matrices tested. This study also presents data on the carriage and transfer of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) 0157, 026, 0111, 0103 and 0145 from faeces and hide/fleece to dressed carcasses of Irish cattle and sheep as well as establishing the virulence potential of VTEC carried by these animals. Individual animals were tracked and faecal samples, hidelfleece and <b>carcass</b> <b>swabs</b> were analysed for verocytotoxin (vtl and vt 2) genes using a duplex real-time PCR assay. Positive samples were screened for the five serogroups of interest by real-time PCR. Isolates were recovered from PCR positive samples using immunomagnetic separation and confirmed by latex agglutination and PCR. Isolates were subject to a virulence screen (vti, vt 2, eaeA and hlyA) by PCR. VTEC isolates were examined by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). This study shows that while VTEC 0157 are being carried by cattle and sheep presented for slaughter in Ireland, a number of other verocytotoxin producing strains (particularly E. coli 026) are beginning to emerge and confirms that that emerging VTEC serogroups should be monitored throughout the food chain.
