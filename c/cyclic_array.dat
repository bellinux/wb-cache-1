The 1969-1970 Woodward-Hoffmann general formulation is seen to be equivalent to the Zimmerman Möbius-Hückel concept. Thus each (4r)a component provides one plus-minus overlap in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>array</b> (i.e. an odd number) for 4n electrons.

The microchannel chip consists of an array of 32 addressable channels etched in silicon that is then bonded to borofloat glass. The channels are addressable through individual ports to permit multiplexing of individual bead arrays.

The array structure of the sequences is introduced, and various implications between these balance properties and the array structure are proved. Specifically, we prove that if a q-ary sequence of period qn- 1 is difference-balanced and has the “cyclic” array structure then it is two-tuple-balanced.

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{properties of}} a closed and symmetric <b>cyclic</b> <b>array</b> of N coupled microring resonators (coupled-microring resonator regular N-gon) {{are for the}} first time determined analytically by applying the transfer matrix approach and Floquet theorem for periodic propagation in cylindrically symmetric structures. By solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem with the field amplitudes in the rings as eigenvectors, it is shown that, for even or odd N, this photonic molecule possesses 1 + N/ 2 or 1 + N resonant frequencies, respectively. The condition for resonances is found to be identical to the familiar dispersion equation of the infinite coupled-microring resonator waveguide with a discrete wave vector. This result reveals the so far latent connection between the two optical structures and is based on the fact that, for a regular polygon, the field transfer matrix over two successive rings is independent of the polygon vertex angle. The properties of the resonant modes are discussed in detail using the illustration of Brillouin band diagrams. Finally, the practical application of a channel-dropping filter based on polygons with an even number of rings is also analyzed. (C) 2007 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Innovative {{techniques}} {{for improving the}} quality indices of engineering devices or systems (e. g. self-checking codes) based on the combinatorial configurations, namely the concept of Ideal Ring Bundles (IRBs), is given. There are one- and multidimensional IRBs. One-dimensional IRBs form perfect partitions of a finite interval [1,S] of integers. The sums of connected sub-sequences of an IRB enumerate the set of integers [1,S] exactly R-times. Example 1 : The IRB { 1, 2, 4 } containing three elements allows an enumeration of all numbers 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 4, 5 = 4 + 1, 6 = 2 + 4, 7 = 1 + 2 + 4 exactly once. Multidimensional IRBs form perfect tD vectors, t � 2. The modular sums of connected tD vectors of an tD IRB enumerate the set of tD <b>cyclic</b> <b>array</b> nodes exactly R times. This property makes IRBs useful in applications which need to partition set with the smallest possible number of intersections. The favourable qualities of the combinatorial structures provide many opportunities to apply them to numerous branches of sciences and advanced engineering. Remarkable property of one- and multidimensional IRBs has been embedded in structural relationships of circular symmetry and asymmetry as being basic law of while-world harmony...|$|E
40|$|Properties of {{a series}} of acetylene-linked perylene bisimide (PBI) macrocycles with {{different}} ring size composed of three to six PBI dyes were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy in a condensed phase. it was demonstrated that the structures of PBI <b>cyclic</b> <b>arrays</b> (CNs, N = 3, 4, 5, and 6) become distorted with increasing the ring size through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (PM 6 -DH 2 method) and AFM height images of CNs on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. The MD simulations showed that only C 5 and C 6 rings are highly flexible molecules whose planarization goes along with a significant energetic penalty. Accordingly, both molecules did not show ordered adlayers on a HOPG surface. In contrast, C 3 and C 4 are far more rigid molecules leading to well-ordered hexagonal (C 3) and rectangular (C 4) 20 lattices. At the single-molecule level, we showed that the fluorescence properties of single CNs are affected by the structural changes. The fluorescence lifetimes of CNs became shorter and their distributions became broader due to the structural distortions with increasing the ring size. Furthermore, the CNs of smaller ring size exhibit a higher photostability and an efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) due to the more well-defined and planar structures compared to the larger CNs. Consequently, these observations provide evidence that not only PBI macrocycles are promising candidates for artificial light-harvesting systems, but also the photophysical properties of CNs are strongly related to the structural rigidity of CNs...|$|R
40|$|This review {{covers the}} {{application}} of halogen bonds to transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes. The introduction provides {{a brief description of}} biological and synthetic transport systems. Emphasis is on examples that explore interactions beyond the coordination with lone pairs or hydrogen bonds for the recognition of cations and anions, particularly cation-π and anion-π interactions, and on structural motifs that are relevant for transport studies with halogen bonds. Section 2 summarizes the use of macrocyclic scaffolds to achieve transport with halogen bonds, focusing on <b>cyclic</b> <b>arrays</b> of halogen-bond donors of different strengths on top of calixarene scaffolds. This section also introduces methods to study anion binding in solution and anion transport in fluorogenic vesicles. In Sect. 3, transport studies with monomeric halogen bond-donors are summarized. This includes the smallest possible organic anion transporter, trifluoroiodomethane, a gas that can be bubbled through a suspension of vesicles to turn on transport. Anion transport with a gas nicely illustrates the power of halogen bonds for anion transport. Like hydrogen bonds, they are directional and strong, but compared to hydrogen-bond donors, halogen-bond donors are more lipophilic. Section 3 also offers a concise introduction to the measurement of ion selectivity in fluorogenic vesicles and conductance experiments in planar bilayer membranes. Section 4 introduces the formal unrolling of cyclic scaffolds into linear scaffolds that can span lipid bilayers. As privileged transmembrane scaffolds, the importance of hydrophobically matching fluorescent p-oligophenyl rods is fully confirmed. The first formal synthetic ion channel that operates by cooperative multiion hopping along transmembrane halogen-bonding cascades is described.
