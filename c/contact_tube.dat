The effect of nano-modified coatings and welding process parameters on wear of <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> for non-copper coated solid wires was reviewed. It {{was found that the}} wear of <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> can be reduced due to the formation of tribo-films on the rubbing surfaces of welding wires against contact tube; it is feasible to decrease <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> wear when non-copper coated solid wires are coated with nano-modified lubricants, thereby displaying excellent lubricating and thermal or electrical conduction characteristics.

40|$|The rate {{of heating}} and the maximum {{temperature}} reached by the <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> during gas-metal-arc welding (GMAW) is quantified. We studied the effect {{of changes in the}} contact-tube-to-work distance (CTWD), voltage, welding wire feed speed, gas-flow rate, composition of the shielding gas, welding speed, and radiation shielding of the <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> on the final temperature. Also, models were developed that simulate the heating curve of the contact. We found that the major sources of heating were resistance (from the voltage drop between the <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> and electrode) and radiation (from the arc), with the major heat loss occurring through conduction to the gun body. The contact tubes often reached 300 °C with the air-cooled gun that we used for our tests, and the temperatures reached a plateau in about 50 s. To lengthen contact-tube life, the tube temperature can be minimized by increasing the CTWD, decreasing the current, or decreasing the arc length...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} different submerged arc welding processes, that is ones using singlewire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes, applied to welding of two webs consisting of L sections 16 x 90 x 4100 mm in size. Experimental welding, measurement of welding parameters, calculation of the melting rate, measurement and calculation of shielding flux consumption, a visual examination of the welds made, an analysis of macro sections, and an economic calculation of the respective {{total cost of the}} welding processes using single-wire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes were performed {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the processes concerned. The experimental results obtained showed that high quality welded joints could be produced using two wires or three wires, i. e. the twin- or triple-wire electrode, in a joint <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> in submerged arc welding. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness of welding, including personnel, materials, overheads and other costs, showed that welding with the twin-wire electrode cuts the costs by 20 % and welding with the triple-wire electrode by around 30 %. Submerged arc welding with a triple-wire electrode is a new welding process variant suitable for thick and long workpieces and in cases where a larger quantity of the molten filler material is required. Three wires in a joint <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> can be arranged in a line or in the shape of a triangle optionally with long sides depending on the shape of the joint assembly and the weld shape desired.

An experimental study involving 15 operators (enough to reach statistical significance) has been carried out with the purpose to estimate the arc efficiency from a specific procedure for calorimetric experiments. The measurement procedure consists of three manual operations which introduces operator bias in the measurement process.

40|$|This paper aims at the {{development}} of an advanced control technology for pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of titanium or other materials which require a highly stable metal transfer process. It is known that conventional pulsed GMAW achieves stable and repeatable spray transfer by using correct pulse parameters. Because the optimal pulse parameters depend on welding parameters such as wire feed speed, arc length, <b>contact</b> <b>tube</b> to work distance, etc., technologies are needed to improve the robustness of the transfer process with respective to the variations in welding parameters. To resolve this problem, active control technology has been proposed to ensure a specific type of desirable repeatable metal transfer modes, i. e., one drop per pulse (ODPP) mode. It uses a peak current lower than the transition current and takes advantage of the downward momentum of the oscillating droplet to enhance the detachment. Such a peak current will not detach the droplet unless it grows to a very lar [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{modeling}} of carbon nanotube-metal contacts is important from both basic and applied view points. For many applications, {{it is important}} to design contacts such that the transmission is dictated by intrinsic properties of the nanotube rather than by details of the contact. In this paper, we calculate the electron transmission probability from a nanotube to a free electron metal, which is side-contacted. If the metal-nanotube interface is sufficiently ordered, we find that k-vector conservation {{plays an important role in}} determining the coupling, with the physics depending on the area of <b>contact,</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and chirality. The main results of this paper are: (i) conductance scales with contact length, a phenomena that has been observed in experiments and (ii) in the case of uniform coupling between metal and nanotube, the threshold value of the metal Fermi wave vector (below which coupling is insignificant) depends on chirality. Disorder and small phase coherence length relax the need for k-vector conservation, thereby making the coupling stronger. ...|$|E

The magnitude of it decreased in proportion to the time elapsed, and the freshest bait evoked the most active biting. 5) Depending on the results obtained, it was concluded that in line fishing bait must be sewed carefully to the hook and should be exchanged as often as possible. ...|$|R

40|$|Electronic Chip cooling {{has become}} an {{important}} issue with the ever increasing transistor densities and computing power demands. One of the crucial components of the thermal management system is high-performance thermal interface materials (TIMs), the materials connecting various solid-solid interfaces in packaged electronic devices. Ideal TIMs have the characteristics of high mechanical compliance and high intrinsic thermal conductivity. Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotube (CNT) arrays are promising for advanced TIMs since they possesses both characters yet poor contact to the target surface can limit the overall performance. Recently, indium-assisted bonding {{has been found to}} enhance the contact conductance by a factor of 10, which inspires a comprehensive study of the CNT-array thermal transport properties. This thesis presents a systematic study on the thermal transport and mechanical properties of CNT arrays. The CNT array density and length are controlled via the thermal annealing duration and ethylene exposure duration in water-assisted chemical vapor deposition synthesis. The thermal transport properties are measured accurately by phase-sensitive photo thermal reflectance thermometry. The thermal contact conductance between CNT array and Glass increased close to linearly by increasing the volume fraction of the CNT array. The increase of volume fraction can potentially increase the number of <b>contacting</b> <b>tubes</b> which further enhance the contact area. In addition, the effective thermal conductivity increases monotonically with the increase of volume fraction of the CNT array. Quantitatively, it has been found that the increasing trend of thermal conductivity is larger than the increasing trend of volume fraction. The strain and buckling behavior of CNT arrays under compressive stress were systematically studied. It has been verified both experimentally and analytically that buckling in lower density CNT array results in a further decrease of thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of CNT array decreases as the structure changes from vertically aligned to buckled, while the thermal conductivity rises back as the buckling structure becomes more compact. The rise of thermal conductivity with the buckling structure is attributed to the rise of the thermal <b>contact</b> conductance between <b>tubes.</b> The thermal <b>contact</b> conductance between CNT array and glass increases as the compressive stress increases to certain degree, while further increase of stress causes fatigue at the contacts, which decreases the contact conductance. These results demonstrate how thermal transport properties vary as a function of CNT array density and {{as a function of the}} strain of CNT array. With such trends, the thermal properties can be further increased by understanding the underlying mechanisms for such trends...|$|R
