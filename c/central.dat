5|$|Above the <b>central</b> figure shines {{a single}} small star {{at the very}} top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of the <b>central</b> figure herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the <b>central</b> figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the <b>central</b> character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|<b>Central</b> eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} <b>central</b> eclipse is an eclipse during which the <b>central</b> line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its <b>central</b> line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th <b>Central</b> Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the <b>Central</b> Committee and the <b>Central</b> Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress.
