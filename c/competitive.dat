5|$|A <b>competitive</b> {{inhibitor}} and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often <b>competitive</b> inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a <b>competitive</b> inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
