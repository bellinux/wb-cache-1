40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of prostate cancer}} clinical outcome remains a major challenge after the diagnosis, even with improved early detection by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring. To evaluate whether copy number variation (CNV) of the genomes in prostate cancer tumor, in benign prostate tissues adjacent to the tumor (AT), and {{in the blood of}} patients with prostate cancer predicts biochemical (PSA) relapse and the kinetics of relapse, 241 samples (104 tumor, 49 matched AT, 85 matched blood, and 3 cell lines) were analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 chips. By using gene-specific CNV from tumor, the genome model correctly predicted 73 % (receiver operating characteristic P = 0. 003) <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> relapse and 75 % (P < 0. 001) <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> short PSA doubling time (PSADT, < 4 months).
