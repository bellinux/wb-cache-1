5|$|Asteroids is an arcade space shooter {{released}} in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The {{object of the}} game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' <b>counter-fire.</b> The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.|$|E
5|$|The Russian 30.5cm shore {{batteries}} at Zerel {{remained a}} significant problem, and so while Kaiser was disrupting the Russian destroyers, Kaiserin, König Albert, and Friedrich der Grosse bombarded Zerel at ranges of between 7.5 and 12.5 miles. Russian <b>counter-fire</b> proved accurate, {{and so the}} German dreadnoughts were forced to continually alter course to avoid being hit. The attack lasted only about an hour, due to fears of mines and submarines. The following morning, two König-class battleships were sent into Moon Sound to destroy the Russian ships stationed there. König sank the pre-dreadnought Slava, while Kronprinz forced {{the withdrawal of the}} remaining warships. By 20 October, the naval operations were effectively over; the Russian ships had been destroyed or forced to withdraw, and the German army attained its objectives.|$|E
6000|$|Truly {{it might}} well enough have grown to {{universal}} flame of War. But this always needs two parties; and pacific George would not be second party in it. George, guided by pacific Walpole, backed by pacific Fleury, answers the ardent firing by phlegmatic patience and protocolling; not by <b>counter-firing,</b> except quite at his convenience, from privateers, from war-ships here and there, and in sulky defence from Gibraltar itself. Probably the Termagant, with all the fire she has, will not do much damage upon Gibraltar? Such was George's hope. Whereby the flame of war, ardent only in certain Spanish batteries upon the point of San Roque, does not spread hitherto,--though all mortals, and Friedrich Wilhelm as much as any, can see the imminent likelihood there is. In such circumstances, what a stroke of policy to have disjoined Friedrich Wilhelm from the Hanover Alliance, and brought him over to our own! Is not Grumkow worth his pension? [...] "Grumkow serves honorably." [...] Let the invaluable Seckendorf persevere.|$|R
5000|$|The German shore batteries, having {{discovered}} the Allied invaders, began firing on the armada at 0530. At 0536, the group commander made the signal [...] "Commence counter battery bombardment.", 14 minutes ahead of schedule. Hobson {{and the other}} ships began <b>counter-firing</b> as spent 5" [...] and 8" [...] shell casings littered their decks. Only the heavy ships had planes to spot for them. The destroyers were {{close enough to see}} their targets which consisted mostly of [...] "strong points" [...] just back of the beaches. Hobson, at station 1, was assigned firing on targets 70 and 72. At 0629, Hobson observed shell splashes near [...] and at 0633, Corry appeared to be hit amidships. As smoke from the intense shore firing drifted offshore and temporarily concealed Corry, Hobson shifted her fire at 0638 to target 86 which appeared to have been firing on Corry. This battery temporarily ceased firing as soon as taken under fire by Hobson. At 0644, the destroyer shifted her fire back to targets 70 and 72 since the leading boat wave was close to shore and neutralization of German firing from those areas was vital. At 0656, the smoke was extremely heavy on the beach, making it difficult to see the targets, and Hobson, per her prior firing orders, estimated that the first troops were going ashore and shifted fire to target 74, which was in an excellent position to deliver deadly enfilade and strafing fire on the Allied landing troops. At 0700, the smoke cover was clearing from Corry and the men on Hobson could see she was [...] "in definite trouble with her back broken between the stacks" [...] as targets 13A and 86 fired on the stricken destroyer. Corry, the worst naval loss of the D-Day landings, was hit by the Crisbecq Battery, whose three 210-millimeter (8.25-inch) guns had a range of 17-21 mi.|$|R
5|$|On 3 November, a {{batch of}} three {{companies}} was deployed to the Badgam area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, {{two of the three}} deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00pm. At 2:35pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but <b>counter-fire</b> was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal lashkar (English: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of Gulmarg. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{artillery}} began {{firing a}} preparatory bombardment on March 4, continuing through the day. It {{is estimated that}} the Greeks fired 150 rounds per gun in this bombardment, while Ottoman <b>counter-fire</b> was hampered by lack of ammunition. The assault was launched on , with three Greek infantry divisionsthe 4th, 6th and 8th Infantry Divisionsthrusting against the eastern and western sectors of the defensive perimeter. At {{the same time the}} Metsovon Joint Brigade launched a diversionary attack from the north. The first Greek units, under heavy artillery support, breached the defensive line in Tsouka sector at morning, and during the following hours the Ottoman defenses were broken in five locations. As a result, the defending Ottoman units from Tsouka to Manoliasa retreated immediately to Ioannina in order to avoid encirclement. Moreover, as these breakthroughs from different axes threatened to collapse the entire defensive perimeter and to cut off his front echelons, Esat Pasha was forced to keep his reserve troops back and engage them in a defensive role. By 18h, the Greek 1st Evzone Regiment, together with the 9th Battalion commanded by Major Ioannis Velissariou, entered the village of Agios Ioannis on the southern outskirts of Ioannina.|$|E
25|$|With {{their light}} {{infantry}} screen withdrawn, the Thai fire bases now came under attack. The PAVN used a new tactic of <b>counter-fire</b> on the batteries to coop the Thai gunners in their bunkers. It would lift this fire in bare time for its infantry to overrun the fire bases. Without time to react, {{many of the}} Thais were trapped in their bunkers.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, after {{elaborate}} reconnaissance, the Union's fleet steamed {{into position}} below the forts {{and prepared for}} the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. On April 18, the mortar boats opened fire. Their shells fell with great accuracy, and although one of the boats was sunk by <b>counter-fire</b> and two more were disabled, Fort Jackson was seriously damaged. However, the defenses {{were by no means}} crippled, even after a second bombardment on April 19. A formidable obstacle to the advance of the Union main fleet was a boom between the forts, designed to detain vessels under close fire if they attempted to run past. Gunboats were repeatedly sent at night to endeavor to destroy the barrier, but they had little success. US Navy bombardment of the forts continued, disabling only a few Confederate guns. The gunners of Fort Jackson were under cover and limited in their ability to respond.|$|E
25|$|Then on 16 January 1798 Babets boats {{captured}} the French schooner Désirée. The schooner was sailing towards Babet as Babet was sailing between Martinique and Dominique. As {{soon as the}} schooner realized that Babet was a British warship she attempted to escape. The wind failed and the schooner then took to her sweeps. Lieutenant Pym of Babet took 24 men in her pinnace and launch and went after the schooner. After rowing several leagues the boats closed to within range of their cannon, which they then commenced to fire. The British closed on their quarry despite a strong <b>counter-fire.</b> The British then boarded Désirée and took her. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. The British lost one man killed and five wounded; the French had three men killed and 15 wounded. Désirée was six days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one American brig that had been sailing from St. Vincent to Boston.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} began deployment in August 2005. The rest of {{the battalion}} began deploying in late September to Camp Taji {{the second week of}} October 2005. Iraqi National elections were scheduled to be held on the 15 October, equipment was delayed in Kuwait until the 20th, after the elections. The unit conducted a RIP/TOA (relief in place/transfer of authority) with 1–118th FA (Georgia Army National Guard) and the 70th Engineer Battalion (3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division) and completed the TOA on the 26th. The 1–320th detached a firing platoon from B Battery to 1–502 Infantry Battalion to conduct counter fire operations in Mahmudiyah. The battalion’s radar section deployed with the 4th BDE 101st, to the Mahmudiyah area also. While in Mahmudiyah, the Radar section conducted numerous <b>counter-fire</b> missions which resulted in the firing of over 1400 rounds of artillery. The 1–320th also detached a MiTT (Military Transition Team) team to work with an Iraqi Army Battalion in support of 1–22 IN and 1–10 CAV in and around Southeast Baghdad and at FOB Falcon.|$|E
2500|$|Counterbattery Radar (CBR) platoons {{are located}} within the {{headquarters}} battery of the artillery regiment. [...] The CBR Platoon's primary mission is to locate enemy rocket, mortar, and artillery weapons and process all acquired enemy locations {{in a timely manner}} for <b>counter-fire</b> and intelligence purposes. [...] Secondary missions that can be assigned by the supported artillery unit are adjusting or registering artillery. [...] They are normally employed as a unit and controlled by the regimental artillery commander. [...] The CBR platoon commander coordinates the employment of radars operating under regimental control. [...] Information on enemy order of battle and locations derived from counter-battery radar detections are reported to the Ground Combat Element and the Command Element of MAGTF.|$|E
2500|$|During the Great Siege, the British {{garrison}} of Gibraltar faced a French and Spanish army entrenched {{on the low}} {{ground of}} the isthmus that links Gibraltar with Spain. The British controlled the high ground of the Rock of Gibraltar, which reaches a height of [...] at its north end. Although this was a major advantage for the British gunners, as it gave them an increased range and {{a clear view of}} the enemy, it also posed significant problems. Enemies close to their positions could not be targeted as existing gun carriages would not allow the amount of vertical depression required to hit such a close target. Gunners tried to deal with this by propping up the rear of the carriages, but this was a clumsy solution that fixed the guns in position. It consequently exposed them to severe danger as they had to load the guns in full view of enemy <b>counter-fire,</b> rather than out of sight in an embrasure or battery.|$|E
2500|$|Philpott {{wrote that}} the début of the tank had been a disappointment, despite their {{suppression}} of machine-guns, because of their unreliability, which caused more losses than German <b>counter-fire.</b> Of the fifty tanks in France, [...] assembled for the attack, [...] the front line and [...] the German front line but only six reached the third objective. On 16 September, three tanks were operational and such losses showed that the tactics of tank warfare {{had yet to be}} developed. The tank would have to remain an accessory to a conventional attack, as part of the furniture of tactical attrition, advancing with infantry in co-operation with artillery, rather than as an independent battle-winning weapon; despite the disappointing results, Haig ordered another [...] The British public was enthusiastic, after reading vastly exaggerated press reports of their feats and in Germany, press reports dwelt on the tanks' vulnerability to armour-piercing bullets and field artillery. Geoffrey Malins, one of the photographers of the film The Battle of the Somme (released on 21 August), titled his new film The Battle of the Ancre and the Advance of the Tanks which went on view in January 1917.|$|E
2500|$|The pincer {{movement}} by the 22nd Brigade to envelop Fricourt had failed {{but the main}} attack on Mametz succeeded, despite a warning of the attack received by a listening station, which had eaves-dropped a British message at La Boisselle. The XV Corps attack took {{a considerable amount of}} ground on the flanks, the right advancing [...] and the left in the centre the attack failed and although enveloped on three sides Fricourt was not captured. In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack by the 7th Division was a success, having been greatly assisted in the crossing of no man's land by a creeping barrage and that the attacking battalions were [...] from the German front line at zero hour. The creeping barrage lost effect as it moved faster than the infantry after which German <b>counter-fire</b> caused an increasing number of casualties but not enough to stop the attack. A failure to engage in counter-battery fire by XV Corps, was redeemed by the emphasis on it by the XIII Corps artillery to the south and the French guns of XX Corps, which [...] "wiped out" [...] the German artillery near Fricourt. The density of the destructive bombardment was much greater than elsewhere and a lack of deep dugouts, led to most of the defenders congregating in dugouts under the front trench, which reduced the capacity of the surviving German infantry to withstand the attack.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack on Sevastopol scheduled for the early summer Heavy Artillery Battalion 833 was ordered to form a Karl-Batterie with three weapons on 18 February 1942, two of which were [...] "Thor" [...] and [...] "Odin". Camouflaged firing positions [...] long, [...] wide and [...] deep had to be dug for each howitzer to minimize Soviet <b>counter-fire</b> before they could move into position. On 20 May 1942 the 11th Army reported all three Karl-Geräte were at the front {{with a total of}} 72 heavy and 50 light concrete-piercing shells. LIV Army Corps reported that 19 heavy shells were fired between 2 and 6 June, 54 on 7 June and all 50 light shells between 8 and 13 June. More shells (29 heavy and 50 light) shipped to the battery {{before the end of the}} month. All 50 light shells were fired on 30 June and 25 heavy shells the following day. Many of these shells were fired at the two [...] twin-gun armored turrets of the Maxim Gorkii coastal defense battery, although shells fired at the turrets had little effect other than to jam one of the turrets and possibly knock out electrical power to the turrets, both of which were repaired without too much trouble. They did rather more damage to the concrete structure supporting the turrets as well as the command center located some 600 meters away (called the Bastion by the Germans). On 19 July 1942 the battery was ordered to ship their weapons to Hillersleben for refurbishment. One dud was recovered by the Soviets and flown to Moscow for evaluation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common form}} of attack {{involves}} hit-and-run mortar or rocket strikes on coalitionbases or locations associated with the Iraqi government or a foreign presence. Insurgents fire a few mortar rounds or rockets and quickly escape before their position can be identified and effective <b>counter-fire</b> directed. Insurgents use urban areas heavily populated by civilians as firing positions to discourage <b>counter-fire,</b> and in the countryside, palm groves and orchards are used for concealment. Insurgents commonly mount mortar tubes in the rear cargo area of civilian trucks allowing them to drive away from the launch position before <b>counter-fire</b> or coalition troops can reach them.|$|E
50|$|Counter-battery fire (sometimes called <b>counter-fire)</b> is a {{battlefield}} military activity {{to defeat the}} enemy's indirect fire elements (guns, rocket launchers, artillery and mortars), including their target acquisition, command and control components.
