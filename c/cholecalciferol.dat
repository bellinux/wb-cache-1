5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less <b>cholecalciferol</b> via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D3 (<b>cholecalciferol)</b> is {{produced}} industrially by exposing 7-dehydrocholesterol to UVB light, followed by purification. The 7-dehydrocholesterol {{is a natural}} substance in fish organs, especially the liver, or in wool grease (lanolin) from sheep. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) {{is produced}} {{in a similar way}} using ergosterol from yeast or mushrooms as a starting material.|$|E
25|$|Mouse and rat poison* {{ingestion}} {{is common}} in dogs. Most rodenticides in the United States are anticoagulant by depleting Vitamin K. This type is the most frequent cause of poisoning in pets. Third generation products contain brodifacoum or bromadiolone and are toxic after a single ingestion. Signs include spontaneous and excessive bleeding internally and externally. Treatment is with Vitamin K supplementation. Other rodenticides may contain <b>cholecalciferol</b> which causes hypercalcemia and leads to heart and kidney problems. Newer rodenticides may contain bromethalin which causes central nervous system signs such as seizures, muscle tremors, and depression.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms. <b>Cholecalciferol</b> (vitamin D3) is {{synthesized}} {{in the skin}} after exposure to the sun, or consumed {{in the form of}} animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.|$|E
25|$|Signaling {{molecules}} can {{belong to}} several chemical classes: lipids, phospholipids, amino acids, monoamines, proteins, glycoproteins, or gases. Signaling molecules binding surface receptors are generally large and hydrophilic (e.g. TRH, Vasopressin, Acetylcholine), while those entering the cell are generally small and hydrophobic (e.g. glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, <b>cholecalciferol,</b> retinoic acid), but important exceptions to both are numerous, and a same molecule can act both via surface receptor {{or in an}} intracrine manner to different effects. In intracrine signaling, once inside the cell, a signaling molecule can bind to intracellular receptors, other elements, or stimulate enzyme activity (e.g. gasses). The intracrine action of peptide hormones remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{pharmaceutical}} {{therapy has}} resulted in an overall reduction in hypertension, particularly in countries with high GDP per capita. A review of blood pressure statistics before these pharmaceuticals were available shows a coherent correlation between {{high blood pressure and}} higher latitude. Seasons of the year also impact high blood pressure; BP is lower in the summer months in high latitudes {{than it is in the}} winter, when there is less sunlight. Individuals with more sun exposure synthesize more active vitamin D (1,25 di-hydroxy <b>cholecalciferol)</b> from diet or ultraviolet radiation exposure. A combination of lower ultraviolet radiation with insufficient vitamin D in a diet leads to vitamin D deficiency. Individuals whose vitamin D ranks in the lowest quartile have double the all-cause mortality of those who rank in the highest quartile. They are also more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease, hypertension and organ cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{refers to}} a group of fat-soluble secosteroids {{responsible}} for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects. [...] In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as <b>cholecalciferol)</b> and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). [...] <b>Cholecalciferol</b> and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. [...] Only a few foods contain vitamin D. [...] The major natural source of the vitamin is synthesis of <b>cholecalciferol</b> in the skin from cholesterol through a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation). Dietary recommendations typically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is from taken by mouth, as sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations about the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of the skin cancer risk.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{it is made}} in {{the skin}} or ingested, <b>cholecalciferol</b> is {{hydroxylated}} in the liver at position 25 (upper right of the molecule) to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol or 25(OH)D). This reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, the product of the CYP2R1 human gene, and expressed by hepatocytes. Once made, the product is released into the plasma, where it is bound to an α-globulin carrier protein named the [...] vitamin D-binding protein.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transformation}} that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 occurs in two steps. First, 7-dehydrocholesterol is photolyzed by ultraviolet {{light in a}} 6-electron conrotatory ring-opening electrocyclic reaction; the product is previtaminD3. Second, previtaminD3 spontaneously isomerizes to vitaminD3 (<b>cholecalciferol)</b> in an antarafacial sigmatropic [...] hydride shift. At room temperature, the transformation of previtaminD3 to vitamin D3 in an organic solvent takes about 12 days to complete. The conversion of previtaminD3 to vitamin D3 in the skin is about 10 times faster than in an organic solvent.|$|E
2500|$|... 7-Dehydrocholesterol is a {{zoosterol}} that {{functions in}} the serum as a cholesterol precursor, and is converted to vitamin D3 in the skin, therefore functioning as provitamin-D3. The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D3 (<b>cholecalciferol)</b> from ultraviolet rays in the sun light, via an intermediate isomer pre-vitamin D3. It {{is also found in}} the milk of several mammalian species. In insects it is a precursor for the hormone ecdysone, required for reaching adulthood. It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist Adolf Windaus.|$|E
2500|$|This was the {{genotype}} inherited by anatomically modern humans, but retained only by part of {{the extant}} populations, thus forming an aspect of human genetic variation. About 100,000–70,000 years ago, some anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) began to migrate away from the tropics to the north where they were exposed to less intense sunlight. This was possibly {{in part due to}} the need for greater use of clothing to protect against the colder climate. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of folate and so the evolutionary pressure working against the survival of lighter-skinned gene variants was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more vitamin D (<b>cholecalciferol)</b> than darker skin, so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D.

2500|$|In general, {{the vitamin}} megadoses {{advocated}} by orthomolecular medicine are unsupported by scientific consensus. Some vitamins are toxic in high doses, including niacin (B3), <b>cholecalciferol</b> (D) and tocopherol (E). The {{view of the}} medical community {{is that there is}} no evidence for the efficacy of Orthomolecular medicine as a treatment for cancer, and that high vitamin doses may on the contrary increase overall mortality. Nutritional treatments are not generally accepted as being helpful for psychological health. Its claims have been criticized by most medical organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute of Mental Health, the American Academy of Pediatrics, CHAMPUS, and the Canadian Paediatric Society. The American Medical Association describes as [...] "myths" [...] the ideas that adequate nutrition is not readily achievable with normal food, all food grown with pesticide is poisonous, all food additives are poisonous, vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common, that the cause of most disease is poor diet, which can be prevented by nutritional supplements.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{from the}} diet or skin {{synthesis}} is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) {{in the liver}} and kidney is required for activation. [...] As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, {{it is not an}} essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin. [...] Instead it could be considered as a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, calcitriol, which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple different locations. [...] <b>Cholecalciferol</b> is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); ergocalciferol is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. [...] These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. [...] Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys to form calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.|$|E
