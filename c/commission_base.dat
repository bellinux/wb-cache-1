40|$|Agreements to halve the {{quantity}} of nutrients reaching the marine environment by 1995 were made within the Helsinki <b>Commission</b> (<b>base</b> year 1987) and at the North Sea Conference/Paris <b>Commission</b> (<b>base</b> year 1985). This goal has not been achieved. Agriculture has contributed substantially {{to an increase in}} nutrient leaching. From 1950 to 1980, the inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the form of inorganic fertilizer increased strongly in relation to their outputs in the form of agriculturally produced foodstuffs such as milk, meat and bread grain in Sweden. After 1980 the surplus of nitrogen remained at the same level. A comparison of the nitrogen surplus in the agricultural system for 1995 with that in 1990 shows that it increased from 86 kg N ha- 1 to 89 kg N ha- 1. Based on the results of these studies it was concluded that the local and regional specialization of farms is one important reason for the high losses of plant nutrients: One type of farm specializes in crop production based on the use of artificial fertilizers, while the other specializes in animal production with high inputs of purchased fodder and a surplus of plant nutrients in the form of ineffectively utilized manure from the animals. In this publication, examples are presented showing {{that it is possible to}} conserve and minimize the losses of nitrogen and other plant nutrients through careful recycling within the agro-ecosystem. However, to achieve high levels of production and recycling efficiency, there needs to be a good balance between the intensity of animal production and crop production hectarage at the local, regional, and national levels...|$|E

It also investigates the willingness of passengers to pay (WTP) for these services together with what type of ancillary items are acceptable at a particular price point. The study found that passengers value a narrow range of perceived ‘necessity’ products and services such as food and drink, checked baggage and seat assignment as opposed to perceived ‘optional’ unbundled or <b>commission</b> <b>based</b> products/services. It also found significant differences in WTP for specific ancillary services based on carrier type (FSC/LCC/Charter), length of flight (long and short haul) and journey purpose (business, leisure, VFR) ...|$|R

The insurer must accrue funds {{during the year}} to recognize the expected contingent commission payout in the financial statements. Westfield Insurance wanted to reduce their accrual forecasting error from 20 percent to less than five percent. We built a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate each Westfield agency’s performance. We clustered agencies into representative groups {{as a proxy for}} generating correlated ran-dom variables and then designed an experiment to shift statistical distributions of agency key performance indicators. The results of the simulation were then used to derive a formula for forecasting expected con-tingent <b>commissions</b> <b>based</b> on overall company results. The approach, results, and areas for further re-search are discussed. ...|$|R
