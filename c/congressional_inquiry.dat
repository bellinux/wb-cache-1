5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

25|$|In March, The New York Times {{reported}} that a bipartisan <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> concluded that the United States had inadequate intelligence to reach any conclusions {{on the state of}} Iran's nuclear program.

The MPAA initially rated Endless Love with an X rating. The film was re-edited to earn an R rating.

In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in The Misadventures of Margaret.|$|E

25|$|Seduction of the Innocent {{is a book}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Fredric Wertham, {{published in}} 1954, that warned that comic books were a negative form of popular literature and a serious cause of juvenile delinquency. The book was taken seriously at the time, and was a minor bestseller that created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. At the same time, a U.S. <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> was launched into the comic book industry. Subsequent to the publication of Seduction of the Innocent, the Comics Code Authority was voluntarily established by publishers to self-censor their titles.|$|E

A grandson, Paul H. Todd, Jr., followed in his grandfather's footsteps and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, in which he served from 1965 to 1966. In addition a nephew, Laurence Todd, was for 30 years the Washington correspondent of the TASS news agency of the Soviet Union, a position which twice put him in the national public spotlight as a subject of <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, both Bonds' {{accomplishments in}} the 2000s {{have not been}} without controversy. During his run, journalists {{questioned}} McGwire about {{his use of the}} steroid-precursor androstenedione, and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> into steroids. Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the BALCO drugs scandal, as his personal trainer Greg Anderson pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} made nine official inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946, and a tenth in 1995. They included an inquiry by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox (1941); the Roberts Commission (1941–42); the Hart Inquiry (1944); the Army Pearl Harbor Board (1944); the Naval Court of Inquiry (1944); the Hewitt investigation; the Clarke investigation; the <b>Congressional</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (Pearl Harbor Committee; 1945–46); a top-secret inquiry by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, authorized by Congress {{and carried out}} by Henry Clausen (the Clausen Inquiry; 1946); and the Thurmond-Spence hearing, in April 1995, which produced the Dorn Report. The inquiries reported incompetence, underestimation, and misapprehension of Japanese capabilities and intentions; problems resulting from excessive secrecy about cryptography; division of responsibility between Army and Navy (and lack of consultation between them); and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence (analysis, collection, processing).|$|E

500|$|In February 2002, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence {{formed a}} joint {{inquiry into the}} {{performance}} of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Their 832 page report released in December 2002 detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information, including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States, in order to disrupt the plots. The joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of Saudi Arabian government officials from non-classified sources. Nevertheless, the Bush administration demanded 28 related pages remain classified. In December 2002, the inquiry's chair Bob Graham (D-FL) revealed in an interview that there was [...] "evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of {{at least some of the}} terrorists in the United States." [...] September 11 victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the <b>Congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> and demanded an independent commission.

The failure of the attacks to kill bin Laden also enhanced his public image in the Muslim world. Further strikes were planned but not executed; as a 2002 <b>congressional</b> <b>inquiry</b> noted, Operation Infinite Reach was [...] "the only instance... in which the CIA or U.S. military carried out an operation directly against Bin Ladin before September 11." ...|$|E

[...] Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who opposed the war in Korea, argued that [...] "when we agreed to the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant our Constitution with the United Nations Charter.

This would, they hoped, protect him from being called to testify. A press release was already prepared, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness.
