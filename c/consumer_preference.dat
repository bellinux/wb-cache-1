Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes <b>consumer</b> <b>preference,</b> while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E

That commitment proved to be impractical, given <b>consumer</b> <b>preference</b> for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal. Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint. Some environmentalists questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda. Ford's position {{is that for the}} company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand. During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{spinning}} wheel was a medieval invention that increased thread making productivity {{by a factor}} greater than ten. [...] One of the early developments that preceded the Industrial Revolution was the stocking frame (loom) of c. 1589. [...] Later in the Industrial Revolution came the flying shuttle, a simple device that doubled the productivity of weaving. [...] Spinning thread had been a limiting factor in cloth making requiring 10 spinners using the {{spinning wheel}} to supply one weaver. [...] With the spinning jenny a spinner could spin eight threads at once. [...] The water frame (Ptd. 1768) adapted water power to spinning, but it could only spin one thread at a time. The water frame was easy to operate and many could be located in a single building. [...] The spinning mule (1779) allowed {{a large number of}} threads to be spun by a single machine using water power. [...] A change in <b>consumer</b> <b>preference</b> for cotton at the time of increased cloth production resulted in the invention of the cotton gin (Ptd. 1794). [...] Steam power eventually was used as a supplement to water during the Industrial Revolution, and both were used until electrification.

[...] Race is not included. For example, in Dothard v Rawlinson the state of Alabama prohibited women from working as prison guards in [...] "contact" [...] jobs, with close proximity to prisoners. It also had minimum height and weight requirements (5"2 and 120 lbs), which it argued were necessary for proper security. Ms Rawlinson claimed both requirements were unlawful discrimination. A majority of 6 to 3 held that the gender restrictions in contact jobs were a bona fide occupational qualification, {{because there was a}} heightened risk of sexual assault, although Stewart J suggested the result might have differed if the prisons were better run. A majority held the height and weight restrictions, while neutral, had a disparate impact on women and were not justified by business necessity. By contrast, in Wilson v Southwest Airlines Co, a Texas District Court held an airline was not entitled to require women only to work as cabin attendants (who were further required to be [...] "dressed in high boots and hot-pants") even if it could show a <b>consumer</b> <b>preference.</b> The essence of the business was transporting passengers, rather than metaphorically [...] "spreading love all over Texas", so that there was no [...] "bona fide occupational requirement". Under the ADEA 1967, age requirements can be used, but only if reasonably necessary, or compelled by law or circumstance. For example, in Western Air Lines, Inc v Criswell the Supreme Court held that airlines could require pilots to retire at age 60, because the Federal Aviation Authority required this. It could not, however, refuse to employ flight engineers over 60 because there was no comparable FAA rule.|$|E
