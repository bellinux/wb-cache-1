One month post the release of his action film Sivaji in June2007, he approached Shah Rukh Khan for the lead in Robot. Khan was about to produce it under his own banner, Red <b>Chillies</b> Entertainment, but in October the same year the project was officially aborted due to creative differences between the two.|$|E

5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and <b>chillies.</b> Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green <b>chillies</b> popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, <b>chillies,</b> and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E

5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green <b>chillies,</b> and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{from the}} eighth to the 14th centuries (during {{the rule of}} the Pandyas, Cholas and later Tenkasi Pandyas) {{indicate}} the growth of Tirunelveli as a centre of economic growth which developed around the Nellaiappar temple. The drier parts of the province also flourished during {{the rule of the}} Vijayanagara kings. From 1550 until the early modern era, migration to the city {{from other parts of the}} state was common and the urban regions became hubs of manufacturing and commerce. Tirunelveli was a strategic point, connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula, as well as a trading centre. Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala. During the 1840s, cotton produced in the region was in demand for British mills. The chief exports during British rule were cotton, jaggery, <b>chillies,</b> tobacco, palmyra fibre, salt, dried saltwater fish and cattle.|$|E
5|$|Red <b>Chillies</b> Entertainment {{continued}} to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One. After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan (2010), the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films. Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made the film's director. To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films {{from all over the}} world. The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios. While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, and so he was brought back. Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Hassan's Dasavathaaram (2008).|$|E

40|$|Exploration of Growth Promoting Endophitic Bacteria Derived from Red <b>Chilly</b> TissuesABSTRACT. The aims of this {{research}} were: to explore growth promoting endophitic bacteria isolated from root of red <b>chilly</b> planted at swampy land, Ogan Ilir, South Sumatera, and to study the ability of resulted isolates to promote growth of red <b>chilly</b> by bioassay evaluation; and to evaluate the ability of resulted isolates to produce IAA in vitro. Different stage of red <b>chilly</b> as sources of endophitic bacteria samples were collected from various locations of <b>chilly</b> farms in Ogan Ilir District, South Sumatera. The results of {{this research}} proved that endophitic bacteria derived from root red <b>chilly</b> tissues acted as growth promoting, neutral and growth inhibiting bacteria. First, second and third of selection resulted in 8, 6, and 3 consortia of endophitic bacteria, which consistently promoted the growth of red <b>chilly.</b> The amount of IAA resulted by S 248 isolates of endophitic bacteria (3. 36 mg kg- 1) as significantly {{lower than those of}} S 348 isolates (4. 16 mg kg- 1) and S 830 isolates (3. 93 mg kg- 1).

5000|$|<b>Chilly</b> Willy {{appeared}} in 50 theatrical short subjects produced by Lantz from 1953 to 1972, {{most of which}} involve his attempts to stay warm, and often meeting opposition from a dog named Smedley (voiced by Daws Butler in his [...] "Huckleberry Hound" [...] voice). Smedley has a large mouth and sharp-pointed teeth (which he shows off when yawning), but is never shown viciously trying to bite <b>Chilly</b> or anyone else with them. There were times, however, when <b>Chilly</b> and Smedley got along, {{as they did in}} Vicious Viking and Fractured Friendship. Ironically, <b>Chilly</b> never referred to Smedley by name. Most times that <b>Chilly</b> was in opposition with Smedley, it wound up with the two of them being friends at the end. <b>Chilly</b> was more of a nuisance to Smedley than an enemy, often showing up where Smedley is working, usually for some mean employer. Many times, the notion of a plot was extremely weak, appearing to be a random collection of loosely related gags as opposed to a coherent story.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a plethora}} of {{research}} concerning the <b>chilly</b> climate for students within the classroom. However there is an absence of literature investigating this phenomenon within distance education. This exploratory research draws from the theories of role strain, academic performance and coping and integrates these theoretical paradigms into the <b>chilly</b> climate, to develop a framework to conceptualise this phenomenon for distance education students. In addition, this paper theorises that women within distance education experience role strain and incorporates the actors for role strain into the <b>chilly</b> climate. The theory saturating the <b>chilly</b> climate is that women are disadvantaged through the lived experience of this phenomenon. Conversely, this research proposes that the independent variable to the overall GPA for women within distance education is the coping strategy chosen by the student. The quantitative analysis indicates that women are outperforming men in GPAs above a credit average. In addition, women studying internally are outperforming their distance education counterparts. This paper intimates that the <b>chilly</b> climate is more complex for women within distance education and it is proposed that Higher Education Institutions recognise that this phenomenon exists and implement marketing strategies {{that are designed to}} dissipate the <b>chilly</b> climate environment...|$|R
