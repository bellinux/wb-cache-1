500|$|A {{key factor}} in the final plan was secrecy. There was to be no pre-battle bombardment, only {{artillery}} fire immediately prior to the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces. The final plan for the Fourth Army involved 1,386 field guns and howitzers and 684 heavy guns, making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries, {{in addition to the}} infantry divisions' artillery. The fire plan for the Fourth Army's artillery was devised by Monash's senior artillery officer, Major General <b>C.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>D.</b> Budworth. British sound ranging advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with [...] "ranging shots" [...] to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns to be hit at [...] "zero hour", while a creeping barrage preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the Feuerwalze which the Germans themselves had used in their Spring Offensive, but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.|$|E

But the reader will remember that in our best shaft base, in Fig. XII. (p. 78), certain props or spurs were applied to the slope of X b; but now that X b is divided into these delicate mouldings, we cannot conveniently apply the spur to its irregular profile; we must be content to set it against the lower roll. Let the upper edge of this lower roll be the curved line here, a, d, e, b, Fig. LIX., and c {{the angle of the}} square plinth projecting beneath it. Then the spur, applied as we saw in Chap.

5000|$|The rhyme {{scheme for}} the octave is {{typically}} a b b a a b b a. The sestet is more flexible. Petrarch typically used <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>e</b> or <b>c</b> <b>d</b> c d c d for the sestet. Some other {{possibilities for the}} sestet include c d d c d <b>d,</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>d</b> <b>e</b> <b>c</b> <b>e,</b> or <b>c</b> <b>d</b> d c c d (as in Wordsworth's [...] "Nuns Fret Not at Their Convents Narrow Room" [...] poem). This form {{was used in the}} earliest English sonnets by Wyatt and others. For background on the pre-English sonnet, see Robert Canary's web page, The Continental Origins of the Sonnet. In a strict Petrarchan sonnet, the sestet does not end with a couplet (since this would tend to divide the sestet into a quatrain and a couplet). However, in Italian sonnets in English, this rule is not always observed, and <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>d</b> <b>c</b> <b>e</b> <b>e</b> and <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>c</b> <b>d</b> <b>e</b> e are also used.|$|R

40|$|This EFSA {{statement}} is a refined exposure assessment of caramel colours (E 150 a, <b>E</b> 150 <b>c</b> and <b>E</b> 150 <b>d)</b> {{taking into account}} additional information on its use in foods as consumed. The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 b, <b>E</b> 150 <b>c,</b> <b>E</b> 150 <b>d)</b> used as food additives in 2011. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for caramel colours E 150 a, <b>E</b> 150 <b>c</b> and <b>E</b> 150 <b>d,</b> but exposure estimates to E 150 b were below the ADI. Following this conclusion, new data from industry were submitted to EFSA providing updated use levels of caramel colours in foods ready to be consumed. A refined exposure assessment was performed for caramel colours that were exceeding the ADI in ANS Panel opinion (EFSA, 2011 a) i. e. E 150 a, <b>E</b> 150 <b>c</b> and <b>E</b> 150 <b>d</b> {{and concluded that the}} anticipated dietary exposure are considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment. However, toddlers and adults have a higher exposure to caramel colour <b>E</b> 150 <b>c</b> and could still exceed the ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for this caramel colour.
