Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the {{interlude}} [...] "Miami" [...] and [...] "Chasing Summers", which are homages to the summers in the city. The collaborative effort We Own the Night follows {{as the third}} track; the song features vocals from English recording artist Luciana Caporaso, which coincides over electronic basslines. After transitioning from [...] "What <b>Can</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> (A Deeper Love)" [...] and [...] "If a Lie Was Love", the respective seventh and eighth tracks—the remixes of [...] "Paradise" [...] and [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know"—follows suit; the latter contains an upbeat melody with pounding synthesizers. It continues with [...] "Walls", the album's ninth song, which contains an upbeat melody and a house-inspired breakdown. Hardwell's remix of [...] "Young Blood" [...] constitutes the tenth tune of Club Life: Volume Two Miami, which albeit retains the original song's banger themes, provides a [...] "euphoric sound with progressively sweet vocals building next to synths before releasing a thumping beat". The thirteenth track, [...] "Arena", commences after [...] "Life", [...] "Long Time", and the [...] "electric summer sound" [...] of Axwell's [...] "In My Mind". [...] "Can't Stop Me", a collaborative work between Tiësto and fellow Dutch producer Afrojack, is drenched with thumping percussion and grandiose vocals.

500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E

Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge.

Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E

A 2006 article from The Economist magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brand's identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. His answer was dismissive: [...] "That's a good question, but what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> We can't forbid people from buying it.

[...] In retaliation, many hip hop icons such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs, who previously included references to [...] "Cris", ceased all mentions and purchases of the champagne. 50 Cent's deal with Vitamin Water, Dr. Dre's promotion of his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line and Dr. Pepper, and Drake's commercial with Sprite are successful deals. Although product placement deals were not popular in the 1980s, MC Hammer was an early innovator in this type of strategy. With merchandise such as dolls, commercials for soft drinks and numerous television show appearances, Hammer began the trend of rap artists being accepted as mainstream pitchpeople for brands.|$|E
