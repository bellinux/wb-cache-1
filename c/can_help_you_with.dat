2500|$|In 1997, at {{a banquet}} {{hosted by the}} US Olympic Committee, a {{reporter}} was interviewing Hal Haig Prieste who had won a bronze medal in platform diving {{as a member of}} the 1920 US Olympic team. The reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> that," [...] Prieste said, [...] "It's in my suitcase." [...] At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The original Antwerp Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it.|$|E

[...] dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. [...] began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. [...] , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. [...] There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. [...] This was , the Ground Squirrel. [...] "," [...] said Ground Squirrel.

40|$|This course {{provides}} an overview of modeling techniques and methods used in decision analysis, including multiattribute utility models, decision trees, and Bayesian models. Psychological components of decision making are discussed. Elicitation techniques for model building are emphasized. Practical applications through real-world model building are described and conducted, including business management, supply chain and logistics, transportation, health care, and homeland security. Each group,which consists 1 - 3 stu-dents, will work on a project throughout the semester, including oral presentations and written reports. Prerequisites: EAS 305 Applied Probability & Statistics Inference; or Graduate student status. What You Can Get out of This Course: The ability to make good decisions is a fundamental skill for engineers and managers in any organization. This course will teach the skills and concepts that you need to make better decisions. The ideas will be applicable in your personal life as well as your professional life.

These ideas <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> deal <b>with</b> {{many of the things that}} can make decision-making difficult, such as uncertainty about future outcomes, tradeoffs between competing objectives (“comparing apples and oranges”), and nonlinearity of preferences (e. g., the fact that twice as much of something may not be twice as good) ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{all like}} comfort. But {{what kind of}} comfort do we not merely like, but need? Merely to be comfortable? To be free from fear, anxiety, sorrow? The comfort which poor human beings want in such a world as {{this is not the}} comfort of ease, but the comfort of strength. The {{comforter}} whom we need is not one who will merely say kind things, but give help--help to the weary, lonely, heavy-laden heart which has no time to rest. We need not the sunny and smiling face, but the strong helping arm. For we may be in that state that smiles are shocking to us, and mere kindness--though we may be grateful for it--of no more comfort to us than sweet music to a drowning man. We may be miserable, and unable to help being miserable, and unwilling to help it too. We do not wish to flee from our sorrow: we do not wish to forget it. We dare not. It is so awful, so heart-rending, so plain-spoken, that God, the master and tutor of our hearts, must wish us to face it and endure it. Our Father has given us the cup--shall we not drink it? Oh! for a comforter who will help us to drink the bitter cup--who will give us faith to say, with Job, [...] "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him"--who will give us the firm reason to look steadily at our grief, and learn the lesson it is meant to teach--who will give us the temperate will to keep sober and calm amid the shocks and changes of mortal life! If we had such a comforter as that, we should not care if he seemed at times stern, as well as kind; we could endure rebuke from him if we could only get from him wisdom to understand the rebuke, and courage to bear the chastisement. Where is that comforter? God answers: That Comforter am I, the God of Heaven and Earth. There are comforters on earth who <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> <b>with</b> wise words and noble counsels, can be strong as man and tender as woman. But God can be more strong than man, more tender than woman likewise; and when the strong arm of man supports thee no longer, yet under thee are the Everlasting Arms.|$|R
