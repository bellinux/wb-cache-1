With holding times of 60 minutes, the difference between CCG and CFCG tests is very small. To characterise the fracture mode metallographic analyses were performed on selected specimens after CFCG tests. The crack path is inter-granular and an area of high cavity density was identified around the crack tip in all specimens. By comparing CFCG, FCG and CCG results, it can be finally noticed that specimens with a holding time of 6 and 60 min show a similar crack growth rate as samples under creep loading...|$|R

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} crack-coalescence {{behavior}} are reported. The first concerns a regime frequently {{referred to in}} the literature as <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interactions</b> but which in this paper is essentially a time-dependent, fatigue-failure process. The second relates to crack coalescence under a wide range of different multiaxial stress-strain states. In the framework of the first approach, a fatigue-crack growth model is derived based on experimental observations during high-temperature, high-strain, reversed-bend, hold-time tests on AISI 316 stainless steel. Essential features of these tests are the compressive and the tensile 60 -min hold periods on different surfaces, which induce, respectively, transgranular-short and intergranular-long cracks. The latter, more damaging cracks involve the coalescence of numerous short cracks to form a dominant Stage II crack that leads to failure. Then, in the framework of the second approach, the crack-coalescence model is advanced to predict the fatigue lifetimes for multiaxial, variable amplitude, proportional loading of a medium carbon steel commonly used to manufacture engineering components. It is shown that under high strain fatigue conditions the models used for the calculations of lifetime must necessarily involve crack-coalescence behavior if unsafe lifetime predictions are to be avoide...|$|R

Equivalent damage was defined as being those effects which influence the crack initiation life-time beyond the damage that is measured in uniaxial, fully-reversed sinusoidal and isothermal experiments at low homologous temperatures. Three areas of equivalent damage were examined: mean stress, cumulative damage, and multiaxiality. For each area, a literature survey was conducted to aid in selecting the most appropriate theories. Where possible, data correlations were also used in the evaluation process. A set of criteria was developed for ranking the theories in each equivalent damage regime. These criteria considered aspects of engine utilization {{as well as the}} theoretical basis and correlative ability of each theory. In addition, consideration was given to the complex nature of the loading cycle at fatigue critical locations of hot path components; this loading includes non-proportional multiaxial stressing, combined temperature and strain fluctuations, and general <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interactions.</b> Through applications of selected equivalent damage theories to some suitable data sets it was found that there is insufficient data to allow specific recommendations of preferred theories for general applications.

40|$|High {{temperature}} creep and dwell-fatigue {{properties of}} the new nickel-based superalloy AD 730 ™ have been investigated. Three microstructures have been studied in creep (850 °C and 700 °C) and dwell-fatigue (700 °C stress control with trapezoidal signals, and dwell times ranging from 1 s to 3600 s) : a coarse grains microstructure, a fine grains one, and single crystalline samples. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the influence of the grain size on creep and creep-fatigue properties. It is demonstrated that fine and coarse grains microstructures perform similarly in creep at 700 °C, showing that the creep properties at this temperature are controlled by the intragranular precipitation. Moreover, both the coarse grains and the fine grains microstructures show changes in creep deformation mechanisms depending on the applied stress in creep at 700 °C. At higher creep temperatures, the coarse grains microstructure performs better and almost no effect is observed by suppressing grain boundaries. During dwell-fatigue tests at 700 °C, a clear effect of the mechanical cycling has been evidenced on the time to failure on both the coarse and the fine grains microstructures. At high applied stresses, a beneficial effect of the cyclic unloading to the lifetime has been observed whereas at lower applied stresses, mechanical cycling is detrimental compared to the pure creep lifetime due to the development of a fatigue damage.

40|$|Due to its {{specific}} mechanical properties, tantalum {{is often used}} in strength-demanding military applications. High cycle fatigue (HCF) behaviour of pure tantalum, however, has been rarely reported and the mechanisms at stake to account for deformation under cyclic loadings are still badly understood [1 - 2]. This presentation aims at better understanding the HCF damage mechanisms encountered in pure tantalum under such loadings. HCF loadings at various frequencies were performed in tension at room temperature on commercially-pure tantalum. Mean stress effects and frequency effects were investigated in the aim of clarifying the interaction between fatigue and creep. For symmetrical loadings (R=- 1, i. e. under zero mean stress), fracture mechanisms were observed to vary from intergranular to transgranular when the maximum stress was decreased. For non-symmetrical loadings (R> 0, with sufficiently large mean stress), a transition was also observed from extensive necking to intergranular initiation. Important creep activation was deduced from the presence of necking. This prevalence of creep at room temperature was actually confirmed by two other phenomena: a) The large influence of the frequency on fatigue life, indicating time-dependent damage. b) Important creep deformation during room-temperature creep tests. Finally, complex sequential loadings, representative of in-service loadings, were applied to pure tantalum specimens. The contribution of each loading sequence to the overall damage was quantified. It was shown that linear cumulative damage rules (analogous to Miner’s law to account for fatigue damage and for creep damage) failed to predict life duration of pure tantalum. The ONERA model [3 - 4], which specifically accounts for <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interactions,</b> granted better results. However, {{it is important to}} notice that this model uses engineering stresses as input, assuming that the specimen cross-section does not evolve drastically during fatigue/creep deformation.

For in-vessel components of fusion reactors the material EUROFER 97 is a candidate for structural application where it is subjected to irradiation and cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. To be able to evaluate fusion reactor components reliably, creep-fatigue damage has to be taken into account. In the frame of Engineering Data and Design Integration (EDDI) in EUROfusion Technology Work Programme rapid and easy design evaluation is very important to predict the critical regions under typical fusion reactor loading conditions. The presented Creep-Fatigue Assessment (CFA) tool is based on the creep-fatigue rules in ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section 3 Division 1 Subsection NH which was adapted to the material EUROFER 97 and developed for ANSYS. The CFA tool uses the local stress, maximum elastic strain range and temperature from the elastic analysis of the component performed with ANSYS. For the assessment design fatigue and stress to rupture curves of EUROFER 97 as well as isochronous stress vs. strain curves determined by a constitutive model considering irradiation influence are used to deal with creep-fatigue damage.

The results {{will provide a}} preliminary database on the fatigue properties of the 2650 T 6 alloy under loading representative of service conditions and predict the damage tolerance assessment of the future civil transport aircraft fuselage. Testing were carried out to evaluate the effect of <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> and get insight into the damage processes. Numerical simulation of stress field around the crack tip were performed {{to account for the}} observed behaviour. The crack growth rates measured on CT specimens were correlated with the stress intensity factor K. In creep tests, an influence of the initial value of K on the low crack growth rates is shown. The behaviour is not deeply affected by temperature in the range 100 - 130 °C. However, at 160 °C, crack growth rates are faster than at 130 °C due to an increase of creep contribution in local stress-strain response, that might be enhanced by ageing. In fatigue (triangular wave loading), no difference is noticed in crack growth rates at 20 and 130 °C. In creep-fatigue, the crack growth rates (trapezoidal wave loading) at 130 °C are faster than during creep or fatigue crack growth in a given domain of K. The fracture surfaces indicate that creepfatigue interaction is characterised by a higher portion of intergranular fracture. Thus, a detrimental <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> at 130 °C has {{to be taken into account}} in crack propagation law used in damage tolerance analysis.

40|$|P 91 {{martensitic}} steel {{has now been}} widely used for power plant components such as steam pipe sections and headers. With the shift to renewable sources, traditional fossil power plants are increasingly expected to operate under so called “two shifting” conditions (high frequency start up/shut down cycles from a partial load condition) to match market demands. Such conditions increase the potential for large thermal stresses to be induced in thick walled components, making thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) and <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> a life limiting concern. It is important to investigate the behaviour of P 91 power plant steel under cyclic <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> conditions in order to estimate the component remnant life under various possible operating strategies. Specimens used for TMF testing are commonly hollow (unlike solid specimens used in isothermal tests) to allow for higher cooling rates (with insignificant radial temperature variations) by injecting air. It is difficult to polish the internal surface {{to the same extent}} as the external surface of the specimen (with a roughness (Ra) of 0. 8 μm). Concerns have been expressed as to whether this type of uncontrolled surface roughness could significantly affect the fatigue life of the specimen since most fatigue cracks often initiate at the surface of the material. In this work, the roughness profile of the internal surface of the TMF sample is measured using Alicona optical profilometer. Resultant surface profiles are idealised and used to simulate distributions of stress and plastic strain under fatigue load using multi-axial visco-plasticity model. Concentration of stress and higher plastic stain accumulations are observed at the peak region of the roughness profile and crack initiations are expected to occur at those regions. Using accumulated plastic strain as a failure criterion for the fatigue, shorter fatigue lifetime is expected for specimen with rougher surface relative to the polished specimen.

Hence, reliable C-F test data is required for meticulous consideration of C-F interactions and oxidation, which in turn is vital for sound design practices. It is also imperative to develop analytical constitutive models that can simulate and predict material response under various long-term in-service conditions using experimental data from short-term laboratory experiments. Consequently, the major objectives of the proposed research are to characterize the creep, fatigue and C-F behavior of grade P 91 steels at 625 C and develop robust constitutive models for simulating/predicting their microstructural response under different loading conditions.

40|$|The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has {{recently}} {{developed a new}} standard for creep-fatigue crack growth testing, E 2760 - 10, that supports testing compact specimens, C(T), under load controlled conditions. C(T) specimens are commonly used for fatigue and creep-fatigue crack growth testing under constant-load-amplitude conditions. The use of these specimens is limited to positive load ratios. They are also limited {{in the amount of}} crack growth data that can be developed at high stress intensity values due to accumulation of plastic and/or creep strains leading to ratcheting in the specimen. Testing under displacement control can potentially address these shortcomings of the load-controlled tests for which the C(T) geometry is unsuitable. A double edge notch tension-compression, DEN(T-C), specimen to perform displacement controlled creep-fatigue crack growth testing is developed and optimized with the help of finite element and boundary element analyses. Accurate expressions for estimating the fracture mechanics crack tip parameters such as the stress intensity parameter, K, the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD), and the load-line displacement (LLD) are developed over a wide range of crack sizes for the DEN(T-C) specimen. A new compliance relationship for use in experimental testing has been developed by using the compliance form available in ASTM E- 647 standard. Experimentally determined compliance value compared well with the new relation for C 15 steel (AISI 1015) and P 91 steel tested at room and elevated temperature conditions respectively. Fatigue crack growth rate data generated using the DEN(T-C) specimens on the two metallic materials are in good agreement with the data generated using standard compact specimens; thus validating the stress-intensity factor and the compliance equation for the double edge notch tension-compression specimen. The testing has shown that the DEN(T-C) specimen is prone to crack asymmetry issues. Through inspection of fatigue surfaces, it has been found that that better alignment control procedures are needed to ensure symmetric crack fronts for the DEN(T-C) specimen. Creep-fatigue crack growth tests were conducted on 9 Cr- 1 Mo (P 91) steels at 625 °C with various hold times. These tests were conducted using C(T) specimens under constant load amplitude conditions (tension-tension) and DEN(T-C) specimens under displacement like conditions (tension-compression). Crack growth data generated under creep-fatigue conditions using standard C(T) specimens correlated well with crack growth data generated using DEN(T-C) specimens. The crack growth rates per cycle increased significantly with increase in hold time when crack growth data were plotted with the cyclic stress intensity parameter, Delta-K. A transient behavior in the initial portion of da/dN versus Delta-K plots were observed for the hold time tests, as reported previously by several other researchers. It is shown for the C(T) specimens that the <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interactions</b> during crack growth for various hold times are represented better by the (Ct) avg parameter implying that the P 91 steel behaves in a creep-ductile manner. Significant differences (factors of 2 to 5) were observed between the calculated values of (Ct) avg and those based on measured values of force-line deflection. It is also shown that there is a high risk of obtaining invalid data in longer hold time tests under force-control conditions. The usefulness of DEN(T-C) specimens for crack growth studies under displacement controlled conditions to combat ratcheting problems in tests conducted under load conditions is established. The tests conditions for the round-robin program on creep-fatigue crack growth testing in support of ASTM E- 2760 are finalized.

A baseline geometric model was developed, with ADLPIPE computer code, Version 2 ElA, 1984. Several seismic analyses were performed by iteration with the maximum number of snubbers reduced to obtain a support configuration having acceptable anchor and support loads as well as acceptable piping stresses. A thermal analysis was performed at an operating temperature of 965 {degrees}F (518 {degrees}C) to qualify the piping system following the replacement of some seismic snubbers with rigid supports. A series of displacements from flow- or pump-induced vibration were measured. These vibrations, on the order of tens of seconds or minutes apart, were not continuous and steady, but rather of a series of forced displacements that rapidly damped out to zero. A scoping evaluation of the effect of the vibration found that the calculated stress is within limits. Results of the stress analysis of the piping with snubber reduction are qualified in accordance with ASME, Section III, Class 1, requirements.

The simulations predict earlier cavity nucleation in creep or dwell-fatigue than in pure fatigue, which is consistent with the performed experiments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} process {{reactors}} in refinery and petrochemical industry {{are constructed using}} low chrome alloys which are operating in the creep range and are in cyclic service. ASME B&PV Section VIII Code provides allowable stresses at elevated temperatures for design of reactor components, which are controlled by creep properties. However, fatigue design rules and fatigue exemption rules are not applicable, precluding construction of reactors using low chrome alloys at temperatures above 371 °C (7000 F). ASME B&PV Section III Division 1 - Subsection NH (ASME-NH) Code considers cyclic failure modes at elevated temperatures and provides <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> rules and damage limits. In this paper, creep-fatigue damage under elevated temperatures is investigated for process reactor components using elastic analysis method of ASME-NH Code for a defined representative load cycle. Also the complexities in application procedures of ASME-NH rules with thermal and structural analysis results are described in detail...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Low cyclic {{behavior}} of a new type near-α titanium alloy containing rare earth Nd (Ti 60) with and without dwell time introduced at maximum tensile strain has been investigated at ambient temperature and 600 ℃. The results show that, Ti 60 alloy exhibits a cyclic softening behavior at almost all strain levels being investigated. The cyclic processes show good agreement with predictions based on the fatigue crack propagation model. At 600 ℃, the LCF life of Nd-bearing near-α titanium alloy is superior to that at room temperature within the investigated strain range, which indicates that Ti 60 alloy is {{a good candidate for}} high temperature component under complicated load and temperature conditions. The results also show that the <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> is related to the strain range applied. The creep-fatigue fracture is characterized by transgranular fracture mode due to the formation of matrix voids induced by Nd-bearing particles...|$|E
40|$|Even at room temperature, {{solder joints}} exhibit both creep and fatigue {{behavior}} that {{is strongly dependent on}} solder joint configuration, the thermal environment, and the solder alloy properties. The microstructures of solder joints with up to 25 years of aging have been studied using SEM/EDS and metallographic techniques. Data are presented on grain growth and metallurgical composition versus aging time. A special nonlinear finite element creep-fatigue simulation model has been developed, based on measured strain-rate hardness relationships, and used to analytically predict the effects of observed metallurgical changes and the effects of lead stiffness in solder joint <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction.</b> To cor-roborate the analytical results, a special bimetallic test fixture has been developed to accelerate the thermo-mechanical loading of solder joints in thermal cycling environments. Measured time-to-failure data for various electronic-package lead configurations/stiffnesses, including gullwing and J-lead, are presented and shown to be in reasonable agreement with the analytical results...|$|E
40|$|Strain-controlled {{low-cycle fatigue}} (LCF) tests were {{conducted}} on ductile cast iron (DCI) at strain rates of 0. 02, 0. 002, and 0. 0002 /s in the temperature range from room temperature to 1073 K (800 0 C). A constitutive-damage model was developed within the integrated creep-fatigue theory (ICFT) framework on the premise of strain decomposition into rate-independent plasticity and time-dependent creep. Four major damage mechanisms: (i) plasticity-induced fatigue, (ii) intergranular embrittlement (IE), (iii) creep, and (iv) oxidation were considered in a nonlinear <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> model which represents the overall damage accumulation process consisting of oxidation-assisted fatigue crack nucleation and propagation in coalescence with internally distributed damage (e. g., IE and creep), leading to final fracture. The model was found {{to agree with the}} experimental observations of the complex DCI-LCF phenomena, for which the linear damage summation rule would fail.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated creep-fatigue (ICF) theory {{to describe the}} non-linear <b>creep-fatigue</b> <b>interaction</b> during thermo-mechanical loading. The ICF theory recognizes the damage evolution as a holistic process consisting of nucleation and propagation of surface or subsurface cracks in coalescence with internally distributed damage, leading to final fracture. In a polycrystalline material under combined cyclic and dwell loading, crack nucleation and propagation occurs by fatigue or oxidation mechanisms, whereas internally distributed damage often occurs {{in the form of}} grain boundary cavities or microcracks due to creep or dwell effects, particularly at high temperatures. Based on the above mechanism, a damage evolution equation is mathematically derived, and the generality of the above physical mechanisms warrants the applicability of the ICF theory over a wide range of stresses and temperatures. This paper uses Mar-M 509, a cobalt base superalloy, as an example to illustrate how the ICF theory describes creep and low cycle fatigue (LCF). Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
