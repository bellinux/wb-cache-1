5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter <b>Classic</b> and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter <b>Classic</b> has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter <b>Classic</b> was held on January 1, 2009, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since. The league expanded its offerings of outdoor games with the introduction of the NHL Stadium Series in 2014. Since the inaugural Winter <b>Classic,</b> the NHL has held 13 additional outdoor games.|$|E
5|$|During the Terminal <b>Classic,</b> El Chal {{maintained}} its primary {{place in the}} San Juan valley. This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late <b>Classic</b> monuments. The continued importance of El Chal in the Terminal <b>Classic</b> resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo {{to the west and}} Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During the Terminal <b>Classic,</b> El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>Classic</b> ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits.
