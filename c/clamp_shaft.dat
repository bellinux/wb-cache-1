5000|$|C-clamps {{function}} by affixing a bolt (the [...] "shaft bolt") to {{the hardware}} {{they are to}} hold in place, such as through the yoke of a lighting instrument, and securely fastening this bolt to the <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft.</b> The open end of the clamp is then placed over the batten, and a bolt (the [...] "clamp bolt") is tightened to secure the c-clamp. C-clamps for stage lighting fixtures usually also have a pan screw (also known as a [...] "grub bolt"), which when loosened will allow the <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft,</b> and therefore the fixture, to be rotated 360 degrees while maintaining a secure connection to the batten.|$|E
5000|$|A tweezer clamp {{consists}} of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5 - 10 cm (2 - 4 in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together {{at one end and}} open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1 cm rubber sheath over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places {{the two sides of the}} metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring [...] - [...] the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{effect of}} impact tool {{geometry}} and soft material covering on bone fracture patterns {{plays a major}} role in fracture patterns. However, the literature is nearly void of such studies and only general correlations between the fracture pattern and the mechanism underlying the insult were reported. Purpose The aim of this study is to reveal the association between the geometry of the impact tool and the presence of soft material covering on bone fracture patterns. The Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with additional bone compression simulating a situation occurring in pedestrian road traffic accidents. Five different tests using varying impact tool sizes with and without soft interface covering were carried out. Results A significant positive correlation was found between the fracture features and the impact tool’s geometry. Only bones that were damaged by a rounded impact body result in a “false” butterfly fragment; in all other cases where the impact body is flat and wide, double trapezoid fragments are observed in the area of impact. The impacted aspect is the most affected. All fracture line features were significantly greater in bones subjected to an impact by tools without soft covering. With an impact with soft covering, the impacted aspect exhibits numerous unique fracture lines and a fragmented pattern. Our study clearly shows that impact tool geometry and soft material covering markedly affect the fracture pattern...|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{innovative}} and useful of the collars is the two-piece clamping collar. Two-piece clamp-style shaft collars can be disassembled or installed in position without having to remove other components from the shaft. The two-piece design provides greater clamping force than a single piece clamp {{because all of the}} force is transferred directly into <b>clamping</b> the <b>shaft.</b> In single piece designs, the non-tightened side provides negative force as it must hold the collar open to allow it to be placed onto the shaft. The single tightener must work against this force as well as provide clamping force of its own.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{direction}} of the impact and the presence of axial loading on fracture patterns have not yet been established in experimental 3 -point bending studies. Purpose: To reveal the association between {{the direction of the}} force and the fracture pattern, with and without axial loading. Material and methods: A Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone <b>clamp</b> <b>shaft</b> was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with and without additional bone compression. Four different directions of the force were applied: anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial. Results: the impacted aspect can be distinguished from the non-impacted aspects based on the fracture pattern alone (the most fractured one); the impact point can be identified on bare bones (the area from which all oblique lines radiate and/or the presence of a chip fragment). None of our experiments (with and without compression) yielded a “true” butterfly fracture, but instead, oblique radiating lines emerged from the point of impact (also known as “false” butterfly). Impacts on the lateral and anterior aspects of the bones produce more and longer fracture lines than impacts on the contralateral side; bones subjected to an impact with axial loading are significantly more comminuted and fragmented. Under axial loading, the number of fracture lines is independent of the impact direction. Our study presents an experimental model for fracture analysis and shows that the impact direction and the presence of axial loading during impact significantly affect the fracture pattern obtained...|$|E

50|$|The {{designs for}} this church {{contained}} many miscalculations, causing {{the weight of}} the dome to be too much for the pillars. The substrate was made up of two curved arc galleries, one {{on either side of the}} longitudinal axis. To address the weight problems, various anchors and iron bands were applied. Of the five Doric columns only the middle one kept its originally designed appearance. The other four were connected to one another in pairs by three steel rods that were riveted with <b>clamps</b> around the <b>shafts</b> of the columns. To conceal these constructive interventions the arch openings of these bays were partially filled with stucco and decorative sculpture. As the original plans had to be adjusted several times to correct the errors, the proportions of the church are not perfect.|$|R
40|$|Spaceflight optical {{instruments}} have two conflicting requirements. They {{need to be}} both rigid and lightweight. In addition, for interferometric far ultraviolet spectrometers, the requirements for precision positioning are more severe than for conventional spectrometers. To {{meet the challenge of}} lightweight {{optical instruments}}, a modular adjustment mechanism was developed to position two orthogonal axes of a universal three-axis gimbal support system with a positioning accuracy on the order of 10 arc seconds. The mechanism was designed as a self-contained assembly which can be removed after final alignment of a spacebound optical instrument to reduce its in-flight mass. To demonstrate the concept, a number of these assemblies were made and mounted on two of the positioning axes of a far ultraviolet spatial heterodyne interferometer. A <b>shaft</b> <b>clamp</b> was used on each positioning axis to retain the adjusted position. This paper describes the design of the mechanism and presents optical test results...|$|R
30|$|A closed {{reduction}} of the fracture was performed under image intensification in both the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral planes before application of the fixator. Patients were placed supine on an orthopaedic table and closed reduction was usually accomplished by applying traction and internal rotation to the slightly adducted injured limb. The reduction was considered anatomical if the neck-shaft angle was between 120 ° and 140 ° and the distraction at the fracture site was less than 2  mm. Minor valgus angulation (< 10 °) and a distraction of less than 5  mm were considered acceptable if an anatomical reduction could not be obtained. The fixator was applied using the AO principles and technique [5]. Two Schanz screws were inserted through stab incisions, {{from the base of}} the greater trochanter, across the fracture site into the femoral head. Another three Schanz screws were inserted at right angles into the middle half of the femoral <b>shaft.</b> <b>Clamps</b> were tightened and the final position was checked radiologically. On the first postoperative day, the patients started sitting on a bed or a chair, and from the second postoperative day, walking on a walker frame was started allowing full weight bearing as tolerated by the patient [14]. Daily care of the Schanz screws and the surrounding skin using povidone iodine solution was applied meticulously. All patients were followed up for a mean of 12  ±  4.5  months. The patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically, bi-weekly for the first month, then monthly for the next 5  months, and subsequently every 6  months. The radiological evaluation of all patients was made with AP and lateral radiographs of the proximal femur. Clinical examination included range of motion of the hip, knee and limb-length discrepancy. Operative time, units of transfused blood, duration of hospitalisation, complications, post-operative walking ability, healing time, and mortality were recorded for a minimum of 6  months.|$|R
40|$|For {{monitoring}} of the engine power of fishing vessels permitted for fishery in the plaice box with engine power of 300 HP or less at sea three different portable power measurement systems are developed and tested. A system measuring the twist of the propeller shaft by two divisible gearwheels mounted on the shaft worked well at shafts with roller bearing at {{both sides of the}} measured interval of 100 – 300 mm length. Only at a very few fishing vessels this system is applicable and therefore for monitoring purposes not suitable. The application of a commercial available system measuring the stress at the surface of the shaft was simplified for application by non experts. The torque is measured by strain gauges. The calibration of the system, measuring and recording of the power is done by a PC automatically. A small polished facet on the shaft protected against oxidation is needed for easy and quick application. In this case the system can be used by technical personnel of supervision boats for {{monitoring of}} the engine power at sea in a short time. A third power measurement system determinates the torque by measuring the displacement of two supports <b>clamped</b> on the <b>shaft</b> at a distance of 100 mm. The displacement is measured by a micrometer gauge mounted on one of the supports. Readout of the rotating gauge display is possible taking advantage of stroboscopic effect. The system needs no conditioning of the shaft and can be used by non technicians. The development is not finished until now and some additional investigations and tests are required. Additional measures for {{monitoring of the}} power on fishing vessels by self recording power measurement systems and sealed fuel racks with limited injection are reported and discussed...|$|R
