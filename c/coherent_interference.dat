40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that the standard}} Capon beamformer (SCB) suffers from severe signal cancellation when {{the knowledge of the}} signal-of-interest (SOI) steering vector is imprecise, the snapshot number is small (which can also be viewed as a steering vector error problem), or the interference is correlated with the SOI. Hence the SCB performs poorly in some applications, such as in a global positioning sys-tem (GPS), where SOI steering vector errors and <b>coherent</b> multipath <b>interferences</b> exist. In this paper, we propose a Capon beamformer that is robust against both SOI steering vector errors and <b>coherent</b> <b>interferences</b> provided that the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the coherent multipaths are approximately known relative to the DOA of SOI. Numeri-cal examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coherent robust Capon beamformer, which we will designate by the acronym CRCB. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the interaction between excitons and a sea of incoherent electrons does not preclude excitons dressing by light. We investigate the role of exciton-electron scattering in the light dressing by measuring the dynamical absorption spectrum of a modulation-doped CdTe quantum well, which shows a clear evidence for significant electron scattering of the excitonic states. We show the occurrence of dressed and correlated excitons by detecting quantum <b>coherent</b> <b>interferences</b> through excitonic Autler-Townes doublet and ac Stark splitting, which evolves to Mollow triplet with gain. We also evidence the partial inhibition of the electron-exciton scattering by exciton-light coupling...|$|R
50|$|With a seismic array the {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of a seismic signal {{can be improved}} by summing the coherent signals from the single array sites.

40|$|The {{multipath}} effect {{creates a}} highly correlated interference. Subsequently, small aperture array antennas equipped in mobile devices {{must be able}} to effectively cancel this <b>coherent</b> <b>interference.</b> Spatial smoothing MMSE is a typical <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> cancellation algorithm; however, this method further reduces the small aperture size and reduces the number of coherent interferences to cancel out. This paper proposes a new method to reject coherent interferences without a reduction in the antenna aperture size. We show the superiority of the proposed algorithm through a comparison of cancellation performance with existing adaptive beamforming algorithms...|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} {{frequency domain}} interferometry (FDI) {{for use as}} a medical acoustic imager to detect multiple targets with high range resolution. The phase of each frequency component of an echo varies with the frequency, and target intervals can be estimated from the phase variance. This processing technique is generally used in radar imaging. When the interference within a range gate is coherent, the cross correlation between the desired signal and the <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> signal is nonzero. The Capon method works under the guiding principle that output power minimization cancels the desired signal with a <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> signal. Therefore, we utilize frequency averaging to suppress the correlation of the <b>coherent</b> <b>interference.</b> The results of computational simulations using a pseudoecho signal show that the Capon method with adaptive frequency averaging (AFA) provides a higher range resolution than a conventional method. These techniques were experimentally investigated and we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method of processing by FDI...|$|E

40|$|In theory the linearly {{constrained}} {{minimum variance}} (LCMV) beamformer can achieve perfect dereverberation and noise cancellation when the acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between all sources (including interferences) and the microphones are known. However, blind {{estimation of the}} ATFs remains a difficult task. In this paper the noise reduction of the LCMV beamformer is analyzed and compared with the noise reduction of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. In addition, it is shown that the constraint of the LCMV can be modified such that we only require relative transfer functions rather than ATFs to achieve perfect cancellation of <b>coherent</b> <b>interferences.</b> Finally, we evaluate the noise reduction performance achieved by the LCMV and MVDR beamformers for two coherent sources: one desired and one undesired.

The photoresist layer is exposed to a <b>coherent</b> light <b>interference</b> pattern that includes periodically alternately spaced dark bands and light bands along a first orientation. The photoresist layer exposed to the <b>coherent</b> light <b>interference</b> pattern along a second orientation, transverse to the first orientation. The photoresist layer developed so as to remove photoresist from areas corresponding to areas of intersection of the dark bands of the interference pattern along the first orientation and the dark bands of the interference pattern along the second orientation, thereby leaving an ordered array of holes passing through the photoresist layer. The photoresist layer and the nanowire growth layer are placed into a nanowire growth environment, thereby growing nanowires from the nanowire growth layer through the array of holes.

40|$|Abstract—The {{transmission}} speed of optical networks strongly {{depends on the}} impact of higher order dispersion. In the presence of <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> which can’t be kept under control by optical filtering, the impact of higher order dispersion becomes more serious. In this paper we give general expressions that describe pulse deformation due to even higher order dispersion in a single-mode fiber. The impulsive responses for even order dispersion in the presence of <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> are characterized by symmetrical waveforms with long trailing skirts. Individual and joint influence of second and fourth order dispersion on the transmission quality is studied. Pulse shape and eye diagram are obtained. 1...|$|E

Similarly, the laser-assisted photoemission effect (LAPE) induces electron-photon energy exchange (with momentum change), and also {{results in a}} discrete energy distribution.

40|$|The JETSET {{experiment}} (PS 202) {{conducted at}} CERN {{was designed to}} search for gluonic resonances in the mass range between 2. 1 and 2. 4 GeV using the channel pp to phi phi. This channel is OZI suppressed, thus any observed enhancement of the cross section beyond expectations of theOZI rule could indicate possible resonating gluonic degrees of freedom. Infact, the measured cross section is two orders of magnitude beyond OZI expectations. Subsequent spin-parity analyses have suggested a resonance with adominant J = 2 spin component and a parity of + 1. Recently, another spin-parity analysis has been performed. This analysis includes the possibility of <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> with a scaler background. It will be summarized that the overall fit quality improves when <b>coherent</b> <b>interference</b> is included.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a novel robust {{noncoherent}} receiver for MMSE {{interference suppression}} for DS–CDMA is proposed.

It is shown that the loss compared to <b>coherent</b> MMSE <b>interference</b> suppression is limited and can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the observation window used for calculation of the reference symbol of the DF–DD. For adjustment of the MMSE filter coefficients a noncoherent normalized least– mean–square (NC–NLMS) algorithm is proposed which is roboust against channel phase variations. 1...|$|R

The concept is based on self-organized anisotropic strain engineering of strained layer templates and is demonstrated for (In,Ga) As/GaAs superlattice structures on GaAs (100) and strain-induced (In,Ga) As growth instability on GaAs (311) B. The well-defined one- and two-dimensional networks of InAs quantum dots grown on top of these templates are of excellent structural and optical quality.

40|$|A broken {{symmetry}} {{is generally}} {{believed to be}} a prerequisite of plasmonic electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT), since the asymmetry renders the excitation of the otherwise forbidden dark mode possible. Nevertheless, according to the picture of magnetic-plasmon resonance (MPR) mediated plasmonic EIT, we show that the plasmonic EIT can be achieved even in the symmetric structures based on the second-order MPR.
