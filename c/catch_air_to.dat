5000|$|Dropped down to maiden race {{company for}} his three-year-old debut, he {{recorded}} a first victory at Newbury before moving into Classic contention {{by winning the}} Chester Vase. After the race, Millenary, described as [...] "a big, gangly horse" [...] by his trainer's representative was quoted at 25-1 for the Epsom Derby. In the event, it was Sakhee who represented the stable at Epsom with Millenary traveling to Chantilly for the Prix du Jockey-Club where he finished unplaced behind Holding Court. Returning to England, he recorded a short-head win in the Gordon Stakes, coming from last <b>to</b> first <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>Air</b> Marshall close <b>to</b> the finish.|$|R

50|$|SCAD diving (Suspended <b>Catch</b> <b>Air</b> Device) {{is similar}} to bungee jumping in that the {{participant}} is dropped from a height, but in this variation there is no cord; instead the participant free falls into a net.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "inversion" [...] {{occurs when}} one skirt of the canopy blows between the {{suspension}} {{lines on the}} opposite side of the parachute and then <b>catches</b> <b>air.</b> That portion then forms a secondary lobe with the canopy inverted. The secondary lobe grows until the canopy turns completely inside out.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may climb to the tips of plants <b>to</b> leap and <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|The Main Fork: Riders {{would ride}} under a {{drenching}} waterfall {{into a dark}} tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. [...] Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a foot-high (30cm) jump where the rafts would momentarily <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> and then slam back onto the surface.|$|R
50|$|Under moist conditions, the elaters curl {{tightly around}} the spore. The wet spores tend {{to stick to}} each other and to nearby {{surfaces}} because of surface tension. When conditions are dry, the spores no longer stick {{to each other and}} are more easily dispersed. At that time, the elaters uncoil to extend out from the spore and will <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> currents. The fact that they are extended only when conditions are dry means that successful spore dispersal is more likely.|$|R

Sébastien Bourdais swept both the pole and the race win. The race was notable for the large bump on the main {{straight}} where a light rail track crossed the course, the bump being large enough to cause the cars <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cranberry girdler, Chrysoteuchia topiaria, was {{monitored}} with pheromone traps in Wisconsin cranberry farms. Cumulative 50 % capture {{was related}} to degree-days after first <b>catch</b> using <b>air</b> or soil temperature. An air temperature of O°C and soil temperature of 2 °C were chosen as base temperatures for calculation of degree-days because they yielded estimates with the lowest coefficients of variation. Weibull functions were fitted to the relation- ship between cumulative percent capture and time or degree-days after first trap <b>catch</b> using <b>air</b> or soil temperatures. The models that predicted the date of 50 % capture were evaluated with data from two other farms. Degree-days after first catch using soil temperatures predicted 50 % catch with less variability than calendar date or degree-days after thaw of ice. but not significantly less variability than days after first catch or degree-days after first <b>catch</b> using <b>air</b> temperatures...|$|R
25|$|After the Catch is a {{roundtable}} documentary-style television mini-series {{that follows}} the captains from Deadliest Catch when they're not fishing. The captains and crew members swap stories about the experiences and sights while fishing the Bering Sea. The spin-off series is produced in partnership with Original Productions and Silent Crow Arts. The first season aired in 2007, filmed at the Lockspot Cafe, a bar in Seattle Ballard neighborhood, hosted by Deadliest Catch narrator Mike Rowe. After the <b>Catch</b> II <b>aired</b> in 2008, filmed at Pratty's Bar in Gloucester, Massachusetts and hosted by Rowe. The third season, titled After the <b>Catch</b> III, <b>aired</b> in 2009 and was filmed at RTs Longboard Bar and Grill in San Diego with Cash Cab Ben Bailey hosting. After the <b>Catch</b> IV <b>aired</b> in 2010, and was filmed at the Blue Nile bar in New Orleans, with Rowe returning as host.|$|R

Using the arrow keys, the player {{controls}} {{the angle of the}} penguin as he flies, and <b>catches</b> <b>air</b> currents (the closer to an ideal angle, the better the currents) to stay in the air. The videos of records all show the flight starting on a low trajectory, with little manipulation of arrow keys to get better angle, meaning an ideal angle is kept throughout the flight.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 October 2003, while {{participating}} in the inaugural Go Fast Games, Weston was killed attempting to fly over the Royal Gorge Bridge near Cañon City, Colorado. [...] Weston was wearing a wingsuit, a skydiving suit with fabric extended below the arms to the body and between the legs <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> allowing for horizontal travel when skydiving. [...] Weston was {{to go over the}} bridge while fellow skydiver Jeb Corliss was to go under it. [...] Just prior to the jump, Weston said to Corliss, [...] "Whatever happens happens".|$|R
50|$|The Queensland Government {{moved the}} people of Aureed to Masig after it was {{declared}} a government reserve. Luggers owned by Masig families continued to operate until the shell industry collapsed in the 1960s. The people then shifted successfully into commercial mackerel fishing, prawning and crayfishing. A highly profitable fish factory has operated on the island since the late 1970s, freezing the <b>catch</b> and <b>air</b> freighting it <b>to</b> southern markets.|$|R
50|$|A {{closing pin}} is a curved piece of {{stainless}} steel metal used in the sport of skydiving. The pin is sewn onto the bridle which is a 7 to 10-foot long piece of nylon webbing connected to the pilot chute. The closing pin passes through the closing loop and in doing so, secures the main container of a skydiving rig, keeping the parachute from deploying prematurely. When the pilot chute is thrown out by the skydiver and <b>catches</b> <b>air,</b> it pulls the closing pin from the closing loop and allows the main parachute {{to be released from}} the container and inflate.|$|R

A few of the lead cars went around Lepage on the outside, but Carl Edwards ran over the back end of Lepage's car, causing Edwards <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> and set off a 15-car pile up. The drivers involved were Lepage, Edwards, Kyle Busch, David Reutimann, Reed Sorenson, Brad Keselowski, Cale Gale, Patrick Carpentier, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace, Steve Wallace, Marcos Ambrose, Stephen Leicht, Kyle Krisiloff and Kelly Bires.|$|R
5000|$|A {{front-end}} bra (car bra, bonnet bra, front-end cover, hood bra, auto bra, hood mask, car mask, etc.) is a stretchy type of vinyl (usually black) that {{attaches to}} the front of a car or other vehicle to protect the bumper, hood, and sides of the fender from scratches, although not everyone agrees: it is argued that car bras can cause damage by retaining moisture, <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> (reducing aerodynamics and causing the fabric to vibrate), and cause scratches in paintwork, paint chipping, and other minor [...] from rocks, gravel, and other road debris. The inside of the bra is lined with a feltlike material.|$|R
5000|$|Market Wise raced at {{age five}} in 1943. On {{the way to}} being voted American Co-Champion Older Male Horse, he won the Massachusetts Handicap and the Narragansett Special. In the Massachusetts Handicap in July, Market Wise carried top weight of 126 pounds and won with an [...] "amazing last-minute burst" [...] in a stakes record of 1:52.6 despite {{sustaining}} a [...] "spread foot". Two months later in the Narragansett Special, he produced a powerful late run <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>Air</b> Master in the closing stages, with Thumbs Up third and Shut Out fourth. He returned to the winners' circle limping badly after sustaining a quarter crack.|$|R
25|$|Ptychozoon flying geckos. There are six {{species of}} gliding gecko, {{of the genus}} Ptychozoon, from Southeast Asia. These lizards have small flaps of skin along their limbs, torso, tail, and head that <b>catch</b> the <b>air</b> and enable them to glide.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} flyingfishes, the Atlantic flyingfish has a {{cylindrical}} body, and large tail and pectoral fins that it uses for flight. To fly, the Atlantic flyingfish {{jumps out of}} the water, uses its pectoral fins <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> currents and provide lift, and beats its tail back and forth to provide thrust. The longest recorded individual was 32 cm long, but most adults are roughly 25 cm long. Atlantic flyingfish are generally green to blue dorsally, and white or silver ventrally. After reaching a speed of 30 km/h, Atlantic flyingfish can jump {{out of the water and}} glide about 3 to 12 m. This is presumably done to avoid ocean-going predators.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2003, while {{performing}} a proximity demonstration, wingsuiter Dwain Weston was killed attempting {{to fly over}} the bridge. [...] Weston was wearing a wingsuit, a skydiving suit with fabric extended below the arms to the body and between the legs <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> allowing for horizontal travel when skydiving. He was {{to go over the}} bridge while fellow skydiver Jeb Corliss was to go under it. Misjudging his distance from the bridge, Weston struck a railing while traveling an estimated 120 mph, severing his leg at the hip. He fell onto a ledge in the gorge under a parachute that had opened on impact, though it is assumed he had already died.|$|R

50|$|The {{headgear}} {{worn by the}} 14th Brooklyn was a {{navy blue}} and red kepi. The top of the cap was covered in dark navy blue and the lower half by a dark red with a band of blue around {{the bottom of the}} cap. Upon the front of the cap the regiment had the number 14 and above it was the company designation. On the sides of the caps were New York state buttons holding the chin strap onto the kepi. At the First Battle of Bull Run the 14th were issued havelocks, a white material that fitted over the kepis and had a long piece of cloth that hung down below over the neck. The idea was <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>air</b> and cool the neck of the soldier. The havelocks proved ineffective as headgear, however many were used as bandages on the battlefield.|$|R

500|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously with oxygen at {{standard}} conditions. They form {{various types of}} oxides, such as simple oxides (containing the O2− ion), peroxides (containing the [...] ion, {{where there is a}} single bond between the two oxygen atoms), superoxides (containing the [...] ion), and many others. Lithium burns in <b>air</b> <b>to</b> form lithium oxide, but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide. Potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide, while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric (spontaneously <b>catch</b> fire in <b>air).</b>|$|R
