40|$|Both the EU and Austria target their road {{transport}} policies at eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks, securing the requisite investment financing {{and reducing the}} environmental and accident costs of road traffic. Taxes and dues imposed on motorisation can be designed so as {{to compensate for the}} infrastructure costs and as an economic incentive to reduce external costs. Even though the mineral oil tax currently serves purely fiscal purposes, it could well be seen as a key to policies regarding transportation and the environment. Increasing this tax will cut fuel consumption, which in turn will reduce environmental costs (arising from the emission of CO 2 and pollutants); mileage cuts on the part of motorists in turn reduce noise and the cost of congestion and accidents. The mineral oil tax could also {{serve as a model for}} a general European toll for all types of roads. To this end, it would be necessary to introduce a uniform tax rate throughout the EU. Congestion problems in agglomerations can be solved by <b>local</b> <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> (such as a city toll modelled along London's congestion charge).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of tolling road use on a {{parallel}} network when different governments have tolling authority on the different links of the network. The paper analyses the tax competition between countries that each maximise the surplus of local users plus tax revenues. Three types of <b>tolling</b> <b>systems</b> are considered: (i) <b>toll</b> discrimination between <b>local</b> and transit traffic, (ii) uniform <b>tolls</b> on <b>local</b> and transit traffic, (iii) only <b>local</b> <b>tolls</b> can be imposed. The paper characterises the optimal toll levels chosen in a Nash equilibrium for the three <b>tolling</b> <b>systems.</b> The numerical illustration shows that introducing transit taxes generates large welfare effects and that <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> that only apply to local users only generate a low welfare gain. Nash equilibrium <b>toll</b> discrimination between <b>local</b> and transit traffic generates slightly higher welfare than the solution where both tolls have to be uniform...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study tax {{competition}} on a parallel road network when different governments have tolling authority on different links of the network. Reflecting many current situations in Europe, each link is used by both local and transit traffic, and transit has a choice of route. Each government maximises the surplus of local users plus total tax revenues in controlling local and transit transport. Three types of <b>tolling</b> <b>systems</b> are considered: (i) <b>toll</b> discrimination between <b>local</b> traffic and transit, (ii) uniform <b>tolls</b> on <b>local</b> and transit transport, (iii) <b>local</b> <b>tolls</b> only. The results suggest that the welfare effects of introducing transit tolls are large, but that differentiation of <b>tolls</b> between <b>local</b> and transit transport as compared to uniform tolls does not yield large welfare differences. Moreover, the welfare effects of coordination between countries are relatively small in comparison with the welfare gains of tolling transit. Numerical application of the model further illustrates the effects of different transit shares and explicitly considers the role of asymmetries between countries. Higher transit shares strongly raise the Nash equilibrium transit toll and slightly decrease <b>local</b> <b>tolls.</b> With asymmetric demands, the welfare gains of introducing differentiated tolling rise strongly for the country with lower local demand...|$|R

5000|$|A local {{exchange}} carrier is a carrier of telephone calls and {{other communication services}} carried by telephone lines. A {{local exchange}} is generally either an exchange within one's own LATA or in an immediately adjacent LATA. A call that is neither local nor long distance is called a <b>local</b> <b>toll</b> call. A <b>local</b> exchange carrier normally sells package deals that include <b>local</b> and <b>local</b> <b>toll</b> calls. <b>Local</b> calls are customarily billed in by the call, or in blocks of calls. Residential local exchange carrier service typically charges , where [...] is the monthly minimum and covers the first [...] calls, [...] is the price per local call, and [...] is the total quantity of calls consumed. <b>Local</b> <b>toll</b> calls are each billed at , where [...] is minimum charge for a <b>local</b> <b>toll</b> call, [...] is the per-minute charge, and [...] is {{the duration of the}} call in minutes. <b>Local</b> <b>toll</b> calls are traditionally grouped into two price ranges, called [...] "near zone" [...] and [...] "far zone", with values of [...] and [...] higher for far zone.|$|R
