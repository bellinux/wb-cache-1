5000|$|Rear cargo or pannier rack: Some improvised hitches {{attach to}} the rear <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> or pannier frame. Since rear racks are not {{structural}} parts of the bicycle they cannot handle much weight or torque loading.|$|E
5000|$|The dual seat {{contains}} a storage compartment adequate {{for a single}} full-face helmet. The rear <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> {{can be used for}} additional carrying capacity but requires the use of ropes or bungee cords to secure any load. This rack can also function as passenger grabrails. The Zuma has [...] "Bug-eyed" [...] dual headlights that come with one light wired to low beam and the other wired to high beam (both lamps have filaments for high and low beam functions, however, and many users install an inexpensive and simple wiring modification to make both headlamps light with both the high and low beams). The instrument panel has turn signal indicators, a high beam indicator, a low-oil indicator, a speedometer, a gas level gauge, and an odometer.|$|E
40|$|A <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> with a {{removable}} folding ramp was constructed to load and transport recreational vehicles. This requires a lightweight design that provides enough strength {{to support the}} projected loads. The testing will consist of loading 450 pounds on the <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> and using the ramp to load 750 pounds. The results for the testing will be successfully transporting a 450 -pound load on the <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> and successfully loading a 750 -pound load with the ramp. This paper further explains the process of designing and manufacturing the <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> and ramp. The design was obtained {{with the use of}} beam deflection and shear stress. The lengthy manufacturing process will also be broken down in this paper. Keywords: <b>Cargo</b> <b>Rack,</b> Ramp, Load, Transporting, Beam Deflection, Shear Stress, Manufacturing...|$|E
50|$|Mountain bikes {{fitted with}} slick or semi-slick {{are also popular}} for commuters. Though less efficient, the upright riding {{position}} allows the cyclist {{a better view of}} traffic, and they can also be readily fitted with mudguards, <b>cargo</b> <b>racks</b> and other accessories.|$|R
50|$|Handcycles {{have also}} been used for touring, and to better {{accommodate}} this interest, some manufacturers incorporate mudguards and pannier <b>cargo</b> <b>racks.</b> As handcycles have evolved they have become progressively lighter, and they have better gearing for long climbs and long distance touring.|$|R
50|$|The CRS Dragon {{design was}} {{modified}} {{beginning with the}} fifth Dragon flight on the SpaceX CRS-3 mission to the ISS in March 2014. While the outer mold line of the Dragon was unchanged, the avionics and <b>cargo</b> <b>racks</b> were redesigned to supply substantially more electrical power to powered cargo devices, including the GLACIER and MERLIN freezer modules for transporting critical science payloads.|$|R
40|$|The Dragon capsule is a {{reusable}} vehicle {{being developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) that will provide commercial cargo transportation to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon {{is designed to be}} a habitable module while it is berthed to ISS. As such, the Dragon Environmental Control System (ECS) consists of pressure control and pressure equalization, air sampling, fire detection, illumination, and an air circulation system. The air circulation system prevents pockets of stagnant air in Dragon that can be hazardous to the ISS crew. In addition, through the inter-module duct, the air circulation system provides fresh air from ISS into Dragon. To utilize the maximum volume of Dragon for cargo packaging, the Dragon ECS air circulation system is designed around <b>cargo</b> <b>rack</b> optimization. At the same time, the air circulation system is designed to meet the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) inter-module and intra-module ventilation requirements and acoustic requirements. A flight like configuration of the Dragon capsule including the air circulation system was recently assembled for testing to assess the design for inter-module and intra-module ventilation and acoustics. The testing included the Dragon capsule, and flight configuration in the pressure section with cargo racks, lockers, all of the air circulation components, and acoustic treatment. The air circulation test was also used to verify the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the Dragon capsule. The CFD model included the same Dragon internal geometry that was assembled for the test. This paper will describe the Dragon air circulation system design which has been verified by testing the system and with CFD analysis...|$|E
50|$|Other models, {{such as the}} ATC250SX were sold. The ATC250SX was {{the first}} sport utility ATV. It {{featured}} a 250 cc air-cooled four-stroke engine that like the later revised Big Reds, were shaft propeller instead of chain. It featured larger balloon tires and a sportier look than the similar Big Reds, but could be ordered with <b>cargo</b> <b>racks</b> if the buyer chose to.|$|R
50|$|The Chadwick C-122 was a single-seat {{ultralight}} helicopter {{developed in}} the United States in the 1980s. It was a minimalist design consisting of a fibreglass shell enclosing a truss structure to which the engine, rotor mast, landing gear, and pilot's seat were attached. A wide variety of roles were envisaged for the aircraft, and therefore it was equipped with attachment points for spray bars, a cargo hook, external <b>cargo</b> <b>racks,</b> and even weapons for law enforcement work. The skid-type undercarriage could be quickly fitted with wheels for ground-handling, or floats for operations from water.|$|R
50|$|The Resupply Stowage Racks and Resupply Stowage Platforms {{were filled}} with Cargo Transfer Bags that contain {{equipment}} and supplies for the station. The six Resupply Stowage Racks contained almost 1451 kg of cargo and the four Resupply Stowage Platforms contained about 544 kg of cargo, not including {{the weight of the}} Cargo Transfer Bags, the foam packing around the cargo or the straps and fences that held the bags in place. The total weight of <b>cargo,</b> <b>racks</b> and packing material aboard Leonardo was just over 4990 kg. Total cargo weight was about 3073 kg.|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch bike <b>racks,</b> <b>cargo</b> carriers, or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|R
40|$|Suzuki APV has a {{relatively}} high body compare with others vehicle which are typical, especially if it is using a roof rack to carry a cargo. With the increase of the central gravity, it will reduce the vehicle stability. Because of that reason, writer {{want to know what}} is the influences of carrying a <b>cargo</b> on roof <b>rack</b> to the stability and safety of the vehicle when cornering at high speed on a climbing road or a down road. The stability of a vehicle could be discovered when itâ€™s cornering, because at that time the resultant of Central Gravity Vehicle will transpose into a new position in order to the influences of a centrifugal force that work at the body. Analyze done by varying speed, steering angle and roof <b>rack</b> <b>cargo</b> position, and it will gain the centrifugal force that work on vehicle which will affecting the slip angle as a result to the stability of the vehicle by using a skid analysis and rolling analysis. Results from this analysis indicate that the influences of placing a cargo on a roof rack will make Suzuki APV GA type easier to roll at a low steering angle compare with unload vehicle. Also with placing a cargo on a roof rack will make the vehicle tends to over steer compare with Unload vehicle that act Under Steer...|$|R
40|$|In {{the space}} shuttle, a <b>cargo</b> bay storage <b>rack</b> was {{required}} {{which was to}} be manufactured from a metal-plastic composite and bolted to a cargo structure. Following completion, utilization of the rack was disallowed due to tolerances, that is, the size differences between the outside bolt diameter and the inside hole diameter. In addition to the space shuttle problem there are other close tolerance requirements for bolts. Such environments often benefit from close tolerance bolting. Frequently such fabrication is not cost effective. Consequently {{there is a need for}} means of achieving close tolerances between bolts and bolt holes. Such means are provided. After compressing the elements together a strong rigid plastic, ceramic, or ceramic plastic fluid is forced into a channel extending through the bolt...|$|R
