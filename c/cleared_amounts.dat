40|$|Three {{different}} {{estimates of the}} percent of fixed geographical regions (160 x 160 km) either free of cloud (clear) or covered by low, middle, and high (opaque) cloud have been intercompared. The estimates were derived by analysts interpreting geosynchronous satellite images, with concurrent meteorological observations; from Nimbus 7 temperature humidity infrared radiometer (THIR) CLOUD ERB (CLE) data; and from Air Force three dimensional nephanalysis (3 DN) data. Air Force 3 DN agrees better with the analyst than THIR/CLE, except for high cloud amount; the CLE and 3 DN results tend to overestimate <b>clear</b> <b>amount</b> when <b>clear</b> <b>amount</b> is large and underestimate it when <b>clear</b> <b>amount</b> is small, by 10 - 20 percent for CLE and by 5 - 10 percent for 3 DN, and both agree well with the analyst in the mean. Systematic and random errors for 3 DN and CLE are specified. CLE estimates of cloud amount over land at night {{should not be used}} for scientific purposes unless restricted to high cloud amount.

40|$|PURPOSE: Protected {{carotid artery}} stent {{placement}} is currently under clinical evaluation {{as a potential}} alternative to carotid endarterectomy. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of new ischemic lesions found on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in nonselected patients after protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device and to determine the potential relation-ship between these new ischemic lesions and {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>clear</b> <b>amount</b> of debris captured by the neuroprotection filter device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonrandomized cohort of 52 patients (40 men, 12 women) presenting with carotid occlusive disease underwent protected carotid artery stent placement using a filter device. DWI obtained 1 day before stent placement was compared with that obtained 1 day after stent placement. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic analysis of debris captured by the filter device during the carotid stent placement procedure was assessed. RESULTS: Neuroprotected carotid stent placement was technically successful in all 53 procedures but was complicated by a transient ischemic attack in 3 patients (5. 6 %). In 22 patients (41. 5 %), new ischemic lesions were found on DWI, and in 21 filter devices (39. 6 %), a substantial amount of atheromatous plaque and/or fibrin was found.

The development of AKI during sepsis further increases morbidity and mortality in these patients [29].

The exact biological effects of resistin and the underlying intracellular mechanisms remain unknown. Moreover, conventional renal replacement therapies {{do not appear to be}} able to <b>clear</b> excessive <b>amounts</b> of resistin [10, 20]. Here, we present a translational study to further delineate the relationship between excessive amounts of resistin, i.e., hyperresistinemia, and key neutrophil functions.

This paper examines the impact of roads and population pressures on deforestation in Thailand between 1976 and 1989, when the country lost 28 % of its forest cover. To analyze the impact of road building, population growth and physical factors on deforestation, we develop a model in which the <b>amount</b> of land <b>cleared,</b> number of agricultural households and size of the road network are jointly determined. The model assumes that the <b>amount</b> of land <b>cleared</b> reflects an equilibrium in the land market.
