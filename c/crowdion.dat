The kinetic shapes are explained by considering a local action of the stabilized interstitiel centers decreasing the creation yield of new Frenkel pairs. At concentration higher than 1019 cm- 3, the decrease of the F center accumulation yield is due to the possibility of uncorrelated recombinations of the F centers and the H centers moving as dynamical <b>crowdions.</b> Our results suggest also an independent limitation of F and F+ center growth, thus independent formation processes...|$|R

Because of the anisotropic crystallographic structure, irradiation damage accumulation in Zr produces effects {{that are different}} from those in cubic metals. A major difficulty in modeling irradiation damage in Zr is the lack of conclusive information on the anisotropy of the migration of both vacancies and self-interstitials. Self-interstitials diffusion in alpha -Zr is studied using Molecular Dynamic (MD) and molecular static (MS) simulation using Ackland's many-body inter-atomic potential. The basal <b>crowdion</b> configuration is found to be the ground state. The diffusion process in Zr is complex. Four types of diffusion jumps can be identified, two in-plane and two out-of plane.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are the results from an {{integrated}} experimental and modeling study on damage cascade formation in ion bombarded solids. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). In one subtask, we studied damage cascade interactions caused by two 2 keV Si atoms simultaneously bombarding a crystalline Si substrate. We found that the enhanced displacement creation appears primarily in the thermal spike stage with all atoms at energies less than the displacement threshold. The study lead {{to the conclusion that}} the cascade interactions increased local melting by increasing energy deposition density, thus promoting defect creation. In another subtask, we studied radiation damage in Si 0. 8 Ge 2 layer caused by Agn clusters with number of atoms in a cluster, n, taking values from 1 to 4. It showed that strained SiGe, a material known to have poor radiation tolerance, still follows the overlap model, rather than the direct amorphization model. In the third subtask, MD simulation has shown that <b>crowdion</b> defects formed in bcc Fe are propagating along directions. <b>Crowdion</b> defect starts to form when damage cascade reaches the maximum volume and contributes a second peak in defect buildups with increasing times. Upon defect recombination, <b>crowdion</b> defects shrink and form oriented dumbbell defects at the <b>crowdion</b> end. In subsequent structural relaxation, dumbbell defects rotate and finally align themselves with directions. The surviving dumbbell defects represent a significant contribution to the final defect distribution after thermal spike formation. The overall research reveals atomic scale details of damage buildups at early stages of defect developments. Although the target systems cover both semiconductor materials and metal, these results show that MD simulation is a powerful tool to show the details at a spatial and time scale beyond experiments. These details are very important to develop understanding the precursor formation in defect clustering in such a case...|$|E

The rupture of the He clusters and, at the same time, the escape and re-deposition of the W atoms have been observed. During the formation of He clusters, the interstitial W atoms are produced and evolve into bundles of <b>crowdions,</b> which would be constrained around the He clusters for a long time.

40|$|Muscovite mica is {{a mineral}} {{in which the}} tracks of charged swift particles, from {{radioactivity}} or cosmic rays, can be recorded and made visible by decoration with the mineral magnetite. Also, the tracks of quasi-one-dimensional lattice excitations, called quodons, moving along close-packed directions can be recorded. Most quodon tracks evolve from nuclear recoils following decay of the radioactive isotope 40 K in mica. The recording process is charge sensitive: moving positive charge precipitates black magnetite and moving negative charge leads to clear epidote. Computer modeling of lattice excitations suggest that breathers or solitons can trap a charge. Most of the decays of 40 K leave behind a charge, about 90 % of them positive. So the evolution of most quodons from nuclear recoil events occurs {{in the presence of}} a charge. The possible energies and mechanisms of charge transmission in the lattice are analyzed.

40|$|It is {{important}} {{to determine the number}} and configuration of point defects that survive atomic displacement cascades in irradiated materials because only those defects that escape recombination are able to contribute to radiation induced property changes such as void swelling, hardening, embrittlement, and irradiation creep. Simulations of displacement cascades using molecular dynamics are being used to provide a description of the most probable surviving defects. In the case of interstitial-type defects in iron, these are predicted to be and type dumbbells and <b>crowdions,</b> along with small clusters of these same defects. Diffuse x-ray and neutron scattering provides a direct method for obtaining detailed information on the displacement fields both near to and far away from the defects in addition to information on the particular position of the defect. To analyze such radiation damage with diffuse scattering, reciprocal space diffraction from crystals with variously oriented dumbbells and small clusters of dumbbells has been modeled. Diffuse scattering measurements between and close to Bragg reflections are sensitive to the orientation of the dumbbells, and the size and type of the small clusters at sizes that are too small to analyze by electron microscopy. Displacement of the near neighbors induces diffuse scattering in regions between the Bragg peaks, whereas the long range part of the displacement field results in Huang scattering close to the Bragg reflections. Simulation of diffuse scattering by different interstitial defects around (h 00), (hh 0), (hhh), (3 h,h, 0) reflections demonstrates that each defect type leads to distinct isointensity contours. These scattering signatures can be used to determine the type and configuration of the surviving interstitials...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} radiation-induced defects {{traveling}} large distances by focussed collision sequences (focusons) without thermal activation has important consequences in radiation effect studies. The focussed collision sequences are of two types: (1) ''Silsbee focussing'' or momentum focussing {{which can cause}} defect pairs to form large distances from the primary knock-on and (2) focussed replacement collisions also called ''dynamic crowdions'' where mass transport causes a large separation between the vacancy and its interstitial. Direct experimental evidence for focussed collision sequences is in short supply and conflicting. The sputtering patterns associated with close packed crystalline directions from the backscattering of charged particles seemed to substantiate long-range focussed collisions until {{it was pointed out}} that collision chains need not be long to yield such patterns. More recently, transmission sputtering has been used with conflicting results. Ecker et al. found no evidence for focusons greater than 17 atom distances whereas preliminary results of Siedman et al. suggest several hundred atom distances. Keil and co-workers found evidence for replacement collision sequences of 100 atom distances by stereo electron microscopy of interstitial agglomerates interjected by low energy heavy ion bombardment.

The interaction energy between the PD's is found to agree accurately with the elastic-continuum energy beyond and at the equilibrium separation distance whereas the former energy grows much more strongly at smaller separation distances due to the increased core repulsion. This behavior indicates a small core overlap at the equilibrium.

However, the effect of focused collision sequences on the displacement cascade is quite small owing to the upper energy limit Ef of- 100 eV in the focusing process. The basic integral equation governing cascade formation can be modified to account for crystal effects by amending Eq. 17. 65 to produced by a single PKA that receives energy E from a collision with the bombarding particle. In this section the supply of ener ~ to the atoms of a metal from fast neutrons is coupled with cascade theory to permit calculation of the “-” rate at which va{,ancies and interstitial are produced in a specified neutron flux spectrum. No account is taken of the {{reduction in the number of}} displacements due to recombination within the volume of the cascade. Let (r,, (E,,,E) dE be the differential energy-transfer cross wction for the production of PKAs with energies in (E,dE) due to neutrons of ener ~ E,,, Each PKA goes on to produce ~~(E) displaced atoms. If the differential neutron flux isd(E,,), the rate at which atoms are displaced is IK R,l =...|$|E
40|$|The thesis reports several {{questions}} {{that arise in}} connection with the thermally induced phenomenon called superionic conduction in the case of halides and oxides with the fluorite structure, principally (i) how can such large anions in a tightly packed configuration move amongst their neighbours with no apparent disruption? and (ii) how can the experimentally observed <b>crowdion</b> structures that involve more than 25 % reduction in separation of anions be stable? A third question is posed by the experimentally observed specific heat anomaly that always accompanies the increase in anionic mobility with increasing temperature. The literature review found no answers to these questions, and the thesis records two lines of theoretical research that were followed by the author. Both lines sough mechanisms that would break degeneracy and thus allow the observed mobility and clustering. In part 1 the breathing shell concept (Schroder, 1966) is examined. A model was devised to emulate breathing by spatially perturbing the potential constraint used by Watson (1958) to calculate the in-crystal wave function for the O � - (which has not been observed as a free ion). The energetics calculated from this model are compatible with the thermal effects being studied and a scenario is expanded qualitatively to suggest the role of various types of solitions. The author concludes that solitions are largely responsible for the degeneracy breaking and the specific head anomaly. However nothing in Part 1 explains the low temperature stability of the fluorite structure where large anions are clustered. In part 2 a quantum mechanical examination of the cohesive energy of the fluorite structure is undertaken in the specific case of doped Zirconium Dioxide for which there was conveniently available basic data. Watsons wave functions were fed into simple density functionals following the method of Gordon and Kim (1972). This was a seminal and successful application of the so called local density approximation (to a uniform electron gas for the purposes of calculating kinetic and exchange-correlation energies). An improvement is proposed-partitioning the electron population according to orbitals and calculating separate kinetic energies. Using this improvement a double potential well in the cohesive energy is discovered that would explain the clustering of anions in the fluorite structure at low temperatures...|$|E
