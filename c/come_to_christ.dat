60|$|There {{are three}} {{sorts of people}} that {{may be said to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> but not to God by him.|$|E
60|$|A {{man that}} is <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> hath the {{advantage}} of him that is but coming to him; and that in seven things.|$|E
60|$|Object. 3. But I cannot {{believe that}} I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> aright, because {{sometimes}} I am apt to question his very being and office to save.|$|E
60|$|When Lot {{came out}} of Sodom, he left the Sodomites behind him (Gen 19). When Abraham {{came out of}} Chaldea, he left his country and kindred behind him (Gen 12; Acts 7). When Ruth <b>came</b> <b>to</b> put her trust under {{the wings of the}} Lord God of Israel, she left her father and mother, her gods, and the land of her nativity, behind her (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11,12). When Peter <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> he left his nets behind him (Matt 4:20). When Zaccheus <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> he left the receipt of custom behind him (Luke 19). When Paul <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> he left his own righteousness behind him (Phil 3:7,8). When those that used curious arts <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ,</b> they took their curious books and burned them; though, in another man's eye, they were counted worth fifty {{thousand}} pieces of silver (Acts 19:18-20).|$|R
6000|$|The Seraphs <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> and said: [...] "Behold! [...] The man, presumptuous and overbold, [...] Who {{boasted that}} his mercy could excel [...] Thine own, {{is dead and}} {{on his way to}} Hell." ...|$|R
50|$|Limbaugh {{was chosen}} by Christians Norman Geisler and Frank Turek to write the {{foreword}} to their book I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist (Crossway, 2004). In the book, Limbaugh states that he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> after years as a skeptic and is now passionate about Christian apologetics.|$|R
60|$|Answ. What though thou hadst {{the sins}} of a {{thousand}} sinners, yet if thou <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> He will save thee (John 6:37; See also Hebrews 7:25).|$|E
6000|$|... 1. He that is <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> hath found God in him {{reconciling}} {{the world}} unto himself, not imputing their trespasses to them. And so God {{is not to}} be found in heaven and earth besides (2 Cor 5:19,20).|$|E
60|$|I {{tell you}} the thing is a wonder, and must for ever stand for a wonder among the sons of men. It stands also for an {{everlasting}} invitation and allurement to the biggest sinners to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for mercy.|$|E

5000|$|Wright {{was educated}} at St Bees Theological College and ordained in 1852. After serving at Bolton-le-Moors he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> Church in Bolton in 1871. In 1874 he founded a {{football}} club with a teacher, Thomas Ogden, [...] from his church school for ex pupils which in 1877 became Bolton Wanderers. He was its first president.|$|R
25|$|<b>Christ</b> Pantocrator has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> suggest <b>Christ</b> as a mild but stern, all-powerful {{judge of}} humanity.|$|R
6000|$|But {{to speak}} more {{distinctly}} to the words, THEY [...] "SHALL COME," [...] two things I would show you from these words--FIRST, What {{it is to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ.</b> SECOND, What force there is in this promise, to make them come to him.|$|E
60|$|What! <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> {{and find}} nothing in him!--when {{all things that}} are worth looking after are in him!--or if anything, yet not enough to wean thee from thy sinful delights, and fleshly lusts! Away, away, thou art not coming to Jesus Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... [52] He {{that has}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> has cast his burden upon Him. By faith he hath seen himself {{released}} thereof; but he that is but coming, hath it yet, as to sense and feeling, upon his own shoulders-(Come and Welcome, vol. 1, p. 264).|$|E
6000|$|First, Art thou indeed <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ?</b> What hast thou {{left behind}} thee? What didst thou come away from, in thy coming <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, as Glass was {{pastor of}} Tengchow church (Lottie Moon's {{original}} post), revival continued to happen, {{the church was}} packed even during freezing weather, and many <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ.</b> One man noted - “Christ was made real and precious. Opium smokers were delivered from their bondage, the lost were saved, Christians became witnesses, and churches were established that were self-supporting from the first.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. They {{may also}} be carved upon the temple doors, {{to show us how}} ready they are, so soon as any poor {{creature}} <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life <b>to</b> take the care and charge of its conduct through this miserable world. 'Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?' (Heb 1:14).|$|R
6000|$|... 2. He honoureth Christ's person, {{in that he}} believeth {{that there}} is life in him, {{and that he is}} able to save him from death, hell, the devil, and damnation; for unless a man {{believes}} this, he will not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life (Heb 7:24,25).|$|E
6000|$|... 45. However humbling, {{this is a}} truth not to be disputed. The wisest {{philosopher and}} most {{illiterate}} peasant are upon a level, fallen from God. None will be excluded who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> whose gracious invitation is general, 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely' (Rev 22:17).--Mason.|$|E
6000|$|This is the objection; well, {{let me tell}} thee, that to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life, and to be saved, {{although}} at present thou hast no other end, is a lawful and good coming to Jesus Christ. This is evident, because Christ propoundeth life as the only argument to prevail with sinners to come to him, and so also blameth them because they come not to him for life. [...] "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life" [...] (John 5:40). Besides, {{there are many other}} scriptures whereby he allureth sinners to come to him, in which he propoundeth nothing to them but their safety. As, [...] "whosoever believeth in him should not perish;" [...] he that believeth is [...] "passed from death unto life." [...] "He that believeth--shall be saved." [...] "He that believeth on him is not condemned." [...] And believing and coming are all one. So that you see, to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life, is a lawful coming and good. In that he believeth, that he alone hath made atonement for sin (Rom 2). And let me add over and above, that for a man to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life, though he comes to him for nothing else but life, it is to give much honour to him.|$|E
6000|$|Men do {{not usually}} <b>come</b> or go <b>to</b> {{this or that}} place, before they have a moving cause, or rather a cause moving them thereto. No more do they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus Christ--I do not say, before they have a cause, but--before that cause moveth them <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> What sayest thou? Hast thou a cause moving thee <b>to</b> <b>come?</b> <b>To</b> be at present {{in a state of}} condemnation, is cause {{sufficient}} for men <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ</b> for life. But that will not do, except the cause move them; the which it will never do, until their eyes be opened to see themselves in that condition. For it is not a man's being under wrath, but his seeing it, that moveth him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> Alas! all men by sin are under wrath; yet but few of that all <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> And the reason is, because they do not see their condition. [...] "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" [...] (Matt 3:7). Until men are warned, and also receive the warning, they will not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b>|$|R
50|$|Salmon {{was educated}} at the Church Missionary Society College, Islington. He was ordained in 1908 and {{began his career}} at Elmvale, Ontario. After that he served at Cookstown and Galetta. He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> Church Cathedral, Ottawa in 1921 serving as a curate untl 1926, and then as it's rector until 1932 and then as dean until 1938. He was then the Rector of Holy Trinity, Philadelphia from 1938 to 1951.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Art thou coming? This {{is because}} God hath {{inclined}} thine heart <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> God hath called thee, illuminated thee, and inclined thy heart to come; and, therefore, thou comest <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> It is God that worketh in thee to will, and <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> Coming sinner, bless God for that he hath given thee a will <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> It {{is a sign}} that thou belongest <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ,</b> because God has made thee willing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him (Psa 110:3). Bless God for slaying the enmity of thy mind; had he not done it, thou wouldst as yet have hated thine own salvation.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. He that is <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> has the {{advantage}} of him that is but coming in this also, namely, he hath drank of the sweet and soul refreshing water of life; but he that is but coming hath not. [...] "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink" [...] (John 7:37).|$|E
6000|$|... 3. It {{is called}} the wine-press of the wrath of God. [...] "And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and {{gathered}} the vine of the earth," [...] that is, them that did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> [...] "and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God" [...] (Rev 14:19).|$|E
60|$|ONE reason which {{moved me}} to write and print this little book was, because, though there are many {{excellent}} heart-affecting discourses {{in the world that}} tend to convert the sinner, yet I had a desire to try this simple method of mine; wherefore I make bold thus to invite and encourage the worst to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> for life.|$|E
50|$|Idowu-Fearon trained {{briefly as}} a soldier before he changed to {{theological}} training for the priesthood. He describes the change this way. “I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> at the Nigeria Military School, Zaria in my second year (1964)” {{and two years later}} (1966) the Lord called “me to be a soldier in His Army.” Idowu-Fearon was given a ‘sympathetic’ discharge by late General Hassan Katsina in Lagos so that he could begin training for the priesthood.|$|R
6000|$|... (6.) If he {{that has}} sinned this sin might yet <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ,</b> then must {{the truth of}} God be overthrown; which saith in one place, [...] "He hath never forgiveness;" [...] and in another, [...] "I will in no wise cast him out." [...] Therefore, that he may never have forgiveness, he shall never have heart <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ.</b> It is {{impossible}} that such an one should be renewed, either to or by repentance (Heb 6). Wherefore, never trouble thy head nor heart about this matter; he that cometh <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ</b> cannot have sinned against the Holy Ghost.|$|R
50|$|After France and Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September 1939, a new British Expeditionary Force {{made its way to}} France. Some of the troops were billeted in and around Lille. Many of them <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> Church, and many to the British Institute hall beneath the church, which was used for social events {{as well as for the}} library. Older members of our congregation can remember dances and music and the excitement of meeting the soldiers when they were children.|$|R
60|$|Third. Dost thou {{continually}} {{neglect to}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> and usest arguments in thine own heart to satisfy thy soul with so doing? THEN THOU ART GONE. (Luke 14:17,18, compared with v 24, and Heb 2:3). 'How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?' How shall we escape, that is, {{there is no}} way to escape.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. They {{may be said}} to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> but not to God by him, who do {{pick and}} choose doctrines, itching only after that which sounds of grace,12 but {{secretly}} abhorring of that which presseth to moral goodness. These did never see God, what notions soever they may have of the Lord Jesus, and of forgiveness from him. (Matt 5:8) ...|$|E
60|$|Q. But when a poor {{creature}} sees its vileness, it {{is afraid}} to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> is it not?--A. Yes; but without ground, for he hath said, 'Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not': and 'to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word' (Isa 35:4, 66:2).|$|E
6000|$|... 5. But again, he that <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ,</b> flies for his life. Now, {{there is}} no man that flies for his life, that thinks he speeds fast enough on his journey; no, could he, he would willingly take a mile at a step. O my sloth and heartlessness, sayest thou! [...] "Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest" [...] (Psa 55:6,8).|$|R
5000|$|While {{living in}} Los Angeles Eldredge {{was looking for}} a [...] "worldview." [...] After {{exploring}} other religions, Eastern mysticism, Lao-Tzu, and New Age spirituality, he discovered the writings of Francis Schaeffer, whom he calls one of the best philosophers of the 20th century. Through Schaeffer, Eldredge <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>Christ</b> and later <b>to</b> the church. He eventually got a master's degree in counseling and practiced in Colorado Springs before working for Focus on the Family, where he served as Senior Fellow for Christian Worldview.|$|R
6000|$|These words, therefore, [...] "I {{will not}} cast out," [...] will prove great words one day <b>to</b> them that <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Jesus <b>Christ</b> (2 Peter 2:4; John 20:31; Luke 20:35).|$|R
