50|$|The {{disaster}} {{had come}} after a protracted {{dispute between the}} miners and the state government. In 1951 the Queensland Government had appointed Athol Lightfoot as general manager of State Coal Mines and Coke Works. Lightfoot subsequently targeted the Collinsville State Mine for mechanisation with his plan to mechanise Tunnel Number One despite opposition from the miners because of its steep grades and constant leakage of carbon dioxide. However, mechanisation of Tunnel Number One went ahead despite the mining union having recommended that if mechanisation were to occur it should be implemented in Tunnel Number Two. The union had also requested that the government allow Miners' Federation NSW Northern District's <b>check</b> <b>inspector</b> Jack Barrett, with his considerable experience in underground mines both in New South Wales and internationally, to make an inspection of the Collinsville State Mine. The Government refused the request. However, in the month before the disaster Lightfoot, who had planned and implemented the mechanisation, resigned from his position as general manager of State Coal Mines and Coke Works.|$|E
40|$|This {{method has}} been applied to the {{analysis}} of a spontaneous combustion event for the five year mine plan of the new Abel Mine, Newcastle, Australia. A team of people with diverse backgrounds provided input to the analysis, which was facilitated by a risk management consultant. The team consisted of the Technical Services Manager – Underground Operations, the Project Manager, The Undermanager, the Ventilation Officer, the local <b>Check</b> <b>Inspector</b> (representing the underground operators), a ventilation consultant and a coal spontaneous combustion expert. The resulting fault tree has provided the mine with a clear set of controls that can be incorporated into a spontaneous combustion management plan. This approach sets a new benchmark for the coal industry and produces a generic model that is robust enough to be transferable to any mine by adjustment of the site specific parameters. Some of the branches of the fault tree will be presented in this paper to raise the awareness of the coal industry to the comprehensive nature of this approach to risk management...|$|E

40|$|Coal mining is a {{dangerous}} industry which demands {{a strong emphasis on}} ensuring the protection of miners' health, safety and well being. This study investigates the role and effectiveness of health & safety reps in Queensland Coal Mines and was undertaken by the Cardiff Work Environment Research Centre at Cardiff University in Wales, UK. The aim of the study is to contribute further knowledge of the effectiveness of the role of worker reps in managing those risks. Early mining disasters resulting in the deaths of many mineworkers highlighted the need for unions to take a proactive role in ensuring their own safety. Originally known as <b>check</b> <b>inspectors,</b> they were first appointed by unions in the Hunter Valley in the 1870 s, and in Queensland they gained statutory recognition in 1915.

50|$|In 1984, BAR also {{implemented}} a biennial Smog Check Program, {{also known as}} the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, pursuant to authority granted by Senate Bill 33 of 1982 (SB 33). SB 33 authorized BAR to implement, maintain, and enforce the Smog Check Program, which licenses Smog Check stations and technicians to reduce air pollution from vehicles through mandatory testing of vehicle emission control components. Smog Check stations must also be registered as ARDs to ensure that consumers receive protection associated with vehicle repairs. In addition, BAR ensures that the equipment used to perform Smog Check inspections and the inspections performed at Smog Check stations by Smog <b>Check</b> <b>Inspectors</b> or Technicians will achieve reductions in vehicle emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Recently, BAR's authority to protect consumers subject to the Smog Check Program was enhanced by Assembly Bill 2289 of 2010 (AB 2289). AB 2289 authorizes BAR to certify high performing Smog Check stations and technicians as STAR certified, which allows them to inspect and repair vehicles that are likely to be high polluters. Shortly after implementation, BAR was recognized for outstanding environmental achievements in government for the STAR Program and was named one of the 2013 Best of California Award winners and received The Green IT Award. AB 2289 further increased the citation amounts for program violations by stations and technicians.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} {{the framework for}} a payment plan based on inspection results in the delegation of inspection agencies. The paper deals with two cases—that in which one <b>inspector</b> <b>checks</b> {{the quality of the}} inspection object (e. g., a design drawing of building) and that in which two <b>inspectors</b> <b>check</b> it simultaneously. The paper points out the applicability of a penalty only in the framework with two inspectors. In addition, it is shown that an appropriate bonus and penalty system based on inspection results can resolve moral hazard and adverse selection problems, and that the framework with two inspectors is superior to that with one if both the upper bound of penalty and social loss, which occurs when the object that does not meet the requisite standards passes an inspection, are relatively large.

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{under which}} the coal mining industry based mines rescue organisations for Queensland and New South Wales operate have been developed over many years of challenging training, exercises, rescues, recoveries and, sadly, fatalities. The New South Wales Mines Rescue Service and the Queensland Mines Rescue Service are working together to underpin their operating procedures and guidelines with risk management logic while taking heed of lessons from the past. The initial focus for this undertaking is a crucial aspect of mines rescue operations: the emergency mine entry and re-entry. A three-phase process is being used {{for the development of}} new guidelines for emergency mine entry and re-entry to facilitate integration with operations’ emergency response systems and day-to-day operations. The first phase is the assessment of risks and determination of appropriate controls for Rescue Services effecting a mine entry or re-entry. The second phase is the conversion of the risk assessment into the practical guidelines (2 ̆ 2 Emergency Mine Entry and Re-entry Guidelines 2 ̆ 2), capturing the necessary controls identified in the risk assessment. The third phase is converting the guidelines into systems that mining operations and mines rescue organisations alike, together with other key industry stakeholders (the Inspectorate, Industry Safety and Health Representatives, Industry <b>Check</b> <b>Inspectors</b> etc), can use for effecting mine entry or mine re-entry responses. A particular emphasis in this third phase is the collection and analysis of information in a timely manner and appropriate format to support decision makers, technical support and crews effecting responses. While these efforts focus on the mines rescue organisation provided services and emergency responses, it is clear there are benefits for operations in having systems ready to support the Emergency Mine Entry and Re-entry Guidelines, as there are significant overlaps between information required for most types of emergency responses involving mines rescue organisations and the information operations require in managing their principal hazards...|$|R

It is filled with water, and a small pump raises the pressure to the necessary test value, at which it is held for a specified time (30 minutes according to the ASME code).

40|$|Abstract. Asbestos-related {{illnesses}} {{become a}} nationwide problem in Japan. Now human <b>inspectors</b> <b>check</b> whether asbestos {{is contained in}} building material or not. To judge whether the specimen contains as-bestos or not, 3, 000 particles must be counted from microscope images. This is a major labor-intensive bottleneck. In this paper, we propose an automatic particle counting method for automatic judgement system whether the specimen is hazardous or not. However, the size, shape and color of particles are not constant. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} model the particle class. On the other hand, the non-particle class is not var-ied much. In addition, the area of non-particles is wider than that of particles. Thus, we use One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). OCSVM identifies “outlier ” from input samples. Namely, we model the non-particle class to detect the particle class as outlier. In experiments, the proposed method gives higher accuracy and smaller number of false positives than a preliminary method of our project. ...|$|R
