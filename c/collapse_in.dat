5|$|A 2010 {{study shows}} that along with some Bay Area freeways, some of BART's {{overhead}} structures could <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> a major earthquake, which has a significant probability of occurring within three decades. Seismic retrofiting {{has been carried out}} in recent years to address these deficiencies, especially in the Transbay Tube.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and <b>collapse</b> (<b>in</b> volumes determined by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1088 and {{the early}} 15th century, the unusual {{features}} of Chichester Cathedral are a Transitional retro choir, a pair of early Norman relief carvings and its freestanding belfry of the 15th century.

5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 720,594 souls; the streets were lined with grass and the buildings on the verge of <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Following the Test, Nash was {{selected}} for Victoria for their match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval in {{what would have been}} his first Sheffield Shield match.

5|$|The {{company had}} {{appeared}} {{to the public}} {{to be in good}} health during the 1920s, so its sudden <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> 1929 came as a shock. Bolckow Vaughan, effectively bankrupt, was forced by its bankers into a takeover by Dorman Long, which liquidated it. No company history was written.|$|E

5|$|Tibet {{was once}} a strong power {{contemporaneous}} with Tang China (618–907). Until the Tibetan Empire's <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia. The Yarlung rulers of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between Tibet and China.|$|E

5|$|After the German <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow {{during the}} peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were {{therefore}} spared {{the destruction of the}} fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, high {{waves and}} gusty winds led to one {{drowning}} {{when a woman}} was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing {{was found dead in}} a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the San'yō Expressway to <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people. In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29people in Japan and injured 179others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¥94.9billion (US$854million).|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E

5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> the price of collectible cars {{brought about by the}} early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|Gareloi is {{the northernmost}} volcano of the Delarof Group, a {{subgroup}} of the Aleutian Islands. It {{is composed of}} two craters, the older of which is covered by lava flows running to the northwest and southern coasts. The northern crater is small, with a feature suggesting dome <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> its northwest flank. The southern flank, higher up and considerably larger, contains fumarolic activity. A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into the older caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris flows from the volcano.|$|E

During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.|$|E
