40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the apparent mismatch between the normative and descriptive literatures in the cognitive science of conditional reasoning. Descriptive psychological theories still regard material implication as the normative {{theory of the}} conditional. However, over the last 20 years {{in the philosophy of}} language and logic the idea that material implication <b>call</b> <b>account</b> for everyday indicative conditionals has been subject to severe criticism. The majority view is now apparently in favour of a subjective conditional probability interpretation. A comparative model fitting exercise is presented that shows that a conditional probability model call explain as much of the data oil abstract indicative conditional reasoning tasks as psychological theories that supplement material implication with various rationally unjustified processing assumptions. Consequently, when people are asked to solve laboratory reasoning tasks, they call be seen as simply generalising their everyday probabilistic reasoning strategies to this novel context...|$|E
40|$|Although {{effective}} {{drug and}} non-drug treatment for unipolar depressive illness exist, different individuals respond differently to different treatments. It {{is not uncommon}} for a given patient to lw switched several times from one treatment to another until an effective remedy for that particular patient is found. This process is costly in terms of time, money and suffering. It is thus desirable to determine at the outset the likdy response of a patient to the available treatments, so that the optimal one can be selected. Although prior attempts at outcome prediction with linear regression models have failed, recent work on this problem has indicated that the nonlinear predictive techniques of backpropagation and quadratic regression <b>call</b> <b>account</b> for a significant proportion {{of the variance in the}} data. The present research applies the nonlinear predictive technique of kernel regression to this problcrn, and employs cross-validation to test the ability of the resulting model to extract, from extremely noisy dinical data, information with predictive value. The importance of comparison with a suitable null hypothesis is illustrated. Office of Naval Research (N 00014 - 95 - 1 - 0409...|$|E

40|$|The {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} of NOx with ammonia over all Fe-zeolite catalyst was investigated experimentally and a transient kinetic model was developed. The model includes reactions that describe ammonia storage and oxidation, NO oxidation, {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NO and NO 2, formation of N 2 O, ammonia inhibition and ammonium nitrate formation. The model <b>call</b> <b>account</b> for {{a broad range of}} experimental conditions in the presence of H 2 O, CO 2 and O- 2 at temperatures from 150 to 650 degrees C. The catalyst stores ammonia at temperatures up to 400 degrees C and shows ammonia oxidation activity from 350 degrees C. The catalyst is also active for the oxidation of NO to NO 2 and the oxidation reaches equilibrium at 500 degrees C. The SCR of NO is already active at 150 degrees C and the introduction of equal amounts of NO and NO 2 greatly enhances the conversion of NOx at temperatures up to 300 degrees C. The formation of N 2 O is negligible if small fractions of NO 2 are fed to the reactor, but a significant amount of N 2 O is formed at high NO 2 to NO ratios. An ammonia inhibition oil the SCR of NO is observed at 200 degrees C. This kinetic model contains 12 reactions and is able to describe the experimental results Well. The model was validated using short transient experiments and experimental conditions not used in the parameter estimation and predicted these new conditions adequately...|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} and experimental data of effects of nitrogen (N) deposition oil plant species diversity have been Used to derive empirical critical N loads for various ecosystems. The great advantage {{of such an}} approach is the inclusion of field evidence, {{but there are also}} restrictions, such as the absence of explicit criteria regarding significant effects on the vegetation, and the impossibility to predict future impacts when N deposition changes. Model approaches <b>Call</b> <b>account</b> for this. In this paper, we review the possibilities of static and dynamic multispecies models in combination with dynamic soil-vegetation models to (1) predict plant species composition as a function of atmospheric N deposition and (2) calculate critical N loads in relation to a prescribed protection level of the species composition. The similarities between the models are presented, but also several important differences, including the Use of different indicators for N and acidity and the prediction of individual plant species VS. Plant communities. A summary of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the various Models, including their validation status, is given. Furthermore,. examples are given of critical load calculations with the model chains and their comparison with empirical critical N loads. We show that linked biogeochemistry-biodiversity models for N have potential for applications to support European policy to reduce N input, but the definition of damage thresholds for terrestrial biodiversity represents a major challenge. There is also a clear need for further testing and validation of the models against long-term monitoring or long-term experimental data sets and against large-scale survey data. This requires a focused data collection ill Europe. combing vegetation descriptions with variables affecting the species diversity. such as Soil acidity, nutrient status and water availability. Finally there is a need for adaptation and upscaling of the models beyond the regions for which dose-response relationships have been parameterized, to make them generally applicable...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Th 2 {{lymphocytes}} {{may play}} a key role in the development of allergic diseases such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Cytokine flow cytometry of tear samples was used to identify the phenotypical and functional properties of lymphocytes at the actual site of the allergic reaction. METHODS. Tear and blood samples were obtained from patients affected by active VKC (n = 12) and from normal control subjects (n = 10). Tears were obtained after gentle scraping of the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva. Tear and blood samples were placed in a solution of brefeldin-A, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), ionomycin, and RPMI for 4 hours and then processed for flow cytometry. Lymphocytes were marked with the monoclonal antibodies, anti-IFN-gamma and anti-interleukin (IL) - 4. Levels of IL- 4, IL- 2, IFN-gamma, IL- 2 R, total IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil protein X/neurotoxin (EPX), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were also evaluated in serum. RESULTS. Expression of IL- 4 was observed in 9. 2 % +/- 9. 5 % of lymphocytes in tears of patients with VKC. Of the 12 patients with VKC, 8 (67 %) had tear lymphocytes positive for IL- 4 (Th 2). Two patients (17 %) had a double population of lymphocytes: One was positive for Th 2, and the other was positive for both IL- 4 and IFN-gamma (Th 0). One patient (8 %) was positive for IFN-gamma (Thl) only, and one patient was negative for both ILs. No differences in the percentage of Th 2 lymphocytes were found between tarsal and limbal patients. The percentage of Th 2 lymphocytes was significantly correlated with the severity of the disease. No positive lymphocytes were found in tears of control subjects. Eosinophils, serum IgE, ECP, and EPX were all significantly higher in VKC than in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS. In ocular allergic diseases, local lymphocytes expressed the Th 2 phenotype and, to a lesser degree, the Th 0 phenotype. Although results of systemic allergic markers can be inconclusive in patients with VKC, flow cytometry demonstrated a local lymphocyte phenotype that <b>call</b> <b>account</b> for the clinical and histologic abnormalities of VKC...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{debates about}} the nature of proper names have been about whether we should treat them as devices of {{reference}} or as disguised definite descriptions.
