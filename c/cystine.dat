5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, hyperparathyroidism, gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, <b>cystine).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} amino acids were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered. <b>Cystine</b> was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and <b>cystine.</b> Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cystine</b> stones, {{caused by}} {{hereditary}} cystinuria, begin forming in childhood and can grow {{large enough to}} fill the renal collection system.|$|E
25|$|Bladder stones or uroliths {{are common}} in dogs. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers {{secondary}} to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. Types of stones include struvite, calcium oxalate, urate, <b>cystine,</b> calcium phosphate, and silicate. Struvite and calcium oxalate stones {{are by far the}} most common.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} concerning rotaxanes and other mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as catenanes, {{has been focused on}} their efficient synthesis or their utilization as artificial molecular machines. However, examples of rotaxane substructure have been found in naturally occurring peptides, including: <b>cystine</b> knot peptides, cyclotides or lasso-peptides such as microcin J25.|$|E
25|$|All strains can use ammonia and urea as {{the sole}} {{nitrogen}} source, but cannot use nitrate, since they lack the ability to reduce them to ammonium ions. They can also use most amino acids, small peptides, and nitrogen bases as nitrogen sources. Histidine, glycine, <b>cystine,</b> and lysine are, however, not readily used. S.cerevisiae does not excrete proteases, so extracellular protein cannot be metabolized.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine {{residues}} from MTs {{can capture}} harmful oxidant radicals like the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. In this reaction, cysteine is oxidized to <b>cystine,</b> and the metal ions which {{were bound to}} cysteine are liberated to the media. As explained in the Expression and regulation section, this Zn can activate the synthesis of more MTs. This mechanism has been proposed {{to be an important}} mechanism in the control of the oxidative stress by MTs. The role of MTs in oxidative stress has been confirmed by MT Knockout mutants, but some experiments propose also a prooxidant role for MTs.|$|E
25|$|Norrin is {{not only}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} the eye. The mutation of the NDP gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the NDP gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring MAO genes. When the mutations simply change a single amino acid in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the NDP mutation does not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying exactly the same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the cysteines forming the putative <b>cystine</b> knot), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cystine</b> ((SCH2CHNH2COOH)2) stones form in an acidic to neutral urine. [...] They {{are usually}} smooth and round. [...] They {{are caused by}} {{increased}} urine excretion of <b>cystine</b> (a relatively insoluble amino acid) in dogs with a defect in renal tubule reabsorption of <b>cystine.</b> [...] Dietary reduction of protein and alkalinization of the urine may help prevent formation. [...] Medications such as D-penicillamine and 2-MPG contain thiol, which forms a soluble complex with <b>cystine</b> in the urine. [...] Dog breeds possibly predisposed to formation of <b>cystine</b> stones include Bulldogs, Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire Terriers, Irish Terriers, and Newfoundlands. [...] In Newfoundlands, cystinuria is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, but in the other breeds it is a sex linked trait and found primarily in male dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from its}} {{oxidation}} to <b>cystine,</b> cysteine participates in numerous posttranslational modifications. [...] The nucleophilic thiol group allows cysteine to conjugate to other groups, e.g., in prenylation. Ubiquitin ligases transfer ubiquitin to its pendant, proteins, and caspases, which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle. [...] Inteins often function {{with the help}} of a catalytic cysteine. [...] These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to <b>cystine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Endospores possess {{five times}} more sulfur than {{vegetative}} cells. [...] This excess sulfur is concentrated in spore coats as an amino acid, <b>cystine.</b> [...] It is believed that the macromolecule accountable for maintaining the dormant state has a protein coat rich in <b>cystine,</b> stabilized by S-S linkages. [...] A reduction in these linkages {{has the potential to}} change the tertiary structure, causing the protein to unfold. [...] This conformational change in the protein is thought to be responsible for exposing active enzymatic sites necessary for endospore germination.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remarkable}} {{stability of}} cyclotides {{means that they}} have an exciting range of potential applications centred on either their intrinsic biological activities or the possibility of using the CCK motif as a scaffold for stabilizing biologically active epitopes. [...] Interest in these has recently intensified with the publications of a chemical methodology capable of synthetically producing cyclotides with high yields, and the amenability of the CCK framework to amino-acid substitutions. [...] But for molecules to be useful in a therapeutic setting they require useful biopharmaceutical characteristics such as resistance to proteolysis and membrane permeability. The membrane interactive surface area and moment of the cyclotides are determinants in the prediction of their biological activities. A recent study on related <b>cystine</b> knot proteins as drug candidates showed that <b>cystine</b> knots do permeate well through rat small intestinal mucosa relative to non-cystine knot peptide drugs such as insulin and bacitracin. Furthermore, enzymatic digestion of <b>cystine</b> knot peptide drugs was associated with only a few proteases and it was suggested that this limitation may be overcome by mutating out particular cleavage sites. Thus, certain <b>cystine</b> knot proteins satisfy the basic criteria for drug delivery and represent exciting novel candidates as scaffolds for peptide drug delivery. [...] The diverse range of intrinsic activities of cyclotides also continues to hold promise {{for a wide range of}} applications in the agricultural fields against insects and nematodes, especially those from Clitoria ternatea.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{disulfide}} isomerases catalyze {{the proper}} formation of disulfide bonds; the cell transfers dehydroascorbic acid to the endoplasmic reticulum, which oxidises the environment. [...] In this environment, cysteines are, in general, oxidized to <b>cystine</b> and {{are no longer}} functional as a nucleophiles.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{laboratory}} conditions, P.destructans {{has been}} shown to produce numerous enzymes including β-glucosidase, esterase/esterase lipase/lipase, leucine and valine arylamidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, naphthol-AS-B1-phosphohydrolase, both acid and alkaline phosphatases, various proteinase, and urease, while testing negative for <b>cystine</b> arylamidase, α-chymotrypsin, alpha/beta-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-fucosidase, α-mannosidase, and trypsin. Important dual virulence factors found in P.destructans and many other pathogenic fungi include urease, proteinase (aspartyll) and superoxide dismutase.|$|E
2500|$|Abderhalden {{is known}} for a blood test for pregnancy, a test for <b>cystine</b> in urine, and for {{explaining}} the Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome, a recessive genetic condition. [...] He did extensive work {{in the analysis of}} proteins, polypeptides, and enzymes. His Abwehrfermente ("defensive enzymes") theory stated that immunological challenge will induce production of proteases. This was seemingly [...] "proven" [...] by many collaborators in Europe, although attempts to verify the theory abroad failed.|$|E
2500|$|Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic {{amino acid}} with the formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in {{cysteine}} often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. [...] The thiol {{is susceptible to}} oxidization to give the disulfide derivative <b>cystine,</b> which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the Enumber E920.|$|E
2500|$|When {{symptoms}} indicate bladder stones, {{the first}} step is usually to take an x-ray. [...] Most types of stones will appear readily in an x-ray, urate and occasionally <b>cystine</b> stones being the most common exceptions. [...] Stones smaller than three millimeters may not be visible. [...] Ultrasonography is also useful for identifying bladder stones. [...] Crystals identified in a urinalysis may help identify the stones, but analysis of the stones is necessary for identification of the complete chemical composition.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclotides {{are small}} {{disulfide}} rich peptides isolated from plants. [...] Typically containing 28-37 amino acids, they {{are characterized by}} their head-to-tail cyclised peptide backbone and the interlocking arrangement of their three disulfide bonds. [...] These combined features have been termed the cyclic <b>cystine</b> knot (CCK) motif. [...] To date, over 100 cyclotides have been isolated and characterized from species of the Rubiaceae, Violaceae, and Cucurbitaceae families. Cyclotides have also been identified in agriculturally important families such as the Fabaceae and Poaceae.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{classified}} as a non-essential amino acid, in rare cases, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of methionine is available. [...] Cysteine is catabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and blood plasma. In contrast, <b>cystine</b> travels safely through the GI tract and blood plasma and is promptly reduced to the two cysteine molecules upon cell entry.|$|E
2500|$|The cyclotides {{fall into}} two main {{structural}} subfamilies. [...] Moebius cyclotides, the less common of the two, contain a cis-proline in loop 5 that induces a local 180° backbone twist (hence likening it to a Möbius strip), whereas bracelet cyclotides do not. [...] There is smaller variation in sequences within these subfamilies than between them. A third subfamily of cyclotides are trypsin inhibitors and are more homologous to a family of non-cyclic trypsin inhibitors from squash plants known as knottins or inhibitor <b>cystine</b> knots than they are to the other cyclotides.|$|E
2500|$|During a Red Cross relief {{mission in}} the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 1960s, a Norwegian doctor, Lorents Gran, noted that during labor African women used a {{medicinal}} tea made from {{the leaves of the}} plant Oldenlandia affinis to induce labor and facilitate childbirth. [...] The active ingredient was later determined to be a peptide, named kalata B1, after the traditional name for the native medicine, kalata-kalata. [...] Although in vivo studies in rats confirmed the uterotonic activity of the purified peptide, it was another 20 years before the cyclic <b>cystine</b> knot motif and structure of the purified peptide were elucidated.|$|E
2500|$|Bladder stones or uroliths are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in animals, especially in domestic animals such as dogs and cats. Occurrence in other species, including tortoises, have been reported as well. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers secondary to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. [...] Stones can form {{in any part of}} the urinary tract in dogs and cats, but unlike in humans, stones of the kidney are less common and do not often cause significant disease, although they can contribute to pyelonephritis and chronic renal failure. [...] Types of stones include struvite, calcium oxalate, urate, <b>cystine,</b> calcium phosphate, and silicate. [...] Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are by far the most common.|$|E
2500|$|Disulfide {{bonds in}} {{proteins}} are formed by oxidation of the thiol groups of cysteine residues. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds. [...] More aggressive oxidants convert cysteine to the corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid. Cysteine residues play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins, {{which increases the}} rigidity of proteins and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous). [...] Inside the cell, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues within a polypeptide support the protein's tertiary structure. [...] Insulin {{is an example of}} a protein with <b>cystine</b> crosslinking, wherein two separate peptide chains are connected by a pair of disulfide bonds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cystine</b> {{serves as}} a {{substrate}} for the cystine-glutamate antiporter. This transport system, which is highly specific for <b>cystine</b> and glutamate, increases the concentration of <b>cystine</b> inside the cell. In this system, the anionic form of <b>cystine</b> is transported in exchange for glutamate. <b>Cystine</b> is quickly reduced to cysteine. Cysteine prodrugs, e.g. acetylcysteine, induce release of glutamate into the extracellular space.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inhibitor}} <b>cystine</b> knot (aka ICK or Knottin) is {{a protein}} structural motif containing three disulfide bridges. Three types of knots are Growth Factor <b>Cystine</b> Knot (GFCK), Inhibitor <b>Cystine</b> Knot (ICK), Cyclic <b>Cystine</b> Knot (CCK). http://www.cyclotide.com/knots.html. Types include a) cyclic mobius, b) cyclic bracelet, c) acyclic inhibitor knottins.|$|E

50|$|Cysteine {{supplements}} {{are sometimes}} marketed as anti-aging products with claims of improved skin elasticity. Cysteine is more easily {{absorbed by the}} body than <b>cystine,</b> so most supplements contain cysteine rather than <b>cystine.</b> N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is better absorbed than other cysteine or <b>cystine</b> supplements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cystine</b> tryptic agar (CTA), {{also known}} as <b>cystine</b> trypticase agar, is a growth medium used for the {{identification}} of microorganisms.|$|E
5000|$|In cystinuria, a {{hereditary}} disorder featuring {{formation of}} <b>cystine</b> stones, penicillamine binds with cysteine {{to yield a}} mixed disulfide which is more soluble than <b>cystine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cystinosis was {{the first}} {{documented}} genetic disease belonging {{to the group of}} lysosomal storage disease disorders. Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal membrane-specific transporter for <b>cystine.</b> Intracellular metabolism of <b>cystine,</b> as it happens with all amino acids, requires its transport across the cell membrane. After degradation of endocytosed protein to <b>cystine</b> within lysosomes, it is normally transported to the cytosol. But if there is a defect in the carrier protein, <b>cystine</b> is accumulated in lysosomes. As <b>cystine</b> is highly insoluble, when its concentration in tissue lysosomes increases, its solubility is immediately exceeded and crystalline precipitates are formed in almost all organs and tissues.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include <b>cystine</b> reductase (NADH), NADH-dependent <b>cystine</b> reductase, <b>cystine</b> reductase (NADH2), and NADH2:L-cystine oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism.|$|E

50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} cause non-type I cystinuria, {{a disease that}} leads to <b>cystine</b> stones in the urinary system due to {{impaired}} transport of <b>cystine</b> and dibasic amino acids.|$|E
50|$|The {{accumulation}} {{is caused}} by abnormal transport of <b>cystine</b> from lysosomes, resulting in a massive intra-lysosomal <b>cystine</b> accumulation in tissues. Via an as yet unknown mechanism, lysosomal <b>cystine</b> appears to amplify and alter apoptosis {{in such a way}} that cells die inappropriately, leading to loss of renal epithelial cells. This results in renal Fanconi syndrome, and similar loss in other tissues can account for the short stature, retinopathy, and other features of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{treatment}} is with adequate hydration, alkalization of the urine with citrate supplementation or acetazolamide, and dietary modification to reduce salt and protein intake (especially methionine). If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with an agent such as penicillamine. Tiopronin is another agent.Once renal stones have formed, however, the first-line {{treatment is}} ESWL (Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). If ESWL {{do not work}} efficiently surgery can be necessary. Both endoscopic surgery and conventional open-abdominal surgery {{have proven to be}} effective treatment modalities for patients with more advanced disease. Adequate hydration is the foremost aim of treatment to prevent cysteine stones. The goal is to increase the urine volume because the concentration of <b>cystine</b> in the urine is reduced which prevents <b>cystine</b> from precipitating from the urine and forming stones. People with <b>cystine</b> stones should consume 5 to 7 liters a day. The rationale behind alkalizing the urine is that <b>cystine</b> tends to stay in solution and causes no harm. In order to alkalize the urine, sodium biocarbonate has been used. One must be careful in alkalizing their urine because it could lead to other forms of stones in process of preventing <b>cystine</b> stones. Penicillamine is a drug that acts to form a complex with <b>cystine</b> that is 50 times more soluble than <b>cystine</b> itself. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) is performed via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm in diameter. Most of the time, <b>cystine</b> stones are too dense to be broken up by shock (ESWL) so PNL is needed.|$|E
