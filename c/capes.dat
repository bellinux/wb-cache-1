5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (<b>CAPES),</b> a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or <b>CAPES,</b> he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of <b>CAPES</b> cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. <b>CAPES</b> {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cape</b> Verdeanness {{is another}} name for <b>Cape</b> Verdean {{cultural}} identity. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness refers to <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness as it has expressed itself since July 5, 1975, {{the first day of}} <b>Cape</b> Verdean independence. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has previously been described at length in the social sciences scholarship. Postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has previously been implicitly rather than explicitly represented in descriptions of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry in the scholarly literature. This study is a first of its kind consideration of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness. It is also the first time <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness of any kind has been explicitly represented by means of a review of <b>Cape</b> Verdean cultural productions. The methods of this study include a review of the findings of the social sciences regarding postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness, a review of the scholarly literature on postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry, and an analysis of a group of postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poems, including contributions from both the <b>Cape</b> Verdean Islands and the <b>Cape</b> Verdean diaspora. The findings of this study are that postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdean poetry provides a significant lens into postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness that both overlaps and complements the lens on <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness provided by the social sciences. Furthermore, postcolonial <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness demonstrates a rupture from colonial-era <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness. Because of this rupture, <b>Cape</b> Verdeanness has now expanded to reflect universal concerns in addition to specifically <b>Cape</b> Verdean ones. [URL]...|$|R

The battle was {{strategically}} decisive, in that it prevented the Royal Navy from reinforcing or evacuating the forces of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. The French were able to achieve control of the sea lanes against the British, allowing them to provide the Franco-American army with siege artillery and French reinforcements—all of which proved decisive in the Siege of Yorktown, effectively securing independence for the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
