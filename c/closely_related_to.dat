5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the birds.

5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> mouse lemurs {{within the family}} Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E

Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E

Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and is <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> human geography.
