50|$|The tuckpointing tools {{themselves}} were originally made from forged iron by blacksmiths {{dating back to}} their origins in England during the 18th century. Over time tuckpointing tools have now evolved into tools made from a hardened quality tool steel and shaped with a sharp-pointed front with a flat base or a beaded or grooved base. The sharp point helps in making the tuckpointed fine line smooth. This is similar in theory or principle to a concreter's float, whereby if one {{has to make the}} concrete surface rough a <b>concreter</b> will use an upturned or rounded float whereby when a <b>concreter</b> has to make the surface smooth they will use a sharp pointed float.|$|E

40|$|Worker {{exposure}} to noise on high-rise construction sites is an ever-present hazard {{and one that is}} commonly accepted by many industry workers. The potential risk to the individual through repeated {{exposure to}} excessive noise on these projects is very real, concerning but controllable. This study focuses on establishing a risk profile on workers exposed to excessive noise including the identification of high-risk operational areas and work activities influential in affecting worker exposure. Involved were 238 workers from 20 occupational groups who were personally monitored for noise exposure during the construction of three high rise projects on the Gold Coast, Queensland. The study results clearly showed that high-rise construction workers are exposed to high levels of impact and steady state noise during work. In particular, occupational groups such as formwork carpenters (93. 52 dB(A)), <b>concreters</b> (93. 5 dB(A)), concrete line hand operators (92. 97 dB(A)), formwork labourers (91. 78 dB(A)), scaffolders (91. 7 dB(A)), internal carpenters (91. 41 dB(A)) and dogman (90. 80 dB(A)) were identified as high risk exposure groups. As defined in Queensland legislation, noise exposure criteria represents an eight hour equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level, LAeq, 8 hr of 85 dB(A) {{or in the case of}} exposure to instantaneous noise levels a linear (unweighted peak) peak sound pressure level, Lpeak, 14...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} occupational history and upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer risk in the ARCAGE European case-control study. The study included 1, 851 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx or esophagus and 1, 949 controls. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for ever employment in 283 occupations and 172 industries, adjusting for smoking and alcohol. Men (1, 457 cases) and women (394 cases) were analyzed separately and we incorporated a semi-Bayes adjustment approach for multiple comparisons. Among men, we found increased risks for occupational categories previously reported {{to be associated with}} at least one type of UADT cancer, including painters (OR = 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 3. 00), bricklayers (1. 58, 1. 05 - 2. 37), workers employed in the erection of roofs and frames (2. 62, 1. 08 - 6. 36), reinforced <b>concreters</b> (3. 46, 1. 11 - 10. 8), dockers (2. 91, 1. 05 - 8. 05) and workers employed in the construction of roads (3. 03, 1. 23 - 7. 46), general construction of buildings (1. 44, 1. 12 - 1. 85) and cargo handling (2. 60, 1. 17 - 5. 75). With the exception of the first three categories, risks both increased when restricting to long duration of employment and remained elevated after semi-Bayes adjustment. Increased risks were also found for loggers (3. 56, 1. 20 - 10. 5) and cattle and dairy farming (3. 60, 1. 15 - 11. 2). Among women, there was no clear evidence of increased risks of UADT cancer in association with occupations or industrial activities. This study provides evidence of an association between some occupational categories and UADT cancer risk among men. The most consistent findings, also supported by previous studies, were obtained for specific workers employed in the construction industry. © 2011 UICC...|$|R
50|$|In 1904, the {{architect}} Auguste Perret used reinforced concrete {{to create a}} revolutionary new building at 25 bis on Rue Franklin in the 16th arrondissement. Reinforced concrete had been used before in Paris, usually to imitate stone. Perret {{was among the first}} the first {{to take full advantage of}} the new architectural forms it could make. The building was on a small site, but offered an exceptional view of Paris. To maximize the view, Perret built the house of with large windows framed with ceramic decorative plaques made by Alexandre Bigot, mounted on reinforced <b>concreter,</b> so that facade of the building was almost entirely windows. The plaques were of a neutral color, to give the appearance of stone. By adding an excèdre on the facade, he was able to create five apartments on each floor, each with the view, whereas a flat traditional facade would have had only four.|$|E
40|$|Workers in the {{construction}} experience high rates of injuries and illnesses, including work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Unfortunately, little attention from construction industry toward the ergonomic risk, cause an ergonomics injury that leads to musculoskeletal disorders. The study was {{to find the most}} severe Ergonomic Risk Factors (ERFs) and to propose procedures to mitigate them. Three objective had been identified which is to study ergonomic risk factors (ERFs) in construction trades, to determine factors affecting ergonomic risk factors (ERFs), and to propose procedures to reduce musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in construction sites. Fifty four (54) sets of questionnaires survey was distributed to constructions workers. The questionnaire had been analysed using Microsoft Excel software for the reliability test result, percentage frequency distribution, relative risk matrix and Average Index (AI). Data then tabulated in table and illustrated in the form of charts. Results indicated that repetition and awkward posture were the highest risk of ERFs and <b>concreter</b> had the highest exposure to all ERFs. From the findings, latent error at management level and lack of control by management are the most factors affected ERFs and may lead to musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, set a proper working time to the workers and giving the correct position and instruction for ergonomics are highly regarded procedures to reduce MSDs, coupled with ergonomic program such as hazard information and reporting, and training, for implementing ergonomic changes in order to controls musculoskeletal disorders among workers in {{the construction}} trade...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the main {{characteristics of the}} mechanical behaviour of adhesive anchors installed in concrete. They are the mechanisms of failure, the relationship between applied pull-out'loadand slip of the anchor and the stresses and strains {{in each of the}} three components (steel-resin'-concrete). The study is-primarily-experimental [...] but theoretical and finite element analyses are also included. These main characteristics are dependent on the'adhesion and wetting phenomena across the resin-conciete and resin-steel interfaces, and on a series of parameters relating to geometry, properties of materials and methods of installation. The principal conclusions obtained are: a) The combined mode of failure involving <b>concreter</b> resin tensile and interfacial bond failure, is the most probable provided that the resin has a high adhesive strength and that the anchor diameter is larger than the minimum value necessary to prevent steel failure, which can be calculated. b) The sequence of failure in the combined mode is concrete failure in the upper part,,, bond failure in the remaining part of the anchor and resin tensile fracture at the bottom of the anchor. c) The values of pull-out load normalized with respect to concrete strength, PuNfCCO, can be 29 - regarded as independent of concrete strength. Therefore, a limit state design criterion for adhesive anchors in any concrete substrate can be established. d) The values of anchor displacement normalized with respect to concrete strength, 6., Vfcco, vary linearly with it. Based upon this, a simple mathematical function can be determined, which allows the calculation of the displacement of any adhesive anchor. This can be used as a design criterion for the, limit state of serviceability of the particular system...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To manage {{social roles}} is a {{challenging}} part of self-management post-stroke. This study explored how stroke survivors act as role managers with their spouses {{in the context}} of everyday activities. METHOD: Two stroke survivors with a first time stroke living at home with a spouse were included. Data were generated through participant observations at their own environment at 3, 6, 9, 15 and 21 months post-discharge. The narrative analysis focused on the actions of participants. RESULTS: Daily activities can be understood as an arena where role management and a meaningful live is negotiated and co-constructed with others. Everyday activities gave stroke survivors and their spouses insight into stroke survivors' capacities in daily situations. This was sometimes empowering, and other times conflicting when a spouse had negative perceptions of the abilities of the stroke survivors. CONCLUSION: The findings add to the current understanding of self-management and role management with regard to how these are situated in everyday activities. Daily activities can help both spouses to reflect and understand about self-management, role management and comanagement in daily life. Moreover, observing stroke survivors in everyday situations provides professionals with concrete pictures of stroke survivors' performance and self-management in interaction with their spouses. Implications for Rehabilitation Self-management is a dynamic process in which individuals actively manage a chronic condition and finally live a meaningful life with a long-term chronic condition; self-management can be divided into medical, role, and emotional management; comanagement is when individuals activate resources and use the capacities of other persons to manage a situation together. Self-management is situated in everyday activities. Everyday activities give stroke survivors and their partners impressions about stroke survivors' self-management abilities post-stroke in an everyday context. Everyday activities give stroke survivors and their partners an arena where role management and a meaningful life are negotiated and coconstructed through doing. Observing stroke survivors in everyday situations provides professionals a <b>concreter</b> picture of stroke survivors' self-management and comanagement with their partners than can be obtained from an informal interview...|$|E
