5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|High rains {{in eastern}} Texas, totaling over , flooded roads in Shelby and Panola {{counties}}; {{damage in the}} two counties collectively totaled $1.5 million. Storm-related flooding washed out a bridge in Henderson and portions of the Santa Fe Railway line between Carthage and Longview. Five people required rescue after being trapped in a fast-moving river. The rains in the region were considered the heaviest in 17 years, and leaving severe damage to corn, <b>cotton,</b> <b>and</b> watermelon crops. Similarly, the floods damaged <b>cotton</b> <b>and</b> other crops in northern Louisiana, totaling several million dollars in losses. The rains caused many streams to exceed their banks, including one creek near Converse that flooded roads and railways. The floods forced families to evacuate in low-lying areas of northern Louisiana. The rainfall in Shreveport caused the worst floods related to a tropical cyclone on record. While the storm was dropping heavy rainfall, it produced thunderstorms and gusty winds along the Texas and Louisiana coastlines. A severe thunderstorm related to the storm damaged roofs and windows in Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
