5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> from a ship and go on a killing spree. In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Although Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they <b>could</b> <b>escape,</b> they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, {{although}} Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In {{stark contrast to the}} industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} the Venetians {{decided to send}} troops against the Ottoman advances. Skanderbeg {{gathered}} 13,400 men, among whom were many Venetians, to launch {{an assault on the}} Ottoman besieging camp, who had taken command once Mehmed left Albania after the construction of Elbasan. Skanderbeg had split his army into three parts and surrounded the besiegers. Ballaban was killed during the fighting and the Ottoman forces were left without a commander and a depleted force which was surrounded. Afterwards the Albanian-Venetian forces completed the rout by killing the remaining Ottoman forces before they <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> by way of Dibër. The victory was well received by both Albanians and Italians. This did not signal the end of the war, however, as soon after, Skanderbeg took up some assaults on Elbasan after being urged to by Venice, but was not able to take the fortress due to lack of artillery. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors, which led Mehmed to begin another campaign against the Albanians. This would result in another siege on Krujë.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to his former preoccupation with the Council's possible intentions. He began to reconsider the details of Howard's behaviour, sinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind circled {{about the idea of}} escaping from these rooms; but whither <b>could</b> he <b>escape</b> into this vast, crowded world? He would be worse off than a Saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London. And besides, how <b>could</b> anyone <b>escape</b> from these rooms? ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802), {{a string of}} {{victories}} at sea ensured that the Royal Navy was dominant. The French Navy in particular had suffered heavy losses, and in Northern European waters had been forced back into its own harbours by British blockade squadrons. Although large ports were watched by fleets of ships of the line, small ports had their own blockade squadrons too, including the shallow French ports on the English Channel. These harbours could not accommodate ships of the line but were well situated for frigates that attacked shipping in British waters whenever they <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> the blockade. One such port was Dunkirk in French Flanders, which contained a squadron of four French frigates: the 44-gun Poursuivante under Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, the 40-gun Carmagnole and the 36-gun Désirée and Incorruptible. Dunkirk was well defended, with gun batteries and gunboats overlooking the harbour. In addition, the port was surrounded by complicated coastal shoals into which the frigates could retreat if attacked.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} at Le Mans but made a forced march north to Alençon, from where he <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> into the safety of Normandy. Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, {{against the advice of}} his officials. The weather was extremely hot, the King was increasingly ill and he appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign. Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his castle at Chinon. Philip and Richard were making good progress, not least because it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations. They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated on his horse, agreed to a complete surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian and she would marry Richard {{at the end of the}} coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they <b>could</b> <b>escape,</b> and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E

5|$|The French ships {{followed}} Swiftsure by tacking {{into the}} wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining {{the pressure on the}} slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive though those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourrège) and Dix-Août (under Louis-Marie Le Gouardin) and the frigate Créole.|$|E
5|$|Troude was wary on {{his arrival}} in the Leeward Islands on 29 March, refusing to {{approach}} Martinique and instead anchoring near the Îles des Saintes until {{the situation in the}} islands could be established. Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe, he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane, who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique. Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes, joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee, HMS York, HMS Belleisle, HMS Captain, HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate closer inshore. Blockading the Saintes was a difficult task: the French had three channels through which they <b>could</b> <b>escape,</b> too many to be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane's disposal. In addition, Troude's force could not be attacked directly, the width of the channels making it impossible for the British ships to attack in full strength.|$|E
5|$|When Nao {{received}} news Card {{had arrived}} in Saigon, he inspected the equipment which now included a new battery and a redesigned bomb. Again, Nao decided to set off the bombs during {{the early hours of}} May 2, so that he and his fellow operative <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> safely and avoid inflicting casualties on the local population. But due to illness, Cay declined {{to take part in the}} operation, so Hung had to replace him. At around 9am on May 1, Nao rushed to Hung’s home, where the latter was given a hand grenade and was notified of an upcoming operation without much detail. At 6pm, after Nao had finished unloading the bombs onto one canoe, he and Hung traveled down the Saigon River in two separate canoes, towards the commercial port district. Both men than pulled over in the Thu Thiem area, to avoid detection from South Vietnamese authorities by intermingling with the local workers who lived there. While waiting for the right time, Nao briefed Hung on the objectives of the operation, which was to sink the largest American ship at the Saigon Port, and promptly report the results back to headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Africaines {{journey to}} Madras took several months and Corbet {{made a number}} of stops on his passage, the final one being at the small British island base of Rodriguez in early September 1810. There Corbet was {{informed}} of the disaster at Grand Port and on his own initiative immediately sailed south to augment Rowley's weakened squadron. Arriving off Isle de France at 06:15 on 11 September, Corbet spotted a French schooner near Île Ronde and gave chase, the schooner sheltering behind the reefs at Grand Bay on {{the eastern side of the}} island. At 07:30, Corbet ordered the frigate's boats to enter the creek into which the schooner had fled, the small craft entering the waterway in the hope of storming and capturing the vessel. As the boats approached, French soldiers and militia appeared along the banks and began firing on the British sailors. Fire was returned by Royal Marines in the boats, but Africaines barge grounded soon after the ambush was sprung and became trapped, French gunfire killing two men and wounding ten. The other boat reached the grounded and abandoned schooner, but the six men aboard were unable to move the vessel unaided and were forced to depart, coming under fire which wounded five men, before they <b>could</b> <b>escape</b> the French trap.|$|E
5|$|Five Bristol Fighters in bombing formation, {{took off}} at 11:40 with eight bombs each, which were dropped on {{retreating}} columns between Et Tire and Tulkarm. They also fired hundreds of machine gun bullets, scattering the retreating force towards Kakon and Tulkarm. At this time, machine gun {{fire from the}} ground aimed at the aircraft was fairly heavy, causing a number of casualties to the air crews. At 12:30, a second formation of three aircraft repeated {{the attack on the}} same retreating Ottoman column, which had reached the corner on the Tulkarm road. Six aircraft took off in the afternoon, two pursuing the retreating columns north of Kakon heading towards Baka, while four aircraft found soldiers, transport, artillery, horses, and camels moving from Tulkarm to Anebta. These they bombed and machine gunned, in a section of the road where it passed the little Wadi Zeimer, through a gorge with steep hills on either side. Before the column <b>could</b> <b>escape,</b> another formation of seven Bristol Fighters attacked them, at about 17:00 west of Anebta. The evening patrols reported the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters still at Nablus, but the entire Eighth Army appeared to be in retreat, with their Tulkarm headquarters already captured. At the crossroads of the Afulah and the coast roads at Sumrah, a supply base with hospital and grain dump was in flames and its inhabitants were seen retreating into the hills.|$|E
