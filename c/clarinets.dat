5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of <b>clarinets</b> used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive <b>clarinets</b> are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano <b>clarinets</b> were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass <b>clarinets</b> and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger <b>clarinets.</b> Ivory was used for a few 18th-century <b>clarinets,</b> but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline <b>clarinets</b> are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such <b>clarinets</b> are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for <b>clarinets</b> since the 1860s, although few modern <b>clarinets</b> are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson <b>Clarinets</b> of England manufactures <b>clarinets</b> using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

5|$|Most alto {{and bass}} <b>clarinets</b> {{have an extra}} key to allow a (written) E3. Modern professional-quality bass <b>clarinets</b> {{generally}} have additional keywork to written C3.

5|$|The {{main body}} of most <b>clarinets</b> is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are {{operated}} by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some <b>clarinets</b> have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger <b>clarinets</b> the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system <b>clarinets</b> and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system <b>clarinets,</b> the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

5|$|This {{practice}} {{of using a}} variety of <b>clarinets</b> to achieve coloristic variety was common in 20th-century classical music and continues today. However, many clarinetists and conductors prefer to play parts originally written for obscure instruments on B or E <b>clarinets,</b> which are often of better quality and more prevalent and accessible.|$|E

5|$|In concert bands, <b>clarinets</b> are an {{important}} part of the instrumentation. The E clarinet, B clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per part on the other <b>clarinets.</b> There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all soprano and piccolo <b>clarinets</b> have keywork {{enabling}} them to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that sounds D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo clarinet), though some B <b>clarinets</b> go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A clarinet. On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E

5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, <b>clarinets</b> {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older <b>clarinets</b> were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller <b>clarinets</b> is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger <b>clarinets</b> are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} frequently {{includes two}} clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually {{equipped with a}} pair of standard <b>clarinets</b> in B and A, and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times {{over the course of a}} piece, or less commonly, a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms' 3rd symphony). Clarinet sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, an E or a bass clarinet. In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different <b>clarinets</b> including the E or D soprano <b>clarinets,</b> basset horn, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and/or contrabass clarinet.|$|E
