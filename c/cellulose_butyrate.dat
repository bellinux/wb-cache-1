30|$|One of the {{important}} issues relevant to wood/plastic composite molding is the compatibility between hydrophilic wood and hydrophobic plastic. Polyolefins modified with maleic anhydride, which have been frequently used for wood and polyolefin composites, are not effective for poly(lactic acid) composites. Because compounds with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups are potential compatibilizers, cellulose esters of several carboxylic acids, RCOO-cellulose (R = CH 3, C 2 H 5, C 3 H 7, C 4 H 9, C 5 H 11, C 11 H 23), were synthesized and their effects as compatibilizers of wood/poly(lactic acid) composites (WPLC) were examined in this study. The mechanical properties of WPLC were improved {{with a small amount}} of added cellulose esters, especially <b>cellulose</b> <b>butyrate</b> or cellulose valerate.

40|$|Catalytic transesterifications of {{cellulose}} were studied under homogeneous conditions using the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) as a solvent. Cellulose was thus efficiently converted into cellulose esters employing various methyl esters and 10 mol% of 1, 5, 7 -triazabicyclo[4. 4. 0]dec- 5 - ene (TBD) as catalyst. 1 H NMR {{analysis of the}} products revealed up to 2. 3 turnovers of the methyl esters per catalyst molecule, leading to degrees of substitution (DS) of up to 0. 69. Although a comparatively low turnover number (TON) is observed, the developed methodology represents the first successful homogeneous catalytic reaction on cellulose. Furthermore, the new method {{is an important step}} forward in terms of sustainability, since the BMIMCl-DMSO mixture can be recycled and reused for the reaction, and toxic and corrosive chemicals commonly employed for cellulose esterification (such as anhydrides, acid chlorides and bromides, organic bases, all in overstoichiometric amounts) are avoided. To demonstrate the versatility of this transesterification, an aromatic (cellulose benzoate), an aliphatic (<b>cellulose</b> <b>butyrate),</b> and a fatty acid containing cellulose ester (cellulose 10 -undecenoate) were prepared. Additionally, cellulose 10 -undecenoate was successfully used for thiol-ene grafting onto reactions employing two thiols for efficient thiol-ene addition reactions.

40|$|Population {{development}} of key groups of bacteria involved in municipal refuse conversion to methane was measured {{from the time}} of initial incubation through the onset of methane production. Hemicellulolytic bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, hydrogen-producing acetogens, and acetate- and H 2 -plus-CO 2 -utilizing methanogens were enumerated by the most-probable-number technique with media containing oat spelt xylan, ball-milled <b>cellulose,</b> <b>butyrate,</b> acetate, and H 2 plus CO 2, respectively. Refuse decomposition was monitored in multiple replicate laboratory-scale sanitary landfills. A laboratory-scale landfill was dismantled weekly for microbial and chemical analysis. Leachate was neutralized and recycled to ensure methanogenesis. The methane concentration of the sampled containers increased to 64 % by day 69, at which time the maximum methane production rate, 929 liters of CH 4 per dry kg-year, was measured. Population increases of 2, 4, 5, 5, and 6 orders of magnitude were measured between fresh refuse and the methane production phase for the hemicellulolytic bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, butyrate-catabolizing acetogens, and acetate- and H 2 -CO 2 -utilizing methanogens, respectively. The cellulolytic bacteria and acetogens increased more slowly than the methanogens and only after the onset of methane production. The initial decrease in the pH of the refuse ecosystem from 7. 5 to 5. 7 was attributed to the accumulation of acidic end products of sugar fermentation, to the low acid-consuming activity of the acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria, and to levels of oxygen and nitrate in the fresh refuse sufficient for oxidation of only 8 % of the sugars to carbon dioxide and water. Cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition was most rapid after establishment of the methanogenic and acetogenic populations and a reduction in the initial accumulation of carboxylic acids. A total of 72 % of these carbohydrates were degraded in the container sampled after 111 days. Initially acetate utilization, but ultimately polymer hydrolysis, limited the rate of refuse conversion to methane. Microbial and chemical composition data were combined to formulate an updated description of refuse decomposition in four phases: an aerobic phase, an anaerobic acid phase, an accelerated methane production phase, and a decelerated methane production phase...|$|E

The relationship between the formulation variable responses including rnicrocapsule yield, microcapsule size, size distribution, drug loading and degree of aggregation and the polymer molecular weight, viscosity of the polymer solution and polydispersity of the polymer were evaluated by Stepwise Regression Analysis. The effects of molecular weight of <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>butyrate</b> on the formulation variables but drug loading were significant. The mean particle size and size distribution of microcapsules increased with increasing molecular weight. Solution viscosity and polydispersity of the polymer also affected the mean particle size.

Stepwise Regression Analysis also indicated that viscosity and polydispersity of the polymer were also influenced by polymer molecular weight. Higher molecular weight of the polymer results in the higher viscosity and larger polydispersity. The burst release was influenced by both the solution viscosity and polydispersity of the <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>butyrate.</b> Higher viscosity of the polymer solution and smaller degree of polydispersity resulted in the smallest burst effect.
