5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show's production budget {{and a return to}} the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
5|$|After the Labour Party was {{defeated}} at the 2010 general election, Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party; in September 2010, Miliband {{was elected to}} replace him. His tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a leftward shift in his party's policies, and by opposition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public sector. He led his party into several elections, including the 2014 European Parliament election. Following Labour's defeat by the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, Miliband announced his resignation as leader on 8 May 2015. He was succeeded in the ensuing leadership election by Jeremy Corbyn.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Roberts sat on {{an interim}} committee dealing with hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding end-of-life care and advance directives. Other legislation that Roberts carried in 2010 included {{a bill to}} allow voluntary income tax contributions to support 2-1-1 services, and she fought against <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Native American tuition waiver program at Fort Lewis College. Roberts {{was one of only}} three Republican House members to vote in support of Colorado's 2010 budget, after successfully sponsoring an amendment that removed restrictions on Fort Lewis College's ability to set its own out-of-state tuition rates.|$|E

That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status.

5|$|Star Breweries {{invested}} {{over four}} million euros into improving its {{factories in the}} 2009-11 period, resulting in a 20% increase in production capacity. These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages.

5|$|The {{president}} effected drastic <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. Martín Balza, who {{had performed}} well during {{the repression of}} Seineldín's mutiny, as the Army's General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a conscript soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism {{of the armed forces}} during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E

The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a serious}} {{heart attack in}} 1988 MacMillan {{continued}} to work intensely. In 1989 {{he made his first}} new ballet for Covent Garden for five years, a new version of Britten's The Prince of the Pagodas. The company had never found the original 1956 Cranko version satisfactory, and it was neglected during the composer's lifetime. MacMillan thought the piece could be successfully reworked with some <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> score, but the Britten estate refused to allow any alterations. MacMillan reverted to classical ballet for the piece, creating a fairy-tale work far from his accustomed style. The result was not judged among his best works, but it marked the emergence of the 19-year-old Darcey Bussell, whom he picked to dance the young heroine. Along with the former Bolshoi principal dancer Irek Mukhamedov, who joined the Royal Ballet in 1991, Bussell was MacMillan's final important muse. For the two of them he created Winter Dreams (1991), inspired by Chekhov's Three Sisters. Mukhamedov was the brutish male leading character in MacMillan's last ballet, The Judas Tree (1992).|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Gay first {{affected}} the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On Mejit Island, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left {{most of the}} islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, Ailuk Atoll experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000people homeless across the country, {{but there were no}} native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May, the British {{government}} {{continued to}} state that it would provide only logistical and technical support to UNAMSIL, but was privately exploring its options for a military deployment. The United Kingdom had a greater level of political involvement in Sierra Leone {{than in any other}} African country and, with the country's stability deteriorating, it was reluctant to see that investment wasted. In addition, an estimated 1,000 entitled personnel were in Sierra Leone, and the government feared for their safety. Academics have since suggested that the credibility of UNAMSIL and future UN peacekeeping operations would have been at stake had the mission in Sierra Leone been allowed to fail. The British Armed Forces were not as widely deployed in 2000 as they were to be later in the decade. The British Army had two brigades serving with NATO in the Balkans, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had ongoing commitments to Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, and elsewhere, but the armed forces—particularly units threatened by proposed <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defence budget—were keen to participate in an operation. Senior officers thus advised the government that an operation in Sierra Leone was feasible. Over the following days, there was debate within the British government as to what the aims of a military deployment to Sierra Leone would be. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advocated a full-scale intervention to assist UNAMSIL, arguing that a non-combatant evacuation operation would not be sufficient and would undermine the UN, but the MoD believed that the armed forces would be unable to sustain a larger-scale operation.|$|E
