40|$|Every year a {{large amount}} of toner is {{produced}} for <b>copiers</b> and <b>printers</b> by toner manufacturing companies. Toner, the dry ink used in laser <b>printers</b> and <b>copiers,</b> can be blended in to asphalt to improve strength and temperature resistance properties. Some of the toner does not meet quality specifications for use in <b>copiers</b> or <b>printers</b> and consequently becomes a waste product of the manufacturing process. This manufacturing waste, along with the spent toner from <b>copiers</b> and <b>printers,</b> is dumped into landfills {{for lack of a better}} way to utilize the material. A cooperative research project, 7 - 3933, undertaken by the Texas Department of Transportation and the University of Texas at Austin, investigated the feasibility and potential benefits of utilizing waste toner in hot-mix asphalt concrete. This implementation project transferred the results from project 7 - 3933, in which the feasibility and potential benefits of utilizing waste toner in hot-mix asphalt concrete were investigated. The results of this study can assist industry and state agencies in their efforts to utilize toner in binder modification. 17. Key Word...|$|R
5000|$|Technology has {{advanced}} since Equitrac's founding, but {{the promise of}} a [...] "paperless" [...] office never materialized. Instead, offices use more paper than ever before, racking up increasingly large copying and printing bills. Equitrac changed gears to solidify its lead and grab more market share. The company began diversifying by developing software embedded in networked <b>copiers,</b> <b>printers</b> and multifunction devices, from manufacturers such as Xerox, Ricoh, Canon and Sharp. That switch also ushered in a fundamental shift in how Equitrac earned its money: while previously it helped companies track costs that would later be charged back to clients, now Equitrac helps those firms cut paper and ink costs.|$|R

40|$|Background to the {{investigations}} was the {{revision of the}} current selection criteria of the German ecolabel ("Blue Angel") for copiers (RAL-UZ 62) and printers (RAL-UZ 85). In the old labels limits were set for ozone, dust and styrene emissions. The corresponding test methods did no longer fulfil today's requirements with regard to emission measurements. In addition, the contrary emission behaviour of hardcopy devices due {{to the use of}} different and non-comparable test methods has been recently discussed. For this reason a new test method had to be developed which enables a reliable, reproducible determination of emission rates for dust, ozone, styrene, benzene and TVOC. The basis for this was the ECMA Standard 328 compiled by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer Association) using dynamic chamber measurements. Nine different machines, desktop laser printers as well as office devices like bigger copiers and multifunctional devices were investigated. As a result of the st udy new criteria for the "Blue Angel" for <b>copiers,</b> <b>printers</b> and a new created for multifunctional devices (RAL-UZ 114), concerning TVOC, styrene, benzene, ozone and dust emissions were determined...|$|R

40|$|Digital <b>copiers</b> and <b>printers</b> {{require that}} {{processing}} steps be performed on image data {{after it is}} captured and before it is finally printed. Grayscale data is typically captured using an image scanner or generated using image composition software. Single bit data is usually printed using a laser, LED, ink-jet, or thermal writer. This thesis describes the design of an ASIC that implements several image processing algorithms. Image histogram modification and convolution filtering are used for operating on gray data. Ordered dither, error diffusion and thresholding convert gray data to binary. A pipe line architecture is used to maximize both the modularity and the throughput of the design. A CPU interface is used to allow flexible programming of the image processing parameters. The design is implemented and simulation stimulus is generated entirely in VHDL. A design of this type allows many of the image processing operations commonly required in digital <b>copiers</b> and <b>printers</b> to be performed in real time {{rather than as a}} pre-processing software step. The programmability of the image processing parameters makes the design suitable {{for a wide variety of}} applications. The use of VHDL for the design allows flexibility in selecting the target implementation technology for synthesis...|$|R
