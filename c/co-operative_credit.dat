40|$|Traditionally, {{agricultural}} co-operatives {{have shown}} a very acute financial need {{that has not been}} satisfied by credit entities, especially after their diversification process during the present decade. Therefore, these co-operatives have been forced to find by themselves alternative financial sources through the creation of credit sections and the stablishment of co-operation agreements with agricultural credit banks and <b>credit</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> Moreover, during the last years, credit sections are undergoing an important process of change so an empirical analysis of the strategic behaviour of agricultural co-operatives in their new socioeconomic context is needed. This article identifies the different entrepreneurial aspects that characterize agricultural <b>co-operatives</b> with <b>credit</b> sections in the Valencian Community.

40|$|In {{the history}} of the <b>co-operative</b> {{movement}} the <b>credit</b> <b>co-operatives</b> in Central Europe were among the most successful and highly respected institutions offering financial services in the most remote localities with a perfect know how of local conditions and also with a considerable social impact and moral influence. Their role was not only economic but also social and cultural one. Their network was in early 1950 ´ replaced by State saving banks as part of the centrally planned economy system. After 1989 the renaissance of their network besides the existing banking institutions has been made possible by a new law. Unfortunately {{in the course of this}} renaissance new serious deformations occurred and co-operative ideas were misused for egoistic personal purposes. Extremely negative experiences with some <b>credit</b> <b>co-operatives</b> evoke suspicions and distrust of the population. An almost complete collapse of the system occurring since about 1999 had many reasons. Radical consequences for the existence of this sector are expected with the EU legislation process.
