5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>farming</b> practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>farming</b> practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
25|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>farming</b> {{practice}} in the area also possibly contributed, sewage {{could have been a}} cause as well, with a reduction of trees and hedges higher up the valley causing water to flow through more quickly than would have been the case in the past.

40|$|The {{protagonist of}} the CBC documentary, The <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> <b>Farming,</b> is an 89 -year-old farmer, called Henry. We learn that his grandson, Adam, has been {{recording}} Henry’s reminiscences about farming {{as a way}} of preserving his family heritage. The program was produced in 1998 by Adam Goddard, a 25 -year-old musician and composer, in collaboration with veteran CBC producer, Steve Wadhams. Adam is more hunter-gather than farmer. He collects found sound, an artist alert to its musical possibilities. He is composing a work using Henry’s speech. We hear the elder’s reaction. And then, in an indispensable coda, the two of them decamp to the barn, back on Henry’s turf once again. The show piece of The <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> <b>Farming</b> is, of course, the musical composition. It is no accident that we have to wait to the end to hear it. In fact, it is testament to the impeccable dramaturgy. It is a master class in the slow reveal. Like all great craft, the attention to detail is well judged and sublimely concealed. The <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> <b>Farming</b> excels <b>in</b> 2 ̆ 7 show, don’t tell 2 ̆ 7 exposition. As storytelling, it upends the conventions of pioneer reminiscences, recombining words and phrases into something with an altogether new meaning. It is anti-nostalgia. And it challenges us. Are Henry’s words the lyrics or musical notes? Is Adam hallowing the past or critiquing it? The <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> <b>Farming</b> juxtaposes an old viewpoint and a youthful one, found sound and the music of an old man’s voice, musical abstraction and the concrete reality of cattle bellowing in the barn. This counterpoint creates a satisfying complexity. This work was ingenious in its storytelling nearly 20 years ago. After all these years the novelty has not worn off. This classic remains farm-fresh...|$|R
40|$|Changes towards {{vertical}} integration in agriculture, increases <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> size, and fewer farm numbers have concerned sociologists for decades. This research conducted two empirical examinations of such trends {{and their effects}} on community well-being in 99 small towns in Iowa from 1994 to 2004. The first study {{examined the effects of}} the scale and structure of agriculture on material and social community well-being. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> size proved more drastic than <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> organization during this decade, with the most dramatic <b>changes</b> occurring <b>in</b> the concentration of pork production.
