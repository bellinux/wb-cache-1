Then the dummy lays their cards face up on the table. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player required to follow suit if possible. Tricks are won by the highest trump, or if there were none played, the highest card of the led suit. The player who won the previous trick leads to the next trick. The declarer has control of the dummy's cards and plays them when it is their turn, although the declarer often requests his partner to play a specified card on his behalf. There also exist conventions that <b>communicate</b> <b>further</b> <b>information</b> between defenders about their hands during the play.|$|R
40|$|Consumption {{patterns}} have considerably {{changed over}} recent years. We are witnessing {{more and more}} frequently {{to a lack of}} information (i. e. information asymmetry) between food producers and consumers, this generate in the consumer the latter need to access information related to processes of production of food and food distribution. Decisionmaking, in absence of <b>further</b> <b>information,</b> leads consumers to pay attention to food labeling. Food labels become the only tool for consumers to acquire additional information about products {{in order to make the}} purchase decision. In today’s modern and globalized market, labels limitations can be partially overcome by using Mobile Marketing tools, such as the QR Code (Quick Response Code). Therefore the objective of this study is: (1) categorize profiles of consumers according to the importance given to various information patterns shown on food labeling; (2) discover consumer behaviors when making a purchasing decision based on food information they require in the label; (3) discover consumer profiles with regards to food quality and the use QR Code to acquire <b>further</b> <b>information</b> about food products. Two Italian regional capitals were chosen, as representative of Northern and Southern Italy, basing on the geographical division of the Country made by the ISTAT (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica). The interviews were carried out by telephone, using a questionnaire. Data collected were processed by Multidimensional Scaling We discovered eight profiles of consumers with different purchasing behaviors. Some consumer profiles, with lifestyles typical of contemporary life, use the QR Code to obtain additional information about food products. The innovative purchasing behavior identifies a consumer who is particularly interested in food quality and safety. Agri-food businesses that focus on quality productions could target the innovative profile and <b>communicate</b> <b>further</b> <b>information</b> trough the use of modern communication technologies...|$|R

A “mock-up ” version should be assembled and then subjected to editing, the preparation of connector sentences and paragraphs, and possibly, the development of new tables and figures for <b>communicating</b> <b>information.</b> <b>Further,</b> the initial draft of an EIS summary shoul...|$|R
