40|$|Current {{fatigue design}} of roof {{cladding}} is entirely reliant on complex and repetitive prototype testing. Standardised cladding fatigue design has successfully minimized {{the occurrence of}} fatigue failure during severe wind storms such as cyclones, but the prototype tests required in fatigue design are costly and time consuming. All variations of the cladding assembly, including the various profiles, manufacturers, fasteners and fastener arrangements, must be tested multiple times. A {{greater understanding of the}} mechanism underlying fatigue of roof cladding in combination with a numerical model capable of simulating cladding fatigue could reduce the total reliance on prototype testing in fatigue design. Such a numerical model would employ fracture mechanics to simulate crack initiation in the cladding and could to some extent replace aspects of the prototype test or enable a semi-empirical approach to fatigue design. This thesis investigates the mechanism of fatigue crack initiation in corrugated roof cladding in a bid to develop a model capable of simulating this phenomenon numerically. Characterising fatigue crack initiation required the development of a specialized testing arrangement which isolated a single cladding-fastener connection. The test, known as the isolated fastener connection (IFC) test, restrained all four edges of a 720 mm × 150 mm section of corrugated cladding with a fastener located at the centre displacing to induce load. The IFC test successfully recreated the response of the cladding that was observed in full scale testing when subject to both monotonic and cyclic loads. In particular, the IFC test reproduced the two common crack formations observed in cladding fatigue, the 'star' type crack and 'H' type crack, and produced the cracks after a comparable number of cycles. A unique and inexpensive photogrammetric method was developed to measure the displacement of the cladding sample within the IFC test when subject to monotonic loads. The photogrammetric method involved texturizing the cladding surface and taking 70 photographs of the cladding at distinct angles. These photographs were passed through commercial photogrammetry software to produce a 3 D digital reconstruction of the cladding surface. The displacement of the cladding was then calculated by comparing the digital reconstruction of the deformed cladding with a digital reconstruction of the cladding under no applied load. The digital surface models produced using the photogrammetric method was also used to extend numerical model validation studies. The digital reconstructions were compared directly with the deformed mesh of a numerical model to provide a full-field comparison of the displacement of the <b>cladding</b> <b>sheet.</b> The IFC test was employed to study the mechanism underlying crack initiation. Corrugated cladding samples were cycled under constant amplitude loading to form a 'star' type crack. The fastener hole edge was monitored by both digital microscopes and strain gauge rosettes. The longitudinal arm of the 'star' type crack opened in the underside of the cladding in regions of tensile strain. The crack proceeded to propagate through the thickness of the cladding along the plane of maximum shear. Once the thickness of the cladding had been entirely bisected, the crack then rapidly opened into the plane of the cladding. A similar mechanism was observed for the transverse leg of the crack. Crack initiation was then defined as the point in which the crack had entirely bisected the thickness of the cladding and had begun to open into the plane of the cladding. Under a number of load amplitudes this point of crack initiation occurred at a crack length of 0. 9 mm and 0. 5 mm for the longitudinal and transverse cracks respectively. Based on this definition of crack initiation, the strain field at the crack tip at crack initiation was monitored to produce a strain based crack initiation criterion. A crack initiation criterion based on the principal surface strains and distinct to the longitudinal and transverse directions was found. Attempts were also made to identify the kinematic material properties of the cladding steel. Anti-buckling fixtures were developed to enable tension-compression testing of the thin steel sheet but the cladding softened too much and continued to buckle under compressive loads. Preliminary results suggest the cladding is prone to significant cyclic softening and the nonlinear combined kinematic and isotropic hardening model is required to accurately describe the kinematic material properties of the steel in a numerical simulation. A numerical model of the cladding subject to monotonic loads in an IFC test was also developed. The model accurately predicted the fastener reaction, strain surrounding the fastener hole and the displacement of the <b>cladding</b> <b>sheet.</b> Under a maximum applied load the cladding predicted the displacement of the cladding to within 89...|$|E

A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> at the roll gap by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method. Constant shear friction between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> is assumed. Due to the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> unbounded before rolling, double-layer sheets are not bonded {{at the entrance of}} the roll gap. Thus the stress field of the roll gap for this model is different from that for <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> bonded firmly before rolling. In this study, the neutral point between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet,</b> the rolling pressure distribution along the contact interface between the rolls and the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet,</b> the horizontal stresses in the component layers of the <b>clad</b> <b>sheet,</b> the rolling force, and the rolling torque etc., can be easily and rapidly calculated by using the developed {{analytical model}}.

40|$|Aluminum <b>clad</b> <b>sheets</b> for brazing {{materials}} in the automotive heat exchangers are required to exhibit both high strength and excellent erosion resistance. In this study, the effects of microstructural changes on the property of <b>clad</b> <b>sheets</b> due to thermomechanical treatment were investigated. The <b>clad</b> <b>sheets</b> were fabricated by roll bonding of twin-roll-cast AA 3527 and AA 4343 alloys followed by cold rolling down to a thickness of 0. 22 mm. Partial or full annealing was conducted at the final thickness in order to improved the erosion resistance while keeping the proper strength. Since full annealing was achieved for a temperature of 400 °C, annealing treatments were performed at 360, 380, and 400 °C, respectively. The tensile strength of 3527 / 4343 clad material {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the annealing temperature before the brazing heat treatment.

40|$|Asymmetrical {{and lower}} heat {{transport}} {{caused by the}} cladding strip during twin-roll casting (TRC) of <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> makes the process window narrow compared with traditional TRC. The effect of pouring temperature on process stability is more remarkable when it is relatively high under high casting speed and casting speed becomes a leading factor when its value is low. The inter-diffusion zone width at the Al/Fe interface depends on the solid/semi-solid contacting time. The longer the time is, the wider the inter-diffusion zone. A widest zone of 3. 8 μm is attained under condition of casting speed of 1. 25 m/min and pouring temperature of 720 °C. Bonding strength of <b>clad</b> <b>sheet</b> by TRC depends on inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction. Proper combinations of inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction can result in same high bonding strength. The highest bonding strength of 16 N/mm is attained under a combination of rolling reduction of 29 % and inter-diffusion zone of 3. 7 μm. The wetting of aluminum melt on steel surface is uneven and insufficient {{as a result of}} short contacting time in TRC. As a result, same rolling reduction in TRC induces lower bonding strength than in roll bonding process.
