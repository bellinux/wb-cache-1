5|$|As {{one of the}} Crown dependencies, Jersey is {{autonomous}} and self-governing, {{with its}} own independent legal, administrative and fiscal systems.

40|$|We {{examine how}} an executive's <b>consultations</b> <b>with</b> {{interest}} groups during the formative {{stage of the}} policy process affect its bargaining success during the decision-making stage after it has proposed new policies to legislative actors. Our theory sets out how <b>consultations</b> <b>with</b> interest groups strengthen the executive by bolstering its formal and informal agenda-setting power. The empirical testing ground for our theory is the European Union (EU), {{and in particular the}} consultations held by the European Commission. The analysis assesses the effects of these consultations on the congruence between the Commission's legislative proposals on controversial issues and EU laws. Our analysis incorporates detailed information on the type and scope of each <b>consultation.</b> In line <b>with</b> our theory, we find that the Commission had more success during the decision-making stage after conducting open <b>consultations</b> <b>with</b> large numbers of interest groups during the policy formation stage...|$|R

Consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.|$|E
5|$|However, Bruce {{soon became}} embroiled in the {{disputes}} over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and {{his lack of}} <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E
