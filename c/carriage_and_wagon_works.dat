5|$|Manchester United {{was formed}} as Newton Heath L F.C. in 1878 by {{the workers in}} the <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works</b> of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Newton Heath depot. In 1901, the club was in over £2,500 of debt and facing a {{winding-up}} order; however, they were saved by local brewer John Henry Davies, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After Davies' death in 1927, the club fell into financial difficulties once again, but James W. Gibson stepped in as a new financial benefactor in 1931. Gibson himself died in 1951, but while ownership of the club passed to his widow, Violet, control of the club passed to director and former player Harold Hardman.|$|E
25|$|The LMS {{inherited}} {{a wide variety}} of passenger rolling stock from its constituent companies, and appointed Robert Whyte Reid, and ex-Midland Railway man, as the head of its Carriage department. Reid had already started to introduce more efficient carriage building practices at the Derby <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>works</b> of the Midland Railway prior to grouping and these same practices were soon introduced to the <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> of the former LNWR at Wolverton and the L at Newton Heath.|$|E
25|$|To the west, {{the site}} also had a six-road <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works,</b> {{suitable}} for maintenance and repair {{of all types of}} rolling stock. Cleaning was carried out on tracks between the station and the locomotive sheds.|$|E
50|$|In 1962 {{building}} of new locomotives ceased at Swindon. Locomotive repairs <b>and</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>work</b> continued, though the original <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> workshop was sold. The whole works closed in 1986, but one building currently houses Swindon Steam Railway Museum. The engineers' office {{is now the}} headquarters of English Heritage, and purpose-built storage now houses the English Heritage Archive.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} railway {{works in}} York, the Queen Street Works, York {{had been established}} in 1842, and carried out locomotive, <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>work.</b> The <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> was a separate building in the north-east of the site, near Queen Street. The building was extended westward in 1864, to give a production capacity of 100 wagons per week.|$|R
50|$|As a result, with {{scrapping}} {{rolling stock}} keeping employment levels at the works high, {{the choice was}} made to cease building of new locomotives at Swindon, and to reassign the works to become a heavy repair facility. New building of locomotives finished in 1965 with construction of the Class 14 diesel-hydraulic locomotives. Locomotive repairs <b>and</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>work</b> continued, though the original <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> workshop was sold.|$|R
25|$|By {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century Brighton works could no longer cope with the repair and {{building}} of both locomotives and rolling stock. In 1911 the LB built a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> at Lancing, which operated until 1965. A marine engineering workshop was established in the mid 1870s at Newhaven.|$|E
25|$|The LB {{directors}} recognised {{that part}} of the problem at Brighton was that the works was overwhelmed with work. In 1910 they purchased land at Lancing for a new <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works,</b> which was opened in 1912. This allowed Stroudley's carriage shed to be used as an overflow 'stock shed' by the locomotive works and the motive power depot. Locomotives repaired at Brighton were also sometimes taken to Lancing for their final painting.|$|E
500|$|Calthrop {{started work}} with Robert Stephenson & Co {{and then was}} apprenticed to the London & North Western Railway at Crewe in 1874. [...] In 1879 he joined the Great Western Railway, where he rose to {{assistant}} manager of the <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works.</b> [...] In 1882 he went to India to join the Great Indian Peninsula Railway as a locomotive inspector.|$|E
5000|$|Wolverhampton works, {{located at}} Gorsebrook, north of Wolverhampton centre, became the {{workshop}} of the Northern Division of the Great Western Railway in 1854 under Joseph Armstrong {{who had been}} in charge of maintenance for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway at Saltney. The first [...] line arrived at Wolverhampton and the running shed was rebuilt. Locomotive repairs were concentrated in Wolverhampton, while <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>work</b> was transferred to Saltney.|$|R
50|$|Barker {{resigned}} {{to go back}} to work in Derby, as a fitter's mate at the <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> railway <b>works</b> in Derby.|$|R
50|$|Plaistow railway {{works were}} built {{adjacent}} to the station {{on the north side}} of the line to the west of the station in 1879 to 1880. A separate engine shed was opened in 1899 adjoining the western end of the works. The locomotive works closed in 1925, with responsibility being transferred to Bow railway works which were a short distance away. <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>work</b> lasted until 1932 when that work was transferred to Wolverton railway works.|$|R
500|$|Secular {{commissions}} {{during this}} period included {{the restoration of the}} medieval tower at Dalton Castle (1859), and buildings for the Lancaster <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works</b> (1864–65). [...] The largest building designed by Paley, and indeed by the practice, was the Royal Albert Asylum (later renamed the Royal Albert Hospital which is currently named Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College) in Lancaster (1868–73); it was in Gothic Revival style, and had an E-shaped plan. [...] It has a central French-type tower, with a steeply pitched pyramidal roof flanked by pinnacles. [...] Paley designed stations for the Furness Railway, starting with the Strand Station in Barrow (1863); he probably also designed the station at Grange-over-Sands (1866). [...] Overlooking the latter town he designed the Grange Hotel (1866).|$|E
500|$|Paley {{did have}} some {{individual}} responsibilities within the practice. [...] He took over from Sharpe as Bridgemaster of the South Lonsdale Hundred in 1860, and in 1868 he was appointed as inspector of Lancaster Gaol and the Judge's Lodgings. [...] He served on the committee of the Royal Albert Asylum for many years, taking much interest in its management. [...] He was {{a director of the}} Lancaster Waggon Company, for whom he designed their factory, the Lancaster <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works</b> (1864–65). [...] In his role as bridgemaster he was responsible for the new road bridge over the River Lune at Caton (1882–83) following its collapse in 1881. [...] Paley became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871, served on its council for two periods, and {{at the time of his}} death was one of its examiners.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{foundation}} of Newton Heath LYR F.C., {{at the request of}} the employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) company's <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works,</b> the club needed a pitch to play on. The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a [...] "bumpy, stony patch in summer, [...] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months". The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in TheThreeCrowns public house, a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.|$|E
50|$|Developments since {{re-opening}} {{have included}} {{the construction of a}} locomotive <b>works,</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> repair <b>works,</b> additional sidings and a café. Additionally, the former gasworks has been opened to the public as a shop and museum, the water tower formerly at Newport was re-erected at Havenstreet in 1971, and money is being raised {{for the construction of a}} carriage storage shed.|$|R
50|$|Shrewsbury Abbey station {{opened on}} 13 August 1866 as the {{temporary}} {{end of the}} Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway (always known locally as 'The Potts'). It was built on part of a monastery that had been destroyed during the Reformation. In 1876 a railway <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> building <b>works</b> of the Midland Wagon Company operated next to the station. It closed in 1912.|$|R

2500|$|The {{appointment}} of Alfred Panter as <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> <b>Works</b> Manager under Robert Billinton in 1898 (Carriage and Wagon Superintendent from 1912) {{led to the}} introduction of bogie carriages for mainline trains in 1905, but suburban services were operated by 6-wheeled [...] "block trains" [...] with solid wooden buffers, permanently tight coupled in sets of ten or 12. Many of these were still in use at grouping in 1923. Better vehicles appeared early in the 20th century with the 'Balloon stock' and electric stock.|$|E
50|$|Taken {{over by the}} Great Western Railway, after {{nationalisation}} under British Railways {{they sold}} off the <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> to the Pullman Company Ltd. Today, both {{the site of the}} railway depot and the <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> have been redeveloped, mainly with buildings and commercial activities associated with the University of Cardiff.|$|E

5000|$|In 1880 the LNWR {{opened a}} line from Aston to [...] on the Birmingham to [...] line which also gave access to the Metropolitan <b>Carriage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wagon</b> Company's <b>works</b> (later Metro-Cammell) at Saltley, reached by a short private siding, opened in 1904, from what the LNWR termed Washwood Heath Junction {{at the point where}} the Aston-Stechford line passed over the Midland Railway from Birmingham to Derby. The new line was also used for the Wolverhampton {{portions}} of some London expresses and also to provide through <b>carriages</b> between Euston <b>and</b> Walsall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} works, {{known locally}} as [...] "The Plant", was small but capable of performing most engineering functions, other than locomotive building. It could, for example, replace locomotive boilers and fireboxes. It employed 130 men. The LNER closed it as a locomotive works in 1927, but it continued as a <b>carriage</b> <b>and</b> predominantly <b>wagon</b> <b>works</b> for many years thereafter. The buildings {{were more or less}} intact in 1972, but by 1977 had all been razed to the ground except the main erecting halls, which are still used, albeit not for railway purposes.|$|R
