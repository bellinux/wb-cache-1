It is the yellow most frequently used such processed food products as corn and potato chips, breakfast cereals such as corn flakes, candies, popcorn, mustard, jams and jellies, gelatin, soft drinks (notably Mountain Dew), energy and sports drinks, and pastries. It is also widely used in liquid and bar soap, shampoo, cosmetics and medicines. Sometimes it is mixed with blue dyes to color processed products green.|$|R
30|$|Tartrazine is a {{synthetic}} lemon yellow azo-dye authorized {{in many countries}} in food processing manufacture with maximum permitted use levels of 50 – 500  mg/kg-food for various food processing. It {{is also known as}} E number E 102, C.I. 19140, FD&C Yellow 5, Acid <b>Yellow</b> 23, and <b>Food</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>4.</b> Reduction of Tartrazine may produce sulphonated aromatic amines compounds, which have low toxicity potential (Aguilar et al. 2009). Tartrazine is considered to be toxic to humans as it acts as hyperactivity and causes asthma, migraines, eczema, thyroid cancer and other behavioral problems (Gautam et al. 2015 a).|$|R
