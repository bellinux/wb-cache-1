40|$|Large {{organizations}} {{often use}} many software applications. In some cases, {{two or more}} of these applications contains information that is very similar or the same. In this thesis we {{are going to look at}} calendar information. UiT - The Arctic University of Norway is a large organization which uses many applications that contains calendar information. Fronter, Syllabus and Microsoft Exchange all covers different needs of the organization, but it is challenging to get a fast and easy overview of calendars from several of the systems at the same time. By creating a generic <b>calendar</b> <b>platform</b> that communicates with these systems, we get a new combined calendar system that contains every calendar within the organization. This platform implements many interfaces to suit the needs of an end user or end user application. The result is that the end user gets everything in one place, without the need to access several different portals and manually compare calendars. The generic <b>calendar</b> <b>platform</b> is also easily extensible, meaning that it could reach outside the organization...|$|E

In this paper we discuss the evolution of the electronic services for calendars, and give overview of the APIs they use, along with protocols and interfaces to these services. We introduce an idea to create Calendar Service Agent as a software agent in order to exchange, modify and synchronize information about events from different <b>calendar</b> <b>platforms.</b> The solution is explained by protocols and patterns, as well as the structure and architecture, and platforms included...|$|R

Silverwood line to serve the [...] "Children's Outings" [...] - seaside day trips for members and their {{children}} which were a regular feature in the clubland <b>calendar.</b> The <b>platform</b> was known as [...] "Thrybergh Tins", but it never had a name board to that effect.|$|R

A Bronze Age astronomical observatory was constructed there around 1900 BC and continuously served the nearby community that lived there until about 700 BC. The central space was used to observe the rising {{of the sun and}} full moon. Three markings locate sunrise at the summer and winter solstices and at the two equinoxes. Four more give the minimum and maximum declinations of the full moon: in summer, and in winter. Two measure the lengths of lunar months. Together, they reconcile solar and lunar cycles in marking the 235 lunations that occur during 19 solar years, regulating a lunar <b>calendar.</b> On a <b>platform</b> separate from the central space, at lower elevation, four stone seats (thrones) were made in north-south alignment, together with a trench marker cut in the eastern wall. This marker allows the rising sun's light to fall on only the second throne, at midsummer (about July 31). It was used for ritual ceremony linking the ruler to the local sun god, and also marked the end of the growing season and time for harvest.|$|R
