St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925.

25|$|Like Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit, the Long Island Rail Road fare {{system is}} based on the {{distance}} a passenger travels, as opposed to the New York City Subway, which has a flat rate throughout the system.

Zone 3 includes Jamaica (and Flushing) and all stations east of Jamaica (and Flushing) within the boundaries of New York City, except Far Rockaway and Belmont Park. Zones 4 and 7 include all the stations in Nassau County and Far Rockaway. Zones 9, 10, 12 and 14 include all the stations in Suffolk County.

25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railway and its boats. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey <b>City</b> <b>Terminal</b> to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost {{a lot of money in}} the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E
500|$|On September 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{terminated}} {{its contract}} with the B, which had permitted the latter to use the [...] "Pennsy's" [...] Hudson River tunnels and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. Thereafter, the Capitol Limited, along with all other B passenger trains to New York, operated over the Jersey Central's main line from the connection with the Reading in Bound Brook into its Jersey <b>City</b> <b>terminal,</b> where passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform. These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into Manhattan, where they proceeded to various [...] "stations" [...] including the Vanderbilt Hotel, Wanamaker's, Columbus Circle, and Rockefeller Center, as well as Brooklyn.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the U.S. entry into World War I and {{resulting}} congestion on the nation's railroads, the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) ordered the Pennsylvania Railroad to permit B passenger trains to use its Hudson River tunnels and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, beginning April 28, 1918, eliminating the B's need for the ferry connection from Jersey City. Following the end of World WarI, the Pennsylvania Railroad continued to allow B passenger trains to use Pennsylvania Station for another eight years. On September 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania Railroad terminated its contract with the B, and the latter's trains reverted {{to the use of the}} Jersey Central's Jersey <b>City</b> <b>terminal.</b> Passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform. [...] These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into Manhattan and Brooklyn, where they proceeded to various [...] "stations" [...] around the city on four different routes, including the Vanderbilt Hotel, Wanamaker's, Columbus Circle, and Rockefeller Center. B's busiest Royal Blue bus terminal at [...] in Manhattan opened on December 17, 1928. Connected to Grand Central Terminal by an underground concourse, it was trimmed in marble and furnished with Art Deco lighting fixtures and leather sofas. This arrangement would continue until the eventual demise of the Royal Blue in 1958.|$|E

500|$|As {{financial}} losses mounted, the B finally ceded the New YorkWashington {{market to}} the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable Royal Blue to an end. As the engineer {{was about to}} ease the locomotive's throttle open for the Royal Blue's final departure from Washington Union Station at 3:45p.m., the event was covered in a trainside remote broadcast by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network See It Now television special. The train's 7:49p.m. arrival at Jersey <b>City</b> <b>Terminal</b> was met by news reporters from The New York Times, the New York Post, Life magazine and The Saturday Evening Post, on hand to cover the legendary Royal Blues demise. In an editorial the next day, the Baltimore Sun lamented {{the end of the}} Royal Blue, saying it [...] "may {{have been one of the}} most famous named trains in history". [...] The New York Times, in a [...] article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said [...] "It was a sad and simple story yesterday as the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack Royal Blue and its five other passenger trains...end sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashion...a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of life...and the reputation for very special service." ...|$|E
