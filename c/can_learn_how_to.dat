25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people need to learn primary subject matter well before they <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E

25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band have {{introduced}} people to rock music and inspired {{them to learn}} how to play the guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as Guitar Hero. The group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs. Guitar teachers in the US have reported an increase in students who cite Guitar Hero as their inspiration to start learning. On the other hand, industry professionals, such the inventor of the Fretlight practice tool, have expressed scepticism over the game's educational value. There is anecdotal evidence that Guitar Hero aids rhythm and general hand-coordination, but also that it creates a false preconception of the difficulty of learning guitar, which can lead students to discontinue their studies. Guitar Center conducted a survey which found that a majority of instrument-based rhythm gamers intended to take up a real instrument in the future while a majority of those who were already musicians had been inspired to play their instruments more. Despite such popularity the guitar remains less popular {{than it was in the}} 1960s. Some musicians have been critical of Guitar Heros impact on music education. Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the Guitar Hero series, stating that he felt that it was [...] "more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar". Other commentators have pointed to drum controllers (including the expanded, lifelike Drum Rocker kit) used in such games as potentially useful in learning and creating music with real drums.|$|E

Goldfish remember the colour of a tube dispensing food one year after the last tube presentation. Sockeye salmon still react to a light signal that precedes food arrival up to eight months since the last reinforcement. Some common rudd and European chub could remember the person who trained them to feed from the hand, even after a 6-month break. [...] Crimson-spotted rainbowfish <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> escape from a trawl by swimming through a small hole in the center and they remember this technique 11 months later. Rainbow trout can be trained to press a bar to get food, and they remember this three months after last seeing the bar.

2500|$|Fish <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{perform a}} {{behavior}} simply by watching other individuals in action. [...] This is variously called observational learning, cultural transmission, or social learning. For example, fish {{can learn a}} particular route after following an experienced leader a few times. One study trained guppies to swim through a hole marked in red while ignoring another one marked in green {{in order to get}} food {{on the other side of}} a partition; when these experienced fish (“demonstrators”) were joined by a naive one (an “observer”), the observer followed the demonstrators through the red hole, and kept the habit once the demonstrators were removed, even when the green hole now allowed food access. [...] In the wild, juvenile French grunt follow traditional migration routes, up to 1km long, between their daytime resting sites and their nighttime foraging areas on coral reefs; if groups of 10-20 individuals are marked and then transplanted to new populations, they follow the residents along what is for them – the transplants – a new migration route, and if the residents are then removed two days later, the transplanted grunts continue to use the new route, as well as the resting and foraging sites at both ends.|$|E
