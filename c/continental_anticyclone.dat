50|$|In winter Cyprus is {{near the}} track of fairly {{frequent}} small depressions which cross the Mediterranean Sea from west to east between the <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclone</b> of Eurasia and the generally low pressure belt of North Africa. These depressions give periods of disturbed weather usually lasting {{for a day or}} so and produce most of the annual precipitation, the average rainfall from December to February being about 60% of the average annual total precipitation for the island as a whole, which is 500 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{rainy season}} is between June and mid-July. It {{is caused by}} hot and humid high {{pressure}} forming in the Sea of Okhotsk due to the North Pacific anticyclone combining with Asiatic continental high pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long jangmajeonseon (Hanja: 장마前線). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclone</b> south of the island of Okinawa. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding. By August the system has weakened as the southern systems retreat towards the Filipino archipelago.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} current regional models in an intercomparison project for a case of explosive secondary marine cyclogenesis occurring during the Canadian Atlantic Storms Project and the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment of 1986. Several systematic errors are found that {{have been identified in}} the refereed literature in prior years. There is a high (low) sea level pressure bias and a cold (warm) tropospheric temperature error in the oceanic (continental) regions. Though individual model participants produce central pressures of the secondary cyclone close to the observed during the final stages of its life cycle, systematically weak systems are simulated during the critical early stages of the cyclogenesis. Additionally, the simulations produce an excessively weak (strong) <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclone</b> (cyclone); implications of these errors are discussed in terms of the secondary cyclogenesis. Little relationship between strong performance in predicting the mass field and skill in predicting a measurable amount of precipitation is found. The bias scores in the precipitation study indicate a tendency for all models to overforecast precipitation. Results for the measurable threshold (0. 2 mm) indicate the largest gain in precipitation scores results from increasing the horizontal resolution from 100 to 50 km, with a negligible benefit occurring as a consequence of increasing the resolution from 50 to 25 km. The importance of a horizontal resolution increase from 100 to 50 km is also generally shown for the errors in the mass field. However, little improvement in the prediction of the cyclogenesis is found by increasing the horizontal resolution from 50 to 25 km. 1...|$|E
40|$|Inactive ice wedges {{are still}} present today at Yituli'he {{in the middle}} Da Xing'anling (Greater Hinggan) Mountains in northeastern China, which is the southernmost known site (50 ° 37 ′N) with ice wedges in the Northern Hemisphere. However, it is {{uncertain}} whether the ice-wedge isotope composition, characterized by low δ 18 O, δD and low deuterium excess values, {{is representative of the}} isotope signature of a broader region. In this paper, the ice-wedge isotope compositions were examined {{in the context of the}} stable isotopes of precipitation from the nearby Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations. In addition, the pollen spectra from the host sediments were analysed to provide additional information on local vegetation in order to better understand the climate conditions favouring ice-wedge formation. The pollen spectra suggest that the Yituli'he ice wedges developed during the colder and wetter period after 6000 cal. a BP. The isotopes in the Yituli'he ice wedges are consistent with the isotope background recorded in atmospheric precipitation collected at the nearby GNIP stations. When the snow-melt froze into ice veinlets, the isotope signals did not change substantially because of the strong, cold, <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclones</b> in winter as well as a strong temperature inversion that prevail in the Da Xing'anling Mountains. As the climate pattern did not change substantially, the neoglacial cold period is unlikely to have allowed for strong secondary fractionation of isotope records during ice-wedge formation. Thus, the annual isotope signature can be interpreted as a valid archive of climate data...|$|R
40|$|Weather events {{over the}} central {{third of the}} United States {{during the first week}} of August 1970 provide an {{excellent}} example of an upper level summer <b>continental</b> warm <b>anticyclone</b> accompanied by well-defined moist tongues. This type of situation, in which significant amounts of convective precipitation can occur with anticyclonic northwesterly flow aloft, was discovered originally with the help of isentropic analysis and described by Namias (1938) and Wexler and Namias (1938). Since the advent of weather satellites, many cases of the cyclonic cloud vortex have been illustrated in the literature, but to our knowledge, none of the large-scale anticyclonic eddy. As shown by Stark (1970, fig. 7), a narrow band of precipitation in southern Texas was associated with th...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{atmosphere}} is usually {{considered to be}} a clean environment, while this study indicates that the near-coast waters of South China Sea (SCS) suffered from even worse air quality than coastal cities. The analyses were based on concurrent field measurements of target air pollutants and meteorological parameters conducted at a suburban site (TC) and a nearby marine site (WS) from August to November 2013. The observations showed that the levels of primary air pollutants were significantly lower at WS than those at TC, while ozone (O 3) value was greater at WS. Higher O 3 levels at WS were attributed to the weaker NO titration and higher O 3 production rate because of stronger oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, O 3 episodes were concurrently observed at both sites under certain meteorological conditions, such as tropical cyclones, <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclones</b> and sea-land breezes (SLBs). Driven by these synoptic systems and mesoscale recirculations, the interaction between continental and marine air masses had profoundly changed the atmospheric composition and subsequently influenced the formation and redistribution of O 3 in the coastal areas. When continental air intruded into marine atmosphere, the O 3 pollution was magnified over SCS, and the elevated O 3 (>  100  ppbv) could overspread the sea boundary layer ~  8 times the area of Hong Kong. In some cases, the exaggerated O 3 pollution over the SCS was re-circulated to the coastal inshore by sea breeze, leading to even aggravating O 3 pollution in coastal cities. The findings are applicable to similar mesoscale environments around the world where the maritime {{atmosphere is}} potentially influenced by severe continental air pollution...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo identificar a influência atmosférica em escala sinótica sobre o oceano, para eventos extremos de maré meteorológica na costa sudeste brasileira. Para isso foram utilizados dados de elevação do nível do mar do Porto de Santos-SP, campos de vento e pressão em superfície das reanálises do modelo do NCEP abrangendo o Atlântico Sul, no período de 1951 a 1990. Foi possível identificar a variabilidade sazonal e o padrão de evolução dos sistemas atmosféricos associados aos eventos extremos, de grande relevância para aplicações em prognósticos e alertas a autoridades. O outono e inverno apresentaram a maior ocorrência de extremos positivos (40, 2 % e 30, 8 % respectivamente), enquanto a primavera e o inverno foram as estações com maior número de extremos negativos (47, 2 % e 32, 3 % respectivamente). Os resultados mostram que os casos mais importantes de sobre-elevação do nível do mar ocorrem com a evolução e persistência de sistemas de baixa pressão sobre o oceano, com ventos de sudoeste acima de 8 m/s, juntamente com o anticiclone da retaguarda posicionado sobre o continente. This work aims to {{identify}} the synoptic scale atmospheric influence over the ocean for extreme events of storm surges events in the Southeastern Brazilian coast. Time series of sea surface height at the Port of Santos as well as wind and surface pressure from the NCEP reanalysis model enclosing the South Atlantic, for period 1951 - 1990, were used. Seasonal variability and typical evolution of atmospheric systems {{were found to be}} associated with extreme events, very relevant for applications on prognostics and warnings to authorities. Autumn and winter are seasons with the highest occurrence of positive extreme events (40. 2 % and 30. 8 % respectively) and the spring and winter are the ones with negative extreme events (47. 2 % and 32. 3 % respectively). The results show that the storm surges events depend on low pressure systems development and persistence over the ocean, with southwesterly winds over 8 m/s, together with a <b>continental</b> <b>anticyclone</b> presence...|$|E
