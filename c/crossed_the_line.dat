5|$|A {{moment of}} silence was also held for Weylandt before stage 11, as his funeral took place the same day. Pieter Weening also gave the first pink jersey to be {{presented}} {{to him on the}} podium to Weylandt's surviving family, and stage 11 winner John Gadret stated that he had had Weylandt in his thoughts as he <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and dedicated his win to him, even though the two were not well acquainted.|$|E
5|$|In stage nine, Pierre Rolland, who {{was second}} in the {{mountains}} classification, wore the polka dot jersey, because Chris Froome wore the yellow jersey {{as leader of the}} general classification during that stage. Froome and Rolland both had collected 31 points up to this point, but Froome claimed the polka dot jersey, because he had <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> as first on first category mountains more often than Rolland.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay {{to overcome their}} Third Division opponents 2–1. The first Leicester goal was controversial, as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged for a foul. Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but Leicester quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second half}} Leicester claimed a third goal, but the referee adjudged that the ball had not <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat's winning time of 1: {{and last}} quarter mile in 23 seconds were both {{records for the}} Derby. In addition, he had run each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Sham {{maintained}} his stride and <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher Our Native, who had lost ground on the final turn into the homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record {{with a time of}} 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E

5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|As Rosberg was {{comfortably in}} the lead, still 18 seconds ahead of Vettel, Verstappen took ninth place from Massa going into turn one on lap 46. Red Bull {{teammate}} Ricciardo also gained a place, at Hülkenberg's expense, {{at the same}} spot three laps later. With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have to}} pass him to achieve third place as long as he stayed within five seconds of him. Pérez nevertheless made the move on the final lap to finish in the final podium position. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to win the Grand Prix, more than 16 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|As {{they came}} to the elbow, on the 494-yard run-in to home, Cahervillahow, Romany King, The Committee and Esha Ness {{remained}} tight and vying for position. But it was 50/1 shot Esha Ness, ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman, who <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> first, in the second-fastest time in Grand National history. Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow, Romany King was third and The Committee fourth. Givus A Buck completed in fifth, with On The Other Hand and Laura's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was.|$|E

5|$|Cancellara {{earned his}} first victory in 2004 at the Tour of Qatar. Cancellara won the race's fourth stage after attacking {{in the final}} {{kilometers}} of the race and then out-sprinting the riders {{who were able to}} keep pace with him to win the stage. His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, where he won the opening stage's bunch sprint. Up next on the calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in 42nd place, just a little over two minutes after the winner Steffen Wesemann. The next weekend, he raced the Paris–Roubaix for the second time. Cancellara showed great form during the race and {{was a member of the}} four man group that was first to reach the finish line. He lost the sprint to the line and <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher. He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June. Cancellara's next success came at the Tour de France. He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd. Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships. Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place; he finished over two minutes behind the winner. He entered the men's road race four days later, but did not finish the course.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to win {{his second}} race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later. The stewards later deemed Button to be at fault for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{at the end of}} the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth on the grid to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E

5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action has <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E
5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped on the flat. Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> with just a few seconds to spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{reversed}} their defeat to Sunderland {{previously in}} the season by winning 2–1 on 22 December. Reading had led 1–0 after a 69th-minute goal from Ívar Ingimarsson. Michael Chopra levelled the match by scoring an 82nd-minute penalty. A goal by Stephen Hunt in the 90th minute sparked controversy as it appeared not to have <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Sunderland met Manchester United on Boxing Day at the Stadium of Light, they were beaten 4–0 in a game were Sunderland striker Martyn Waghorn made the step up from the club's Youth system to the first team. Martyn Waghorn promoted to first team from Youth system. Sunderland ended 2007 with a 3–1 home win to Bolton Wanderers on 29 December, Kieran Richardson, Kenwyne Jones and Daryl Murphy were the scorers.|$|E

5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close {{a minute and a half}} over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in fifth.|$|E
5|$|The fourth caution {{came out}} on lap 181 because of debris on the back straightaway. The first nine {{positions}} stayed off of pit road while the rest made pit stops. On lap 186, Hamlin made a good start and maintained the first position. On lap 188, Jimmie Johnson, who restarted twelfth, had moved up to the sixth position. On lap 193, Hamlin had a growing lead over Kahne. Denny Hamlin <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to win the race, a second ahead of second place Kasey Kahne. Kurt Busch maintained third while Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart finished fourth and fifth.|$|E
5|$|This was Cancellara's {{first year}} {{with his new}} team , which lacked the high caliber domestiques that Cancellara had in the past, meaning that winning would be tougher for Cancellara. His first major race {{of the year was}} the Tirreno–Adriatico, where he won the race's final stage which was an {{individual}} time trial. Cancellara came to the Milan–San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time. He positioned himself in an eight-man breakaway that made {{it all the way to}} the finish. As the group approached the finish line, Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in second.|$|E
