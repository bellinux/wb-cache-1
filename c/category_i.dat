The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior.

This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in <b>Category</b> <b>I</b> in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Strategies for {{managing}} wildlife damage may {{be divided into}} 3 broad categories: direct manipulation of populations, manipulation of behavioral or ecological traits of pest species, and manipulation of environmental features. For each of these <b>categories,</b> <b>I</b> review the importance of ecological considerations in determining the effectiveness of management strategies. Proper incorporation of ecological information {{is important to the}} success of management strategies in all 3 <b>categories.</b> <b>I</b> predict that future demands will increase for ecologically-based strategies that require minimal intervention, and for integration of management strategies that simultaneously address problems posed by both vertebrate and invertebrate pests. Several recent ecologically-based techniques are discussed, and pioneering efforts at comprehensive programs of integrated pest management are identified. Successful management of wildlife damage requires balancing ecological, sociological, and economic concerns. Attaining this balance in the future ultimately may depend upon our ability to develop new strategies of managing damage and to foster among the public an increased understanding of ecological processes pertaining to damage and its management...|$|R
