50|$|Lines patched as data ports into {{a network}} switch require simple straight-through patch cables {{at each end}} <b>to</b> connect a <b>computer.</b> Voice patches <b>to</b> <b>PBXs</b> in most {{countries}} require an adapter at the remote end to translate the configuration on 8P8C modular connectors into the local standard telephone wall socket. No adapter is needed in the U.S. as the 6P2C and 6P4C plugs most commonly used with RJ11 and RJ14 telephone connections are physically and electrically compatible with the larger 8P8C socket. RJ25 and RJ61 connections are physically but not electrically compatible, and cannot be used. In the UK, an adapter must be present at the remote end as the 6-pin BT socket is physically incompatible with 8P8C.|$|R

40|$|Many Hox {{proteins}} {{are thought}} <b>to</b> require <b>Pbx</b> and Meis co-factors to specify cell identity during embryogenesis. Here we demonstrate that Meis 3 synergizes with Pbx 4 and Hoxb 1 b in promoting hindbrain fates in the zebrafish. We find that Hoxb 1 b and Pbx 4 act together to induce ectopic hoxb 1 a expression in rhombomere 2 of the hindbrain. In contrast, Hoxb 1 b and Pbx 4 acting together with Meis 3 induce hoxb 1 a, hoxb 2, krox 20 and valentino expression rostrally and cause extensive transformation of forebrain and midbrain fates to hindbrain fates, including differentiation of excess rhombomere 4 -specific Mauthner neurons. This synergistic effect requires that Hoxb 1 b and Meis 3 have intact Pbx-interaction domains, suggesting that their in vivo activity {{is dependent on}} binding <b>to</b> <b>Pbx</b> 4. In the case of Meis 3, binding <b>to</b> <b>Pbx</b> 4 is also required for nuclear access.

50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a key {{telephone}} system (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system manually select their own outgoing lines on special telephone sets that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically, or formerly, by an operator.

40|$|Two new {{homeobox}} genes, PBX 2 and PBX 3, {{were isolated}} {{on the basis}} of their extensive homology <b>to</b> <b>PBX</b> 1, a novel human homeobox gene involved in t(1; 19) translocation in acute pre-B-cell leukemias. The predicted Pbx 2 and Pbx 3 proteins are 92 and 94 % identical <b>to</b> <b>Pbx</b> 1 over a large region of 266 amino acids within and flanking their homeodomains, but all three proteins diverge significantly near their amino and carboxy termini. Chromosome in situ hybridizations demonstrated that the PBX genes are not clustered but map to separate chromosomal loci: PBX 1, 1 q 23; PBX 2, 3 q 22 - 23; PBX 3, 9 q 33 - 34. Expression of PBX 2 or PBX 3 was not restricted to particular states of differentiation or development, as mRNA transcripts of these genes were detected in most fetal and adult tissues and all cell lines, unlike PBX 1, which is not expressed in lymphoid cell lines. Similar <b>to</b> <b>PBX</b> 1 RNA, PBX 3 RNA is alternatively spliced to yield two translation products with different carboxy termini, a feature not observed for PBX 2. Their extensive sequence similarity and widespread expression suggest a generalized, overlapping role for Pbx proteins in most cell types. Differences in their amino and carboxy termini may modulate their activities, mediated in part by differential splicing and, for PBX 1, protein fusion following t(1; 19) chromosomal translocation...|$|R
50|$|Three main {{categories}} of wireless extensions <b>to</b> <b>PBXs</b> exist: those that work over Wi-Fi (VoWLAN, or VoWi-Fi), those that use public mobile networks like 3G, {{and those that}} use other radio technologies like DECT. Client software can make a dual-mode smartphone act as a Wi-Fi extension <b>to</b> the <b>PBX.</b> This gives the handset a split personality: a regular cell phone and a VoIP PBX extension, each having its own phone number. These two personalities can be well integrated, fully separate or something in between. Session redirection as described above moves the call between devices; with a dual-mode phone, session redirection can occur between the two networks, keeping the call on the same handset.|$|R
50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection <b>to</b> the customer's <b>PBX,</b> and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer.

As calls are presented <b>to</b> the <b>PBX,</b> the dialed telephone number is signaled <b>to</b> the <b>PBX</b> with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant.

40|$|Abstract- Over {{the last}} few years, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) evolved from {{enabling}} voice communications between <b>computer</b> terminals <b>to</b> providing much wider functionality of the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN). The idea of deploying VoIP in Private Branch eXchanges (PBXs) is gaining credence among service providers, and this paper addresses some of the design issues related <b>to</b> an IP <b>PBX</b> implementation. Specifically, the paper explores the interoperability between Cisco Call Manager (CCM) and Linux-based Asterisk <b>PBXs</b> corresponding <b>to</b> the enterprise-class and Open Source IP PBXs, respectively. The architecture of the networking testbed is documented for running various VoIP protocols between multi-vendor devices and IP PBXs. The results presented can be broadly defined into three areas of investigation: (i) the use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Inter Asterisk eXchange (IAX) trunks to integrate CCM <b>to</b> Asterisk <b>PBXs</b> and Asterisk <b>to</b> Asterisk <b>PBXs,</b> respectively; (ii) examining interoperability between the CCM and Asterisk PBX with advanced features like Call Display, Voicemail, Call Detail Records (CDR) and Voicemail to e-mail transfer; and (iii) testing the resilience of voice quality against packet loss and delay in the Open Sourc...|$|R
