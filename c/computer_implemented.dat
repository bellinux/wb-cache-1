This allowed Apple to bring the machines to market with only a partially native operating system, and end users could adopt the new, faster architecture without risking their investment in software. Partly because the emulator was so successful, many parts of the operating system remained emulated. A full transition to a PowerPC native operating system (OS) was not made until the release of Mac OS X (10.0) in 2001. (The OS X [...] "Classic" [...] runtime environment continued to offer this emulation capability on PowerPC Macs until OS X 10.5.) ...|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, in {{a recent}} {{decision}} on the patentability of a <b>computer</b> <b>implemented</b> method of generating an index based on selection and weighing of data based on certain criterion, the Full Federal Court of Australia reaffirmed that mere methods, schemes and plans are not manners of manufacture. The Full Court went on to hold {{that the use of}} a computer to implement a scheme did not contribute to the invention or the artificial effect of the invention. The subject matter of the invention was held to be an abstract idea and not a manner of manufacture within the meaning of the term in the Patents Act. The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method  and system for assessing an individual’s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{boundary}} between when a <b>computer</b> <b>implemented</b> process is purely an abstract idea (and thus not patentable) {{and when it}} is a process implementing the idea in a practical way (and thus is patentable) is still a matter of debate within the US patent office. ("The Supreme Court has not been clear [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] as to whether such subject matter is excluded from the scope of 101 because it represents laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.") It also remains a contested issue whether process patent claims must be directed to a transformation of substances or else embody a nontrivial, novel implementing machine or device. The PTO has taken this position in its arguments to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See USPTO brief in In re Bilski. The Government also so argued in briefing the Benson case. The majority opinion in the Federal Circuit's opinion in In re Bilski adopts this position.|$|E
40|$|A <b>computer</b> <b>implemented</b> {{method of}} {{processing}} two-dimensional physical signals includes five basic components {{and the associated}} presentation techniques of the results. The first component decomposes the two-dimensional signal into one-dimensional profiles. The second component is a <b>computer</b> <b>implemented</b> Empirical Mode Decomposition that extracts a collection of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF's) from each profile based on local extrema and/or curvature extrema. The decomposition {{is based on the}} direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales in the profiles. In the third component, the IMF's of each profile are then subjected to a Hilbert Transform. The fourth component collates the Hilbert transformed IMF's of the profiles to form a two-dimensional Hilbert Spectrum. A fifth component manipulates the IMF's by, for example, filtering the two-dimensional signal by reconstructing the two-dimensional signal from selected IMF(s) ...|$|E
