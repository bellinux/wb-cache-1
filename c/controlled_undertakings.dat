The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Insurance Statistics are presented in the following tables: Balance sheet and income The balance sheet and income dataset shows data for direct insurance and reinsurance by life, non-life and composite categories shown in US dollars or national currency. Data are available from 2008 to 2010. The countries covered are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. Business written in the reporting country This dataset contains business written in the reporting country on a gross and net premium basis. It contains a breakdown by ownership between domestic companies, foreign-controlled companies and branches and agencies or foreign companies. It also comprises various type of premiums (gross premiums, premiums ceded, net written premium) as well as insurance type (life, non-life, composite) and facultative reinsurance may be included under (direct business or reinsurance accepted) according to practice in the reporting country.

Gross claims payments This dataset contains data related to gross claims payments in the reporting country, containing a breakdown between domestic companies, foreign-controlled companies and branches and agencies of foreign companies. The core variable can be further analysed by type of insurance (life, non-life, composite). Data are expressed in different currencies and starting from 1993. The countries covered are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. Gross operating expenses This dataset contains gross operating expenses in the reporting country, with a breakdown between domestic companies, foreign-controlled companies and branches and agencies of foreign companies.

A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. One of the solutions was the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike. Today, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with [...] "piping" [...] and erosion. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events. Proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike, with the first stage costing approximately $67million (US$).|$|R

Generally, as {{the complexity and}} scale of attempted projects increases, the ability to bring such projects to a successful completion decreases. Indeed, while the software engineering community is technically capable of producing software, {{there is a growing}} lack of confidence in its ability to <b>control</b> such <b>undertakings.</b> A key obstacle is that traditional {{software development}} is predicated on constraints and limitations that are either no longer valid or that pertain to well-structured situations. Many of the problems tackled by software developers are simply not of that type. Rethinking Software Development, a reprint of the original work which still maintains its relevance, challenges the dominant mindset and introduces an alternative; a more pluralistic perspective supportive of continuous delivery, learning and dynamic resolution processes. The discussion explores problem solving, decisions, wicked problems, systems, design, change, economics, complexity and knowledge as part of the search for lasting solutions...|$|R

Project management can also be described as a set of models and techniques for the planning and <b>control</b> of complex <b>undertakings</b> (Packendorff 1995), or the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities and to meet project requirements (Moe and Pathranarakul 2006).|$|R

50|$|Through our freedom, {{particular}} self-governing capabilities can {{be installed}} {{in order to bring}} our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives 1996:155. These capabilities are enterprise and autonomy. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one’s everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself 1996:154. Autonomy is about taking <b>control</b> of our <b>undertakings,</b> defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers 1996:159.

40|$|Abstract — Post {{independence}} {{the advent}} of Public Sector Undertakings was encouraged as the tool for giving momentum {{to the growth of}} Indian Economy. The Government took several policies decisions to set up Government <b>controlled,</b> Government financed <b>undertakings</b> {{to bridge the gap between}} rich and poor, optimum usage of natural resources, regional inequalities, and absenteeism of private sector in those business activities which either were totally socially oriented or were driven by very less profit margins. In the process, government forayed into all business activities thus coming in direct competition with the private sector in almost all sectors. When the performance of all such PSUs were adjudged against the performance of their counterpart in private sector, then it was revealed that either many of these PSUs were not performing as efficientely as those in private sector or were already in deep red financially. Analysis of poor performance of these PSUs led to the conclusion that all these PSUs need to be effectively financially managed to come closer or to surpass the performance private sector companies. This was also essential to ensure that deployment of public funds should be done in such a judicious manner that instead of becoming a constant burden on Government exchequer these PSUs should contribute to the nation’s growth on self sustained basis This paper covers brief history with reasons why the concept of commercial organizations as PSUs emerged, various type of PSUs and what are the ingredients of their financial management...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} cable {{television}} in the 1990 s has seriously challenged the historically rooted place of Chinese mass media as an organ of the state propaganda machine. One of the more acute features in the cable development was the establishment of cable stations run largely by communal work units known as " danwei " in Chinese. This thesis probes the "micro locale" of a Chinese danwei community and investigates how the communist propaganda is distilled at the grass-roots level and, furthermore, how the indigenous resistance and defiance against the central domination are negotiated and translated into community-based cable television. It seeks to illuminate {{the nature of the}} media development in reform-era China from the perspective of community media [...] or danwei media, as the most appropriate term and, consequently, map out the changing patterns of control, contestation and conciliation between the twin actors of community media and state propaganda. Chinese danwei communities have constituted a basic unit of the social organization of communist China and occupied a prima position in the communist establishment of mass media. It is in the ultimate interests of the state to <b>control</b> media <b>undertakings</b> at the grass-roots in order to dominate the local space of communication and entertainment with the official language and ideology. However, this objective of absolute control {{on the part of the}} central government becomes definitely impossible, particularly in the age of economic reform of the 1990 s, when the once omnipotent power of the Party-state has withered away remarkably in terms of permeating the daily life of the danwei communities. My research findings illustrate the tension and symmetry between community-cable television and the overarching Chinese media system. On the one hand, community cable embodies the grass-roots resistance to the state domination of television [...] it is the intelligent use of cable technology on the part of danwei communities to take advantage of the communist tradition of locally organized media operation in gaining control over the local television space. Simultaneously, though, community cable has emerged as the newest medium for the state propagandists to penetrate the basic units of society. It provides local resources to not only assist the delivery of state propaganda to work units, but also the repackaging of the state propaganda vocabulary into more locally palatable television programming. Community cable represents a unique experience of the Chinese people in asserting their desire to recapture the local media and to negotiate their space within the state structure of mass media...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of ordoliberal {{thinking}} on the drafting of the prohibition of "abuse" of a dominant position in the market that {{was included in the}} competition rules of the Rome Treaty establishing the European Economic Community as well as on its interpretation by the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Firstly, it is shown that the ordoliberal school must not be regarded as a set of ideas frozen in its formative period of 1933 to 1950 or 1957 when the "Freiburg School" was established but rather as an approach that has been dynamically developed and refined over the last 75 years (i. e. over four generations of ordoliberals) up to the present day by integrating important new insights without, however, giving up its core tenets and convictions. Secondly, it is shown {{on the basis of the}} preparatory work which lead in the 1950 ies to the Rome Treaty that the adoption of the concept of "abuse" for the <b>control</b> of dominant <b>undertakings</b> was due to the strong influence of the German negotiating team that consisted of (in the meantime second generation) ordoliberals. Thirdly, it is explained how ordoliberal thinking about the "system of undistorted competition" and the protection of "residual competition against exclusionary practices" has influenced the application of the "abuse" concept in the jurisprudence of the Commission and the CJEU from the Continental Can case to the recent Intel case. This approach has come under attack from welfare-economic approaches which emphasize efficiency instead of competition and which have accused the ordoliberal approach of formalism, lack of sufficient economic analysis, preoccupation with fairness, protection of competitors instead of competition, obsession with interventionist regulation etc. This paper demonstrates that all of these characterizations are based on fundamental misunderstandings of what ordoliberal thinking originally meant and what it stands for today...|$|R
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThis paper {{seeks to}} answer the {{following}} question: how can municipalities manage and regulate markets in a manner that facilitates access to food and contributes to the enhancement of food security? In attempting to answer this question, the paper will also address the following questions: what does the term 'food security' mean? What does 'access to food' mean? What does the 'right to food' mean? What are the powers and functions of local government? What are the limits, problems or risks attached to the exercise of these powers? What constitutes 'markets' or 'fresh produce markets' in this case? What is the scope of local government's legislative and executive competence regarding food 'markets', as enumerated in Part B of Schedule 5 of the Constitution? And, how can municipalities utilise food markets as a means to facilitate access to food and address the issue of food security? This paper will focus primarily on fresh produce markets, as opposed to other markets or 'markets' in their entirety. This limitation is based on the argument that fresh produce markets are more relevant for the role of local government in facilitating access to food because they provide a platform for the sale and purchase of fresh produce, which is important for nutritional purposes. The argument presented in this thesis centres around the facilitation of access to food, by local government, through the regulation and management of markets. The paper will address the problem by examining the concepts of 'food security' and 'access to food' in the South African context, {{as well as in the}} international context. In examining the above concepts, the paper will also include the right to food. The paper will further look at how South Africa has responded to the issue of food security through its national food security policies. The paper will look at how local food markets are utilised internationally to facilitate access to food and thereafter, examine how food markets should be utilised to facilitate access to food in South Africa. Thereafter, an examination of the powers and functions of local government as entrenched in the Constitution will be provided, as well as the implications of such powers, the limitations and the problems attached to the exercise of local government powers. Lastly, the paper looks at local government's competence regarding food 'markets' in Schedule 5 B of the Constitution, as well as the other competencies related to food/food security. Although local government has the scope to address the issue of food security by exercising its legislative and executive authority over the competence ‘markets’ as per Schedule 5 B of the Constitution, this study does not focus solely on the management and regulation of 'markets'. The study extends and includes related competencies such as trade regulations, the licensing and <b>control</b> of <b>undertakings</b> that sell food to the public, municipal abattoirs, street trading and municipal health service, and shows how the links between these competencies provide local government with the opportunity to contribute to the enhancement of food security...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{essential}} facilities doctrine {{may be seen}} as the ‘extra weight’ which is put onto the balance, in order to give precedence to the maintenance of competition over the complete contractual freedom of <b>undertakings</b> <b>controlling</b> an important and unique facility. The main purpose of the doctrine is to impose upon such ‘dominant’ undertakings the duty to negotiate and/or give access to the facility, against a reasonable fee, to other undertakings, which cannot pursue their own activity (and therefore will perish) without access to such a facility. This very simple description of the content of the doctrine underlines its limitations: through the imposition of a duty to negotiate or contractual obligations, the rule tends to compensate for the weaknesses of the competitive structure of a market, which are due to the existence of some essential facility. In other words, the doctrine does not by itself provide a definitive solution to the lack of competition, but tends to contractually maintain or even create some competition. 1 The doctrine of {{essential facilities}} originates in the US antitrust case law of the Circuit and District Courts, but has never been officially acknowledged by the Supreme Court. It has been further developed and hotly debated by scholars in the US, both from a legal and from an economic viewpoint. In the EU, the essential facilities doctrine was openly introduced by the Commission during the early 1990 s, but has received only limited and indirect support by the Court of First Instance (the CFI) and the European Court of Justice (the ECJ). It also indirectly inspired the legislation concerning the deregulation of traditional ‘natural’ monopolies. The judicial origin of the doctrine, combined with the hesitant application by the appeal courts, both in the US and the EU, cast uncertainty not only on the precise scope of the doctrine, but also on the issue of its very existence. These questions receive a particular light within the EU context, where the doctrine is called upon to play a different role from its US counterpart. In order to address the above issues, we will first pretend that an EU essential facility doctrine does indeed exist and we shall try to identify the scope and content thereof, through its main applications (Section 1). Subsequently, we will try to answer the question whether such a doctrine should exist at all in the EU (Section 2) ...|$|R
5000|$|... :We are {{not called}} upon to decide {{in the present case}} whether the federal Parliament could assume control over egg farms devoted {{exclusively}} to the production of eggs for extraprovincial trade. Under the present circumstances such farms are, like any other farms, local undertakings subject to provincial authority, irrespective of the destination of their output. I can see no reason why such legislative authority would not extend to the control of production as to quantity just as it extends undoubtedly to the price to be paid for raw materials.:This does not mean that such power is unlimited, a province cannot control extraprovincial trade, as was held in the Manitoba Egg Reference and in the Burns Foods case. However, “Marketing” does not include production and, therefore, provincial control of production is prima facie valid. In the instant case, the provincial regulation is not aimed at controlling the extraprovincial trade. In so far as it affects this trade, it is only complementary to the regulations established under federal authority. In my view this is perfectly legitimate, otherwise it would mean that our Constitution makes it impossible by federal-provincial cooperative action to arrive at any practical scheme for the orderly and efficient production and marketing of a commodity which all governments concerned agree requires regulation in both intraprovincial and extraprovincial trade. As early as 1912, it was asserted by the Privy Council that “whatever belongs to self-government in Canada belongs either to the Dominion or to the provinces”. I do not overlook the admonition in the Natural Products Marketing Act case, that the legislation has to be carefully framed but, when after 40 years a sincere cooperative effort has been accomplished, it would really be unfortunate if this was all brought to nought. While I adhere to the view that provinces may not make use of their <b>control</b> over local <b>undertakings</b> to affect extraprovincial marketing, this does not, in my view, prevent the use of provincial control to complement federal regulation of extraprovincial trade.:In so far as the producer quotas are to be viewed as marketing quotas rather than as production quotas, {{it seems to me that}} their validity is established by the principle of the Willis case. Those quotas are fixed by the provincial board so the total will equal what the plan, established under the federal Act, provides for Ontario in respect of extraprovincial trade in addition to what comes under intraprovincial trade. The Board is properly empowered by provincial authority to regulate the intraprovincial trade and it has delegated authority from the federal in respect of the extraprovincial trade. I fail to see what objection there can be to overall quotas established by a board thus vested with dual authority, unless it is said that our constitution precludes any businesslike marketing of products in both local and extraprovincial trade except under a federal assumption of power, something which I think, is directly contrary to the basic principle of the B.N.A. Act.|$|R
