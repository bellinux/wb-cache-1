Experiments made under low agitation conditions (600 rpm) showed that the biomass concentration could be increased 3. 9 -fold with vancomycin production kinetics {{very similar to that}} of <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture</b> without biomass-recycle. The specific production rate (q(vancomycin)) was maximal when the biomass-recycle ratio (R) was 0. 13 (D = 0. 087 h(- 1)). When the dissolved oxygen tension dropped below 20 % (air saturation), the biomass and vancomycin concentrations decreased and an unidentified red metabolite was released into the culture medium. Using increased agitation (850 rpm), used to maintain the dissolved oxygen tension above 20 % air saturation, maximum increases in biomass concentration (7. 9 -fold) and vancomcyin production 1. 6 -fold (0. 6 mg/g dry weight/h) were obtained when R was 0. 44 (D = 0. 056 h(- 1)) compared to <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture</b> without biomass-recycle. Moreover, at this latter recycle ratio the volumetric vancomycin production rate was 14. 7 mg/L/h (a 7 -fold increase compared to <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture</b> without biomass-recycle).

As a first step in understanding and evaluating their potential, a mathematical model was developed to describe growth, lipid accumulation and substrate consumption of the oleaginous fungus Umbelopsis isabellina (also known as Mortierella isabellina) in submerged <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> Key points of the model are: (1) if the C-source supply rate is limited, maintenance has a higher priority than growth, which has a higher priority than lipid production; (2) the maximum specific lipid production rate of the fungus is independent of the actual specific growth rate. Model parameters were obtained from <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> of U. isabellina grown on mineral media with glucose and NH 4 +. The model describes the results of <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> well for D > 0. 04 h- 1, but it has not been validated for lower dilution rates because of practical problems with the filamentous fungus.

To understand the process of lipid production better, we developed a model for growth, lipid production and lipid turnover in submerged batch fermentation. This model describes three subsequent phases: exponential growth when both a C-source and an N-source are available, carbohydrate and lipid production when the N-source is exhausted and turnover of accumulated lipids when the C-source is exhausted. The model was validated with submerged batch cultures of the fungus Umbelopsis isabellina (formerly known as Mortierella isabellina) with two different initial C/N-ratios. Comparison with <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> with the same strain showed a significant difference in lipid production: in batch cultures, the initial specific lipid production rate was almost four times higher than in <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> but it decreased exponentially in time, while the maximum specific lipid production rate in <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> was independent of residence time. This indicates that different mechanisms for lipid production are active in batch and <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> The model could also describe data for submerged batch cultures from literature well...|$|R

High (20 microM) copper in the medium reservoir resulted in a dramatic drop in cell numbers which was overcome with time. The copper-stressed cultures established a new equilibrium cell concentration slightly (ca. 20 %) lower than control <b>cultures.</b> Copper-stressed <b>chemostat</b> populations contained an increased number of copper-resistant cells, but these averaged only 26 % of the copper-adapted population.

40|$|Chemostat {{cultivation}} enables {{investigations into}} the effects of individual environmental parameters on sugar transport in yeasts. Various means are available to manipulate the specific rate of sugar uptake (q(s)) in sugar-limited <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> A straightforward way to manipulate q, is variation of the dilution rate, which, in substrate-limited <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{is equal to the}} specific growth rate. Alternatively, q(s) can be varied independently of the growth rate by mixed substrate cultivation or by variation of the biomass yield on sugar. The latter can be achieved, for example, by addition of nonmetabolizable weak acids to the growth medium or by variation of the oxygen supply. Such controlled manipulation of metabolic fluxes cannot be achieved in batch cultures, in which various parameters that are essential for the kinetics of sugar transport cannot be controlled. In sugar-limited <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures,</b> yeasts adapt their sugar transport systems to cope with the low residual sugar concentrations, which are often in the micromolar range. Under these conditions, yeasts with high-affinity proton symport carriers have a competitive advantage over yeasts that transport sugars via facilitated-diffusion carriers. Chemostat cultivation offers unique possibilities to study the energetic consequences of sugar transport in growing cells. For example, anaerobic, sugar-limited chemostat cultivation has been used to quantify the energy requirement for maltose-proton symport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Controlled variation of growth conditions in <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> can be used to study the differential expression of genes involved in sugar transport and as such can make an important contribution to the ongoing studies on the molecular biology of sugar transport in yeasts...|$|R

The relative fitness of these strains was determined in competition experiments in both batch and <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> In batch cultures, the decrease in relative fitness corresponded to the number of rRNA operons deleted, which could be accounted for completely by increased lag times and decreased growth rates. The magnitude of the deleterious effect varied with the environment in which fitness was measured: the negative consequences of rRNA operon deletions increased under culture conditions permitting more-rapid growth. The rRNA operon deletion strains were not more effective competitors under the regimen of constant, limited resources provided in <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> Enhanced fitness in <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures</b> would have suggested a simple tradeoff in which deletion strains grew faster (due to more efficient resource utilization) under resource limitation.

Although the genome of S. davuligerus has not yet been sequenced, tools were developed to study the metabolic flux distribution (fluxomics) and gene expression (transcriptomics) at genome scale. A Streptomyces clavuligerus-specific genome-scale metabolic network was derived from the network reconstructed for the close relative S. coelicolor (Borodina et al., 2005), removing reactions unique to S. coelicolor and adding the ones known to take place in S. clavuligerus. This metabolic network was then used to perform Flux Balance Analysis. Genome-scale transcription analysis was also made possible by customising S. coelicolor DNA microarrays thanks to the addition of 80 S. clavuligerus-specific probes, corresponding to most of the sequenced S. clavuligerus genes, to the 8, 000 S. coelicolor probes, including probes for the genes of the clavulanic acid cluster. These genome- scale methodologies were applied to S. clavuligerus grown in chemostat and batch cultures. Macromolecular compositions at two dilution rates (0. 02 h- 1 and 0. 05 h- 1) and in different growth phases were analysed in order to obtain reliable flux data. Flux distribution was simulated accurately and predicted supplements such as threonine, malate, pyruvate or citrate that might lead to increased antibiotic production. The customised DNA microarrays demonstrated that the genes of the clavulanic acid cluster are regulated differently in batch and in <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture.</b> The analysis of the transcription data also predicted that the use of supplements such as glycine or thymidine could lead to increased clavulanic acid production. Finally, the gene expression patterns showed that S. clavuligerus might be using an alternative pathway to metabolise glycerol during clavulanic acid production. In batch culture, the fluxomic and transcriptomic data showed no correlation, while some correlation was observed in <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture.</b> This demonstrated that <b>chemostat</b> <b>culture</b> is more useful than batch culture when performing genome-scale analysis.

However, even when growing at the faster rate the value of Y $ still was extremely small compared to those found with other micro-organisms. This low yield value was not due to an incomplete oxidation of glucose, since most of the glucose carbon utilized (83 to 97 %) could be accounted for as carbon dioxide, the percentage conversion depending on the dilution rate.

Pulse experiments with thiosulfate indicated that tetrathionate is an intermediate during thiosulfate oxidation by cell suspensions of T. acidophilus. From mixotrophic growth studies, the energetic value of thiosulfate and tetrathionate redox equivalents was estimated to be 50 % of that of redox equivalents derived from glucose oxidation. Ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) activities in cell extracts and rates of sulfur compound oxidation by cell suspensions increased with increasing thiosulfate/glucose ratios in the influent medium of the mixotrophic cultures. Significant RuBPCase and sulfur compound-oxidizing activities were detected in heterotrophically grown T. acidophilus. Polyhedral inclusion bodies (carboxysomes) could be observed at low frequencies in thin sections of cells grown in heterotrophic, glucose-limited <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> Highest RuBPCase activities and carboxysome abundancy were observed in cells from autotrophic, CO 2 -limited <b>chemostat</b> <b>cultures.</b> The maximum growth rate at which thiosulfate was still completely oxidized was increased when glucose was utilized simultaneously. This, together with the fact that even during heterotrophic growth the organism exhibited significant activities of enzymes involved in autotrophic metabolism, indicates that T. acidophilus is well adapted to a mixotrophic lifestyle. In this respect, T. acidophilus may have a competitive advantage over autotrophic acidophiles with respect to the sulfur compound oxidation in environments in which organic compounds are present...|$|R
