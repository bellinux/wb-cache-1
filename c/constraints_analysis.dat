It is used in many image-guided surgical systems to establish a transformation between pre- and intra-operative coordinate systems. This paper describes several tools which are useful for improving the accuracy resulting from shape-based registration: <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis,</b> <b>constraint</b> synthesis, and online accuracy estimation. <b>Constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> provides a scalar measure of sensitivity which is well correlated with registration accuracy. This measure {{can be used as}} a criterion function by constraint synthesis, an optimization process which generates configurations of registration data which maximize expected accuracy.

40|$|Abstract—Scheduling {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} that need to be solved by high-level hardware and software compilers. Existing heuristics are often incapable of finding feasible solutions for practical examples, because the tight time and resource constraints make the feasible-solution subspace very small compared to the size of the full search space. For that reason, constraint-analysis techniques that help the scheduler find feasible solutions are nowadays a subject of research. In this paper, the effect of <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> on heuristic schedulers is experimentally quantified to investigate to which extent <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> improves the quality of such schedulers, and also to see which heuristics complement it well. The results show that, for most experiments, <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> helps to improve the obtained schedules in terms of the latency of the schedule.

40|$|A {{strategy}} of cooperative path {{planning for a}} master-slave multiple robot system is presented in this paper. The path planning method is based on motion constraints between the end-effectors of cooperative robots. Cooperation motions have been classified into three types by relative motions between end-effectors of master and slave robots, which is concurrent cooperation, coupled synchronous cooperation and combined synchronous cooperation. Based on this classification, position /orientation constraints and joint velocity constraints are explored in-depth here.

40|$|Program {{analysis}} {{based on}} set constraints has many potential applications, including compiler optimisations, type-checking, debugging, verification and planning. The usual approach to set <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{to solve a}} set of constraints derived directly from the program text. However, {{it was pointed out}} by Cousot and Cousot that set <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> of a particular program P could be understood as an abstract interpretation over a finite domain of nondeterministic tree automata, constructed from P. One advantage of doing this is that set <b>constraint</b> <b>analysis</b> can be combined with other domains, using standard frameworks for abstract interpretation. In this paper we define such an abstract interpretation for logic programs, and describe its implementation. Both goal-dependent and goal-independent analysis are considered. Variations on the abstract domains operations are introduced, and we discuss the associated tradeoffs of precision and complexity.
