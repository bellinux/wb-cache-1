In this paper, results from the fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor of three different waste computer monitor casings composed of mainly acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer and two different waste computer <b>body</b> <b>casings</b> composed of mostly poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) type polymers are presented. Preliminary characterization of the waste plastics was investigated using coupled thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FT-IR). The results showed that the plastics decomposed in two stages. For the ABS-containing monitor casings, aromatic and aliphatic material were released in the first and second stages. The PVC-containing computer <b>body</b> <b>casing</b> samples showed a first-stage evolution of HCl and a second stage evolution of aromatic and aliphatic material and further HCl. In addition, each of the five plastics was fast-pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C. The fluidized bed pyrolysis led to the conversion of most of the plastics to pyrolysis oil, although the two PVC computer body cases produced large quantities of HCl. The pyrolysis oils were characterized by GC-MS and it was found that they were chemically very heterogeneous and contained a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, halogenated, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds...|$|R
30|$|For the {{straight}} {{part of the}} well, the ground compaction would cause large, plastic, and compressive strain in the casing connections in the pay zone. Once the reservoir compacts, the displacement {{at the top of}} the reservoir can cause significant tensile strain along the casing above the pay zone. If the connection between casings is not as strong as the <b>casing</b> <b>body,</b> joint failure can occur in compression in the pay zone. In a reservoir, compressive strain will quickly yield the casing and joints, while the tensile strain in the overburden generally will stay elastic, but can exceed the joint strength if the connection is weak in tension. A huge axial load from <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> can also cause the joint failure. So, the joints need to be as good as the <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> in both tension and compression within the pay zone and for a few hundred feet above the pay zone. It is always good to meet this criterion during the casing design to avoid unnecessary risks for the well.|$|E

A theoretical approach is presented to evaluate LCF resistance and compared with preliminary results from experiments on a large diameter buttress connection.

30|$|Local {{buckling}} is buckling {{along the}} casing wall while the center {{line of the}} casing stays straight. This contrasts with column buckling where the center line of the casing bends.

40|$|Abstract. CF 8 M cast {{austenitic}} stainless steel is used for several components such as primary coolant piping, pump <b>casing,</b> and valve <b>bodies</b> in light water reactors. Thermal aging results in spinodal decomposition of the delta-ferrite leading to increased strength and decreased toughness. Material properties depend on multiple variables including chemical composition, ferrite content, aging time, aging temperature and so on. Various algorithms {{have been developed to}} predict the results of these multiple variables, and studies to predict the results using artificial neural networks have been performed actively. In this study, we performed the neural network training using the measured data by Argonne national lab. and others and obtained the Charpy impact energy considering the various aging conditions through the experiments. The results of ferrite content and Charpy impact energy considering thermal embrittlement in CF 8 M material using the trained neural network are well corrected with the measured results. The material property change of CF 8 M by thermal embrittlement can be effectively predicted using the result of this study...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the railway}} superstructure is mainly influenced by its quality, by the operational technical conditions, climatic phenomena {{and above all}} by the dynamic load by the pair of wheels of the rail vehicles and also {{by the quality of}} railway subgrade.

40|$|Environmentally {{assisted}} cracking (EAC) of lightwater reactor (LWR) materials {{has affected}} nuclear reactors {{from the very}} introduction of the technology. Corrosion problems have afflicted steam generators from the very introduction of pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology. Shippingport, the first commercial PWR operated in the United States, developed leaking cracks in two Type 304 stainless steel (SS) steam generator tubes as early as 1957, after only 150 h of operation. Stress corrosion cracks were observed in the heat-affected zones of welds in austenitic SS piping and associated components in boiling-water reactors (BRWs) as early as 1965. The degradation of steam generator tubing in PWRs and the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of austenitic SS piping in BWRs {{have been the most}} visible and most expensive examples of EAC in LWRs, and the repair and replacement of steam generators and recirculation piping has cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Cast duplex austenitic-ferritic SSs are used extensively in the nuclear industry to fabricate pump <b>casings</b> and valve <b>bodies</b> for LWRs and primary coolant piping in many PWRs. Embrittlement of the ferrite phase in cast duplex SS may occur after 10 to 20 years at reactor operating temperatures, which could influence the mechanical response and integrity of pressure boundary components during high strain-rate loading (e. g., seismic events).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} microbial succession in the mushroom supply chain from compost, <b>casing</b> to fruit <b>body</b> formation and mushroom growth to the point of harvested, packing and point of sale. The microbial population dynamics of compost, casing and mushrooms were determined using a plate count technique, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16 S and 18 S rDNA. Plating revealed greater abundance of bacteria, fungi and yeasts in mushroom compost compared to casing and fresh mushroom samples. The viable count method also showed that bacteria and yeasts increased significantly after harvest and during cold storage. Sequencing revealed a more diverse culturable bacterial population in casing and on the mushrooms than in the compost. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a general trend of grouping of species from the same sources. In contrast, a higher microbial diversity was recorded in compost when using the DGGE method, which reflects cultural and non- culturable microorganisms. For compost and casing bacteria studied using DGGE, several species formed separate lineages, demonstrating highly diverse communities in these samples. Fungi were shown to be less abundant and less diverse compared to bacteria and yeasts. The study provides baseline knowledge of microbial populations and -succession trends in mushroom production systems using viable and non- viable methods. The information provided in this study may be useful for microbial ecology studies and to identify and develop biocontrol systems for pathogen control during production or to enhance pinning stimulation by knowing when to apply Pseudomonas spp. to ensure increased yield. Finally an insight is provided into microbial survival during cold storage and marketing of mushrooms.

2500|$|Almost {{all species}} of velvet worm {{reproduce}} sexually. The sole exception is Epiperipatus imthurni, of which no males have been observed; reproduction instead occurs by parthenogenesis. All species are in principle sexually distinct and bear, in many cases, a marked sexual dimorphism: the females are usually {{larger than the}} males and have, in species where the number of legs is variable, more legs. The females of many species are fertilized only once during their lives, which leads to copulation sometimes taking place before the reproductive organs of the females are fully developed. In such cases, for example {{at the age of}} three months in Macroperipatus torquatus, the transferred sperm cells are kept in a special reservoir, where they can remain [...] for longer periods. Fertilization takes place internally, although the mode of sperm transmission varies widely. In most species, for example in the genus Peripatus, a package of sperm cells called the spermatophore is placed into the genital opening of the female. The detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true penis having only been observed in species of the genus Paraperipatus. In many Australian species, there exist dimples or special dagger- or axe-shaped structures on the head; the male of Florelliceps stutchburyae presses a long spine against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus Peripatopsis is particularly curious.

40|$|Twined textile shrouds, {{beginning}} {{at least nine}} thousand years ago, were an integral and relatively unchanging feature of Chinchorro mummy bundles, though Chinchorro mummification practices dramatically varied through the millennia. Twined mats were used like <b>casings,</b> enshrouding the <b>bodies,</b> like a postmortem amniotic sack made from vegetal fibers. They carried the individuals to the after world protected {{in the belly of}} the earth. Chinchorro mummies beginning with the earliest dated individual, known as Acha Man, from 9, 000 B. P. through and into to the next cultural phase, Formative 3, 000 - 1, 500 B. P., were enveloped in a reed shroud. The use, materials, structures and overall forms of these textiles reveal aspects about the people who produced them and the people they protected in their journey to the after life. Who used them? In Arica, Chile there are at least 9, 000 years of twined mats. Within this long period of sustained textile tradition most evidence comes from mortuary contexts. Though very little {{attention has been paid to}} the twined mats, they were the most enduring Chinchorro characteristic. The presence of a mat shroud is a constant and diagnostic feature of Chinchorro culture. The mummies themselves were found in a variety of styles according to Arriaza et al. (2008), Arriaza (1995), Guillen (1992), and Standen (1991) that range from natural mummies, complex black mummies, complex red mummies (see image), bandage/striped mummies, to mud or cement coated mummies that relate to some extent with temporal differences. However, all mummy styles were found in an extended position and wrapped in twined mats, the distinguishing mortuary characteristics denoting the Chinchorro. In contrast later Quiani peoples, with distinctive flexed burials, used camelid twined and woven cloth as well as dyed turbans of camelid yarns for personal adornment. The mortuary mat shrouds made of vegetable fibers were used for all burials of the Chinchorro period and continued to be common in this later culture known as Quiani (3000 BP) that marked a transition to the Formative Period and different mortuary traditions. Later in the Formative Period the mats became much coarser, and more like architectural features than shrouds. The twined mats were used as divisions between layers of individuals in mortuary mounds. Though little effort in the Formative Period (3000 – 1500 BP) was placed on mat making in terms of quality, loom weaving had arrived and basketry in general took on greater importance and was impressive in quality...|$|R

40|$|Too Exposed to One Another: The Art of Nudity in John Updikes Nakedness Proposal Avis Hewitt Grand Valley State University Third Biennial John Updike Conference, October 1 - 4, 2014 The {{narrative}} just preceding Separating in Updikes long-term {{project that}} delineates {{the rise and}} fall of the marriage of Richard and Joan Maple, published first in paperback as Too Far to Go (1979) and then later by Knopf as an Everymans Pocket Classic titled The Maples Stories (2009) unsettles readers as a warm-up act for the powerful trauma of the June day when Richard must confess to each of his four children that he is breaking up the family. While Separating is frequently anthologized and is considered, as James Schiff notes in John Updike Revisited, the rarest gem in a volume made up of Updikes finest work in short fiction (121), the little piece that leads to it is a bit of an enigma. I propose to read that mystery in light of a trail of artful clues which serve as Hansel-Gretel pebbles that Updike has strewn for readers alert to his love of art. The research question in play is how to provide the best interpretation of the closing scene. Joan has performed what Richard considers a strip show for an audience of one as he lies on the bed watching her after an evening they have spent at dinner with friends. But when he rises from the bed to approach her, she looks at him, her eyes blue as a morning sea, and smiles. Then she says ‘No... in complacent firm denial, and that causes Richard to feel thrilled, invaded because [t]his nakedness is new to them (173). Why is this nakedness new to them? Robert Luscher sees it as a good. While Richard and Joan cannot emulate the unaffected nudity of the young couple on the beach in the opening scene of the story a couple whose unclothed exposure to the sun has left them newly unsexed visually, they can perhaps move for a moment to a place where the accumulation of infidelities and repulsions retreats behind the smooth pelt of an even tan that minimizes the sexual signs so large in our interior mythology, the breasts and pubic patches, melted to almost nothing in the middle distance, in the sun with [e]ven the young mans penis seem[ing] incidental (165). Interpretation hangs on the tone of Joans no. She may be simply repeating Richards answer when she asks if he has nothing better to do than watch her undress. That approach is an enemy challenge, rather than a lovers come hither. But it is not a rejection of him. Still, Luschers optimism fails to account for Richards rejection of her as Richard remembers her hand close to a naked boys penis as she offer liberal sympathies to the nudists being kicked off the beach, as well as his remembering her sense of being a nincompoop, and worst, his revisiting her physically as one whose heart in the fatty <b>casing</b> of her <b>body</b> plump[s] up (168, 173) when she feels triumphant or smart as his rival. He disdains her. The art and literary allusions are carefully ordered: Hieronymus Bosch, Massacios Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden, Noah beheld naked by Ham, Susanna and the elders, Rodins remark re: a woman undressing, Rodins Bathers, Joyces Molly Bloom, Titans Venus, Manets Olympia, Goyas Maja, Chopins Edna Pontellier, Rodins Thinker, the old farmer who had sired eleven children without ever seeing his wifes naked body,the West African port that was the last place where a young woman could walk naked without attracting attention, and Brigitte Bardots Time photo of her from behind, bare from head to toe. The concluding strip show boasts three more allusions: Michelangelos slave, Munchs Madonna, and Ingress urnbearer, the last of which is seen from the front, unbarbered (173). William Feavers 2006 Art News article suggests that all Ingres is erotic, that every drawing Ingres made was an overture, every painting a consummation. Given the erotic subtext of Nakedness not just based on Ingres but on almost all of these allusions [...] readers are hard-pressed to reconcile its surface estrangements and repulsions. The contemporary radical Italian theorist Giorgio Agamben suggests in Nudities that the unconcealment or absence of veils that marks our nakedness is a form of inoperativity that is, the cessation of work. Our nakedness moves us from doing into being. My hypothesis is that Richards disdain is for Joans doing: her swelling to show pride in the relevance of [her] humanistic education and her willingness to call the golden-mustached young policeman a pig (168, 166. Her liberalism disgusts him. Yet these acts somehow do not taint in that night moment his desire for her being. If, like Robert Luscher, I am unduly optimistic in this interpretation, the proof should lie in providing context for these EIGHTEEN allusions to art and literature which offer an obvious and rich, but heretofore unpacked, context for this small gem in its own right of a warm-up act for Separating. Updikes own considerable propensity for nude art in Just Looking (1989) and Still Looking (2005) will also serve as a necessary element of this interpretive effort. Word Count: 87...|$|R
