[...] Over the course of ten years, it is alleged that at least $8.7 million in donations were involved, out of which the charities kept nearly $750,000.

[...] By October of that year, [...] "Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said 'prewar estimates that may be borne out in fact are likelier to be more lucky than smart.' [...] added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others 'oozed with uncertainty.'" [...] Di Rita's comments came as a much less optimistic secret Pentagon study—which had been complete at the time of Wolfowitz's testimony—was coming to public light, and when actual production results in Iraq were coinciding with those projected in the less optimistic Pentagon study.|$|R
50|$|In 1892, Davies married Virginia Meriwether, one of New York State's {{first female}} physicians. Her family, suspecting that their {{daughter}} might end {{by being the}} sole breadwinner of the family if she was to marry an impoverished artist, insisted that the bridegroom sign a prenuptial agreement, renouncing any <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> his wife's <b>money</b> {{in the event of}} divorce. (Davies would eventually become very wealthy through the sale of his paintings, though his prospects at thirty did not look enccouraging.) Appearances notwithstanding, they were anything but a conventional couple, even {{aside from the fact that}} Davies was of a philandering nature. Virginia had eloped when she was young and had murdered her husband on her honeymoon when she discovered that he was an abusive drug addict and compulsive gambler, a fact that she and her family kept from Davies.|$|R
40|$|Money supply has a {{tendency}} to increase or decrease the price level. Because of it, it is important to do a restraint and control action <b>on</b> <b>money</b> supply through its affecting factors include net foreign assets, net <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> central government, <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> region government, <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> the other finances institution, <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> nonfinances enterprise of state-owned corporation, and <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> private sector. In this study, a model has done between money supply and its affecting factors using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) with NIPALS (Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares) algorithm because the affecting factors of money supply data is detected multicollinearity. In the PLSR, regression coefficient is obtained iteratively. Three stage iteration process in PLSR produce weight vector, loading vector, and parameter estimation that produce PRESS and R 2 values later. Based on the analysis, PLSR model to the money supply data in July 2012 until December 2014 is obtained at the fourth iteration with minimum PRESS value as 2, 10815 x 1010. That PLSR model has R 2 value as 99, 47 %, so it is very good for explaining the money supply. By means of bootstrap technique, concluded that all of the affecting factors of <b>money</b> supply <b>on</b> PLSR model influence money supply significantly...|$|R

40|$|It is {{remarkable}} how the world’s short {{recent history of}} floating exchange rates among fiat currencies has affected popular thinking about what is eternally normal and proper in the economic system. Recently, Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham (2006) wrote matter of factly in the Wall Street Journal that “One of the fundamental tenets of free trade is that currencies should float. ” Such a “tenet, ” if it were such, could only have emerged since the 1970 s. Of course, exchange rates had fluctuated widely in previous centuries, {{but it has been}} only since the 1970 s that such fluctuations have been taken as connatural with the international monetary regime. Even John Maynard Keynes, the arch slayer of the last remnants of commodity money, was an adamant supporter of fixed exchange rates. 1 Before the 1970 s, it was generally taken for granted that international transactions would be best served by a system of fixed exchange rates relative to the international standard of value, which was a commodity or a <b>claim</b> <b>on</b> a commodity. <b>Money</b> accepted across borders had generally been gold, or <b>claims</b> <b>on</b> gold, for about 2, 500 years. The post- 1971 international monetary “system, ” certainly a misnomer, is comprised of 150 -some-odd currencies, primarily national, all circulating in the form of irredeemable IOUs, or IOUs redeemable only in other IOUs. Some trade freely against others, some trade freely but with governments buying and selling so as to maintain a desired price, and some are subject to exchange restrictions by their government issuers. This would appear a recipe for continual global chaos, but it functions with far more stability than one might expect, given the complete absence of agreed rules or an agreed internationa...|$|R
40|$|Although {{they were}} never {{confirmed}} conquerors, the total waiver for loss and damage caused by the Japanese in the Pacific war under Article 14 (b) of the Treaty of San Francisco conferred a blanket sovereign immunity on them in the jurisdictions they invaded including the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong. As occupiers under the Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War (the Hague Regulations) the evaluation of Japanese state practice and liability to pay compensation arising from misuse of civilian-owned private property rests entirely on the validity of Article 14 (b). This paper takes the prospects of the Hong Kong Chinese of winning individual-to-state reparations {{as an example of}} how a new reparations model could work. In particular, it surveys financial losses that were incurred by them during the Japanese Occupation (1941 – 1945). The misapplied sovereign immunity granted to the Japanese for wartime loss and damage under Article 14 (b) has allowed them to escape evaluation as occupiers. But recognizing Article 14 (b) as void would not necessarily open the flood gates if the moderating elements of military necessity and an occupant’s monetary policy prerogative were applied. Thus, rather than focus on the loss of value of money through confiscatory currency exchange rates, rampant price inflation or demonetization, a new reparations <b>claim</b> should focus <b>on</b> <b>money</b> taken by the Japanese of non-Kwomintang Hong Kong Chinese in house-to-house requisition drives and from bank deposit accounts...|$|R
30|$|In 1993, “Making <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the Internet” {{inspired}} the global gold rush in electronic commerce (e-commerce) along {{the newly opened}} information speedway (Glossbrenner & Glossbrenner 1994). In {{a little bit more}} than two decades, we have experienced the tremendous changes in our society brought up by the Internet, mobile communications, electronic commerce, and, nowadays, financial innovations. We have witnessed how Google, eBay, FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Alibaba, Tencent, Microsoft, CISCO, and many others, are booming in a short period, how social networks reinforced by ubiquitous mobile communications are penetrating and occupying in our daily life, and how explosive big data in the cyber space challenges our information and communication technologies (ICT), and hence stimulates the development of newer technologies, such as Hadoop ([URL] Spark ([URL] NoSQL ([URL] H 2 O ([URL] etc. Electronic commerce has quickly evolved from trading of physical goods to digital goods, from primitive electronic payment to advanced financial services, and now credit based businesses (Niranjanamurthy & Kavyashree 2013). Today, baby-boomers is retiring, and Generation X, Y, and Z are giving the way to an even newer generation dwelling deeply in the cyber world.
