5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the <b>cytoskeleton.</b> The association with the <b>cytoskeleton</b> determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the <b>cytoskeleton,</b> is also critical to the association with the <b>cytoskeleton.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{cell wall}} {{provides}} external {{support of the}} plant cells, while the <b>cytoskeletons</b> including the microtubules and the actin filaments constitute an internal framework. The <b>cytoskeletons</b> contribute to the cell wall biosynthesis by spatially and temporarily regulating the transportation and deposition of cell wall components. This tight control is achieved by the dynamic behavior of the <b>cytoskeletons,</b> but also through the tethering of these structures to the plasma membrane. This tetheringmay also extend beyond the plasma membrane and impact on the cell wall, possibly {{in the form of}} a feedback loop. In this review, we discuss the linking components between the <b>cytoskeletons</b> and the plasma membrane, and/or the cell wall. We also discuss the prospective roles of these components in cell wall biosyn-thesis and modifications, and aim to provide a platform for further studies in this field...|$|R

5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic <b>cytoskeleton.</b> Proteins related to the <b>cytoskeleton</b> components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E
5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the <b>cytoskeleton,</b> {{which is}} {{normally}} used to move organelles inside the cell.

5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a <b>cytoskeleton,</b> an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

After removing the cell membrane and soluble proteins by Triton X- 100 extraction, {{we found that the}} remaining complex (Triton <b>cytoskeletons)</b> activated Rap 1 upon stretch. Rap 1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C 3 G, was required for this activation; C 3 G as well as the adaptor protein, CrkII, in cell extract bound to Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> in a stretch-dependent manner. CrkII binding, which was Cas dependent, correlated with stretch-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> including Cas at the contacts with ECM.

Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell.

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the <b>cytoskeleton.</b> Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the <b>cytoskeleton</b> and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E

5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the <b>cytoskeleton,</b> which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the susceptibility of vimentin and nuclear lamins from cultured Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells to degradation by Ca 2 + −activated neutral thiol proteinase (calpain) has been undertaken. While pure vimentin was degraded very quickly at physiological ionic strength by purified calpain, isolated lamin B was digested comparatively slowly and purified lamins A/C were fairly resistant to proteolytic degradation. Similar digestion patterns were obtained from vimentin and lamin B with intermediary breakdown products close in size to the corresponding alpha−helical rod domains. To exclude {{the possibility that the}} low susceptibility of isolated lamins to Ca 2 +−dependent proteolytic degradation was due to irreversible denaturation during their isolation and purification, Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> were prepared and their nuclear lamina as well as vimentin filaments were exposed to relatively large quantities of purified calpain. Under these conditions, not only vimentin filaments but also lamins A and B were digested while lamin C remained intact to a high degree. The major breakdown products of vimentin and lamins were identified as polypeptides which were 35 to 45 amino acids longer than the corresponding alpha−helical rod domains. Most of the vimentin−derived material and all high molecular weight polypeptides originating from lamins remained associated with the Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in conjunction with immunoblotting. Indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscope analysis of the calpain−digested Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> revealed that they still contained a laminalike structure around the nuclear chromatin and numerous structurally altered intermediate filaments in the cytoplasmic remnant, although all vimentin had been degraded with the formation of 40 / 41 kDa polypeptides as major digestion products. In untreated Triton <b>cytoskeletons,</b> the vimentin filaments seemed to be in direct physical contact with the nuclear lamina, whereas in digested Triton <b>cytoskeletons</b> there was a distinct gap between structurally altered filaments and the nuclear surface.

5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the <b>cytoskeleton</b> by motor proteins.|$|E

Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
