50|$|One {{day when}} {{he is in the}} farm, he is told to return home early as his elder {{daughter}} - Haniyeh - has lost her hearing aid. When he reaches home he finds that his son Hussein and neighborhood children are searching for the hearing aid in their underground water cistern, which, because of blockages holds little but sludgy mud now. Karim scolds his son and others for coming there, but joins them in searching for the hearing aid. During the search his son Hussein and his friends reveal their idea of <b>clearing</b> the <b>sludge</b> and raising fish in the hope of becoming millionaires. Karim rejects the idea and discourages them. They eventually find the hearing aid, but Karim discovers that it's not working properly. He approaches the hospital and learns that he has to wait up to four months to get the aid repaired for free, otherwise he has to go to Tehran city to replace it immediately. As his daughter's exam is approaching, he is worried about getting the hearing aid promptly.|$|R

The highly polluting POME is identified as the major stumbling block {{to the development of}} palm oil industry in Malaysia. Hence, an integrated membrane process with physical-chemical treatment had been successfully achieved for treatment of POME. The role of membrane was explored significantly; where the chemical treated POME was further treated using ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membrane. The concept of sustainable development in palm oil industries is achieved by recovering and recycling the crystal <b>clear</b> water and <b>sludge</b> as organic fertilizer from POME back to its process and plantations using the innovative membrane treatment. Consequently, zero discharge is achieved by eliminating the discharge of POME into the rivers...|$|R
40|$|Sewage from {{residential}} areas often contains viruses pathogenic for man and significant amounts are probably associated with solids in sewage sludge. Information on {{the survival of}} viruses in sewage sludge is {{necessary in order to}} develop guidelines for recycling programmes that involve spreading the sludge on land. In the present study, a number of enteroviruses were added to sewage sludge and the artificially contaminated sludges were tested for viruses at intervals over a 12 -week period. Most of the viruses survived for many weeks at room temperature. It is <b>clear</b> that sewage <b>sludge</b> destined for land application should be adequately treated for virus inactivation. In interpreting these results, it should be borne in mind that the survival of hepatitis A virus might be similar. Recent reports about the reappearance of poliomyelitis in regions with immunization programmes should also be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Although {{literature}} suggests that aquatic worms can help to enhance the methane production from excess activated <b>sludge,</b> <b>clear</b> evidence for this is missing. Therefore, anaerobic digestion tests were performed at 20 and at 30 °C with sludge from a high-loaded membrane bioreactor, the aquatic worm Lumbriculus variegatus, feces from these worms and with mixtures of these substrates. A significant synergistic effect of the worms or their feces on methane production from the high-loaded sludge or on its digestion rate was not observed. However, {{a positive effect on}} low-loaded activated sludge, which generally has a lower anaerobic biodegradability, cannot be excluded. The results furthermore showed that the high-loaded sludge provides an excellent feed for L. variegatus, which is promising for concepts where worm biomass is considered a resource for technical grade products such as coatings and glues. </p...|$|R

Najprej sem se moral seznaniti s celotnim postopkom čiščenja odpadnih vod v industriji in s kemijskimi procesi, ki so prisotni preden se na čistilni napravi nabere blato, ki ga je potrebno kasneje odstraniti. Ugotovil sem, da je za moj problem najbolj primerna elektronika s senzorjem, ki na podlagi sprejemnih in oddajnih diod meri debelino blata na vodi. Elektronika pa s prejetimi informacijami s senzorja prilagaja hitrost zajemanja preko frekvenčnika. Pri montaži predstavljenega kontrolerja količine blata je potrebno v začetku spremljati proces, da se nastavi optimalen odvzem blata iz vode saj gre lahko blato ostopoma proti dnu in se pomeša s čisto vodo v primeru, da je hitrost odvzema premajhna in obratno se odstrani preveč čiste vode, če je hitrost odvzema prehitra. Hitrost odvzema se pri mojem projektu regulira s pomočjo treh potenciometrov. Vsak služi nastavitvi hitrosti v odvisnosti od debeline blata. Prvi potenciometer služi za nastavitev hitrosti pri majhni količini blata, drugi potenciometer služi za nastavitev hitrosti pri večji količini blata in tretji potenciometer, ki služi za nastavitev hitrosti zajemalke pri maksimalni količini blata. In present thesis, {{the sludge}} blanket {{controller}} for <b>clearing</b> the <b>sludge</b> out of waste water is presented. My work started with gathering {{of information about}} industrial waste water treatment and with undrestanding the corresponding chemical processes that take place before the sludge is accumulated in the waste water cleaning device. For cleaning the accumulated sludge, the most appropriate electronics system {{turned out to be}} the electronics with a sensor that measures the sludge thickness on the water trough the receiving and transmission diodes. This system uses the information from the sensor to adjust the information capure spreed via the frequency converter. When installing the presented sludge blanket controller, first the process needs to be monitored to determine the optimal withdrawal of the sludge. In the case where the sludge removal speed is too small, the sludge can gradually sink toward the bottom and is mixed with clean water, while in the case where the sludge removal speed is to fast, too much clean water is removed. In the presented electronics, the sludge removal speed is regulated with three potentiometers, each adjusted for its own sludge thickness. The first potentiometer is used to set the speed for a small amount of sludge, the second potentiometer is used to set the speed in larger quantities of sludges and the third potentiometer, serves to adjust the speed of the dipper in the maximum quantity of sludge...|$|R
40|$|Sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants in five Swedish pulp and paper mills has been burned together with wood in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. The sludge was either mechanically dewatered or pre-dried. The mechanically dewatered sludge had to be fed with a pump, but the pre-dried sludge could be fed by the fuel feed system normally used for coal, wood chips or wood pellets. In parallel to the combustion tests in the CFB boiler the sludges were also investigated as single fuels in a small laboratory FB. The Swedish {{pulp and paper industry}} produces three major fractions of sludge: pure fibre sludge, sludge produced by employing a precipitation species like ironaluminiumsulphate, and finally, sludge subjected to biological cleaning. The way of production of the sludge influences its content of, for example, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine, but the composition of the sludge is also influenced by the pulp and paper process. The present measurements show that the concentrations of nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine in the sludge have a great impact on the corresponding gaseous emissions from combustion. Actions to prevent these emissions could be necessary, depending on the origin of the sludge and treatment process used. In the present project all sludges were burned with wood-pellets as the main fuel under identical operating conditions, typical for a CFB boiler. Wood pellets were chosen as a well defined, low-polluting fuel that makes comparison of emissions from the <b>sludges</b> <b>clear.</b> Co-combustion with wood-pellets has the advantage of enabling operation also with wet sludges that cannot be used as single fuels without pre-drying. No actions were taken to improve sulphur and chlorine retention, by for example adding limestone. From a combustion point of view the co-combustion works well with low levels of carbon monoxide present in the flue gas and no light hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{frequency}} of Japanese subjects over 20 {{years old with}} metabolic syndrome is 45. 6 % in men but just 16. 7 % in women. The reason why Japanese male subjects {{are more susceptible to}} metabolic syndrome than women is unknown. One possibility is the higher {{frequency of}} Japanese male subjects (40 – 70 years old) who had a drinking habit (67 %), while that of female subjects was only 25 %. In addition, daily fat intake was markedly increased in Japanese subjects (from 9 % to 25 %), and cholesterol cholelithiasis {{is one of the most}} rapidly increasing digestive diseases during the past 50 years. The object of this study is to examine whether a potential sex-related risk factor exists in the manifestation of metabolic syndrome as well as gallstone formation. Methods Gallbladder dysmotility accerelates gallstone formation and gallbladder contraction depends on cholecystokinin (CCK) and its receptor (CCK- 1 R). We developed CCK- 1 R gene knockout (-/-) mice. The effects of the fat- and protein- enriched diet OA- 2 on body weight, hyperlipidemia, and frequencies of sludge and gallstone formation were examined, and compared between wild-type and CCK- 1 R(-/-) male and female mice. The OA- 2 diet contains slightly higher protein and fat (7. 9 % fat and 27. 6 % protein) compared with a standard diet (CRF- 1) (5. 6 % fat and 22. 6 % protein), but their total energies are similar. After weaning, CRF- 1 was provided until 3 months of age in all animals. Administration of an OA- 2 diet was started when age-matched CCK- 1 R(-/-) and wild-type male and female mice reached maturity, at 3 months of age. Administration of CRF- 1 was continued in the rest of the animals. Mice were sacrificed by guillotine at 6 and 12 months of age and the blood was collected to measure plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol. The gallbladder was removed and classified as normal (<b>clear</b> gallbladder), clouded (<b>sludge</b> formation), and/or containing gallstone formations. Results As long as CRF- 1 was provided, the frequency of sludge and/or gallstone formation in CCK- 1 R(-/-) male mice was 3 of 8 (35 %) and 4 of 9 (45 %) in females at 12 months of age, whereas no gallstone formation was observed at 6 months of age. On the other hand, male mice fed OA- 2 increased their body weight and plasma lipid concentrations, compared with those fed CRF- 1 regardless of genotype. Under the OA- 2 diet, sludge and gallstone formation was observed at 6 months of age, not only in CCK- 1 R(-/-) male mice but also in wild-type male mice. In contrast, parameters in female mice did not differ between the two diets. Conclusion Male mice were more susceptible to protein- and fat-enriched diet-induced obesity than female mice, and hyper-nutritional status accelerated sludge and gallstone formation in male mice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Anodising is an {{important}} finishing technique used to produce controlled oxide coating on aluminium extrusions which impart aesthetic finish, longer life and resistance to corrosion and abrasion. The anodising process however leads to generation of significant amounts of acid and alkaline waste containing mainly aluminium. Normally these wastes are neutralised producing aluminium hydroxide sludge the disposal of which is problematic. Finex is New Zealand's most recently developed anodising plant established in Hamilton in 2004. During the first period of operation the company {{was faced with a}} costly sludge disposal problem. The present project was devised to study their production plant and wastewater treatment plant. A brief study of the sludge showed that even under optimum conditions and with use of polyelectrolyte, gravity settling produced excessive volumes of sludge. The decision was made to install a plate and frame filter press. With the reduction of its bulk by dewatering, the problem of sludge disposal was essentially solved. However the 12 tonnes per week of dewatered sludge production still posed the challenge of devising a way of using the material beneficially. The characteristics of the sludge were determined and routes to commodity products were investigated. Commodity alum was produced in good yield at 4 C by treatment of the sludge with sulphuric acid followed by crystallisation with anhydrous potassium sulphate. The product was very similar to the commercial product. Under basic conditions, sodium aluminate was produced by adding stoichiometric amount of OH-. Under acid conditions at the H+/Al(OH) 3 stoichiometric ratio of 3, 95 % of the aluminium was recovered as aluminium salt solution. When acid addition was less than the stoichiometric ratio of 3, the polyelectrolyte containing sludge showed little tendency to re-suspend. A variety of mechanical and thermal methods was used in an attempt to disaggregate and re-suspend the sludge. These included ultrasonic treatment at 80 C at frequency 14 kHz for 6 hours, autoclaving the sludge in electrical furnace at 150 C for 6 hours, homogenisation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 20 C and mechanical grinding using mortar and pestle at 20 C. The ultrasonic treatment was effective in re-suspending 30 % of the sludge. The other treatments were largely ineffective. On comparing the heavy metal concentration present in the original anodising sludge with the heavy metal concentration in the recovered commodity products, it was found that heavy metal content reduction was achieved with the alum crystallisation process. On producing aluminate, Cd, Mg and Ni were reduced through the removal of insoluble hydroxides. Minimal reduction of heavy metal content was achieved in the acidic aluminium chloride solution. The acidic and alkaline products prepared from anodising sludge were tested for their usefulness as coagulation agents. Critical coagulation concentrations for kaolin suspensions for all products were determined to be 5 mg/L. For all systems except the ultrasonic re-suspended <b>sludge,</b> <b>clear</b> solutions of low turbidity resulted after 1 hour standing. An analysis of the cost recovery of various commodity products from waste sludge indicated that recovery of acid aluminium chloride solution was most cost effective while the recovery of alum produces the purest product. Assuming that the acid aluminium chloride solution could be substituted for and sold at the same per kg of aluminium price as polyaluminium chloride, a 52 % margin over consumables cost allows the possibility of a modest profit. The main benefit to Finex from proceeding with a sludge recovery program however is likely to be enhancement of the companies green credentials...|$|R
