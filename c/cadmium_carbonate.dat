40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical alterations of cadmium yellow (CdS) paints in Henri Matisse’s The Joy of Life (1905 – 1906, The Barnes Foundation) {{have been recognized}} since 2006, when a survey by portable X-ray fluorescence identified this pigment in all altered regions of the monumental painting. This alteration is visible as fading, discoloration, chalking, flaking, and spalling of several regions of light to medium yellow paint. Since that time, synchrotron radiation-based techniques including elemental and spectroscopic imaging, as well as X-ray scattering have been employed to locate and identify the alteration products observed in this and related works by Henri Matisse. This information is necessary to formulate one or multiple mechanisms for degradation of Matisse’s paints from this period, and thus ensure proper environmental conditions for the storage and the display of his works. This paper focuses on 2 D full-field X-ray Near Edge Structure imaging, 2 D micro-X-ray Diffraction, X-ray Fluorescence, and Fourier Transform Infra-red imaging of the altered paint layers to address one of the long-standing questions about cadmium yellow alteration—the roles of <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and <b>cadmium</b> sulphates found in the altered paint layers. These compounds have often been assumed to be photo-oxidation products, but could also be residual starting reagents from an indirect wet process synthesis of CdS. The data presented here allow identifying and mapping the location of <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> <b>cadmium</b> chlorides, cadmium oxalates, cadmium sulphates, and cadmium sulphides in thin sections of altered cadmium yellow paints from The Joy of Life and Matisse’s Flower Piece (1906, The Barnes Foundation). Distribution of various cadmium compounds confirms that <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and sulphates are photo-degradation products in The Joy of Life, whereas in Flower Piece, <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonates</b> {{appear to have been}} a [(partially) unreacted] starting reagent for the yellow paint, a role previously suggested in other altered yellow paints...|$|R
30|$|While the {{theoretical}} precipitation of CdCO 3 (Ksp =  1  ×  10 − 12 at 25  °C) begins at pH 8.5, an initial chemisorption step may {{also serve as}} a removal mechanism (Pickering 1983). Our results clearly showed that higher removal efficiency from the lower grade limestone sample (S) was probably related to its higher specific surface area, combined with elevated concentrations of silica and other impurities, as indicated earlier in this paper. To get more insights on the removal mechanisms, the dissolved calcium during the present sorption study was measured and compared in the case of Pb and Cd removal by limestone. It was confirmed that the presence of lead favored calcite dissolution, while <b>cadmium</b> inhibited calcium <b>carbonate</b> dissolution to some extent. Calcium concentration exceeded 40  mg/L in the case of lead removal, but less than 25  mg/L during the removal of cadmium regardless of the limestone sample.

40|$|The {{cadmium yellow}} paints (CdS) used in impressionist and modernist {{paintings}} in early 1900 s are undergoing several deterioration processes including whitening and discoloration.

40|$|A {{process for}} the {{recovery}} of a metal, in particular, cadmium contained in scrap, in a stable form. The process comprises the steps of mixing the cadmium-containing scrap with an ammonium carbonate solution, preferably at least a stoichiometric amount of ammonium carbonate, and/or free ammonia, and an oxidizing agent to form a first mixture so that the cadmium will react with the ammonium carbonate to form a water-soluble ammine complex; evaporating the first mixture so that ammine complex dissociates from the first mixture leaving carbonate ions to react with the cadmium and form a second mixture that includes cadmium carbonate; optionally adding water to the second mixture to form a third mixture; adjusting the pH of the third mixture to the acid range whereby the <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate</b> will dissolve; and adding at least a stoichiometric amount of sulfide, preferably {{in the form of}} hydrogen sulfide or an aqueous ammonium sulfide solution, to the third mixture to precipitate cadmium sulfide.

40|$|The {{activity}} of a biological photosynthetic community promotes the seasonal precipitation of hydrozincite, Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6, from heavy-metal contaminated {{waters of the}} Rio Naracauli stream, Sardinia. The precipitation removes from waters not only zinc, but also other heavy metals, such as Cd, Cu, Pb. The phenomenon has remarkable environmental implications, and may have remediation applications. In this study, we investigate the nature of Cd binding to hydrozincite by release tests in deionized water, backed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra collected at the Cd K-edge, and by synchrotron-based anomalous X-ray diffraction (AXRD) spectra. Release tests indicate that Cd is weakly bound to hydrozincite, being released to a significantly higher rate than Zn. The absence of a residual corresponding to a crystalline phase in the anomalous diffraction pattern indicates that, up to bulk concentration of 2 wt%, Cd occurs in hydrozincite in an essentially disordered environment. The analysis of the weak signal of the second shell in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra suggests a local environment similar to <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> but distinct from otavite. We conclude that Cd is bound to hydrozincite as a disordered amorphous surface precipitate.

In general, the decomposition curves at 270 ℃ and 280 ℃ are given induction period, indicating an autocatalytic reaction, but over the temperature range of 290 - 330 ℃ the induction period was virtually absent and the final decay period more pronounced. The decomposition rate was Lowered {{in the presence of}} He, N_ 2, O_ 2 and especially CO_ 2 than in vacuum. The rate equation that described the entire range of the decomposition was not found.

40|$|The {{cadmium yellow}} paints used in impressionist and modernist {{paintings}} in early 1900 s are undergoing several deterioration processes, including whitening and discoloration. Relevant e↵ects produced {{at the surface}} of modern paintings include the growth of discolored crusts, formed mainly by white globular hydrated cadmium sulfate CdSO 4 *nH 2 O and <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate</b> (CdCO 3). In {{view of the fact}} that the pigment, cadmium sulfide, was historically synthesized by means of dry and wet processes and that CdCO 3 and CdSO 4 are reagents for this procedure, their identification alone does not constitute conclusive proof of photo-oxidation. The origins of such chemical and physical alterations are still under debate. Structural defects in CdS, among other possible causes like photo-oxidation processes, may play a role in the degradation process. Their presence in the pigment surface alters the electronic structure of cadmium sulfide by forming acceptor levels in the gap of the semiconductor. Such levels make the surface more reactive in the interaction with external agents (oxygen, water [...] .). To this end, we present a theoretical study of points defects, namely Cd- and S- vacancies, in the structural wurtzite structure (bulk) and [10 ¯ 10] CdS surface. In order to understand, at atomic level, the oxidation and hydration mechanisms of these whitish globules, we present the early stages of the interaction between the hexagonal clean and defective [10 ¯ 10] surface of CdS and O 2 and H 2 O molecules to simulate the combined e↵ects of exposure to air and humidity. The geometrical and electronic structures as well as the vacancy formation and adsorption energies are determined with the use of a first principles method. All the calculations are performed within the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA-PBE) with the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials. Despite the standard DFT-GGA ensures a correct order of electronic states, the G 0 W 0 calculations are strongly required to attribute an accurate position of the trap level. Considering the possibility to investigate in a broader spectral range, such theoretical method would be helpful in the interpretation of experimental evidences on fluorescence emissions produced from by yellow altered. This thesis highlights the key role that first-principles methods can play in the application of materials science to art conservation. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} {{to the atmosphere}} are considered a significant contributor to climate change due to {{the activity of the}} carbon dioxide molecule in the infrared spectrum. This causes solar radiation to be ‘trapped’ in the earth’s atmosphere if increased CO 2 concentrations are present, leading to global warming. In order to decrease CO 2 emissions from stationary sources, like fossil fuel-fired power plants, and halt global warming, carbon capture and storage is proposed as a viable option. Here, a big fraction of the CO 2 normally being emitted to the atmosphere is to be separated from a flue gas stream of a conventional combustor facility (known as post-combustion) or from a synthesis gas (syngas) stream obtained by gasification of the fuel before its combustion (known as pre-combustion). The characteristics of the post-combustion flue gas and the pre-combustion syngas are substantially different, so that capture technologies must be developed for their respective application. The captured CO 2 can then be either used in industrial applications like enhanced oil recovery, if a market exists, or else be stored in places separate from the atmosphere, so as to not cause global warming. Underground storage, consisting of saline aquifers or depleted natural gas caverns, is among the options considered for permanent and safe CO 2 storage. This project investigated the use of metal oxide-based sorbents for pre-combustion capture of CO 2 at 250 to 400 °C from syngas generated in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) process. At this temperature, syngas leaves the water gas shift reactor, which is the ultimate part of the gasification system within the IGCC process. Capturing the CO 2 in-situ at this temperature is considered beneficial, as it eliminates the requirement to cool or heat the gas to CO 2 sorption temperature, which would come with an energy penalty. In the first part, various metal oxides were screened for their suitability to capture CO 2 in the temperature range of IGCC syngas. These were lanthanum oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and cadmium oxide. Based on a literature review, it was found that their carbonates decompose at temperatures considered here. A thermogravimetric screening test routine was outlined and the materials tested by exposure to carbon dioxide on a temperature ramp from 120 to 650 °C. Pure metal oxides and carbonates were considered as well as oxides doped with alkali metal compounds. It was found that cadmium oxide doped with various alkali halides sorbs and desorbs CO 2 well in the screening test, so that more detailed studies were proposed. A magnesium oxide/cesium carbonate composite, which was analysed in detail in a previous project and synthesised using a variety of precursors here, was screened as well and found suitable. As the latter material exhibited a comparatively poor overall CO 2 sorption capacity, it was hypothesised that improvements could be made by varying the synthesis method. In the second part, cadmium oxide/alkali halide mixtures were analysed for their optimal concentration of dopant required to give maximum CO 2 sorption capacity. A variation of alkali halide dopants showed that 17. 5 wt% of sodium iodide (based on <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate</b> used as synthesis precursor) used in synthesis yields the best-performing sorbent. This sorbent was tested in detail via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for single-cycle and multiple cycle CO 2 sorption and desorption by partial pressure variation under isothermal conditions at various temperatures. The carbonation of cadmium oxide to carbonate and its decarbonation was confirmed as the reaction mechanism via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. XRD also showed no significant change in the unit cell parameters of cadmium oxide due to sodium iodide doping. It was shown that alkali halides are necessary promoters for the carbonation reaction, as pure cadmium oxide did not exhibit any CO 2 inclusion and conversion into <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> For the sodium iodide-doped cadmium oxide, a stoichiometric recarbonation was achieved, resulting in a mass gain of 26 % (based on cadmium oxide and considering the presence of dopant here). It was also shown in multicyclic sorption experiments, that a significant decay in working capacity (i. e., the amount of CO 2 both captured and released per cycle) occurred if the initial decarbonation of the <b>cadmium</b> <b>carbonate</b> precursor was performed in air. This could be improved by carbonate decomposition in inert gases like nitrogen or argon. Elemental analysis performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) showed that iodine is lost from the sample, which might be attributed to oxidation of iodide to iodine. The loss of iodine promoter is considered to be the cause of a decay in working capacity of the sorbent. Water vapour addition (1 vol%) to the sorption gases lead to an increase in stability in terms of the working capacities over the number of cycles, but had no noticeable effect on the iodine loss over sorption cycles. Powder samples were considered for multicyclic sorption as well as pelletised samples. It was shown that pelletisation via mechanical compression under vacuum resulted in materials with lower working capacities than powder equivalents, being attributed to the larger pellets being less accessible to the gas than small powder grains. Pellets made from carbonate lost their mechanical strength after 25 CO 2 sorption cycles, whereas pellets made in the oxide state virtually exhibited no working capacity. Introduction of SBA- 15 (porous silica) as spacer made the oxide pellets more accessible to the gas so that they showed a certain working capacity. However, this again led to partial loss of mechanical strength, but to a lower extent as observed for the carbonate pellets. In the third part of the thesis, the physico-chemical properties of the cadmium oxide/sodium iodide material were studied in detail. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed morphological changes if the samples underwent multiple sorption cycles. Initially, spherical cadmium oxide nanoparticles of approx. 200 nm width were observed, which partially broke into irregular pieces after 25 sorption cycles. It was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental mapping that sodium iodide is interspersed into the cadmium oxide as discrete particles. In-situ powder XRD showed that sodium iodide contained in the cadmium oxide/sodium halide mixture is amorphous at room temperature after initial calcination, but becomes crystalline upon heating to CO 2 sorption temperature (in this case 325 °C). These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} cadmium oxide/sodium halide mixed sorbent is not a mixed metal oxide, but rather a mixture of halide and an oxide particles. The initiation of the CO 2 sorption by the dopant halide must thus be due to a mechanistic contribution of the crystalline halide, rather than the formation of a cadmium-alkali-halide-oxide mixed phase under CO 2 uptake after sorption. Analysis of the exit gas from CO 2 desorption in a fixed bed by mass spectrometry confirmed the loss of iodine by showing mass-to-charge values of 126 in the mass spectrum, whereas X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed two species of iodine on the material’s surface, possibly due to different oxidation states. These results support the idea that iodine might be lost during multicyclic sorption by oxidation of iodide to iodine. In the fourth part of the thesis, improvements in the sorption capacities of magnesium oxide/cesium carbonate sorbents are shown. Using a solvothermal process involving hydration of magnesium methoxide and cesium carbonate methanolic solution mixed with toluene and subsequent treatment in an autoclave at 265 °C and flash-evaporation of the solvent, higher surface areas were obtained compared to the material made from commercial magnesium oxide as substrate. The activated solvothermally-made magnesium oxide/cesium carbonate sorbent appeared chemically similar to the one made from commercial templates as shown by XRD, but exhibited a higher working capacity (5 wt% instead of 4 wt%) than the latter. TEM and elemental mapping techniques showed that the solvothermal method leads to smaller particle sizes and also showed a mostly uniform distribution of the cesium throughout the magnesium, with occasional clustering of cesium being observed. The fifth part of the thesis investigates the effect of syngas components on the sorbents. As syngas contains hydrogen, which is a strong reducing agent, it was deemed necessary to assess if the sorbents are stable if hydrogen is present during CO 2 sorption. It was also analysed if hydrogen sulphide, which is a trace component in syngas, has an effect on the sorbents. It was shown that hydrogen tends to lower the working capacity of the cadmium sorbents, possibly due to reduction of the cadmium oxide to cadmium metal. Lowering the sorption temperature 20 °C below the one achieving the highest multicyclic working capacity (i. e., to 285 °C), was able to significantly reduce capacity loss in a CO 2 sorption experiment containing hydrogen. The magnesium-cesium sorbent appeared stable in the presence of hydrogen. Hydrogen sulphide, however, had a significant impact on both the cadmium and magnesium-based materials by reducing their working capacities. In summary, a cadmium oxide based CO 2 sorbent was developed and its physical and chemical properties examined. A magnesium-based mixed oxide developed in a previous study was improved in sorption capacity. The stability of both these materials under simulated syngas conditions was examined and future work is proposed to focus on the application of real syngas to these sorbents, with the goal of further improvements in their stability...|$|E
