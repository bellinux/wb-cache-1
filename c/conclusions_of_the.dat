5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two, a third post-mortem {{was conducted on}} 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. It found that premature {{regulation of the}} new platform might stifle the market-driven development of the service, {{that it should be}} based upon existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content. It was too early at the time to make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted the <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} of 2011, Mirela Holy, who had declared her opposition to the project prior to {{the elections}}, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection. In 2012 the ministry commissioned four reviews of the EIA. The reviews—one of them supporting the EIA and three disproving the <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original EIA—were submitted to the Government of Croatia one day after Holy resigned her post, reportedly over an unrelated matter, on 7 June 2012. Objections were raised by authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors have been kept secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the matter, which has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface <b>conclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E
