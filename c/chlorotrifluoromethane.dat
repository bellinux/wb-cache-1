50|$|<b>Chlorotrifluoromethane,</b> R-13, CFC-13, or Freon 13, is a non-flammable, {{non-corrosive}} chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) {{and also}} a mixed halomethane. It {{is used as a}} refrigerant, however, due to concerns about its ozone-depleting potential, its use has been phased out due to the Montreal Protocol.|$|E
50|$|In this reaction, the {{recombination}} of {{a partially}} positively charged chlorine atom (in trifluoromethoxy chloride) with a partially negatively charged chlorine atom (in hydrogen chloride) {{is used as}} elemental chlorine. The undesired products, by-products chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and <b>chlorotrifluoromethane,</b> can be removed by evaporation at -110 °C. Trifluoromethanol has a melting point of -82 °C and a calculated boiling point of about -20 °C. The boiling point is thus about 85 K {{lower than that of}} methanol. This fact {{can be explained by the}} absence of intramolecular H—F bonds, which are also not visible in the infrared gas phase spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Difluoromethane is a {{refrigerant}} {{that has}} zero ozone depletion potential. Difluoromethane in a zeotropic (50%/50%) m/m mixture with pentafluoroethane (R-125) {{is known as}} R-410A, a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons (aka Freon) in new refrigerant systems, especially for air-conditioning. The zeotropic mix of difluoromethane with pentafluoroethane (R-125) and tetrafluoroethane (R-134a) is known as R-407A through R-407E depending on the composition. Likewise the azeotropic (48.2%/51.8% m/m) mixture with <b>chlorotrifluoromethane</b> (R13). As a refrigerant difluoromethane is classified as A2L - slightly flammable. Although it has zero ozone depletion potential, it has global warming potential 675 times that of carbon dioxide, based on a 100-year time frame.|$|E

The temperature-pressure variations of the dynamic viscosity and the self-diffusion coefficients of small molecules were predicted.

40|$|The {{activity}} of γ-alumina and γ-alumina promoted with transition metal chlorides for the hydrolytic decomposition of dichlorodifluoromethane {{was investigated in}} the temperature range 250 - 400 °C. It {{was found that the}} hydrolysis of dichlorodifluoromethane occurs on the acid sites of the γ-alumina. Carbon dioxide was the main product formed. γ-alumina was deactivated by reaction with hydrogen fluoride formed by the hydrolysis reaction. The fresh catalysts and catalysts after the reaction were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Surface chloride was found to be replaced by fluoride during catalytic reaction. After prolonged reaction, rhombohedral aluminum fluoride was detected in the aged catalysts. The deactivated catalyst also catalyzed the formation of <b>chlorotrifluoromethane.</b> Transition metal chlorides were dispersed on the surface of γ-alumina and reduced the hydrolytic {{activity of}} the fresh catalyst. Transition metal fluoride phase formed by reaction of the chlorides with HF during reaction, especially that formed from CrCl 3, reduced the rate of fluorination of γ-alumina and thus its deactivation.

40|$|Using a {{computer}} controlled {{version of the}} Ben-Naim/Baer apparatus, the solubilities of dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl 2 F 2, Freon- 12), <b>chlorotrifluoromethane</b> (CClF 3, Freon- 13), and octafluorocyclobutane (c-C 4 F 8, Preon C- 318) in H 2 O and D 2 O were determined at four temperatures in the range 288 to 318 K and at a partial pressure of gas of 101. 325 kPa. The precision of the measurements was 0. 5 – 1. 0 %. The experimental data were processed using rigorous thermodynamic methods and were fitted to the Clarke/Glew/Weiss equation. Changes in the thermodynamic properties on solution were calculated from the smoothing equations. The thermodynamic transfer functions of gases from H 2 O to D 2 O were calculated.
