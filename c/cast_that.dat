5000|$|One {{reviewer}} {{described it}} as [...] "a brilliantly absurd story" [...] and [...] "a hilariously tongue-in-cheek premise, wonderfully layered humor that runs from broad slapstick to clever satire, and a <b>cast</b> <b>that's</b> filled {{to the brim with}} beautiful women wearing very, very little." ...|$|R
5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating the style of a music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy.
