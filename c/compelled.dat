5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was <b>compelled</b> to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also {{increased}} their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be <b>compelled</b> to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E

5|$|If White is <b>compelled</b> to play Nb1–d2, it is {{sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later <b>compelled</b> to exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the current campaign finance jurisprudence in the United States, {{with a particular}} emphasis on the Court’s recognition of <b>compelling</b> state interests. Given the limited recognition of <b>compelling</b> state interests, this Article seeks to question the seemingly arbitrary rationale behind recognition and explore the implications of minimal acceptance of <b>compelling</b> state interests. Because the evolution of <b>compelling</b> state interest recognition has varied greatly, the Court’s recent insistence — {{that the state has}} merely one <b>compelling</b> interest — is troublesome. This Article provides a comprehensive review of the campaign finance jurisprudence, then reviews the decisions that created or argued for additional <b>compelling</b> state interests. Interests that were considered <b>compelling</b> prior to Citizens United, such as the anti-distortion interest, remain <b>compelling</b> and hold an important place in the US campaign finance landscape. This Article attempts to respond to the current Court’s trend and shed light on the history of <b>compelling</b> state interest recognition...|$|R
