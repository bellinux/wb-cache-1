500|$|Homer is [...] "a (happy) {{slave to}} his various appetites", and would gladly sell his {{soul to the}} devil in {{exchange}} for a single donut. He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Incan mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene" [...] (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive <b>cranial</b> <b>trauma,</b> and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the episode [...] "HOMR" [...] (season 12, 2001) Homer gets surgery to remove the (newly discovered) crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level. Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him make the right decisions, but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him. Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers [...] "used every possible permutation". These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.|$|E
40|$|Aim: {{the purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the ante-mortem <b>cranial</b> <b>traumas</b> in the skeletal remains of the medieval necropolis of Caravate (Varese). The skull injuries were classified according to their location, type, frequency, age, and sex distributions to clarify the specific causes of the traumas. Materials and methods: the human skeletal remains of twenty individuals were discovered during an archaeological excavation near the church of St. Agostine (8 - 9 th century). We used classical physical anthropological methods for the identification (race, sex, age at death, stature). For the trauma investigations we used radiological analyses (X-ray: 16 -layer Hitachi Etlos). Results: six skeletons present <b>cranial</b> <b>traumas.</b> The types of skull lesions diagnosed are principally blunt trauma and perforation trauma. Traumas are present in all age groups and in both sexes. Conclusions: the significant number of traumas found in the osteological remains of Caravate reveal the possible presence of interpersonal violence in the little community of St. Agostine. In the paleopathological studies the prevalence of traumatic skull lesions among the ancient population suggests a relatively high rate of inter and intra-group violence...|$|R
40|$|Anterior Pituitary Hormone Deficiencies {{may be due}} to any lesion in this {{anatomical}} region, {{most commonly}} benign tumors like pituitary adenomas or craniopharyngiomas, and to surgical or radiation-based treatments of these tumors.

The resulting pituitary hormone deficiencies may lead to severe clinical consequences with significant morbidity and often increased mortality despite recent therapeutic improvements. The large observational studies launched for the follow-up of patients treated by growth hormone have provided valuable epidemiological data. In recent years, new aetiologies of acquired hypopituitarism have been reported such as hypophysitis following targeted anticancer immune therapies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of bioarchaeological analysis of the late mediaeval (13 th- 14 th century) skeletal sample from Koprivno, southern Croatia. Skeletal remains of 21 individuals (eight males, nine females, and four subadults) were examined for the possible presence of dental pathologies (caries and alveolar bone diseases), subadult stress indicators (cribra orbitalia and dental enamel hypoplasia), degenerative osteoarthritis of the vertebrae and major joints, Schmorl’s nodes on vertebrae, periostitis, and bone trauma. The analysed sample is characterised by high frequency of alveolar bone disease, most probably as a result of somewhat longer average life span (around 41 years) and very poor oral hygiene, while the data concerning dental caries indicate mixed diet evenly based on meat and cereals. High frequencies of cribra orbitalia, dental enamel hypoplasia and periostitis suggest frequent episodes of physiological stress (hunger, epidemics of infectious diseases) which is in accordance with historical data. Distribution and prevalence of <b>cranial</b> <b>traumas</b> strongly suggest a relatively high degree of interpersonal violence in the analysed community...|$|R

40|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} {{conducted in the}} 13 th century cemetery of the Church of S.

The skull, belonging to an adult male, shows two traumatic lesions produced by bladed instruments. The first lesion, located on the anterior part of the parietal bones, involved only the outer cranial table; bone remodeling indicates that the individual survived the injury for a long time. The second lesion, located on the frontal bone, involved all {{the thickness of the}} bone; the absence of reparative processes allows a diagnosis of peri mortem lesion. In order to treat this wound the patient was submitted to a surgical intervention.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine differences between the United States-based NASS and CIREN and Australia-based ANCIS databases in occupant-, crash-, and vehicle-related parameters for AIS 4 + head injuries in motor vehicle crashes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine roles of the change in velocity (DV), crash type (frontal, far-side, nearside, rear impact), seatbelt use, and occupant position, gender, age, stature, and body mass in <b>cranial</b> <b>traumas.</b> Belted and unbelted non-ejected occupant (age > 16 years) data from 1997 – 2006 were used for the NASS and CIREN datasets, and 2000 – 2010 for ANCIS. Vehicle model year, and occupant position and demographics including body mass index (BMI) data were obtained. Injuries were coded using AIS 1990 – 1998 update. Similarities were apparent across all databases: mean demographics were close to the mid-size anthropometry, mean BMI was in the normal to overweight range, and representations of extreme variations were uncommon. Side impacts contributed to over one-half of the ensemble, implying susceptibility to head trauma in this mode. Odds of sustaining head injury increased by 4 % per unit increase in DV (OR: 1. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 03 – 1. 04, p< 0. 001; adjusted for other variables); one-half for belted compared to unbelted occupants (OR: 0. 48, 95 % CI: 0. 37 – 0. 61, p< 0. 001); nearside, then far-side had significantly higher odds than frontal, and no difference by gender or position (front-left, front-right).

40|$|Death due to <b>cranial</b> blunt force <b>trauma</b> is a {{major issue}} not just in South Africa but worldwide. The vast {{majority}} of studies conducted on <b>cranial</b> blunt force <b>trauma</b> have analysed trauma to the frontal portion of the head. This {{is due to the}} involvement of the frontal portion of the head in automotive accidents. The lateral portion of the head is however no less important and is often impacted during homicidal assault. In cases involving <b>cranial</b> blunt force <b>trauma,</b> a common question asked of experts relates to the amount of force involved with a particular trauma. The goal of forensic science in general is to provide objective, repeatable results. At present, however, answering this question relies on a subjective rating scale of mild, moderate or severe force. Determining the severity of the force is also subjective, in that it relies heavily on the experience of the expert. Forensic anthropology by its nature is often subjective; however {{there is a need to}} move away from conducting analyses based predominantly on the experience of the investigator. With this in mind, this dissertation offers background information on fracture mechanics and impact biomechanics and provides a current review of the literature surrounding lateral impact to the skull. The research conducted as part of this dissertation attempts to quantify the force and energy involved with lateral impact to the skull due to a blow by a hammer, as well as describes the wound morphology associated with such impacts. Human tissue for experimentation is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire. There is therefore a need to determine suitable models for use in such testing. In the current study whole porcine heads were impacted on the fronto-parietal portion of the cranium. Half of the specimens were impacted with an implement resembling the shape and weight of a hammer. These hammer tests were conducted primarily to determine the type of trauma associated with such impacts and determine if a correlation exists between velocity or energy of impact and the level of trauma sustained. The remaining specimens were impacted with a Hopkinson pressure bar of the same diameter as the striker in the hammer tests. The Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus allows for the determination of the force of impact. The use of the Hopkinson pressure bar to determine fracture forces in whole specimens is novel. The fracture forces obtained in the current study agree considerably with the literature previously published on lateral, <b>cranial</b> blunt force <b>trauma</b> to both human and porcine specimens. The fractures produced, however, are atypical and may indicate a need to conduct further tests on other animal models...|$|R
40|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} {{carried out in}} 2007 in the Medieval cemetery of the Church of S. Agostino in Poggibonsi, Tuscany (Italy), a collective tomb was investigated. The large funerary structure, which contained the skeletal remains of 24 individuals, is dated back to the 13 th century. A skull, belonging to an adult male, was found among the skeletal remains showing evidences of two head lesions produced by bladed instruments. The first consists in a linear wound that involved only the outer cranial table of parietal bones; bone remodeling indicates that the individual survived the injury for a long time. The second {{is located on the}} right portion of the frontal squama and involves all the thickness of the bone with clean and well-defined margins; the absence of any traces of reparative processes and signs of healing allows a diagnosis of peri mortem lesion. Only the triangular extremities of this injury can be recognized because the central portion of the wound is obliterated by an oval bone loss, 3 x 2 cm, characterized by clean cutting-edges along the outer cranial table, whereas the margins of the inner cranial table are irregulars. In order to treat this lesion, the patient was submitted to a surgical intervention, probably performed to clean the wound and remove any bone splinters. Trepanation performed to treat <b>cranial</b> <b>traumas</b> was described in detail by several medical classic and medieval Authors, whose texts were available in the 13 th century. In particular, the surgeon from Poggibonsi had access to the medical literature and he probably followed the prescriptions of the surgical texts, such as that of Albucasis, {{which was one of the}} most famous during the Middle Ages.

Despite the overall trauma prevalence being similar between the sexes when not differentiated by age, the null hypothesis was rejected. Key differences that occurred between the sexes were that males suffered greater malintent and occupational traumas, whereas osteoporosis was the major contributor to trauma in older females. This is reflected in the age trends as males had a more linear pattern, while the female pattern peaks in the oldest age cohort. The research supports the conclusions that all studies of trauma should stratify samples by age and sex and investigate trauma using the individual as the unit of measure rather than separate skeletal elements...|$|R
