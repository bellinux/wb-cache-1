5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> According to a report, this may have accelerated the retreat of glaciers in Europe which otherwise may have continued to expand until approximately the year 1910.|$|E
5|$|Living mammal species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by the {{presence}} of sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a simple}} change-point {{model with a}} binary regressor. We examine the {{consistency}} of the change-point estimator when the regressor is subject to misclassification. It is found that the time of change <b>can</b> always <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> Further, special cases where the structural parameters <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>are</b> discussed.

5|$|The {{degree to}} which the {{character}} of Alice <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as Alice Liddell is controversial. Some critics identify the character as Liddell, or write that she inspired the character. Others argue that Carroll considered his protagonist and Liddell to be separate. According to Carroll, his character was not based on any real child, but was entirely fictional.|$|E
5|$|The {{third party}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by name or {{as a member}} of a {{particular}} group, and does not need to exist when the contract was made. The Act specifically excludes certain types of contract, such as contracts for the transport of goods across national lines, as these fall under international trade laws.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} orientations for {{the choice}} of design management <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> in companies. These orientations influence the perception of management and the responsibility of design managers within the organisation.

5|$|A revival <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by the {{dedication}} of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by their color, {{the time of}} year when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E

5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of {{different species of}} flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

5|$|Many booklet stamps <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by one non-{{perforated}} edge, {{though a}} few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as a Miniopterus on {{the basis}} of the {{possession}} of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared to living Miniopterus, the cingulum (shelf) that surrounds the P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E

40|$|We report {{data on the}} {{luminescence}} spectra {{associated with}} photochromic centers in X-ray irradiated calcium fluoride crystals doped with Lu ions. Irradiation in low energy photochromic centers absorption band excites emission, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identify</b> with transitions into photochromic centers. Ab initio calculation of absorption spectrum of photochromic center agrees rather well with experimental data...|$|R
5|$|Polyphaga is {{the largest}} suborder, {{containing}} more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including rove beetles (Staphylinidae), scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), blister beetles (Meloidae), stag beetles (Lucanidae) and true weevils (Curculionidae). These polyphagan beetle groups <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> {{by the presence of}} cervical sclerites (hardened parts of the head used as points of attachment for muscles) absent in the other suborders.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} the genus Lactarius are also similar: The {{tropical}} African Lactarius chromospermus has a superficial resemblance to L.volemus, but the former species, {{in addition to its}} African distribution, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the Russulaceae. Lactarius subvelutinus is also similar to L.volemus, but lacks the fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
