40|$|The {{need for}} {{lightweight}} crush resistant structures has inspired researchers to conduct both experimental and numerical studies on axial crush characteristics of aluminium tubes {{as well as}} polymer matrix composite tubes. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} hybrid tubes containing a composite overwrap over an aluminium tube have higher energy absorption than either aluminium or composite tubes. However, the published research on hybrid tubes was limited in scope and the beneficial effect of combining composite and aluminium has not been fully investigated. The objective of this research was to conduct a systematic numerical study on the axial crush characteristics of both square aluminium and square aluminium-composite hybrid tubes over a wide range of design parameters, such as triggering mechanism, aluminium tube thickness, overwrap thickness and fiber orientation angle in the overwrap. The numerical models were developed using LS-DYNA and validated using the experimental data available on aluminium and aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. The parametric study involved both aluminium and aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. It was shown that the transition from symmetric to asymmetric folding pattern occurred at lower aluminium tube thickness when a composite overwrap was used on the aluminium tube. For the aluminium-composite hybrid tubes, the folding initiation force, mean <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> and energy absorbed of the hybrid tubes were significantly higher than those of the aluminium tubes. These three crush resistance parameters depended on overwrap thickness as well as fiber orientation angle. As the fiber orientation angle increased toward the loading path, the mean <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> decreased linearly. The contribution of this research is {{in the development of a}} numerical technique for modeling quasi-static crushing aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. In addition, parametric studies were conducted using the aforementioned design parameters. Empirical equations were developed to predict the mean <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> of aluminium-composite hybrid tubes, which would be beneficial in designing crush-resistant structural members.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} a {{study on}} the multi-scale modeling and optimization of lightweight aluminum front rails for automotive crashworthiness applications. This research is aimed to enhance the crashworthiness characteristics of aluminum front crush rail for mass-production mid-size vehicles. Understanding the performance of these components during a collision is critical to the successful implementation of aluminum into crashworthiness applications. Accurate simulation of energy absorption structures during crush is a challenging task due to large and various strain paths that the structure undergoes during collapse. Material anisotropy that is introduced from manufacturing presents an additional complexity that affects the deformation development. Furthermore, current methods that predict a material's initial microstructure and the evolution are not feasible in a component-scale simulation due to current computational limitations. Thus, new knowledge in optimization with advanced constitutive modeling for crashworthiness is required. In this thesis, optimization techniques, using artificial intelligence techniques (neural networks, genetic algorithms, and adaptive simulated annealing) are used to study and identify elastic-plastic characteristics that are best suited for energy absorption in axial crush. New definitions and analytical equations for crush efficiency and energy absorption are developed and calibrated with the axial crush simulations to develop a framework for optimal material selection for axial crush. This work shows that the yield stress increases the energy absorption, peak <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> and steady state <b>crush</b> <b>force,</b> while tending to decrease the crush efficiency. Lightweight alloys with a low yield stress that have significant work hardening capabilities outperform materials with a high yield stress and low work hardening in terms of energy absorption when a constraint is imposed on the peak crushing force. The effects of anisotropy on the axial crush response are studied using advanced phenomenological constitutive models. Dynamic crush simulations of tubes are performed using different yield surface shapes calibrated to the same experimental anisotropy. Simulations of axial crush show that the yield surface shape affects the collapse mode and predicted energy absorption characteristics of the crush tube. The analysis indicates that the deformation is predominately controlled by balanced biaxial deformation. However, characterization of both the plane strain and pure shear points on the yield surface for energy absorption are also important. The shape and the area of the yield function governs the loading condition, which dictates the deformation and energy absorption. A novel framework for structural optimization is developed to design an optimized front rail that maximizes crash energy absorption characteristics. The new design is coupled with material and process development to provide a component with superior energy absorption and strength characteristics that are commercially sustainable. Simulations are compared to the dynamic crush results for this new design. The size of the structure is optimized using the response surface methodology to enhance the specific energy absorption (SEA) of the structure. An analytical relationship that relates the SEA function to the crush efficiency is derived to show that a single optimization function parameter may be sufficient for mass minimization. The new optimization framework can increase the mean <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> and energy absorption by 21. 9 % and 26. 7 % more energy absorption than baseline geometries. Coupling the optimization framework with advanced constitutive models to can further enhance the energy absorption characteristics energy absorption and mean <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> of + 4. 2 % and + 2. 5 % respectively. Relaxing mass constraints, combined with anisotropic yield functions, can enhance SEA by + 10 %. Finally, a framework for multi-scale modeling that bridges crystal plasticity to phenomenological plasticity is developed to study the significance of microstructural evolution on the enhancement of aluminum structures. Crystal plasticity is used to calibrate yield functions and microstructural evolution through the phenomenological-based texture evolution (PBTE) model. Simulations show that microstructural evolution can impact localization behaviour and ultimately, the energy absorption behaviour of the structure. The results of this thesis highlight the importance of coupling mechanical properties, such as initial anisotropy, microstructure evolution and flow stress behaviour with optimization of axial crush rails...|$|E

Such information is vital in the design of polymer composite sandwich structures as energy absorbers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|A severe {{crush injury}} to the hand is devastating to patients. Under {{conditions}} in which the <b>crush</b> <b>force</b> is too great, the digits are not viable candidates for replantation. We present two {{cases in which the}} patients suffered from loss of the thumb ray at the first carpometacarpal joint and skin defect at the radial side. The tendons, radial nerve and metacarpal bone of the index fi nger were injured, and the second metacarpal head was retained. There was a comminuted fracture of the trapezium in both patients. The treatment protocols consisted of the index finger pollicization and the free anterolateral thigh flap transfer. The procedure was performed in a single operation. The new thumb is able to provide a stable post for pinch and grip after six months follow-up. Both patients were satisfi ed with the function and appearance of the reconstructed thumb.

40|$|The current paper {{describes}} an apparatus for full-scale vehicle crash test experimentation. This apparatus {{is referred to}} as the harp. In brief, the harp may either accelerate a trolley which is impacted into a test vehicle or the test vehicle itself may be accelerated and impacted into an object such as a barrier, a pole, or another vehicle. If a trolley is accelerated, it is equipped with load cells to record the axial <b>crushing</b> <b>force.</b> If a test vehicle is accelerated, it is equipped with a three-axis accelerometer to record the <b>crushing</b> <b>force.</b> At the impact site, high-speed cameras and instrumentation record vital data during the crash...|$|R
