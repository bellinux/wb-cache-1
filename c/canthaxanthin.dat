5|$|Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, <b>canthaxanthin</b> and adonirubin, are {{responsible}} for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.|$|E

50|$|<b>Canthaxanthin</b> is {{not found}} in wild Atlantic Salmon, but is a minor {{carotenoid}} in Pacific Salmon. <b>Canthaxanthin</b> is used in farm-raised trout. <b>Canthaxanthin</b> is used in combination with astaxanthin for some salmon feeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Canthaxanthin</b> is most {{commonly}} used as a color additive in certain foods. Although the FDA has approved the use of <b>canthaxanthin</b> in food, it does not approve its use as a tanning agent. When used as a color additive, only very small amounts of <b>canthaxanthin</b> are necessary. As a tanning agent, however, much larger quantities are used. After <b>canthaxanthin</b> is consumed, it is deposited throughout the body, including in the layer of fat below the skin, which turns an orange-brown color. These types of tanning pills {{have been linked to}} various side effects, including hepatitis and <b>canthaxanthin</b> retinopathy, a condition in which yellow deposits form in the retina of the eye. Other side effects including damage to the digestive system and skin surface have also been noted. The FDA withdrew approval for use of <b>canthaxanthin</b> as a tanning agent, and has issued warnings concerning its use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Canthaxanthin</b> is {{a potent}} lipid-soluble antioxidant. The {{biological}} functions of <b>canthaxanthin</b> are related, at least in part, to its ability to function as an antioxidant (free radical scavenging/vitamin E sparing) in animal tissues.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the safety of}} <b>canthaxanthin</b> as a feed and a food {{additive}} was drawn into question {{as a result of}} a completely un-related use of the same carotenoid. A reversible deposition of <b>canthaxanthin</b> crystals was discovered in the retina of a limited number of people who had consumed very high amounts of <b>canthaxanthin</b> via sun-tanning pills - after stopping the pills, the deposits disappeared and the health of those people affected was fully recovered. However, the level of <b>canthaxanthin</b> intake in the affected individuals was many times greater than that which could ever be consumed via poultry products - to reach a similar intake, an individual would have to eat daily more than 50 eggs produced by layers fed practical levels of <b>canthaxanthin</b> in their diets. Moreover, it was demonstrated by Hueber et al. that ingestions of <b>canthaxanthin</b> cause no long-term adverse effects, and that the phenomenon of crystal deposition on the retina is reversible and does not result in morphological changes. Although this incidence was totally unrelated and very different from the feed or food use of <b>canthaxanthin,</b> as a link had been drawn between <b>canthaxanthin</b> and human health, it was important that the use of <b>canthaxanthin</b> as a feed and food additive should be reviewed in detail by the relevant authorities, both in the EU and at an international level. The first stage of this review process was completed in 1995 with the publication by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for <b>canthaxanthin</b> of 0.03 mg/kg bodyweight. The work of JECFA was subsequently reviewed and accepted within the EU by the SCF (EU Scientific Committee for Food) in 1997. The conclusion of both these committees was that <b>canthaxanthin</b> is safe for humans. Recently (2010), the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient sources added to food (ANS) published a revised version of the safety assessment of <b>Canthaxanthin,</b> reconfirming the already set ADI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no [...] "tanning pills" [...] approved for sale in the United States. In spite of this, there are companies that continue to market such products, some of which contain <b>canthaxanthin.</b> The FDA considers such items [...] "adulterated cosmetics" [...] and as a result sent [...] "Warning Letters" [...] to the firms citing such products as containing [...] "a color additive that is unsafe within the meaning of section 721(a) of the FD&C Act (FD&C Act, sec. 601(e))." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{characteristics of}} <b>canthaxanthin</b> {{have been studied}} {{by a number of}} authors and experiments have shown that the presence of <b>canthaxanthin</b> can potentially help to reduce oxidation in a number of tissues including broiler meat and the chick embryo.

5000|$|Astaxanthin [...] is a keto-carotenoid. It {{belongs to}} a larger class of {{chemical}} compounds known as terpenes (in Asthaxanthin's case, a tetraterpenoid); terpenes are built from five carbon precursors; isopentenyl diphosphate (or IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (or DMAPP).

5000|$|... 3'-Hydroxyechinenone is a keto-carotenoid pigment {{found in}} {{cyanobacteria}} and microalgae. Carotenoids {{belong to a}} larger class of phytochemicals known as terpenoids.

50|$|Like the American flamingo, their pink {{color is}} diet-derived, {{consisting}} of the carotenoid pigment <b>canthaxanthin.</b> Another carotenoid, astaxanthin, {{can also be found}} deposited in flight and body feathers.

50|$|There are 0.032 mg/g of {{carotenoids}} in {{the body}} of Semisulcospira libertina (shell exclude).

50|$|The cost of {{astaxanthin}} production, high commercial {{price and}} lack of a leading fermentation production systems, combined with the shortfalls of chemical synthesis mean that research into alternative fermentation production methods has been carried out. Metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to create biological systems {{for the production of}} a specific target compound. The metabolic engineering of bacteria (Escherichia coli) recently allowed production of astaxanthin at >90% of the total carotenoids, providing the first engineered production system capable of efficient astaxanthin production. Astaxanthin biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via either zeaxanthin or <b>canthaxanthin.</b> Historically, it has been assumed that astaxanthin biosynthesis proceeds along both routes. However, recent work has suggested that efficient biosynthesis may, in fact, proceed from beta-carotene to astaxanthin via zeaxanthin. The production of astaxanthin by metabolic engineering, in isolation, will not provide a suitable alternative to current commercial methods. Rather, a bioprocess approach should be adopted. Such an approach would consider fermentation conditions and economics, as well as downstream processing (extraction). Carotenoid extraction has been studied extensively, for example, the extraction of <b>canthaxanthin</b> (a precursor to astaxanthin) was studied within an E. coli production process demonstrating that extraction efficiency was increased substantially when two solvents, acetone and methanol, were used sequentially rather than as a combined solution.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} astaxanthin as an additive {{for fish}} feed {{only as a}} component of a stabilized color additive mixture.

The color additives astaxanthin, ultramarine blue, <b>canthaxanthin,</b> synthetic iron oxide, dried algae meal, Tagetes meal and extract, and corn endosperm oil are approved for specific uses in animal foods. Haematococcus algae meal (21 CFR 73.185) and Phaffia yeast (21 CFR 73.355) for use in fish feed to color salmonoids were added in 2000.|$|E
50|$|In {{the home}} {{aquarium}} {{they should be}} fed according to the same nutritional principles as other African Cichlids. Namely: Tubifex worms should never be offered, as they can cause fatal systemic bacterial diseases. High protein diets or diets that exclude vegetable matter should be avoided. The fish should be fed {{as much as they}} can consume in five minutes, and overfeeding should be avoided. A weekly fast day can be beneficial, as it allows the intestinal tract to be purged. Finally, Lamprologus ocellatus are similar to other African Cichlids in that their coloring will benefit from a diet containing quantities of beta-carotene and <b>canthaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is of {{note that}} kidney {{dysfunction}} {{in general is}} associated with hypercarotenemia {{as a result of}} decreased excretion of carotenoids. Liver dysfunction, regardless of origin, causes hypercarotenemia {{as a result of the}} impaired conversion of carotenoids to retinol. This is of particular interest because jaundice and carotenoderma can coexist in the same patient. Anorexia nervosa causes carotenoderma mainly through diets that are rich in carotenoids and the associated hypothyroidism. It tends to be more common in the restricting subtype of this disease, and is associated with numerous other dermatologic manifestations, such as brittle hair and nails, lanugo-like body hair, and xerosis. Although Alzheimer's disease has been associated with carotenoderma in some reports, most studies on serum carotenoids in these patients show that their levels of carotenoids and retinol are depressed, and may be associated with the development of dementia. A true association between Alzheimer's disease and carotenoderma is unclear at this time. There have been case reports in the literature of increased serum carotenoids and carotenoderma that is unresponsive to dietary measures, with a genetic defect in carotenoid metabolic enzymes proposed. <b>Canthaxanthin</b> and astaxanthin are naturally occurring carotenoids that are used in the British and US food industry to add color to foods such as sausage and fish. <b>Canthaxanthin</b> has been used in over-the-counter “tanning pills” in the United States and Europe, but is not currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this purpose in the United States because of its adverse effects. These include hepatitis, urticaria, aplastic anemia, and a retinopathy characterized by yellow deposits and subsequent visual field defects.|$|E
5000|$|Plants, in general, contain six {{ubiquitous}} carotenoids: neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein and β-carotene. Lutein is {{a yellow}} pigment found in {{fruits and vegetables}} and is the most abundant carotenoid in plants. Lycopene is the red pigment responsible for the color of tomatoes. Other less common carotenoids in plants include lutein epoxide (in many woody species), lactucaxanthin (found in lettuce), and alpha carotene (found in carrots). [...] In cyanobacteria, many other carotenoids exist such as <b>canthaxanthin,</b> myxoxanthophyll, synechoxanthin, and echinenone. Algal phototrophs such as dinoflagellates use peridinin as a light harvesting pigment.While carotenoids can be found complexed within chlorophyll-binding proteins such as the photosynthetic reaction centers and light-harvesting complexes, they also are found within dedicated carotenoid proteins such as the orange carotenoid protein of cyanobacteria.|$|E
50|$|Weedon, in {{collaboration}} with L. M. Jackman, {{was the first to}} use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structures of carotenoids. He also worked on the synthesis of carotenoids and in 1953 described the synthesis of methylbixin which was produced by exposing bixin from Bixa orellana to iodine, later he successfully synthesised bixin using the Wittig reaction. During the 1960s and 1970s, Weedon's research group elucidated the structures of and synthesised a wide range of naturally occurring carotenoids. These included, <b>canthaxanthin</b> (responsible for the pink colour of flamingos), astaxanthin (responsible for the colour of lobsters), capsanthin and capsorubin (found in red peppers), renieratene (from Japanese sea sponges) and fucoxanthin (the most abundant carotenoid found in seaweed). Other compounds whose structures were discovered include alloxanthin, mytiloxanthin, decaprenoxanthin and violerythrin.|$|E
