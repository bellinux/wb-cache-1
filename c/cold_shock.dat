A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown.

40|$|The nuclear phenotypes of Malpighian tubule {{cells in}} fifth instar nymphs of Triatoma infestans, {{one of the}} most {{important}} vectors of Chagas disease, were studied following sequential shocks at 0 degrees C, separated by intervals of 8 h and 24 h at 30 degrees C, under conditions of moderate fasting and full nourishment. The insects pertained to colonies reared in the laboratory and originated from domestic specimens collected in the Brazilian states of São Paulo (north) and Minas Gerais (south). Since nuclear phenotypes in this species are affected by single <b>cold</b> <b>shocks,</b> it was expected that these phenotypes could also be changed by sequential shocks. Nuclear phenotypes indicative of mechanisms of cell survival (nuclear fusion and heterochromatin decondensation) and cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) were observed concomitantly in all the conditions tested. Nuclear fusion and heterochromatin decondensation were not found relevant for the presumed acquisition of the cold-hardening response in T. infestans. The decreased frequency of apoptosis and necrosis following sequential <b>cold</b> <b>shocks</b> including under fasting conditions, indicated that tolerance to sequential <b>cold</b> <b>shocks</b> occurred in T. infestans of the mentioned origin...|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} of the starter culture is then slowly reduced, often by the graduated addition of must to get within 5–10°C (41–50°F) of the must that the culture will be added to. This is done to avoid the sudden <b>cold</b> <b>shock</b> that the yeast cells may experience if the starter culture was added directly to the must itself which can kill up to 60% of the culture. Additionally, surviving cells exposed to <b>cold</b> <b>shock</b> tend to see an increase in hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E

The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|E

2500|$|The actual {{cause of}} death in cold or very cold water is usually lethal bodily {{reactions}} to increased heat loss and to freezing water, rather than any loss of core body temperature. Of those who die after plunging into freezing seas, around 20% die within 2 minutes from <b>cold</b> <b>shock</b> (uncontrolled rapid breathing and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic), another 50% die within 15 – 30 minutes from cold incapacitation (loss of use and control of limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core), and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time.

2500|$|Chang's {{body of work}} in {{mammalian}} fertilisation is {{vast and}} appears in nearly 350 publications. [...] One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. [...] Chang found that at a temperature of 13°C or lower, the membrane structure and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. [...] This phenomenon is now commonly known as <b>cold</b> <b>shock.</b> [...] Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation {{on the relationship between}} the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. [...] It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being {{a very large number of}} available sperm in the fertilisation process. [...] Chang found that it was actually the physiological structure of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. [...] He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. [...] The process of capacitation, the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also amongst one of Chang's major discoveries. [...] This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose capacitation if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to produce triploid offspring of O. niloticus, applying warm thermic shocks (41 A- 42 oC) to eggs during 3, 5 - 4 min., 3, 5 mino after fertilization, or <b>cold</b> <b>shocks</b> (10, 8 - 11, 3 oC) to oocytes during one hour, 5 min after their fertilization. The best tissue to confirm triploids was kidney and brain of larvae and alevines. Then, the survival of fertilized eggs and growth rate were determined. The results show that the warm and <b>cold</b> <b>shocks</b> are efficient to produce 100 % triploids, with different rates of survival. Also, that 25, 5 % oftspring was deformed when <b>cold</b> <b>shocks</b> were applyed, and 32, 5 % deformities with warm shocks. There were not significant difterences in growth between triploid and diploid populationsafter three months of age. La triploidía se obtuvo aplicando choques térmicos calientes (41. 4 - 42 OC) a oocitos durante 3. 5 - 4 minutos, 3. 5 min. después de la fertilización, y choques térmicos fríos (10. 8 - 11. 3 oC) a oocitos durante una hora, 5 minutos de su fertilización. La triploidía se comprobó por análisis cromosomal en larvas y alevinos. Luego se monitoreó la tasa de crecimiento y sobrevivencia de los huevos fertilizados.

In pursuit of his ruthless plot against our island home, the terrible President had learnt not only English, but all the dialects at a moment's notice to win over a Lancashire merchant or seduce a Northumberland Fusilier.

Carley dropped her eyes. But she could not shake off the feeling that wherever she moved this man's gaze followed her. The unpleasantness of this incident would have been nothing to Carley had she at once forgotten it. Most unaccountably, however, she could not make herself unaware of this ruffian's attention. It did no good for her to argue that she was merely the cynosure of all eyes. This Ruff's tone and look possessed something heretofore unknown to Carley. Once she was tempted to tell Glenn. But that would only cause a fight, so she kept her counsel. She danced again, and helped Flo entertain her guests, and passed that door often; and once stood before it, deliberately, with all the strange and contrary impulse so inscrutable in a woman, and never for a moment wholly lost the sense of the man's boldness. It dawned upon her, at length, that the singular thing about this boldness was its difference from any, which had ever before affronted her. The fool's smile meant that he thought she saw his attention, and, understanding it perfectly, had secret delight in it. Many and various had been the masculine egotisms which had come under her observation. But quite beyond Carley was this brawny sheep dipper, Haze Ruff. Once the party broke up and the guests had departed, she instantly forgot both man and incident.|$|E
