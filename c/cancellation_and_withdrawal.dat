40|$|Customer-side {{influences}} on insurance {{have been relatively}} ignored in the literature. Using the household as the unit of analysis, {{this article focuses on}} the behavior of households having multiple policies of different types with the same insurance company, and who cancel their first policy. How long after the household's cancellation of the first policy does the insurer have to retain the customer and avoid customer defection on all policies to the competition? And, what customer characteristics are associated with customer loyalty? Using logistic regression and survival analysis techniques, an assessment is made of the probability of total customer <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>and</b> the length of time between first <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> subsequent customer <b>withdrawal.</b> Using a European database spanning 54 months of household multiple policyholder behavior, the results show that cancellation of one policy is a very strong indicator that other household policies will be canceled. Further, the insurer can have time to react to retain the customer after the first cancellation, however, this time is significantly dependent on the method used to contact the company, household demographics, {{and the nature of the}} household's insurance policy portfolio. Surprisingly, core customers having three or more policies in addition to the canceled policy are more vulnerable to total defection on all policies than noncore customers. Further, the potential customer repelling effects of premium increases seem to wear out after 12 months. Strategic implications of the results are presented.

40|$|Abstract. When {{dealing with}} complex {{business}} processes (e. g., {{in the context}} of a workflow implementation or the configuration of some process-aware information system), it is important but sometimes difficult to determine whether a process contains any errors. <b>Cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins are important features that are common in many business processes. The presence of <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins makes it difficult to perform verification. Therefore, existing approaches and tools are typically restricted to process models without such features. In this paper, we explore verification techniques for processes with <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins. We present these techniques {{in the context of}} workflow language YAWL that provides direct support for these features. We have extended the graphical editor of YAWL with diagnostic features based in the results presented in this paper. The approach relies on reset nets and can easily be adapted to support other languages allowing for <b>cancellations</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins...|$|R

Although comparing the current legislation with the previous one is not {{the purpose of the}} thesis, such comparison is provided in several places. The purpose is to show the same or, conversely, different features of both, particularly in relation to the applicability of existing case law and doctrinal interpretation. The work consists of three main chapters that form a coherent wholes. The first chapter is devoted to the withdrawal of a member of a limited liability company and is further divided into several sub-chapters. It deals with the legal aspects of the withdrawal of a member under the Czech legislativ. It describes in detail the various reasons of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> also offers some suggestions de lege ferenda. The second chapter focuses on the exclusion of a shareholder of a limited liability company by the general meeting. It brings an analysis of legislation, describes the procedure of exclusion and analyzes the available case law. The third chapter, entitled "Termination of participation of a member of a limited liability company [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to acoustic echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection for a teleconferencing system including a loudspeaker for which an estimate of the loud-speaker impulse response is available. The approach is general {{in the sense that it}} may be applied to most existing acoustic echo can-cellation and doubletalk detection algorithms. We show that the new approach reduces the computational complexity for both the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> the doubletalk detection algorithms. Fur-thermore, the numerical examples show that the new approach also may increase the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection per-formances.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the usability of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips for individuals with mental retardation in Taiwan. This paper first described the current state of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> services in Taiwan to individuals with mental retardation. The person with mental retardation often tried hard to adapt himself/herself to the existing deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. This paper addressed the difficulties faced by users with mental retardation in comprehending the contents of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips. The investigation into the low usability showed no consideration for meeting the demand of users with mental retardation. Thus, this paper proposed a new design of the deposit <b>and</b> <b>withdrawal</b> slips that are adapted to users with mental retardation. The design approach was based on the principle of Universal Design. This paper finally offered some conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|R
