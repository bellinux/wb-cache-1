5|$|Apollonius' problem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to {{construct}} all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem {{corresponds to a}} special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, {{to construct}} circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.|$|E

5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E

An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons.

5|$|Apollonius' problem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> {{from the}} plane to the sphere and other {{quadratic}} surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical problem can be rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles.

5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to other, non-perfect, {{classes of}} graphs as well. For instance, {{in a circle}} graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, tessellations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to spaces {{other than}} the Euclidean plane. The Swiss {{geometer}} Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation {{to make it easy}} to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E

5|$|Similar results <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> from closed curves to {{unbounded}} curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if {{both sides}} of the curve have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the curve, with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (<b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> {{to three}} dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked {{in a regular}} crystal pattern to fill (or tile) {{three-dimensional}} space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E

5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers.

Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed.
