5000|$|When {{a vessel}} {{is subject to}} a heeling force (such as wind pressure), vessel {{buoyancy}} & beam of the hull will counteract the heeling force. A weighted keel provides additional means to right the boat. In some high-performance racing yachts, water ballast or the angle of a canting keel can be changed to provide additional righting force to counteract heeling. The crew may move their personal weight to the high (upwind) side of the boat, this is called hiking, which also changes the centre of gravity & produces a righting lever to reduce the degree of heeling. Incidental benefits include faster vessel speed caused by more efficient action of the hull & sails. Other options to reduce heeling include reducing exposed sail area & efficiency of the sail setting & a variant of hiking called [...] "trapezing". This can only be done if the vessel is designed for this, as in dinghy sailing. A sailor can (usually involuntarily) try turning upwind in gusts (it is known as rounding up). This can lead to difficulties in <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> if over-canvassed. Wind can be spilled from the sails by 'sheeting out', or loosening them. The number of sails, their size and shape can be altered. Raising the dinghy centreboard can reduce heeling by allowing more leeway.|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{high-speed}} crafts’ hydrodynamic coefficients {{will help to}} analyze the dynamics {{of these kinds of}} vessels and the factors affecting their dynamic stabilities. Also, it can be useful and effective in <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> instabilities. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the coefficients of longitudinal motions of a planing catamaran with and without a hydrofoil using RANS method to evaluate the foil effects on them. Determination of hydrodynamic coefficients by experimental approach is costly, and requires meticulous laboratory equipment; therefore, utilizing numerical methods and developing a virtual laboratory seems highly efficient. In the present study, the numerical results for hydrodynamic coefficients of a high-speed craft are verified against Troesch’s (1992) experimental results. In the following, after determination of hydrodynamic coefficients of a planing catamaran with and without foil, the foil effects on its hydrodynamic coefficients are evaluated. The results indicate that most of the coefficients are frequency independent especially at high frequencies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, construction and control systems development of <b>the</b> marine cybernetics <b>vessel</b> CS Saucer. CS Saucer is a fully actuated and highly controllable vessel with a spherically shaped hull, {{much like a}} flying saucer. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> is fitted with three azimuth thrusters which are driven by three Torpedo 800 motors. The embedded controller myRIO from National Instruments is used to <b>control</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> <b>The</b> system {{is powered by a}} three cell 11. 1 V Lithium Polymer battery. The hull of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> is constructed from three millimeter MDF sheeting, milled Divinycell foam and a woven carbon sheet fitted to the exterior of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> with epoxy. This results in a rigid and watertight hull with a low draft. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> has a detachable lid made of plexi glass that is secured to the top of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> with four butterfly screws. The drag forces acting on <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> have been analyzed through testing in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory (MC Lab) at NTNU. The results have been used to derive the parameters for a dynamic model used in Hardware-in- the-loop testing and for future model based <b>control</b> design. <b>The</b> forces produced by each of the thrusters have been mapped and approximated with linear curve fitting. This approximated force mapping has been used in the implemented thrust allocation with fixed thruster angles. Manual thruster control and manual force <b>control</b> of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> can be operated by the application on the host computer or directly from the Dashboard app from National Instruments available on Android and iOS devices. A dynamic positioning system has been implemented on the CS Saucer and tested in the MC Lab. The dynamic positioning system performs as desired when changing the setpoint for <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> position. A tentative path following controller has also been implemented and tested on <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> <b>The</b> completed CS Saucer is a fully functioning vessel and a stable and expandable platform for use in future demonstrations, projects and research at the MC Lab...|$|R
