5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard <b>crystalline</b> <b>basement</b> rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. This zone {{is a major}} land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian <b>crystalline</b> <b>basement.</b> Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, a period of mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, with a hard sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun Emplacement is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular flat area and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The Emplacement is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The Emplacement was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and recreational value.|$|E

The natural settings for hydrogen include hydrocarbon-bearing basins, young organic-rich sediments, coal beds, fault zones, extrusive igneous rocks, alkaline igneous complexes, geothermal fields, <b>crystalline</b> <b>basements,</b> potash-bearing strata, salt-bearing strata, and ultramafic rocks. The geologically controlled sources of natural H 2 can be grouped according to four main families of processes: (1) water hydrolysis processes (several processes that include the oxidation of ferrous minerals, radiolysis, cataclasis, and metamorphism); (2) organic matter decay (including thermal maturation); (3) methane and/or ammonia decomposition during metamorphism; and (4) deep Earth degassing. The alteration of Fe(II)-bearing minerals is the most commonly reported source of natural H 2 seepages on Earth, notably at mid-oceanic ridges and in ophiolitic massifs, where mafic and ultramafic are altered. Moreover, a recent study suggested that the H 2 production from the Precambrian continental lithosphere has been underestimated (Sherwood Lollar et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{introduces}} a new method for the mod-eling and inversion of magnetic anomalies caused by <b>crystalline</b> <b>basements.</b> The method {{is based on}} the 3 -D Cauchy-type inte-gral representation of the magnetic field. Traditional methods use volume integrals over the domains occupied by anomalous susceptibility and on the prismatic representation of the volumes with an anomalous susceptibility distribution. Such discretization is computationally expensive, particularly in 3 -D cases. The tech-nique of Cauchy-type integrals makes it possible to represent the magnetic field as surface integrals, which is particularly significant in solving problems of the modeling and inversion of magnetic data for the depth to the basement. In this letter, a novel method is proposed, which only requires discretizing the magnetic contrast surface for modeling and inversion. We demonstrate the method using several synthetic models. The results show that the new method is fast and capable of providing high-resolution depth estimation for the sediment–basement interface...|$|R

25|$|During the Mesozoic era (about 250 to 66 {{million years}} ago) a large ocean (Tethys Ocean), floored by oceanic {{lithosphere}} existed in-between the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia (which lay {{to the south}} and north respectively; Robertson & Dixon, 2006). This large oceanic plate was consumed at subduction zones (see subduction zone). At the subduction trenches the sedimentary rock layers that were deposited within the prehistoric Tethys Ocean buckled, were folded, faulted and tectonically mixed with huge blocks of <b>crystalline</b> <b>basement</b> rocks of the oceanic lithosphere. These blocks form a very complex mixture or mélange of rocks that include mainly serpentinite, basalt, dolerite and chert (e.g. Bergougnan, 1975). The Eurasian margin, now preserved in the Pontides (the Pontic Mountains along the Black Sea coast), is thought to have been geologically similar to the Western Pacific region today (e.g. Rice et al., 2006). Volcanic arcs (see volcanic arc) and backarc basins (see back-arc basin) formed and were emplaced onto Eurasia as ophiolites (see ophiolite) as they collided with microcontinents (literally relatively small plates of continental lithosphere; e.g. Ustaomer and Robertson, 1997). These microcontinents had been pulled away from the Gondwanan continent further south. Turkey is therefore made up from several different prehistorical microcontinents.|$|E
25|$|The Eiger {{does not}} {{properly}} {{form part of}} the main chain of the Bernese Alps, which borders the canton of Valais and forms the watershed between the Rhine and the Rhône, but constitutes a huge limestone buttress, projecting from the <b>crystalline</b> <b>basement</b> of the Mönch across the Eigerjoch. Consequently, {{all sides of the}} mountain feed the same river, the Lütschine, through the Weisse Lütschine on the west side (west face of the Eiger) and through the Schwarze Lütschine on the east side (north and east faces of the Eiger). Therefore, all the water running down the Eiger converges {{at the foot of the}} Männlichen in Zweilütschinen, 10km northwest of the summit, where the Lütschine proper begins its course to Lake Brienz and the Aare. Although the north face of the Eiger is almost free of ice, significant glaciers lie at the other sides of the mountain. The Eiger Glacier flows on the west side of the Eiger, from the crest connecting it to the Mönch down to 2,400 m, south of Eigergletscher railway station, and feeds the Weisse Lütschine, through the Trümmelbach. On the east side, the Eismeer (well visible from the windows of Eismeer railway station) flows from the Mönch down to 1,300 m through the Lower Grindelwald Glacier system, which feeds the Schwarze Lütschine.|$|E

40|$|Mars is {{the most}} Earth-like of the Solar System s planets, and {{the first place to}} look for any sign of present or past {{extraterrestrial}} life. Its surface shows many features indicative of the presence of surface and sub-surface water, while impact cratering and volcanism have provided temporary and local surface heat sources throughout Mars geologic history. Impact craters are widely used ubiquitous indicators for the presence of sub-surface water or ice on Mars. In particular, the presence of significant amounts of ground ice or water would cause impact-induced hydrothermal alteration at Martian impact sites. The realization that hydrothermal systems are possible sites for the origin and early evolution of life on Earth has given rise to the hypothesis that hydrothermal systems may have had the same role on Mars. Rough estimates of the heat generated in impact events have been based on scaling relations, or thermal data based on terrestrial impacts on <b>crystalline</b> <b>basements.</b> Preliminary studies also suggest that melt sheets and target uplift are equally important heat sources {{for the development of a}} hydrothermal system, while its lifetime depends on the volume and cooling rate of the heat source, as well as the permeability of the host rocks.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, MRS {{contribution}} to characterize aquifers in common conditions {{down to about}} 100 meters deep is highly valuable in rocks that exhibit hydraulic behaviour of non-consolidated aquifer at the sounding scale (e. g. sediments, weathered and fissured hard-rocks, densely fissured or highly interstitial porous carbonates). In rocks that exhibit behaviour of fractured aquifer (e. g. low density fractured <b>crystalline</b> <b>basements</b> and limestone, karsts) MRS is a useful complementary method but is not always effective for common engineering studies. In magnetic rocks MRS measurements are often impossible. On the one hand, field experiences reveal that MRS is useful to characterize aquifers. (1) The geometry of saturated aquifer can be estimated in 1 D case. Interpolation in-between 1 D soundings also reveals 2 D geometry if the size of MRS loops is smaller than about half the heterogeneity size. (2) Links between MRS water content and aquifer total porosity and storativity have been found. (3) The transmissivity is accurately estimated from MRS parameters in several geological contexts, using the appropriate conversion equation. (4) Thanks to the integrative property of the sounding, the spatial scale of measurement is considered by hydrogeologists as appropriate for aquifer characterization and modelling. (5) The aquifer characterization is improved when MRS {{is used in the}} framework of a hydrogeological methodology and jointly with complementary geophysical methods. On the other hand, field experiences reveal the main limitations encountered in the use of MRS with the actual instrumentation. (1) MRS is not yet self-sufficient to characterize aquifers as the MRS output parameters still need to be compared to hydrogeological properties to achieve quantitative estimation of transmissivity. Storage related parameters are not yet quantitatively accessible from MRS. (2) The electromagnetic noise lowers the signal to noise ratio and makes urban areas but also low interstitial porosity and poorly fractured rocks difficult to survey.

Hence, in an original way, the controlled source inversion has been performed by using a code dedicated to LET. After several tests to check the results trade-off with the inversion parameters, we build up a 3 -D a priori velocity model, in which the sea-bottom topography, the acoustic and the <b>crystalline</b> <b>basements</b> and the Moho interfaces have been considered. The reliability of the obtained features has been checked by checkerboard tests and also by their comparison with the deep-penetration multichannel seismic profiles, and with the wide-angle reflection and refraction modelled profiles. This study provides the first 3 -D view of the basement topography along the active North Anatolian fault beneath the Marmara Sea, even beneath the deepest part of three sedimentary basins of NMT. Clear basement depressions reaching down 6 km depth below the sea level (bsl) have been found beneath these basins. The North Imrali Basin located on the southern continental shelf is observed with a similar sedimentary thickness as its northern neighbours. Between Central and Cinarcik basins, the Central High rises up to 3 km depth below (bsl). Its crest position is offset by 10 km northwestward relatively to the bathymetric crest.

New La-ICPMS U-Pb ages from the Georgian basement provide further evidence for the derivation of the Transcaucasus and its western continuation (the eastern Pontides) from Gondwana. A migmatized granodiorite provides preserved magmatic zircon cores with an age of 474 ± 3 Ma, while the age of migmatization is constrained by its 343 ± 2 Ma metamorphic rims. Metamorphism is synchronous with widespread I-type granites that were emplaced at 335 ± 8 Ma in the neighbouring Dzirula massif, and in the eastern Pontides. These U-Pb ages are in close agreement with recently obtained Ar/Ar ages from biotites and muscovites from metamorphic schists and U-Pb ages ranging from 340 to 330 Ma in the Georgian basement. The narrow range of ages suggests that the Variscan LP-HT metamorphic event in the eastern Pontides and Georgia was of short duration and likely related to mantle-derived intrusives. Furthermore, we suggest that (1) rifting of the Pontides-Transcaucasus block (PTB) from Gondwana at 450 – 350 Ma could have been driven by roll-back of the south-dipping Rheic slab, (2) that the main metamorphic and coeval magmatic events are related to the accretion of the PTB to the Eurasian margin at c. 350 Ma, while the source of magmatism is ascribed to slab detachment of the south-dipping slab at 340 Ma and that (3) three subduction zones may have been contemporaneously active in the Tethyan domain during the Jurassic: (i) the Lesser Caucasus South Armenian Block (SAB) shares a similar Gondwana affinity, but bears younger ages for its MP-MT metamorphic evolution and calc-alkaline magmatism bracketed from 160 to 123 Ma; (ii) north-dipping subduction below the PTB from c. 210 Ma to 150 Ma; (iii) northward intra-oceanic subduction bracketed from 180 to 90 Ma between the SAB and the PTB...|$|R
