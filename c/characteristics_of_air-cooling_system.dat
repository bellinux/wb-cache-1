40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{operating}} cooling fluid, internal combustion engine cooling systems can be classified in two macro areas: <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> and liquid-cooling system. In four-stroke engines, liquid-cooling system is generally preferred to the <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> because <b>of</b> its efficiency in the engine heat dissipation. However, thanks to its simplicity, today the engine <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> is still widely used in the engine market, especially on two-stroke engine applications like small motorbike, light aircraft, and handheld products. To assure the necessary heat waste in air-cooled engines, the key point is the optimization of the air flow over the cylinder external surface. Air flow separation from cylinder external surface can result in high temperature gradients inside the cylinder volume causing destructive heat problem for the engine. It can be avoided only by a fine optimization of the cylinder fin design placed externally to the cylinder surface. To fulfil this need, the definition of specific methodology to evaluate the air-cooling effect on the engine is mandatory. In the present paper, the authors present a 3 D-CFD simulation methodology designed to perform a detailed evaluation of two-stroke air-cooled engines. The methodology was applied on two different engines equipping handheld brush-cutter machines. The optimization <b>of</b> the <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> such a machine is a very challenging task because the machine design must be very compact forcing all the engine parts to remain quite close each other. The simulation results are compared to experimental evidences in order to verify the validity of the proposed approach...|$|R
30|$|In our {{framework}} {{model of}} classification and integration, we propose a stacked structure, where upper layers need of lower layers {{to increase their}} attainable savings. Firstly, we consider the component enhancement as {{the base of the}} energy efficiency for the RAN (see Section 6). For this reason, we will name it component baseline layer (CB). The enhancement at this layer permits to relax the design constraint in order to facilitate the design in upper levels. This layer has a critical importance and new developments in internal components must be done for reducing the consumption and mitigate the losses into the BS. As we have seen that a great amount of work is being done around the power amplifier and the effort should continue toward this direction. The reduction of power amplifier consumption reduces the heat dissipated and additionally avoids the necessity <b>of</b> having <b>air-cooling</b> <b>systems</b> into the macroBS, which reduces even more the consumption. Future advances in photonics and optical networks will reduce the losses due to internal components interconnection and at the backhaul level infrastructure.|$|R

40|$|Battery thermal {{management}} {{is critical in}} achieving performance and the extended life of batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles under real-driving conditions. Appropriate modeling for predicting thermal behavior of battery systems in vehicles helps to make decisions for improved design and shortens the development process. For this paper, {{we looked at the}} impact of cooling strategies with air and direct/indirect liquid cooling. The simplicity <b>of</b> an <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> is an advantage over a liquid-cooling system. In addition to its intrinsically lower heat transfer coefficient, another disadvantage of air cooling is that the small heat capacity of air makes it difficult to accomplish temperature uniformity inside a cell or between cells in a module. Liquid-cooling is more effective in heat transfer and takes up less volume, but the added complexity and cost may outweigh the merits. The surface heat transfer coefficient, h, and the blower power for air cooling are sensitive to the hydraulic diameter of the cooling channel (Dh). However, because of the added thermal resistances, h evaluated at cell surface is not as sensitive to the variation of Dh in an indirect (water/glycol jacket) cooling system. Due to the high heat transfer coefficient at small Dh, direct liquid cooling using dielectric mineral oils may be preferred in spite of high pressure loss in certain circumstances such as in highly transient large heat generating battery <b>systems.</b> In general, <b>air-cooling</b> should be considered first, as the power demand increases with heavier vehicles and more aggressive driving, water/glycol jacket cooling should be considered next.

30|$|As already mentioned, great {{efforts are}} being made for the {{amplifier}} section, where different architectures and features have been proposed (Class J amplifier [14], switched mode power amplifier--SMPA [56], drain modulation technique [56], etc.). Such proposals promise higher efficiencies compared to pre-distorted Doherty amplifier [8, 22, 57], which is currently 45 - 50 %. These approaches have the common objective of reducing amplifier losses and increasing power efficiency, linearity and reducing the PAPR. More details on this approach {{can be found in}} the above-cited references and in [13]. On the other hand, some manufacturers claim that their state-of-art amplifiers can avoid the use <b>of</b> <b>air-cooling</b> as stated by FUJITSU for its Doherty pre-distorted power amplifier in [57]. This is also true for smaller BS equipment like femto or picoBSs, which do not need an air-cooling component as shown in the models presented in [21]. Therefore, avoiding using <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> in larger BS is a clear direction for fabricants. However, it is also possible to take benefit of heat produced by Power Amplifier. The study of [56] shows the work done on benefitting from heating by reutilising the heat generated by using a thermoelectric generator (TEG). Such a device transforms such heat into electricity by allowing some of the dissipated energy to be recovered.|$|R

40|$|As {{geothermal}} {{resources that}} are more expensive to develop are utilized for power generation, there will be increased incentive to use more efficient power plants. This {{is expected to be}} the case with Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) resources. These resources will likely require wells drilled to depths greater than encountered with hydrothermal resources, and will have the added costs for stimulation to create the subsurface reservoir. It is postulated that plants generating power from these resources will likely utilize the binary cycle technology where heat is rejected sensibly to the ambient. The consumptive use of a portion of the produced geothermal fluid for evaporative heat rejection in the conventional flash-steam conversion cycle is likely to preclude its use with EGS resources. This will be especially true in those areas where there is a high demand for finite supplies of water. Though they have no consumptive use <b>of</b> water, using <b>air-cooling</b> <b>systems</b> for heat rejection has disadvantages. These systems have higher capital costs, reduced power output (heat is rejected at the higher dry-bulb temperature), increased parasitics (fan power), and greater variability in power generation on both a diurnal and annual basis (larger variation in the dry-bulb temperature). This is an interim report for the task ‘Air-Cooled Condensers in Next- Generation Conversion Systems’. The work performed was specifically aimed at a plant that uses commercially available binary cycle technologies with an EGS resource. Concepts were evaluated that have the potential to increase performance, lower cost, or mitigate the adverse effects of off-design operation. The impact on both cost and performance were determined for the concepts considered, and the scenarios identified where a particular concept is best suited. Most, but not all, of the concepts evaluated are associated with the rejection of heat.

The conversion of conventional aircraft into more/all-electric one tends {{to be based on}} the installation of such innovative systems. A better understanding of problems related to fuel cells applied to aeronautics is sought by the European Commission funded project environmentally friendly intercity aircraft powered by fuel cells ENFICA-FC. The main objective of the ENFICA-FC project is to develop and to validate the use of a fuel-cell based power system for propulsion of an all-electric aircraft. The fuel-cell system will be installed in a light sport aircraft Rapid 200 that will be flown and performance tested as a proof of functionality and future applicability. Specific aspects have to be investigated in the onboard installation of the innovative system and new design indications have to be pointed out in order to fulfill the conversion. One of the key items under investigation is the simulation of existing cooling system and the evaluation of motor and fuel-cell temperature; the temperature has to be maintained within the limits established by manufacturers of critical systems during all likely operating conditions as indicated by aeronautic regulations for general aviation. The computational problem addressed in this paper is the numerical computational fluid dynamics CFD simulation <b>of</b> the existing <b>air-cooling</b> <b>system</b> that satisfies air request for cooling and venting.
