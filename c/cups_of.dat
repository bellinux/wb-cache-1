5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink.|$|E

5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E

5000|$|When {{cardinal}} utility is used, {{the magnitude}} of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, {{it can be concluded}} that the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice is better than the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea by exactly the same amount by which the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea is better than the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> water. One cannot conclude, however, that the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea is two thirds as good as the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the [...] "zero" [...] of utility. For example, if the [...] "zero" [...] of utility was located at -40, then a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea 120 utils more than zero.|$|R

5|$|The nesting and {{breeding}} biology of antbirds {{have not been}} well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated antbird was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more {{of the work in}} some species. Antbird nests are <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus Dysithamnus are all suspension nesters.|$|E

25|$|The UK Food Standards Agency has {{recommended}} that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, {{to less than}} 200mg of caffeine a dayâ€“ the equivalent of two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> instant coffee, or {{one and a half}} to two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300mg, or a little over two 8oz (237mL) <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee.|$|E
