D.), Department of Horticulture, Washington State UniversitySuppressing {{weeds and}} {{enhancing}} desirable plant establishment are important when installing or maintaining landscapes. Two woodchip mulches of different particle sizes and origin were applied at different depths to assess these two criteria in transplanted Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) in a historically weedy field. Arborist chips and chips {{made from recycled}} wood were used, in both coarse (1. 09 - 7. 62 cm) and fine (≤ 1. 09 cm) particle sizes, at depths of 10, 20, or 30 cm. Weed biomass was significantly affected by mulch depth; the average annual weed biomass collected was 59. 4 g/m 2 from non-mulched plots, and 10. 9, 2. 6, and 0. 5 g/m 2 from plots with 10, 20, and 30 cm of mulch, respectively. For two growing seasons, plant health was visually rated on a 1 - 5 scale (with 5 being the most healthy), and data were collected on plant height and trunk caliper. Douglas fir trees were significantly affected by particle size in both arborist and recycled wood chips, with increased health ratings, caliper, and height in the <b>coarser</b> <b>chip</b> mulch. Mean Douglas fir health ranged between 3. 4 − 3. 5 in <b>coarse</b> <b>chips</b> compared to 2. 4 − 2. 8 in fine chips. Mean Douglas fir caliper ranged between 8. 0 − 8. 2 mm in <b>coarse</b> <b>chips</b> and 4. 2 − 6. 5 mm in fine chips. Mean Douglas fir height increased in <b>coarse</b> <b>chips</b> by 19. 8 cm from year 1 to year 2, but only 4. 3 cm in fine chips. Snowberry was not significantly affected by either mulch treatment; given its aggressive spreading nature, this is not surprising. Ideally, wood chip mulches should be coarse (at least 1 cm) and deep (at least 20 cm) to both suppress weeds and enhance establishment of woody landscape plants.

5000|$|On 6 May 2010, the KP Chair {{reminded}} {{all participants}} {{that they should}} maintain vigilance to ensure that Marange diamonds comply with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The five-page notice also included photographs and descriptions of rough diamonds from the Marange fields: [...] "On first sight, strong 'gravel' impression resembling rounded pebbles in a riverbed. Look like tumbled and abraded <b>coarse</b> <b>chips</b> of broken beer bottles with colours ranging from dark brown to black to darkish green. Most surfaces are matt (sic) and dulled with rounded corners and edges. Broken surfaces display 'metallic-like' lustre." [...] The report also contains photographs showing Marange diamonds {{in various stages of}} processing, so they can be recognized if they are mixed in with a legitimate diamond export.|$|R
50|$|Smooth {{roads are}} {{preferred}} to <b>coarse</b> <b>chip</b> sealed roads, as coarse surfaces tend to wear rear wheels faster, create a rougher ride and even reduce drifting ability. Riders gather {{most of their}} momentum through gravity but many trike drifters choose to employ a freewheeling pedal front wheel, which makes for a more versatile trike. The freewheel hub allows the rider to obtain forward momentum but allows for coasting when not pedaling. Another means to gain initial momentum is {{to stand on the}} rear of the trike and to kick/push with one leg. Operating speeds for drift trikes generally range between 25-50 mph.Drift triking has become a recognized sport, with crews such as Drift Trikes Whangarei being sponsored by Red Bull. One {{of the biggest names in}} the drift trike sport is Triad Drift Trikes, which originates from Australia. Triad Drift trikes have been custom manufacturing drift trikes for over 3 years.|$|R
50|$|It {{was found}} that better strength, {{appearance}} and resin economy could be achieved by using more uniform, manufactured chips. Producers began processing solid birch, beech, alder, pine and spruce into consistent chips and flakes; these finer layers were then placed {{on the outside of}} the board, with its core composed of <b>coarser,</b> cheaper <b>chips.</b> This type of board is known as three-layer particleboard.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} in storing wood chips freshly harvested from short rotation plantations, which result in quality losses {{as well as}} in dry matter and energy losses. The factors influencing the degradation of raw material are examined in this paper with special focus on fungal development. An excessive growth of fungi is connected to dry matter losses and also to an increased health risk during raw material handling. The following factors were measured during 6 months storage of poplar wood chips depending on particle size: box temperature, moisture content, pH-value, appearance of fungi in the storage and the concentration of fungal particles in the air. The results show a close connection between particle size, temperature and attack of fungi. During the storage mesophilic and termophilic species of the genera Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium appeared. The concentration of fungal particles is the highest for fine chips and decreases in bigger particles. There was a special focus on the investigation of the properties of <b>coarse</b> <b>chips</b> (G 50), which represent a good compromise between handling, storage losses and health risk due to fungal development...|$|R
5000|$|Wood {{chips are}} a {{byproduct}} of the pruning of trees by arborists, utilities and parks; {{they are used to}} dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather <b>coarse</b> after <b>chipping</b> and tend {{to be used as a}} mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. The decay of freshly produced chips from recently living woody plants, consumes nitrate; this is often off set with a light application of a high-nitrate fertilizer. Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used to mulch trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors.|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} a mobile screening device for upgrading <b>coarse</b> wood <b>chips</b> to residential user standards, by removing oversize particles and fines. The machine was designed for transportation to forest landings, logistic terminals and plant chip yards. Average productivity was 1. 9 oven-dry tons (odt) h- 1, corresponding to a screening cost of 28. 5 €odt- 1. This figure was lower than the price increase obtained by upgrading industrial chips to residential user standards. Hence, screening offered a profit of 4. 7 €odt- 1, or 16 % of the original screening cost. The screening process was capable of upgrading chips from industrial to residential specifications, by reducing the incidence of oversize particles below the 1 % critical threshold. Screening also allowed a substantial reduction in the content of fines. A similar effect was not verified for crushed wood, which failed to meet the specifications for residential fuel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This project {{tested at}} the field scale, five on-site, {{non-proprietary}} bioremediation processes on weathered petroleum hydrocarbons from a fire fighter training area. Two bioremediation processes based on fungi (commercially produced white rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and aged, <b>coarse</b> wood <b>chips,</b> 'compost', with naturally occurring fungi) were applied with variations and compared to one control: a typical static biopile. An elevated-face compost turner was used to turn the soil in selected windrows for aeration. Statistically-based sampling was employed and quality control measures were enforced for sampling and analysis. The treatment options examined for the contaminated soil were: (1) white rot fungus and compost, (2) compost, poultry manure and turning, (3) compost, synthetic nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium fertilizer, and turning, (4) compost, the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning, and (5) the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning (static biopile). The compost and poultry manure process performed the best, remediating 35 tonnes of soil contaminated with 6000 mg/kg of mineral oil and grease (MOG) to the remediation criteria of 1000 mg/kg in 19 days and to less than 300 mg/kg in less than 56 days. The net rate of bioremediation was 100 mg/kg/day of MOG. The estimated cost of this process for commercial applications, excluding labour, excavation and site preparation, was $ 18 to $ 29 per tonne, depending {{on the cost of}} the poultry manure...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to provide coarse grain {{parallelism}} for the RAW <b>chip.</b> <b>Coarse</b> grain parallelism can be expressed by using instrumented function calls which are queued and executed on other processors. Function calls are reassigned to adjacent processors only. Subsequently, a computation tree is dynamically embedded into the processor mesh (Chapter 3). A C library interface was developed to provide this mechanism: applications can spawn function calls, and wait at synchronization points (Chapter 4). Two imple-mentations of the spawn interface were built {{as part of the}} thesis project: i) a system that runs on the RAW chip using interrupting messages to implement work scheduling and synchronization (Chapter 5); ii) a generic spawn library based on POSIX threads that uses shared memory and locking (Chapter 6). Embedding computation trees into 2 D processor meshes proved to be successful for a selection of tree structures and mesh sizes. Two models were used for testing: a perfect binary tree, and a Fibonacci tree...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} coarse {{aggregate}} gradation and cement content on strength of concrete was studied. Concrete made of Iowa Department of Transportation Standard Mix C- 3 and Aggregate Gradation No. 3 were selected as reference. C- 3 proportions {{were used for}} mixes # 1 and # 2. C- 3 mix with 10 % reduction of the cement content was used for mix # 3. C- 3 mix with 20 % reduction of the cement content was used for mix # 4. On the other hand, mix # 1 used coarse aggregate of Gradation No. 3, while mixes # 2, # 3, and # 4 used coarse aggregate mix of 65 % concrete stone and 35 % 3 / 8 in. chips. It was found that strengths of portland cement concrete decrease with decreasing cement factor. On the other hand, 35 % of <b>chip</b> replacement for <b>coarse</b> aggregate increases strengths of concrete. By replacing 35 % of <b>coarse</b> aggregate with <b>chips,</b> one could reduce cement factor 10 % and achieve equivalent strengths...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, a denitrification wall {{was constructed in}} a sand aquifer using sawdust as the carbon substrate. Ground water bypassed around this sawdust wall due to reduced hydraulic conductivity. We investigated potential reasons for this by testing two new walls and conducting laboratory studies. The first wall was constructed by mixing aquifer material in situ without substrate addition to investigate {{the effects of the}} construction technique (mixed wall). A second, biochip wall, was constructed using <b>coarse</b> wood <b>chips</b> to determine the effect of size of the particles in the amendment on hydraulic conductivity. The aquifer hydraulic conductivity was 35. 4 m/d, while in the mixed wall it was 2. 8 m/d and in the biochip wall 3. 4 m/d. This indicated that the mixing of the aquifer sands below the water table allowed the particles to re-sort themselves into a matrix with a significantly lower hydraulic conductivity than the process that originally formed the aquifer. The addition of a coarser substrate in the biochip wall significantly increased total porosity and decreased bulk density, but hydraulic conductivity remained low compared to the aquifer. Laboratory cores of aquifer sand mixed under dry and wet conditions mimicked the reduction in hydraulic conductivity observed in the field within the mixed wall. The addition of sawdust to the laboratory cores resulted in a significantly higher hydraulic conductivity when mixed dry compared to cores mixed wet. This reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the sand/sawdust cores mixed under saturated conditions repeated what occurred in the field in the original sawdust wall. This indicated that laboratory investigations can be a useful tool to highlight potential reductions in field hydraulic conductivities that may occur when differing materials are mixed under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Coconut {{shell is}} often {{considered}} as solid waste {{though it has}} high strength, hardness and bond capacity. After using coconut fruit, outer shell is released to the environment as a waste material. Recently, several research studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate a possibility of utilize this waste as building material. The block manufactured using Crushed Coconut Shell (CCS) has shown acceptable structural properties and thermal performances at 28 days. Since the coconut shell is a biodegradable material it is important to investigate long term behaviour of CCS based masonry block. As masonry blocks are used as wall, an investigation on the behaviour of a wall panel is useful. In this study, long term behaviour of CCS based block and panel were investigated. Compressive strength, water absorption and thermal performances of the individual block, which was manufactured twelve months ago, were determined. These solid masonry blocks having the size of 360 mm× 100 mm× 170 mm were cast with a mix proportion of 1 : 5 cement-sand by using local block manufacturing machine. Crushed coconut shell was used as replacement for <b>coarse</b> aggregates (<b>chips)</b> with 25 % (volume basis). Internal surface and external surface temperatures of the block were measured by using thermocouples. In addition, load-displacement curve of the wall panel subjected to vertical static loading was investigated. As a further development of the block, cost analysis was carried out. From the experimental study, it was found that in long term also, the CCS based blocks exhibit the similar thermal performances as in the short term. Compressive strength and water absorption found in the current study were compared with the same properties at 28 days found in a previous study. Cost analysis study confirms that CCS based block is economical compared with the conventional block...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 190 - 196). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Tortilla chips were prepared from commercially nixtamalized dry mesa flour. The effect of initial moisture content, frying oil temperature, flour particle size distribution, and degree of starch gelatinization on the moisture loss, oil absorption, changes in geometric dimensions, texture, porosity, and pore size distribution of tortilla chips during frying was studied. Isotherm, glass transition, and pore size distribution models during frying of tortilla chips were also developed. Tortilla chips with a high initial moisture content had a high rate of water loss and oil absorption during frying. As water evaporated tortilla chips shrank (in diameter) to a large extent and the chips' thickness increased. Tortilla chips fried in a higher oil temperature showed a higher degree of shrinkage and a lower degree of expansion. Crust formation occurred faster thus creating puffiness at the chips' surface. Higher oil temperature produced chips with a higher practicability and grouchiness. Oil temperature did not affect the final oil content of tortilla chips. The chips made from fine grain flour formed small pores during frying which accounted for the large amount of oil absorption. The <b>coarse</b> grain <b>chips</b> had the highest fracturability and the least crunchiness. Tortilla chips with a high starch gelatinization prior to frying shrank (in diameter) the most and no thickness expansion occurred. These chips absorbed a very small amount of oil that was deposited on the surface. Various models were fitted to determine which one predicted the experimental data of water activity the best. The Crapiste and Rotstein model (1986) provided the best correlation at the entire range of moisture content and temperatures. The equilibrium moisture content decreased as temperature and oil content increased for the same water activity value. The glass transition temperatures were fitted using the Gordon and Taylor equation. The glass transition curve for the fried chips with total oil content is higher than the one for the chips with partial oil content. A model was developed using the Extreme Value distribution to predict the pore size distribution of tortilla chips during frying. Pore size increases during frying and becomes more uniformly distributed as frying continues...|$|R
