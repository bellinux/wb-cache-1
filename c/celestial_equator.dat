5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator.</b> The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} forms {{one of the}} {{two fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator.</b> Perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the two fundamental planes, the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> known as nutation.|$|E

40|$|When I put Kepler’s {{first law}} under peer review, I note: 1) There is an {{isolation}} cordon between daytime and night = 13. 88 m; 2) Earth’s Rotation Axis loses its tendency to its mother (Polaris now) in winter; 3) <b>Celestial’s</b> <b>equator</b> doesn’t parallel Earth’s equator; 4) Ice sheet in Antarc tica equals ice sheet on arctic. But {{we find the}} field observation data contrary to that...|$|R
5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called the true equator and equinox; the positions without nutation are the mean equator and equinox.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the length and {{orientation}} of a shadow cast by a vertical gnomon depends on the time of the day and on the season of the year. But it also depends on the latitude of the site of observation. During the equinoxes, the temporal sequence of the shadows cast by each of the points that form any object follows a straight line from west to east. A simple construction using sticks and threads can be used to materialize the plane of <b>celestial</b> <b>equator's</b> local projection, giving us a way to calculate our astronomical latitude during daytime with high precision.

5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation Taurus during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E
5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on {{the tail of the}} Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the <b>Celestial</b> <b>Equator</b> which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
25|$|The term {{circumpolar}} constellation is {{used for}} any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon. From the North Pole or South Pole, all constellations south or north of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> are circumpolar constellations. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south, or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or zodiac ranging between 23½° north, the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> and 23½° south.|$|E
25|$|Orion {{is located}} on the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> but it will not always be so located due to the effects of {{precession}} of the Earth's axis. Orion lies well south of the ecliptic, and it only happens to lie on the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of Gemini and Taurus, to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000 Orion will be far enough south that it will become invisible from the latitude of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{orbital plane}} {{is known as}} the {{ecliptic}} plane, and Earth's tilt is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letter ε.|$|E
25|$|Astronomical {{latitude}} {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with declination, the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> (see equatorial coordinates), nor with ecliptic latitude, the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the ecliptic (see ecliptic coordinates).|$|E
25|$|Orion is a {{prominent}} constellation {{located on the}} <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> and visible throughout the world. It {{is one of the}} most conspicuous and recognizable constellations in the night sky. It was named after Orion, a hunter in Greek mythology. Its brightest stars are Rigel (Beta Orionis) and Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), a blue-white and a red supergiant, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Monoceros (Greek: Μονόκερως) is a faint {{constellation}} on the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator.</b> Its name is Greek for unicorn. Its {{definition is}} attributed to the 17th-century Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius. It is bordered by Orion to the west, Gemini to the north, Canis Major {{to the south and}} Hydra to the east. Other bordering constellations include Canis Minor, Lepus and Puppis.|$|E
25|$|In {{astronomy}} {{there are}} a series of spherical coordinate systems that measure the elevation angle from different fundamental planes. These reference planes are the observer's horizon, the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> (defined by Earth's rotation), the plane of the ecliptic (defined by Earth's orbit around the Sun), the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the Sun), and the galactic equator (defined by the rotation of the Milky Way).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of precession, the First Point of Libra, (also known as the autumn equinox point) lies within the {{boundaries}} of Virgo very close to β Virginis. This is one of the two points in the sky where the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> crosses the ecliptic (the other being the First Point of Aries, now in the constellation of Pisces.) This point will pass into the neighbouring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.|$|E
25|$|Pisces is {{classified}} as a short ascension sign; one which takes a shorter {{amount of time to}} ascend over the horizon than the other signs. It {{is also one of the}} six southern signs, because it is south of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> when the sun is in it (no longer true). This results in it being seen in the winter sky in the northern hemisphere. Pisces is also considered a bicorporeal or double-bodied sign, as the astrological sign is composed of two fishes.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} large {{asterism}} which, like the Diamond of Virgo, {{is composed of}} a pair of equilateral triangles. Sirius (α CMa), Procyon (α CMi), and Betelgeuse (α Ori) form one to the North (Winter Triangle) while Sirius, Naos (ζ Pup), and Phakt (α Col) form another to the South. Unlike the Diamond, however, these triangles meet, not base-to-base, but vertex-to-vertex, forming the Egyptian X. The name derives from both the shape and, because the stars straddle the <b>Celestial</b> <b>Equator,</b> it is more easily seen from south of the Mediterranean than in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar. Stars on the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, the stars of Crater were possibly incorporated {{with those of the}} crow Corvus in the Babylonian Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). John H. Rogers observed that the adjoining constellation Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with the water snake Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
25|$|An oversimplified {{definition}} of the tropical year would be the time required for the Sun, beginning at a chosen ecliptic longitude, to make one complete cycle of the seasons {{and return to the}} same ecliptic longitude. Before considering an example, the equinox must be examined. There are two important planes in solar system calculations, the plane of the ecliptic (the Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the plane of the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator</b> (the Earth's equator projected into space). These two planes intersect in a line. This direction is given the symbol ♈ (the symbol looks like the horns of a ram because it used to be toward the constellation Aries. The opposite direction is given the symbol ♎ (because it used to be toward Libra). Because of the precession of the equinoxes and nutation these directions change, compared to the direction of distant stars and galaxies, whose directions have no measurable motion due to their great distance (see International Celestial Reference Frame).|$|E
25|$|The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence {{was founded}} by Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 to honour organizations, groups, {{societies}} or associations who have made outstanding contributions {{to the advancement of}} aviation in Canada. The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence was bestowed upon the Air Cadet League of Canada in 1989. Orion, the son of Neptune, according to Greek Mythology, was a handsome and energetic hunter who possessed the power to walk through the sea and on its surface. Artemis, the Goddess of the hunt, fell in love with Orion, but her twin brother, Apollo, was jealous and sent a scorpion to kill him. In her sorrow and remorse for his death, Artemis placed him in the sky as a constellation. Orion, the Great Hunter, is a brilliant constellation, second to the Big Dipper on the roster of major constellations. It straddles the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> and is outlined by a quadrilateral of three brilliant stars—Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Rigel, and one of lesser magnitude. Inside the quadrilateral are three second-magnitude stars forming the Belt of Orion. The three stars of the Belt point south-eastward to Sirius, the brightest star of the heavens.|$|E
500|$|Each star's {{approximate}} {{position on}} the celestial sphere is given using the equatorial coordinate system. [...] The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center. [...] Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: declination and sidereal hour angle, which are similar to latitude and longitude {{on the surface of}} the Earth. [...] To define declination, the Earth's equator is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the <b>celestial</b> <b>equator,</b> and declination is measured in degrees north or south of this <b>celestial</b> <b>equator.</b> [...] Sidereal hour angle is a measurement between 0 and 360 degrees, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the First Point of Aries.|$|E
