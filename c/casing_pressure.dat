The degree of the effect depends on continuous or intermittent flow of the gas. The gas can be injected at a single point below the fluid or may be supplemented by multipoint injection. An intermitter at the surface controls {{the timing of the}} gas injection. The mechanisms are either pressure or fluid operated. They may be throttling valves or <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> operated valve.Fluid operated valves require a rise in tubing pressure to open and drop to close.A throttling pressure valve is opened by <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> build up and closed by <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> drop.Conventional gas lift valves are attached to gas lift mandrels and wire line retrievable gas lift valves which are set in side pocket mandrels.|$|E

Thus, a model to calculate the external <b>pressure</b> of <b>casing</b> is established with finite element method. In the model a contact is built between the outer wall of the casing and the inner wall of the cement sheath. The <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> can be got through extracting contact force of results. The numerical results and analysis show that: The largest <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> exists {{in the direction of}} minimum horizontal stress of formation rather than {{in the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. There exists such matching between the cement sheath elastic modulus and formation elastic modulus: When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is small, reducing its value is conducive to reduce the <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> and to prolong casing service life. When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is large, increasing its value is conducive to reduce the <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> and to prolong casing service life. The <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> will become large with the increase of Poisson's ratio of cement sheath. With the increase of the degree of the formation stress unevenness, the maximum <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> increases and the smallest external decreases. The increasing of the non-uniformity degree of formation stress makes the non-uniformity degree of <b>casing</b> external <b>pressure</b> and the risk of casing failure increase. The study can provide certain reference for drilling workers to take measures to prolong service life of casing...|$|R
40|$|Non-contact {{measurement}} of gas turbine blade vibrations {{has made significant}} progress over recent years; however, there still exist some limitations in the current techniques available. Specifically with blade tip timing (BTT) methods, some of the limitations are: the requirement {{of a large number}} of sensors for each engine stage, difficulties in dealing with multiple excitation frequencies, and sensors being located in the gas path. An alternative technique is examined here, utilising the unsteady <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressure,</b> which has the potential to rectify some of these limitations. Analytical simulation of the internal <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressure</b> is derived, for the situation with rotor blades undergoing forced vibration.

Analytical modelling of the <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressures</b> and reconstruction of rotor blade vibration amplitudes from the analysis of these simulated pressure signals have shown potential advantages over current non-contact rotor blade vibration measurement methods. However, the modelling made some fundamental assumptions about the <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressure.</b> One of the assumptions made was that the pressure at the blade tip is not significantly different from that measured across the clearance gap at the casing wall.

50|$|This {{effect will}} be minor if the influx fluid is mainly salt water. And with an {{oil-based}} drilling fluid {{it can be}} masked {{in the early stages}} of controlling a kick because gas influx may dissolve into the oil under pressure at depth, only to come out of solution and expand rather rapidly as the influx nears the surface. Once all the contaminant has been circulated out, the shut-in <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> should have reached zero.|$|E
50|$|The first {{response}} to detecting a kick {{would be to}} isolate the wellbore from the surface by activating the blow-out preventers and closing in the well. Then the drilling crew would attempt to circulate in a heavier kill fluid to increase the hydrostatic pressure (sometimes {{with the assistance of}} a well control company). In the process, the influx fluids will be slowly circulated out in a controlled manner, taking care not to allow any gas to accelerate up the wellbore too quickly by controlling <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> with chokes on a predetermined schedule.|$|E
50|$|When a {{hydrocarbon}} well is hydraulically fractured, {{this is done}} through a production packer (seal), through the drill pipe or tubing.

The rest of the well casing will not experience any increase in pressure due to the sealing of the packer. The surface casings do not experience the great pressures experienced at the production zone. This means the stresses on a surface casing are no greater than on a normal oil or gas well. Smaller diameter pipes can sustain much larger pressures than large diameter pipes.|$|E

In this case, the operator faces two options, depending on the fluid level in the casing: (i) increasing pump speed with adjusting <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> and (ii) increasing pump speed without adjusting the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure.</b> First, the current wellbore pressure has to be calculated using the methodology introduced in Section “Methodologies”. Then, the methodology described in Section “Methodologies” should be used to predict the oil production and the increase in oil viscosity, respectively, at a certain increase in the wellbore pressure. Based on the knowledge of the anticipated production rate, the fluid level at any combination of the pump speed and <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> can be estimated using Eq.  26. The methodologies introduced in this article would help the operator’s decision making process.

40|$|A recent {{research}} program has identified {{the possibility of}} using the analysis of <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressures</b> in the direct measurement of gas turbine rotor blade vibration amplitudes. Currently the dominant method of non-contact measurement of gas turbine blade vibrations employs the use of a number of proximity probes located around the engine periphery measuring the blade tip (arrival) time (BTT). Despite the increasing ability of this method there still exist some limitations, viz: the requirement {{of a large number of}} sensors for each engine stage, sensitivity to sensor location, difficulties in dealing with multiple excitation frequencies and sensors being located in the gas path. Analytical modelling of the <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressures</b> and reconstruction of rotor blade vibration amplitudes from the analysis of these simulated pressure signals has shown significant improvement over current non-contact rotor blade vibration measurement limitations by requiring only a limited number of sensors and providing robust rotor blade vibration amplitude estimates in the presence of simulated measurement noise. However, this modelling was conducted with some fundamental assumptions about the <b>casing</b> wall <b>pressures</b> being made. One of these assumptions presumed that during blade motion the pressure profile around the rotor blades follows the blade’s motion while it oscillates around its equilibrium position. This assumption is investigated in this paper through the numerical modelling of the fully coupled two-way rotor blade motion and fluid pressure interaction...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the well production, the operator of the candidate well increased the pump speed when the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> was kept constant. The lower wellbore pressure increased the production rate {{as well as the}} sand production. The amount of sand flowing into the wellbore exceeded the capacity of the pump, and the pump finally got ‘sanded-up’. The sand, which flows into the wellbore but cannot be lifted by the PCP, is accumulated at the wellbore. Sanded-up situation occurs when the maximum applied torque cannot turn the rotor due to the accumulated sand. This situation is also referred to as ‘torqued-up’. After the Coiled tubing unit (CTU) job, the pump became no longer usable and, therefore, it had to be changed. The improper implementation of CTU job is harmful to PCP because the inserted coiled tubing may damage the stator. The operator could have increased the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> before increasing the pump speed. However, the operator decided to keep the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> constant because the fluid level was relatively low. In fact, the operator was not sure how much of the fluid level would be decreased by increasing the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> and did not intend to cause the dry condition for the pump.|$|E

30|$|It is very {{important}} to understand the annular multiphase flow behavior and the effect of hydrate phase transition during deep water drilling. The basic hydrodynamic models, including mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, were established for annular flow with gas hydrate phase transition during gas kick. The behavior of annular multiphase flow with hydrate phase transition was investigated by analyzing the hydrate-forming region, the gas fraction in the fluid flowing in the annulus, pit gain, bottom hole pressure, and shut-in <b>casing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The simulation shows {{that it is possible to}} move the hydrate-forming region away from sea floor by increasing the circulation rate. The decrease in gas volume fraction in the annulus due to hydrate formation reduces pit gain, which can delay the detection of well kick and increase the risk of hydrate plugging in lines. Caution is needed when a well is monitored for gas kick at a relatively low gas production rate, because the possibility of hydrate presence is much greater than that at a relatively high production rate. The shut-in <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot reflect the gas kick due to hydrate formation, which increases with time.|$|E

It is necessary to realize remote regulating and automatic control on production systems of CBM wells as soon as possible, so that production cost can be reduced effectively and fine production of CBM wells can be improved. In this paper, remote production control technologies were designed based on production behaviors of CBM wells. And then, in light of the features of automatic monitoring instruments, automatic production of CBM wells was divided into four stages (i. e. before <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> occurring, <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> building, initial gas production and gas production). Finally, an automatic control program was developed and embedded into on-site control terminals after study was carried out on automatic control logics and methods of each production stage of CBM wells.

40|$|Chances {{of cement}} sheath failure {{increase}} considerably when the application involves deep, high pressure/ high temperature (HPHT) wells. Such failures {{occur as a}} result of temperature and pressure-induced stresses created by well events such as hydraulic fracturing, well testing, enhanced oil recovery, completion, production, and work over, or other remedial treatments. These would impose huge operational costs and in some circumstances lead to loss of production. Analytical and FEA modeling research has been done in the past but fewer experimental studies focused on finding the fatigue endurance cycles of oil well cements under HPHT conditions. Abundant unconventional resources, producing from deeper horizons, numerous frac jobs in the US, and safety significance were the prime motivations for creating a new testing procedure for evaluating cement integrity under HPHT conditions. A novel HPHT cell was manufactured and mounted on a Chandler 7600, an extreme HPHT Rheometer. Cylindrical cement samples were cured and tested at constant confining pressure while the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> varied cyclically.

40|$|Pressure buildup {{analysis}} {{has been used}} for many years to evaluate the performance of wells and estimate the properties of reservoirs. Usually, the application of pressure transient theory to the evaluation of well tests requires that accurate bottomhole pressure measurements be made. In the case of a well producing by beam pumping, the direct measurement of bottomhole pressures is impossible, since the presence of the pump in the tubing physically precludes the use of wireline pressure gages and permanent downhole pressure installations are usually not economically attractive. For this reason, indirect bottomhole pressure measurements are usually made by measuring the annulus pressure at the surface along with the fluid level in the annulus. From these measurements and the fluid densities, the bottomhole pressure may be estimated with an accuracy depending on the accuracy of the estimated fluid properties and the measurement accuracy. This procedure has been criticized, since the pressures being analyzed are not directly measured and the accuracy of the data and estimated fluid properties limits the analysis precision. This report documents an improved evaluation method for wells producing on beam pumps. Instead of indirectly calculating the bottomhole pressure, the wellbore is modeled and the analysis is performed directly on the measured data. Since both <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> and fluid level are measured, the number of data points is essentially doubled over standard well testing and the accuracy of the analysis can be judged by comparison with the actual measured data. In addition, since the <b>casing</b> <b>pressure</b> appears to be mainly affected by wellbore effects, the evaluation accuracy is improved even more than would be expected from statistical considrations alone...|$|E
