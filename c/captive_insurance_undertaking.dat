40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Captive</b> <b>Insurance,</b> a {{technique}} for internal risk financing is {{an insurance company}} that only insures {{all or part of}} the risk of its parent company. (Kloman et al, 1982) It is one such area in the field of risk financing which has always remained undercover due to the complexity attached in the form of sensitivity in information disclosure and confidentiality of data. So the objective of this dissertation is to examine the <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> industry, with a special focus on its five major domiciles - Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Vermont, British Virgin Islands and Guernsey, their structure and their recent trends and developments. Various research and data collection techniques have been used to perform the research in the field of <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> industry and more precisely its five major domiciles. The dissertation begins with a literature review providing an insight of what the previous researchers have explored in the <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> field of risk financing. It is followed by a research methodology that has been structured so as to carry out the research in an efficient manner. Examining the overall captive market indicated that <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> market is governed by five of its major domiciles Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Vermont, British Virgin Islands and Guernsey, with Bermuda being the main choice of domicile. So the main focus of this dissertation is to examine the structure, and trends & developments of these five domiciles...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Every modern-day {{company is}} faced with {{challenges}} {{on a daily basis}} to improve its performance. This challenge stretches further than the financial target that is received from the shareholders every year and boils right down to the day to day operations of a company. How does the company perform according to the market, does the company have a uniqueness that will allow for a competitive advantage, how can costs be reduced in order to create value in terms of shareholders and how to stay the blueprint company with its competitors seen as followers. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the effect that financial risk management in terms of a cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility has on a company, especially the financial side and ultimately to provide a framework on the implementation of a cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. A cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility stems from the self insurance principle and is tailored to a unique product offered by various insurance companies. It enables a company to insure its frequent losses at a lower premium than the insurance market and all surpluses resulting from the Captive can be regarded as profit to the owner of the captive or used to lower the following year's contribution. In order to obtain a Cell <b>Captive's</b> <b>insurance</b> facility, a company must purchase shares in an insurance company, known as a sponsor, and hereby receive certain <b>insurance</b> amenities. The <b>captive</b> that is now formed enables a company to insure all business related activities against possible risks with a further extension of the definition 'business related activities'. Due to the unlikely event to completely self insure, with regards to the cost implication and bearing the size of the captive in mind to cover all possible financial losses, an underwritten agreement between the cell captive owner and the sponsor insurance company should cater for all catastrophic risks which protects the captive from collapsing, due to a massive loss. With the creation of a cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility, the owner of the captive can extend on all its business related activities and offer insurance products to its employees and clients, with a reasonably reduce rate compared to the insurance market. The success of theses products can be so-good that the financial impact on the captive proofs the products to be self-reliant and even generates an income for the cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. As a result of the objective to implement effective risk management via a cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility and to create profit by doing so, the results of the Vodacom Group was used in order to emphasize the successfulness of a cell <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. Vodacom Group saved or rather refer to the term as "created" a net underwriting profit that amounts to R 3, 385, 275 in the first three months by using its Cell <b>Captive</b> <b>Insurance</b> Facility. Thats more than enough to prove the financial gain, but the company also benefited from the fact that it now has the ability to educate its managers and their management styles. The captive can no act as the focal point of the Group's risk management effort, by focusing the minds of senior management on the causes of claims and means to combat that...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two recent Department of Labor (DOL) {{decisions}} have {{cleared the way}} for <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> subsidiaries to insure the employee benefits of their parent firms. This paper examines whether using captives for this purpose is beneficial for employ-ees and whether employee benefit premiums should be tax deductible in this case. We conclude that under the DOL’s conditions, the practice is advantageous for employees. Furthermore, we conclude that unless outside risk and outside premiums are added to the pooling arrangement, there’s no basis for permitting premiums to be tax deductible. The analysis suggests the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of employ-ee benefit risk as “outside risk ” when insured by the parent company’s captive insurer is incorrect.
