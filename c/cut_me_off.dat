He {{turned down}} a knighthood in 1951 because {{he felt that the}} bestowal would lead to a {{perception}} of him as an establishment figure and that [...] "such a title might tend to <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from fellow artists whose work has aims similar to mine". He was, however, awarded the Companion of Honour in 1955, the Order of Merit in 1963 and Erasmus Prize in 1968.|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, {{the paper}} decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns {{in a program}} known as TimesSelect, which {{encompassed}} many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, {{and at least one}} site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission. Although his {{military}} superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well".|$|E

[...] (Jethro knew Dudley Worthington well enough to appreciate that this would make no particular difference in his opposition to the marriage except to make that opposition more vehement.) [...] "And because you do not know me," [...] continued Bob. [...] "When I say a thing, I mean it. Even if my father <b>cuts</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> and casts <b>me</b> out, I will marry Cynthia.

60|$|I liked your Play marvellously, {{having no}} {{objection}} to it but one, which strikes me as applicable to {{a large majority of}} plays, those of Shakspeare himself not entirely excepted--I mean a little degradation of character for a more dramatic turn of plot. Your present of Hone's book was very acceptable; and so much so, that your part of the book is the cause why I did not write long ago. I wished to enter a little minutely into notice of the dramatic extracts, and, on account of the smallness of the print, deferred doing so till longer days would allow me to read without candle-light, which I have long since given up. But, alas! when the days lengthened, my eyesight departed, and for many months I could not read three minutes at a time. You will be sorry to hear that this infirmity still hangs about <b>me,</b> and almost <b>cuts</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from reading altogether. But how are you, and how is your dear sister?

2500|$|At {{this time}} the {{strength}} was estimated at 68,000 rifles and sabres and morale of the Ottoman defenders very strong, the harvest coming in and food abundant. While the EEF was defending its line with every available unit. As Allenby {{wrote in a letter}} to the War Office on 15 June 1918, [...] "all my goods are in the shop window." [...] The [...] EEF line stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River was strong, supported by roads and communications behind. However the line was wide in comparison with the size of the EEF it. Allenby saying, [...] "It is the best line I can hold. Any retirement would weaken it. My right flank is covered by the Jordan; my left by the Mediterranean Sea. The Jordan Valley must be held by me; it is vital. If the Turks regained control of the Jordan, I should lose control of the Dead Sea. This would <b>cut</b> <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from the Arabs on the Hedjaz railway; with the result that, shortly, the Turks would regain their power in the Hedjaz. The Arabs would make terms with them, and our prestige would be gone. My right flank would be turned, and my position in Palestine would be untenable. I might hold Rafa or El Arish; but you can imagine what effect such a withdrawal would have on the population of Egypt, and on the watching tribes of the Western Desert. You see, therefore, that I cannot modify my present dispositions. I must give up nothing of what I now hold. Anyhow, I must hold the Jordan Valley." ...|$|E

[...] The proposal sounded tempting, but was a little risky, and after consulting together we decided to let things remain as they were.
