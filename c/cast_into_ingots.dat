50|$|Most {{grades of}} steel are melted once and are then <b>cast</b> or teemed <b>into</b> a solid form prior to {{extensive}} forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an {{electric arc furnace}} and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> <b>ingot</b> molds. The solidified ingots then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.|$|R

50|$|To recover {{lead from}} a battery, the battery is broken and the {{components}} are classified. The lead containing components are processed in blast furnaces for hard lead or rotary reverberatory furnaces for fine particles. The blast furnace {{is similar in}} structure to a cupola furnace used in iron foundries. The furnace is charged with slag, scrap iron, limestone, coke, oxides, dross, and reverberatory slag. The coke is used to melt and reduce the lead. Limestone reacts with impurities and floats to the top. This process also keeps the lead from oxidizing. The molten lead flows from the blast furnace into holding pots. Lead may be mixed with alloys, including antimony, tin, arsenic, copper and nickel.

25|$|The {{workflow}} of {{the manufacturing}} process consisted of a few steps that required {{a great amount of}} skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> flat <b>ingots</b> and hammered <b>into</b> intermediate plates. For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high repoussé; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.|$|R

A significant part of the work consists of the design of a specialised rig for this high temperature processing method. Following preliminary tests, graphite was chosen as the mam vessel material, and a crucible was designed with a bottom pouring mechanism. In order to optimise stirring conditions, a computer program was used to stimulate the fluid flow in the process crucible. The mam research challenge was to solve the problem o f poor wettability between particulate SiC and molten aluminium (A 359 alloy), materials which are potentially suitable to the proposed fabrication approach as reinforcement and matrix materials respectively.

The fabrication approach was successful in producing cast MMCs samples which have reasonable mechanical properties The use of clean SiC particles, magnesium as a wetting agent, and continuous stirring while the MMC slurry is solidifying were found to promote the wettability o f SiC and A 359 matrix alloy Decreasing the solidifying time was found to improve the wettability significantly...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, {{mischmetal}} {{was prepared}} from monazite, an anhydrous phosphate {{of the light}} lanthanides and thorium. The ore was cracked by reaction at high temperature either with concentrated sulfuric acid, or with sodium hydroxide. Thorium was removed {{by taking advantage of}} its weaker basicity relative to the trivalent lanthanides, its daughter radium was precipitated out using entrainment in barium sulfate, and the remaining lanthanides were converted to their chlorides. The resulting [...] "rare earth chloride" [...] (hexahydrate), sometimes known as [...] "lanthanide chloride", was the major commodity chemical of the rare earth industry. By careful heating, preferably with ammonium chloride or in an atmosphere of hydrogen chloride, the hexahydrate could be dehydrated to provide the anhydrous chloride. Electrolysis of the molten anhydrous chloride (admixed with other anhydrous halide to improve the melt behavior) {{led to the formation of}} molten mischmetal, which would then be <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> <b>ingots.</b> Any samarium content of the ore tended not to be reduced to the metal, but accumulated in the molten halide, from which it could later be profitably isolated. Monazite-derived mischmetal typically was about 48% cerium, 25% lanthanum, 17% neodymium, and 5% praseodymium, with the balance being the other lanthanides. When bastnäsite started being processed for rare earth content in about 1965, it too was converted to a version of rare earth chloride, and on to mischmetal. This version was higher in lanthanum and lower in neodymium.|$|E

The material is <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> large <b>ingots,</b> which are cut with a band saw <b>into</b> smaller <b>ingots</b> (i. e. bricks). The bricks are then sliced into wafers with a wire saw. Damage is introduced within the wafers during these processes. If sufficient, the damage can cause brittle failure during the sawing processes, or in handling during further processing downstream. In this study, the surface quality of eight polycrystalline silicon bricks cast at BP Solar and exhibiting a characteristic quality was investigated using contact profilometry. The bricks were then returned to BP Solar where they were sliced into wafers. Wafers {{from each of the}} eight bricks were collected and the surface topography of the wafer surface and wafer edges was examined using white light interferometry. In addition, mechanical properties of the wafers were determined using biaxial flexure and a novel edge flexure test. Fractography revealed that wafers failed from either surface flaws introduced during wire saw sectioning or edge flaws introduced during band saw sectioning.

40|$|Wrought aluminum-based alloys exhibit {{superior}} {{physical and}} mechanical properties compared to conventional shape casting alloys. However, wrought alloys cannot be cast into near net shapes because they develop hot tears and hot cracks during solidification. For this reason, these alloys are typically <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> <b>ingots</b> and are subsequently brought to final shape by mechanical {{processes such as}} rolling, extrusion, drawing and forging. These processes significantly increase {{the cost of the}} manufactured component. Controlled Diffusion Solidification (CDS) is a novel process that allows casting of wrought alloys directly into final shapes that are free of hot tears; thus CDS eliminates the added cost of machining. The process follows a different route from conventional casting methods. In CDS two liquid alloys of predetermined composition and temperature are mixed together so that upon solidification the resultant alloy has a globular rather than a dendritic microstructure as shown in Figure 1. The hot tearing tendency of wrought alloys originates from the inadequate permeability of their dendritic network, which obstructs the flow of interdendritic liquid and hinders compensation for shrinkage. The nondendritic microstructure made possible by CDS minimizes hot-tearing thus enabling wrought alloys to be cast directly. The CDS has the potential to: Reduce the cost of multiple component assemblies Minimize several typical casting defects that are associated with solidification Reduce the time required to fabricate assemblies Reduce process variability by controlling the solidification Increase casting application...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 68 % of the {{aluminum}} {{produced in the}} United States is first <b>cast</b> <b>into</b> <b>ingots</b> prior to further processing into sheet, plate, extrusions, or foil. The direct chill (DC) semi-continuous casting process has been the mainstay of {{the aluminum}} industry {{for the production of}} ingots due largely to its robust nature and relative simplicity. Though the basic process of DC casting is in principle straightforward, the interaction of process parameters with heat extraction, microstructural evolution, and development of solidification stresses is too complex to analyze by intuition or practical experience. One issue in DC casting is the formation of stress cracks [1 - 15]. In particular, the move toward larger ingot cross-sections, the use of higher casting speeds, and an ever-increasing array of mold technologies have increased industry efficiencies but have made it more difficult to predict the occurrence of stress crack defects. The Aluminum Industry Technology Roadmap [16] has recognized the challenges inherent in the DC casting process and the control of stress cracks and selected the development of 'fundamental information on solidification of alloys to predict microstructure, surface properties, and stresses and strains' as a high-priority research need, and the 'lack of understanding of mechanisms of cracking as a function of alloy' and 'insufficient understanding of the aluminum solidification process', which is 'difficult to model', as technology barriers in aluminum casting processes. The goal of this Aluminum Industry of the Future (IOF) project was to assist the aluminum industry in reducing the incidence of stress cracks from the current level of 5 % to 2 %. Decreasing stress crack incidence is important for improving product quality and consistency as well as for saving resources and energy, since considerable amounts of cast metal could be saved by eliminating ingot cracking, by reducing the scalping thickness of the ingot before rolling, and by eliminating butt sawing. Full-scale industrial implementation {{of the results of the}} proposed research would lead to energy savings in excess of 6 trillion Btu by the year 2020. The research undertaken in this project aimed to achieve this objective by a collaboration of industry, university, and national laboratory personnel through Secat, Inc., a consortium of aluminum companies. During the four-year project, the industrial partners and the research team met in 16 quarterly meetings to discuss research results and research direction. The industrial partners provided guidance, facilities, and experience to the research team. The research team went to two industrial plants to measure temperature distributions in commercial 60, 000 -lb DC casting ingot production. The project focused on the development of a fundamental understanding of ingot cracking and detailed models of thermal conditions, solidification, microstructural evolution, and stress development during the initial transient in DC castings of the aluminum alloys 3004 and 5182. The microstructure of the DC casting ingots was systematically characterized. Carefully designed experiments were carried out at the national laboratory and university facilities as well as at the industrial locations using the industrial production facilities. The advanced computational capabilities of the national laboratories were used for thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of phase transformation, heat transfer and fluid flow, solidification, and stress-strain evolution during DC casting. The achievements of the project are the following: (1) Identified the nature of crack formation during DC casting; (2) Developed a novel method for determining the mechanical properties of an alloy at the nonequilibrium mushy zone of the alloy; (3) Measured heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) between the solidifying ingot and the cooling water jet; (4) Determined the material constitutive model at high temperatures; and (5) Developed computational capabilities for the simulation of cracking formation in DC casting ingot. The models and the database developed in this project have been used to predict crack formation and to determine the optimal conditions for DC casting. The results demonstrated that cracking formation is strongly affected by casting conditions and the composition of the alloy. Scrap rate due to crack formation can be significantly reduced by controlling the cast speed and the concentrations of the alloy...|$|E
