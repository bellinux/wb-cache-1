We attempt to find the latest evidence on how the RMB pegs to its currency basket.

We then move forward to examine how the RMB pegs to its currency basket and estimate the weight of each of <b>component</b> <b>currencies</b> over the period from January 2007 to March 2013 by applying Frankel and Wei (1994) ’s model. The results illustrate that the RMB did not perfectly peg to RMB basket as the PBoC announced {{during the period from}} January 2007 to March 2013. But we find the US dollar’s weight has declined steadily since 2011, although it still is the most important reference currency to peg for the RMB. Interestingly, other currencies like Singapore dollar received increasing weight in RMB basket. It implies that RMB exchange rate regime is in the transitional period from single currency peg to currency basket peg...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the value of}} the RCU as a weighted average of East Asian currencies following the method used to calculate the ECU. The weight of <b>component</b> <b>currencies</b> is determined on the basis of each country's economic importance and contribution to regional cooperation such as the nominal GDP, GDP measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), intra-regional trade, and bilateral swap arrangement under the CMI. Two features are noteworthy. One is that the RCU value based on nominal GDP varies the most and the value based on PPP-GDP fluctuates the least. The other feature is that the trends of the RCU look very different according to the choice of the benchmark year. The RCU thus calculated {{can be used as a}} divergence indicator to monitor the exchange rate movement of East Asian currencies.

40|$|The {{log-normal}} Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) {{currency option}} model usually creates pricing biases when matched {{with the market}} prices. The observed price bias pattern is generally consistent with the mixed jump-diffusion distribution for exchange rates. Various studies have provided evidence of jump risks in exchange rate movements. This paper argues that the jump risk in the exchange rates may be correlated with the market. Thus an equilibrium framework is needed to price the systematic jump <b>components</b> in <b>currency</b> option prices. I propose an equilibrium model to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} exchange rate in a small open monetary economy with stochastic jump-diffusion processes for both the money supply and aggregate dividend. It is shown that the exchange rate is affected by government monetary policies, aggregate dividends and the level of investment in foreign assets. As a result, the exchange rate exhibits more discontinuities than stock prices as empirically documented. Since the jump in the exchange rate is correlated with aggregate consumption, the jump risk in the exchange rate derived from aggregate dividend must be priced for currency options. I further derive the foreign agents' risk-neutral valuation of the European currency option and provide restrictions to ensure the parity conditions in currency option market. In general, these restrictions depend on the agent's risk preference. Exchange rates, Systematic jumps, Currency options, Open economy, Equilibrium...|$|R
