5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must <b>choose,</b> <b>and</b> through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During this phase, the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they <b>choose,</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of the item rental system.|$|E

5|$|Glass Swords is {{the debut}} studio album by Scottish {{producer}} Russell Whyte under his alias of Rustie, released by Warp in 2011. The album was produced and recorded between 2008 and 2010 by Whyte, partially in his father's home in Glasgow, Scotland and partly {{in his own}} home in London, England. The album contains vocal work from Whyte as well as London based producer Nightwave. The final six months of the production sessions involved Whyte attempting to <b>choose</b> <b>and</b> edit which tracks he felt were worth releasing on the final version of Glass Swords.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would <b>choose</b> <b>and</b> what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|NBA {{teams can}} call up players {{as many times}} as they <b>choose,</b> <b>and</b> there is no limit to the number of times an NBA player with three years or less {{experience}} can be assigned to the G League.

25|$|In {{the middle}} 20th century in North America when a call {{could not be}} completed, for example because the phone number was not assigned, had been disconnected, or was {{experiencing}} technical difficulties, the call was routed to an intercept operator who informed the caller.

Disconnected numbers are reassigned to new users after the rate of calls to them declines.|$|E

25|$|In most species, {{the female}} does {{most or all}} of the nest construction, though the male often helps.

The ability to <b>choose</b> <b>and</b> maintain good nest sites and build high quality nests may be selected for by females in these species. In some species the young from previous broods may also act as helpers for the adults.|$|E
25|$|The two {{line system}} was {{abolished}} in 2005 and the gymnasium was completely re-formed.

Instead of choosing a line of study when enrolling, the students now only let the school know what line they intend to <b>choose,</b> <b>and</b> the final decision is made after half a year of introduction to the different faculties (primarily the arts, languages and natural science). Furthermore, {{a wide range of}} general subjects, like for instance social studies, were made mandatory.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Sina {{refers to}} the {{secondary}} education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status.

He wrote that this was a transitional stage and {{that there needs to be}} flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduage, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.|$|E
