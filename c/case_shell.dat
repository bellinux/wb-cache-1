40|$|To {{overcome}} the inflexibility {{of the traditional}} CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools, meta-CASE tools, or CASE shells had been proposed. Instead of using a fixed, or built-in method for presenting a software specification, CASE shells use specification or development methods which are separately defined. Metaview is a <b>CASE</b> <b>shell</b> in which various software development methods can be defined using the EARA (Entity, Aggregate, Relationship, Attribute) model.

40|$|There is {{an obvious}} need to improve the {{adaptation}} of methods into Com-puter Aided Software/Systems Engineering (CASE) tools. This paper pre-sents {{a new approach to}} adapting methods into CASE environments, called metamodeling. It applies a new generation CASE tool or <b>CASE</b> <b>shell</b> to offer flexible mechanisms to specify and implement methods, or to modify existing ones in tools. This allows customization of CASE support for local needs. Metamodeling is a key step in such a customization and adaptation task. During metamodeling a formal model of the method to be supported is derived. This paper offers guidelines for a method adaptation process based on metamodeling. The goal of the process is to examine and improve methods so as to adapt them flexibly and successfully into the contingent local needs in order to achieve a sufficient fit between users ’ cognitive skills, special methods, and tool support. The practicality of the method adapta-tion guidelines is demonstrated by reporting a case study where a ‘manual’ method called Activity Modelling was adapted into a <b>CASE</b> <b>shell</b> called MetaEdit. We also suggest criteria to evaluate the adaptation outcome and illuminate them in our adaptation case. The paper ends up with a spec-ulation of how the nature of IS development methods is likely to change due to increased computer support. This will make the dominating ‘paper-and-pencil ’ mentality obsolete, and introduce more flexible, complex and versatile methods which are supported by powerful analytical tools offering unprecented functionality such as simulation or hypertext features. We be-lieve that the metamodeling approach will form an essential core of method development and use in years to come, as {{it can be used to}} extend and rnod-ify organizations ’ knowledge about methods and to make them learn more rapidly. ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{generation}} of CASE tools mainly provides rigid and unflexible support for editing, storage, verification and transformation of specifications. Information engineers have to adapt their way of working to CASE tools instead of vice versa. To enable a more flexible, method independent, support of information engineers, {{the concept of a}} <b>CASE</b> <b>shell</b> has emerged. Crucial for CASE shells is the specification of interpretable method knowledge. A technique capable of specifying method knowledge is referred to as a meta-modelling technique. In this paper it is stressed that a meta-modelling technique should also be able to represent graphic conventions in methods. An existing meta-modelling technique is extended with constructs for the representation of graphic knowledge. 1 Introduction CASE tools are currently considered as the prime initiators of attempts to formalize and standardize information systems development methods in a more detailed way.

40|$|Scenario {{building}} and related analysis {{is useful in}} several fields, ranging from military and business planning to its more recent applications in addressing global challenges such as climate change or economic crises.

These case studies highlight the potential and challenges of scenario building as a process and tool in urban governance in fast-growing cities in emerging economies. The analysis reveals that the scenario-building process can be as important as its outcome, because the different perspectives of the participating actors, their understanding of the local context and mutual learning gained on the topic may influence their future plans and course of action.

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{operations}} {{are characterized by}} extreme shape changes in initially flat or pre-formed blanks, thus needing complex and robust simulation tools for their correct virtual analysis. Among numerical approaches, finite element procedures {{are one of the}} most common techniques in modelling and simulation of such manufacturing applications. However, reliable simulations of complex parts' sheet forming must be able to correctly reproduce the deformation patterns involved but also accurately predict the appearance of defects after or during forming stages. Among the most common defects in the forming of metallic parts, spring-back and wrinkling are of crucial importance in manufacturing viewpoint. Spring-back appearance can be traced to the onset of traction instabilities when the tools depart the blank due to a rearrangement of stress fields after forming (or forming stages) and so, the unloaded blank reaches a new equilibrium. On the other side, wrinkling defects can be seen as compressive dominated defects and, in this sense, be dealt with as buckling-type structural instabilities. In this work, a class of solid-shell finite elements [1, 2, 3, 4], based on distinct features but relying on the enhanced assumed strain approach, are tested in the simulation of sheet metal forming operation in metallic components. Results obtained from these elements, specially designed to treat transverse shear and volumetric locking effects, are then compared with well-established references in the literature, including experimental and numerical studies, where, for the latter <b>case,</b> <b>shell</b> finite elements are dominantly used (as can be seen, for instance, in reference [5]) ...|$|E
