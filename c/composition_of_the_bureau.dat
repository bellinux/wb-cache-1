5000|$|Critics of Sarkozy {{claimed it}} was [...] "illegal" [...] for him to name the party [...] "Republicans" [...] because every French person is a republican if they support the values and ideals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Republic that emanated from the French Revolution, and as such the term is above party politics.

50|$|The {{formation}} of the political bureau was a significant event for many reasons. The <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureau</b> could hardly be faulted as it included {{men and women of}} character and learning; it also served as an early move for Babangida to co-opt, cultivate and involve intellectuals in the elaborate Transition civil rule Programme. In preparation, Babangida released political detainees, repealed the Decree 4 of 1984 and promised a respect for fundamental human rights. Within two years of seizing the reins of government, Babangida had the support of a large swathe of the country; there were few dissensions. When it started to be obvious to discerning members of the bureau that all was not well with Babangida's plans, {{only a few of the}} members took decisive action.|$|E
5000|$|Once again, the baby-boom {{generation}} {{has become a}} generator of change, this time in its retirement. Moreover, <b>the</b> jobless recovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2001 recession, coupled with the severe economic impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2007-2009 recession, caused disruptions in the labor market. In the first 12 years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population has slowed and labor force participation rates generally have declined. As a result, labor force growth also has slowed. <b>The</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the next 10 years will bring about an aging labor force that is growing slowly, a declining overall labor force participation rate, and more diversity in the racial and ethnic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor force. <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> Labor Statistics, Monthly Labor Review, December 2013.|$|R
50|$|The Soviets, {{trying to}} {{increase}} their influence in Luanda, began sending busts of Vladimir Lenin, a plane full of brochures with Brezhnev's speech at the February 1976 Party Congress, and two planes full of pamphlets denouncing Mao Zedong, to Angola. They sent so many busts that they ran out in <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1976 and requested more from the CPSU Propaganda Department. Despite <b>the</b> best efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet propaganda machine and persistent lobbying by G. A. Zverev, the Soviet chargé d'affaires, Neto stood his ground, refusing to grant the permanent military bases the Soviets so desperately wanted in Angola. Neto allies like Defense Minister Iko Carreira and MPLA General Secretary Lúcio Lara also irked the Soviet leadership through both for their policies and personalities. With Alves out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, the Soviet Union promoted Prime Minister Lopo do Nascimento, another 'internationalist', against Neto, a 'careerist,' for the MPLA's leadership. Neto moved swiftly to crush his adversary. The MPLA-PT's Central Committee met from December 6 to 9. The Committee concluded the meeting by firing Nascimento as both Prime Minister and as Secretary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Politburo, <b>the</b> Director <b>of</b> National Television, and <b>the</b> Director <b>of</b> Jornal de Angola. Commander C. R. Dilolua resigned as Second Deputy Prime Minister and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Politburo. Later that month the Committee abolished <b>the</b> positions <b>of</b> Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Paving the way for dos Santos, Neto increased <b>the</b> ethnic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MPLA-PT's political <b>bureau</b> as he replaced the hardline Old Guard with new blood.|$|R
