25|$|During {{the main}} {{fundraising}} campaign {{to build the}} organization's endowment fund, which launched in October 1921, the Wilson Foundation named <b>chairs</b> <b>for</b> each state to coordinate fundraising activities on a state basis.

This system was roughly analogous to the wartime sales of Liberty bonds, which made similar use of formal state and local officers to coordinate sales. By the end of September 1921, chair of the National Executive Committee Cleveland Dodge boasted that 37 of the 48 American states had been organized on such a basis.

25|$|The {{rickshaw}} {{was first}} imported from Japan in 1870 by an American businessman. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking {{at more than}} 7,000 {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Rickshaws competed with sedan <b>chairs</b> <b>for</b> customers depending on their budget, haste, or terrain to be negotiated. The rickshaw was more rapid, but was not suited to climbing the steep terrain of Hong Kong Island. Before Hong Kong's Peak Tram went into service in 1888, wealthy residents of The Peak were carried on sedan chairs by coolies up the steep paths to their residence, including former Governor Sir Richard MacDonnell's summer home, where they could take advantage of the cooler climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} then dry-docked for her fitting out (at {{the moment of}} the launching, the ship was merely an empty shell, without machines, installations, or funnels). At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed. However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its {{function}} was the ventilation of the kitchen and the storage of deck <b>chairs.</b> <b>For</b> her propulsion, Olympic was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines. The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the SS Laurentic two years before.|$|E
