Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the <b>core</b> spun <b>threads.</b> The <b>core</b> spun black <b>threads</b> were stronger than the <b>core</b> spun white <b>threads</b> in loop breaking strength.

Therefore, we can predict that the upper limit of the prototypes is 16  mm. Based on the above discussion, we use a pipe with an inner diameter of 14  mm.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of attenuation by woven structures produced from hybrid yarns.

The idea of creating hybrid yarns that may intensively protect against EMFs comes from the analogy discovered between {{the construction of a}} fancy bunch yarn and an electric system composed of electro-conductive solenoids on a ferromagnetic material connected in series and then in parallel. The application of hybrid fancy yarn as a weft made of copper as a special effect thread insulated with lacquer and wrapped around a core of steel thread in a textile fabric will enable EMF attenuation as a result of inducing an electromotive force in the special effect thread and magnetizing the <b>core</b> <b>thread.</b> In this way, the designed electric circuit (textile fabric) in the variable primary EMF will be the source of a secondary EMF directed opposite to the direction of the primary field.

Two PES yarns were fed to the nozzle as <b>core</b> <b>threads</b> and one as wrap effect. The properties of threads manufactured alternatively with thermosetting and without it are studied in dependence on overfeed of wrap yarn and pressure of air fed into the texturing nozzle. ZWICK/ROELL BDO-FBO. 5 TH testing machine with a 50 N load cell was used performing the tests. Mechanical properties of the PES multifilament yarns are markedly changed by air-texturing. Breaking tenacities of PES/PES air-textured sewing threads are only one half of those of the raw PES yarn due to core-wrap structure of the air-textured threads and the disordering of filaments of <b>core</b> <b>threads</b> during air-texturing. PES/PES threads are pretty less responsive to loop testing if comparing with straight thread test than the raw PES yarn. Air-pressure and overfeed in texturing are influential factors in respect of stress-strain properties and loop strength of air-textured PES/PES sewing threads. Their influence is markedly affected by thread thermosetting: lower air pressure and overfeed values are advantageous factors while texturing without thermosetting but they are disadvantageous ones while texturing with thermosetting. The thermosetting of threads does not markedly influences relaxation behaviour of air-textured PES/PES threads, but the thermoset threads show to have more stable elastic power at higher strains...|$|R

40|$|This study {{offers a}} method applied in {{injection}} mould with automatic thread demoulding by using servo {{control and the}} combination of mechanical structures. In injection moulding, using hydraulic motor to drive gears and cores with thread for automatically taking plastic-injected parts with thread off from the cores is a common method for thread demoulding. The thread demoulding is completed by two movements. One of them is realized by {{the rotation of the}} threaded cores driven by hydraulic motor; the other is to stop the injected plastic part from turning and meanwhile push it out by a pushing plate. The pushing plate is usually driven by springs which give forces that vary with the distance the plate travels. Because of this, the displacement of the pushing plate might be different from that of displacement of the <b>core</b> <b>thread</b> goes along the core axis. Thus the parts moulded may be damaged at the thread area on the part when the automatic thread demoulding is proceeding. This technique needs much to be improved hereon in injection moulding. In this study, the author brings up a solution that the hydraulic motor is replaced by a step motor and the pushing plate is driven by a servo motor. And there is a programmable logic controller to synchronize the two movements driven by the motors. Through the improvement the mechanism is substantially enhanced compared with the spring-driven pushing demoulding system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the recent}} years {{virtually}} all processor architectures employ multiple cores per chip (CMPs). It {{is possible to}} use legacy (i. e., single-core) power saving techniques in CMPs which run either sequential applications or independent multithreaded workloads. However, new challenges arise when running parallel shared-memory applications. In the later case, sacrificing some performance in a single <b>core</b> (<b>thread)</b> {{in order to be}} more energy-efficient might unintentionally delay the rest of cores (threads) due to synchronization points (locks/barriers), therefore, harming the performance of the whole application. CMPs increasingly face thermal and power-related problems during their typical use. Such problems can be solved by setting a power budget to the processor/core. This paper initially studies the behavior of different techniques to match a predefined power budget in a CMP processor. While legacy techniques properly work for thread independent/multiprogrammed workloads, parallel workloads exhibit the problem of independently adapting the power of each core in a thread dependent scenario. In order to solve this problem we propose a novel mechanism, Power Token Balancing (PTB), aimed at accurately matching an external power constraint by balancing the power consumed among the different cores using a power token-based approach while optimizing the energy efficiency. We can use power (seen as tokens or coupons) from non-critical threads for the benefit of critical threads. PTB runs transparent for thread independent / multiprogrammed workloads and can be also used as a spinlock detector based on power patterns. Results show that PTB matches more accurately a predefined power budget (total energy consumed over the budget is reduced to 8 % for a 16 -core CMP) than DVFS with only a 3 % energy increase. Finally, we can trade accuracy on matching the power budget for energy-efficiency reducing the energy a 4 % with a 20 % of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores a 5 -year {{period in}} the {{political}} history of Spain. It looks at a series of political processes and projects, beginning with the 15 M/Indignados social movement. These projects go from 15 M in 2011 {{to the creation of}} new digital platforms for participatory democracy for the city of Barcelona in 2016. The thesis defends the idea that these cases add up to a cycle of political contention, which is defined as “the 15 M cycle of contention”. It supports the idea that a <b>core</b> <b>thread</b> throughout the cycle has been the challenging of the liberal representative model of democracy and some of its key social forms, primarily in discourse, but also in practice. The cases within the cycle vindicated, and experimented with, alternative forms and practices of democracy. Concretely, they tried {{to move away from the}} current liberal representative model, preeminent since XVIII century, towards a more participatory one. The thesis also defends the argument that a key driver of these democratic experiments has been “technopolitics”, otherwise, practices and processes that hybridize politics and technologies (particularly, information and communication technologies). The thesis focuses on three paradigmatic cases of the 15 M cycle of contention: 15 M itself, a social movement born in 2011; the X party, a new party created in 2013 by 15 M activists; and Decidim. barcelona, a digital platform for participation, launched in early 2016 by the Barcelona City Council, designed by people involved in previous projects within the 15 M cycle. The first of these three cases covers the sphere of social movements and civil society, the second, that of political parties, and the third, that of the State at the municipal level. I look at the discourses and the practices of democracy in these processes and projects, and whether they innovate or not in relation to pre-existing political forms in social movements, political parties, and the State. In every case I look at the technopolitics deployed by the actors involved. For analyzing such technopolitics, I look at three main elements: discourses, practices, and technological infrastructures. These are used, respectively, as the main entry into the semantics, the pragmatics and the syntax of technopolitics. As a complementary view, I look beyond the cases and into the cycle. Concretely, to the variations in discourses on democracy and technopolitical practices. I suggest that the cycle as a whole can be conceived as: a) a process of “reassembling of democracy”, a reassembling oriented towards a democratization of the political field (and society more broadly) beyond the liberal representative model; and b) as a case of “technopolitical contention”, in which political struggles have been organically connected to technological practices. Since, differently from traditional democratization processes from XVIII century onwards, this one has not been oriented to establish but to challenge the structures of liberal representative democracy (f. i. : the current structure and centrality of representation, traditional political parties, Parliaments, etc.), I define it as an attempt at “alter-democratization”. I also show that this alter-democratization process challenges not only the forms, but also the ontology of liberal representative democracy, concretely, some of its key subjective and collective forms, as well as its key modes of political relation. By looking at civil society, parties and State institutions I try to map changes in various areas of the political field in liberal democracies. In that sense, the cycle has pointed towards (although has not always succeeded in bringing about) alternative political ontologies and forms of life. In order to analyze both the cycle and the three key cases under study, I have recurred to a multi-method and multi-disciplinary approach. I have primarily relied on qualitative methods, such as participant observation, fieldwork, interviews, and digital materials (blog posts, journals, etc.). I spent more than 5 years as participant in various 15 M cycle projects. Secondarily, I have used quantitative methods: along with fellow activists and researchers, in 2014 we ran a digital survey that gathered 1000 + responses among 15 M participants. Finally, I have also used social network analysis methods to map activity on social networks. In terms of disciplines, I primarily draw resources from political science, sociology, philosophy, and STS...|$|E
