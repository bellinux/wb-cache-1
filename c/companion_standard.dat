50|$|IEC 60870-5-103 IEC103 is a {{standard}} for power system control and associated communications. It defines a <b>companion</b> <b>standard</b> that enables interoperability between protection equipment and devices of a control system in a substation. The device complying with this standard can send the information using two methods for data transfer - either using the explicitly specified application service data units (ASDU) or using generic services for transmission of all the possible information. The standard supports some specific protection functions and provides the vendor a facility to incorporate its own protective functions on private data ranges.|$|E
