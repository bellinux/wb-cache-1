The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} review on our recent {{experimental}} investigations into the phase behavior of the deeply cooled <b>water</b> <b>confined</b> in a nanoporous silica material, MCM- 41, with elastic neutron scattering technique. Under such strong confinement, the homogeneous nucleation process of water is avoided, which allows the <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> to keep its liquid state at temperatures and pressures that are inaccessible to the bulk water. By measuring the average density of the <b>confined</b> heavy <b>water,</b> we observe a likely first-order low-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) transition in the deeply cooled region of the <b>confined</b> heavy <b>water.</b> The phase separation starts from 1. 12 +- 0. 17 kbar and 215 +- 1 K and extends to higher pressures and lower temperatures in the phase diagram.

5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers. The primary naval opponent {{for the duration of the}} war was the Austro-Hungarian Navy; the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, believed the threat from submarines in the <b>confined</b> <b>waters</b> of the Adriatic was too serious to permit an active fleet policy. He therefore planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats conducted raids. The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the event that the Austro-Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases. As a result, the ship's career during the war was limited. During the war, Regina Elena and her three sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat. On 1415 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuring Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Regina Elena and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to permit them to join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} year, the French continued to attack British trade convoys, achieving important victories at the Action of 18 November 1809 and the Action of 3 July 1810, where they captured another five East Indiamen {{as well as}} numerous smaller merchant ships and a large Portuguese frigate. Rowley too was active, commanding the successful Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and renaming the island Île Bourbon, basing his squadron at Saint Paul on the island's eastern shore. From this base, Rowley's ships were ideally positioned to begin a close blockade of Isle de France, led initially by Captain Samuel Pym in HMS Sirius. Pym sought to reduce French movement by seizing a number of fortified offshore islands, starting with Île de la Passe off Grand Port. The island was captured, but when a French squadron broke through the British blockade and took shelter in Grand Port, Pym resolved to attack them. The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for Rowley's squadron, as Pym led four of Rowley's five frigates into the bay without adequately assessing the channel through the coral reefs that sheltered the harbour. As a result, two frigates grounded {{out of range of}} the enemy and the remaining two were outnumbered in <b>confined</b> <b>waters.</b> In a complicated battle lasting several days, two of Pym's frigates were captured and two more had to be scuttled, with their entire crews made prisoner.

Hollins was sure that the threat from the Gulf was much more severe than Richmond thought, so {{he was prepared to}} listen when General Lovell pleaded for him to come down to New Orleans to help in its defense. When there, he sent a telegram to Richmond seeking permission to attack Farragut's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar. His pleas were so insistent that they virtually amounted to insubordination. Hollins was called to Richmond, ostensibly to serve on an examination board, but in effect to be removed from active service. By default, command of the Confederate Navy vessels in the vicinity of New Orleans fell on the shoulders of Commander William C. Whittle, up to that time commandant of the navy yard there. Whittle did not consider himself able to handle all of his new duties, so on April 18 he passed command of CSS McRae, Jackson, and Manassas, together with their support vessels, to his executive officer, Commander John K. Mitchell. These were all the Confederate Naval vessels afloat at the time; Louisiana and Mississippi had not yet been launched, and were explicitly not controlled by Whittle or Mitchell. Later, when Louisiana was launched but before she was completed, she joined the others in Mitchell's domain.|$|E

40|$|Water is {{ubiquitous}} but mysterious. It exhibits anomalous thermodynamic behaviors at low temperatures. In addition, the glassy water, {{also called}} amorphous ice, exhibits polyamorphism. These phenomena could be understood if one accepts that a first-order low-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) phase transition {{exists in the}} deeply cooled region (below 230 K) of water. However, the experimental test on the LDL and HDL in bulk water is practically difficult due to the crystallization below the homogeneous nucleation temperature (~ 232 K at atm). It is found that, by <b>confining</b> <b>water</b> in a hydrophilic nanoporous material, MCM- 41, the homogeneous nucleation process can be avoided, which allows us to keep water in liquid state at least down to 130 K. Therefore, the <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> provides {{us an opportunity to}} detect the hypothetical HDL and LDL in the deeply cooled region of water. This thesis is devoted to the detection of the first-order LDL-to-HDL transition in the <b>water</b> <b>confined</b> in MCM- 41. In this thesis, the phase behaviors of the deeply cooled <b>water</b> <b>confined</b> in MCM- 41 are investigated. With elastic neutron scattering, we measure the average density of the <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> at low temperatures and high pressures. The results show the existence of a first-order LDL-to-HDL transition in such system. The phase separation starts from 1. 12 0. 17 kbar and 215 1 K and extends to higher pressures and lower temperatures in the phase diagram. This starting point could be the liquid-liquid critical point of the <b>confined</b> <b>water.</b> The locus of the Widom line in the phase diagram is also determined. Parallel to the density measurement, the dynamic properties, including the so-called "boson peak", the librational motion, and the relaxation process of the <b>confined</b> <b>water,</b> are also studied with dynamic neutron scattering. The time scales of these motions cover a broad range from 10 - 2 picosecond to hundreds of nanoseconds. The results confirm the phase diagram obtained with the density measurement and show that the HDL and LDL differ in the hydrogen-bond strength and the configuration of the local hydrogen-bond network. Combining all the experimental results, we provide a clear evidence for the existence of the LDL and HDL in the <b>confined</b> <b>water.</b> Water is crucial to protein dynamics. We investigate the role water plays in sub-picosecond collective vibration of protein with inelastic X-ray scattering and find that the hydration water makes the intraprotein longitudinal phonons "softer". We also study the slow dynamics of the protein hydration water with quasi-elastic neutron scattering. A hydration-dependent dynamic crossover phenomenon is found. The observation of the liquid-liquid transition in the <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> has potential to explain the mysterious behaviors of water at low temperatures. In addition, it may also have impact on other disciplines, because the <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> system represents many biological and geological systems where water resides in nanoscopic pores or in the vicinity of hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. by Zhe Wang.
