40|$|Abstract: In today’s {{neoliberal}} audit cultures university rankings, {{quantitative evaluation}} of publications by JIF (Journal Impact Factor) or researchers by h-index (Hirsch-Index) {{are believed to}} be indispensable instruments for “quality assurance” in the sciences. Most of these performance rankings employ citation data provided by huge for-profit North-American media corporation Thomson Reuters (TR). Today TR’s influence on funding decisions, individual careers, departments, universities, disciplines and countries is immense and ambivalent. Yet there is increasing resistance against “impactitis” and “evaluitis”. Usually overseen: Trivial errors in Thomson Reuters’ <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> (SCI, SSCI, AHCI) produce severe non-trivial effects: Their victims are authors, institutions, journals with names beyond the ASCII-code and scholars of humanities and social sciences. Based on the “Joshua Lederberg Papers” (provided by the National Library of Medicine) I claim: the eventually successful ‘invention’ of science <b>citation</b> <b>indexing</b> is a product of contingent factors and strategies. To overcome severe resistance (no interest, almost no grants, heavy criticism) Eugene Garfield, the ‘father’ of <b>citation</b> <b>indexing,</b> and his most important mentor and advocate Joshua Lederberg had to foster overoptimistic attitudes and to downplay the severe problems connected to global and multidisciplinary <b>citation</b> <b>indexing.</b> The difficulties to handle different formats of references and footnotes, non-Anglo-American names, and of publications in non-English languages were known to the pioneers of <b>citation</b> <b>indexing.</b> Nowadays the rich corporation Thomson Reuters is the owner of the citation databases founded by Garfield.

40|$|Effectiveness {{of academia}} has usually been {{evaluated}} {{by using the}} number of publications. However, indexing with natural language on <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> makes evaluation process problematic for author affiliation. Affiliation information mistakes made by authors or editors can cause confusion during the indexing period. Consequently, visibility of the institutions in the <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> may reduce, different rankings for institutions may emerge and bibliometric studies may generate inaccurate results. It {{is important to understand}} these standardization problems in <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> to be able to fix them. The main aim {{of this study is to}} present name confusions of author affiliations within the <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> by using the example of the names of Turkish Training and Research Hospitals (TRH). In order to achieve this, 198, 687 publications within the Web of Science, addressed in Turkey and produced between 1928 and 2009 were evaluated. The preliminary findings show that there are 65 unique TRHs which were mentioned with several different formats in the address section of the <b>citation</b> <b>indexes.</b> All these varying affiliation information were unified as a standard format for this study. It is observed that the names of these hospitals cause the main confusion. For example, there are four different “Numune TRH”s in different cities of Turkey. In such a case, if the author does not mention the city name in the address field, confusion becomes inevitable. In addition to that, affiliation information mistakes generally appear in the form of wrong spelling, abbreviation and translation mistakes. Findings of thi...|$|R
40|$|<b>Citation</b> <b>indexes</b> have {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} many researchers in the recent years. In this {{paper we propose a}} new class of <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> which is shown to generalize most of the <b>citation</b> <b>indexes</b> in the existing literature (h-, g-, f-, t-index). The class of indexes is obtained borrowing from the notion of ``certainty equivalent income'' or ``equally distributed equivalent income'' which has been largely implemented in the field of risk and inequality measurement. As a result citation orderings are shown to depend on a parameter of concentration/dispersion aversion capturing the value judgments of the decision-maker with respect to the distribution of citations. In order to verify the sensitivity of scientific productivity orderings with respect to concentration/dispersion aversion, an empirical application to a representative sample of Italian academic economists is presented. ...|$|R

The low share of social sciences compared to natural sciences may reflect {{that this is a}} common pattern in Asian nations, that Chinese social scientists publish in national journals not included in the Index and have less career incitements regarding publishing in international journals, and that state ideology and control is more important for social sciences than natural sciences.
