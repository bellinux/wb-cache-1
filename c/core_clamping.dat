40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the result of}} an investigation on the effect of rubber material <b>clamp</b> of <b>core</b> lamination with stagger yoke on three 100 kVA three-phase distribution transformer. The investigation involves the variation of power loss, building factor and the total harmonic distortion of flux. The method that used in the measurement is a no load test. Loss at the <b>core</b> of the <b>clamps</b> of wood is lower than the <b>core</b> without <b>clamps</b> and using rubber materials clamp. The Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of flux is larger in the <b>core</b> using wood <b>clamp</b> material and smaller in the <b>core</b> assembled without <b>clamp,</b> over the whole flux density range. Using wood material <b>clamp</b> of <b>core</b> lamination in transformer core is more efficient than using the other two types of transformer core lamination. In which the use of rubber in addition as clamp material will increase the losses in transformer core due to the surface area of <b>core</b> <b>clamp</b> is inhibit and not easily released to air in a short period...|$|R

30|$|Genome {{duplication}} in E. coli {{is carried}} out by DNA polymerase III, an enzyme complex consisting of ten subunits. Investigations of the biochemical and structural properties of DNA polymerase III require the expression and purification of subunits including α, ge, θ, γ, δ′, δ, and β separately followed by in vitro reconstitution of the pol III <b>core</b> and <b>clamp</b> loader. Here we propose a new method for expressing and purifying DNA polymerase III components by utilizing a protein co-expression strategy. Our {{results show that the}} subunits of the pol III core and those of the clamp loader can be coexpressed and purified based on inherent interactions between the subunits. The resulting pol III <b>core,</b> <b>clamp</b> loader and sliding clamp can be reconstituted effectively to perform DNA polymerization. Our strategy considerably simplifies the expression and purification of DNA polymerase III and provides a feasible and convenient method for exploring other multi-subunit systems.|$|R

40|$|Baboon {{reovirus}} (BRV) is {{a member}} of the fusogenic subgroup of orthoreoviruses. Unlike most other members of its genus, BRV lacks S-segment coding sequences for the outer fiber protein that binds to cell surface receptors. It shares this lack with aquareoviruses, which constitute a related genus and are also fusogenic. We used electron cryomicroscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to determine the BRV virion structure at 9. 0 -Å resolution. The results show that BRV lacks a protruding fiber at its icosahedral 5 -fold axes or elsewhere. The results also show that BRV is like nonfusogenic mammalian and fusogenic avian orthoreoviruses in having 150 copies of the <b>core</b> <b>clamp</b> protein, not 120 as in aquareoviruses. On the other hand, there are no hub-and-spoke complexes attributable to the outer shell protein in the P 2 and P 3 solvent channels of BRV, which makes BRV like fusogenic avian orthoreoviruses and aquareoviruses but unlike nonfusogenic mammalian orthoreoviruses. The outermost “flap ” domains of the BRV core turret protein appear capable of conformational variability within the virion, a trait previously unseen among other ortho-and aquareoviruses. New cDNA sequence determinations for the BRV L 1 and M 2 genome segments, encoding the core turret and outer shell proteins, were helpful for interpreting the structural features of those proteins. Based on these findings, we conclude that the evolution of ortho- and aquareoviruses has included a series of discrete gains or losses of particular components, several of which cross taxonomic boundaries.

30|$|The {{decrement}} in maximum voluntary torque with passive hyperthermia (study 1) {{was associated}} with a decrement in voluntary activation (Figure  1). The level of hyperthermia imposed in the study 1 (i.e., <b>core</b> temperature <b>clamped</b> at 39 °C) was selected to induce significant neural alterations (Racinais and Cresswell 2013). Consequently, the current observations confirm previous reports that passive hyperthermia reduces voluntary drive to human skeletal muscles (Morrison et al. 2004; Thomas et al. 2006; Racinais et al. 2008; Périard et al. 2011). However, the current data demonstrated that warming the skin only (study 2) did not affect torque production or voluntary activation (Figure  1). These results confirm a previous study concluding that core temperature, rather than local thermal afferent input from the skin, mediates the alteration in neural drive (Thomas et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are critical}} components within the electrical power network. In {{the event that}} a failure occurs in service, the impact can be far reaching. Not only causing extended outages, but costly repairs and potentially serious injury or fatality can result. The concept of Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) has been successfully used as a diagnostic technique to detect winding deformation, <b>core</b> and <b>clamping</b> structure for power transformers. However, because FRA has been relying on graphical analysis, it calls for an expert person to analyse the results. So far, there are no standard codes for FRA interpretation. This paper investigates the impact of parameters variation of a high frequency transformer model based on distributed parameters approach on the FRA signature.

Recruitment curves of the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) and compound motor potential (M-wave), and homo-synaptic post-activation depression (HPAD) recovery curves were obtained in 14 volunteers during normothermia (CON, ~ 37. 3 ºC) and hyperthermia (HOT, <b>core</b> temperature <b>clamped</b> at ~ 39. 0 ºC). Electromyographic responses were obtained from the soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles following electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve at varying intensities and paired-pulse frequencies (0. 07 Hz to 10 Hz). Results showed that maximal amplitude of the H-reflex was reached at a similar intensity of stimulation in CON and HOT (p > 0. 47), with a similar associated M-wave (p > 0. 69). However, maximal H-reflex amplitude was significantly lower in HOT than CON (p 0. 23). In summary, hyperthermia alters neuromuscular and Ia-afferent pathway transmission, albeit the latter without an increase in HPAD...|$|R

40|$|Transcription {{initiation}} by eukaryotic RNA polymerase (Pol) III {{relies on}} the TFIIE-related subcomplex C 82 / 34 / 31. Here we combine crosslinking and hydroxyl radical probing to position the C 82 / 34 / 31 subcomplex around the Pol III active center cleft. The extended winged helix (WH) domains 1 and 4 of C 82 localize to the polymerase domains clamp head and <b>clamp</b> <b>core,</b> respectively, and the two WH domains of C 34 span the polymerase cleft from the coiled-coil region of the clamp to the protrusion. The WH domains of C 82 and C 34 apparently cooperate with other mobile regions flanking the cleft during promoter DNA binding, opening, and loading. Together with published data, our results complete the subunit architecture of Pol III and indicate that all TFIIE-related components of eukaryotic and archaeal transcription systems adopt an evolutionarily conserved location in {{the upper part of}} the cleft that supports their functions in open promoter complex formation and stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Background: DNA {{polymerase}} III, {{the main}} enzyme responsible for bacterial DNA replication, {{is composed of}} three sub-assemblies: the polymerase <b>core,</b> the b-sliding <b>clamp,</b> and the clamp loader. During replication, single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) coats and protects single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and also interacts with the cψ heterodimer, a sub-complex of the clamp loader. Whereas the c subunits of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are about 40 % homologous, P. aeruginosa ψ is {{twice as large as}} its E. coli counterpart, and contains additional sequences. It was shown that P. aeruginosa cψ together with SSB increases the activity of its cognate clamp loader 25 -fold at low salt. The E. coli clamp loader, however, is insensitive to the addition of its cognate cψ under similar conditions. In order to find out distinguishing properties within P. aeruginosa cψ which account for this higher stimulatory effect, we characterized P. aeruginosa cψ by a detailed structural and functional comparison with its E. coli counterpart. Results: Using small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and homology-based modeling, we found the N-terminus of P. aeruginosa ψ to be unstructured.

40|$|All-metal {{sandwich}} construction holds promise for {{significant improvements in}} stiffness, strength and blast resistance for built-up plate structures. Analysis {{of the performance of}} sandwich plates under various loads, static and dynamic, requires modelling of face sheets and core with some fidelity. While it is possible to model full geometric details of the core for a few selected problems, this is unnecessary and unrealistic for larger complex structures under general loadings. In this paper, a continuum constitutive model is proposed as an alternative means of modelling the core. The constitutive model falls within the framework of a compressible rate-independent, anisotropic elastic– plastic solid. The general form of the model is presented, along with algorithmic aspects of its implementation in a finite element code, and selected problems are solved which benchmark the code against existing codes for limiting cases and which illustrate features specific to compress-ible cores. Three core geometries (pyramidal truss, folded plate, and square honeycomb) are con-sidered in some detail. The validity of the approach is established by comparing numerical finite element simulations using the model with those obtained by a full three-dimensional meshing of the core geometry {{for each of the three}} types of <b>cores</b> for a <b>clamped</b> sandwich plate subject to uniform pressure load. Limitations of the model are also discussed. Copyright 2004 John Wiley &...|$|R

40|$|This project {{investigated}} the non-thermal factors which influence {{the control of}} eccrine sweating during exercise, with particular emphasis upon mechanoreceptor feedback and feedforward regulation. The aim of this project was to attempt to differentiate between these two neural pathways using three experimental treatments (active exercise; passive exercise and passive heating), with <b>core</b> temperature <b>clamped</b> among treatments and two pedal frequencies used for both the active and passive exercise conditions. It was hypothesised that during active (dynamic) exercise, sweat rates (m_(subscript SW)) and sweat expulsion frequencies (f(subscript SW)) would exceed those of the passive exercise and passive heating trials. It was expected that, when the pedal force was doubled during the active exercise trials, both the m_(subscript SW) and f(subscript SW) would exceed those values observed at the lower pedal force. Ten male subjects participated in five experimental trials: (a) two active (dynamic) exercise trials, in which the subjects voluntarily cycled at two different pedal frequencies; (b) two passive exercise trials, in which subjects were driven at the same two pedal frequencies, but did not actively recruite muscles to either track or resist the pedal motion; and (c) a seated resting trial, with subjects passively heated to track core temperature (T(subscript C)) changes in the other conditions. The combination of a water-perfusion garment and a climate chamber was used to increase and clamp T(subscript C) at similar rates across the five trials. During these trials, the following variables were measured: core temperatures at the oesophagus (T(subscript es)), auditory canal (T(subscript ac)), and the rectum (T(subscript re)); skin temperatures at eight sites; m_(subscript sw) were measured simultaneously at six locations; f(subscript sw) were identified using sweat data from the forehead and forearm sites; cardiac frequency (f(subscript c); ventricular depolarisation); thermal sensation; and ratings of perceived exertion. Of particular interest for this project were the variables of m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw), {{and how they were}} affected by differences in pedal frequency (active versus passive exercise) and passive heating. The primary observation for these trials was that, when comparing the active and passive trials at the same pedal frequency, m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) were very similar for each of the pedal frequencies, in the period from 15 to 25 minutes. However, the initial comparisons between m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) of the active and passive trials were significantly different. When comparing trials at different pedal frequencies, but within the active exercise mode, a consistent trend in the m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) was observed, with both being at 80 rev. min- 1, relative to 40 rev. min- 1 trials, though this was not statistically significant. For the same comparison in the passive exercise mode, the principal difference was the thermal load which was imposed on the subjects, with the data from the seated resting trials being greater than both the passive and active exercise trials. These observations may be interpreted in the following manner. First, the role of joint and muscle mechanoreceptors feedback may have been an influencing factor in the similarities of m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) in the period from 15 - 25 minutes. Second, in the active exercise trials, the initiation of sweating seemed to be more related to central feedforward command, a non-thermal influence, while the passive and seated resting trials, were related more to feedback control, created from the differences in thermal gradient of T(subscript c) and T(subscript sk). Third, it would seem that thermal and non-thermal influences both {{play a role in the}} control of sweating, but their relative contribution may be modified by internal temperature and skin temperature changes...|$|R
