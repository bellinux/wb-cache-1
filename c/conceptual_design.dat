5|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>design</b> of a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method.

After examining six possible locations for {{a permanent}} repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant.

40|$|This study {{develops}} an empirically and theoretically grounded {{explanation of}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing.</b> <b>Conceptual</b> <b>designing</b> is a concept-mediated planning {{activity that is}} typically collaborative and {{involves the use of}} semiotic resources such as talk, text, figures, pictures, visualisations, diagrams, sketching, and gesturing. Central to <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing</b> is the intent to articulate high-level simplifications, design concepts, which guide the strategic decision-making over a thing-to-be-designed and inform detailed designing. The original main contribution of the study is an explanation of <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing</b> in terms of project-specific learning. It is assumed that the changes in the ways a project team articulates, talks about, refers to, and makes changes to a thing-to-be-designed, are indicative of project-specific learning. A novel method for the investigation of project-specific learning is presented, namely Framing Analysis of Design Articulation (FADA), and a set of analytical concepts for the investigation and conduct of <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing</b> are introduced. With FADA it is possible to investigate designers’ construction of semiotic resources, which are necessary when designers create a framing strategy for their project. As the result of investigating two real projects the study sheds light on to the deep dilemmas inherent in <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing</b> as well as delivers concrete insights for its facilitation. The work is conducted as part of the practice-based tradition, and aspires to be associated to such works that have been able to make a doubly methodological contribution; to the methodology of studying design practice by introducing theoretical insights, methods, and analytical concepts; and to the approach that designers employ in conducting <b>conceptual</b> <b>designing.</b> The key benefit of the present work for designers is the uncovering {{of the importance of the}} preliminary activities of developing semiotic resources for the construction of the design concept, i. e. the value of priming, and the significance of preliminary structuring of attention and articulation through what will be called pre-framing...|$|R

25|$|A decimal {{number system}} using hieroglyphics {{dates back to}} 3000 BC in Egypt, and was later in use in ancient India where the modern {{numeration}} system was developed. By the 9th century CE, the Hindu–Arabic numeral system was transmitted from India through the Middle East and {{to the rest of}} the world. The concept of 0 as a number, and not merely a symbol for separation is attributed to India. In India, practical calculations were carried out using zero, which was treated like any other number by the 9th century CE, even in case of division. Brahmagupta (598–668) was able to find (integral) solutions of Pell's equation. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>design</b> for a perpetual motion machine by Bhaskara II dates to 1150.

25|$|The program {{aimed at}} {{producing}} a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails.

This aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance. The program entailed two phases. Phase I explored the theory and result in a <b>conceptual</b> <b>design,</b> while Phase II would have resulted in the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs.|$|E

25|$|In 1869, at age 22, Westinghouse {{invented a}} {{railroad}} braking system using compressed air. The Westinghouse system used a compressor on the locomotive, a reservoir {{and a special}} valve on each car, and a single pipe running {{the length of the}} train (with flexible connections) which both refilled the reservoirs and controlled the brakes, allowing the engineer to apply and release the brakes simultaneously on all cars. It is a failsafe system, in that any rupture or disconnection in the train pipe will apply the brakes throughout the train. It was patented by Westinghouse on October 28, 1873. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's invention. It was in time nearly universally adopted by railways. Modern trains use brakes in various forms based on this design. The same <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> of fail-safe air brake is also found on heavy trucks.|$|E
25|$|A 1980 AMC Concord {{served as}} the test vehicle in s <b>conceptual</b> <b>design</b> study of the {{automotive}} Improved Gas Turbine (IGT) powertrain. Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable power turbine nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E
