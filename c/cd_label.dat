Translocation patterns {{to the root}} systems of two dry edible bean genotypes (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were examined after a 3 -day exposure to aerated and nonaerated environments. Localized anoxia of root systems was simulated by growing roots in split configurations and exposing half of the system to anoxic conditions. Anoxia of the root system for 72 hours reduced the movement of 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> into the roots with concurrent accumulations in the hypocotyl region. The translocation of 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> to anoxic roots was less than 50 % of the aerated controls of both genotypes. Most of the 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> translocated to anoxic root systems was excluded from respiratory metabolism during the 3 -hour pulse/chase period and was {{an order of magnitude}} less than the aerated controls. These observations suggest that the bulk of 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> which entered the root during the anoxic period was unavailable for metabolism by the enzymes of glycolysis and/or was diluted by a relatively large metabolite pool. A higher percentage of 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> was translocated to the aerated half of the localized anoxia treatment relative to the half of the aerated controls. The proportion of 14 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> translocated to the root system in the aerated control was 20 and 16 % compared to 28 and 25 % in the aerated localized anoxia treatment for the genotypes Seafarer and line 31908, respectively.

40|$|Tumor {{cells can}} adopt {{alternative}} metabolic pathways during oncogenesis. This {{is an event}} characterized by an enhanced utilization of glucose for rapid synthesis of macromolecules such as nucleotides, lipids and proteins. This phenomenon was {{also known as the}} `Warburg effect', distinguished by a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to increased aerobic glycolysis in many types of cancer cells. Increased aerobic glycolysis was also indicated with enhanced lactate production and glutamine consumption, and has been suggested to confer growth advantage for proliferating cells during oncogenic transformation. Development of a tracer-based methodology to determine de novo protein synthesis by tracing metabolic pathways from nutrient utilization may certainly enhance current understanding of nutrient gene interaction in cancer cells. We hypothesized that the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells as characterized by nutrient utilization for protein synthesis is significantly altered during oncogenesis, and 13 C stable isotope tracers may incorporate 13 C into non-essential amino acids of protein peptides during de novo protein synthesis to reflect the underlying mechanisms in cancer cell metabolism. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are: 1) To examine the effects of using siRNA to knockdown metabolic enzymes, transketolase (TKT) and adenylate kinase 2 (AK 2) of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in oral cancer cells. 2) To develop a 13 C stable isotope tracer-based approach for studying de novo protein synthesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma. 3) To develop a 13 C stable isotope tracer-based approach to investigate 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> proteins in TKT siRNA and control scrambled siRNA transfected oral cancer cells. 4) To develop a 13 C stable isotope tracer-based approach to determine differential 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> proteins in normal human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cells and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells via in-vitro and in-vivo. METHODS: Knockdown of TKT or AK 2 was achieved by transfecting oral cancer cells with small interfering RNA for TKT or AK 2. 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> of proteins was achieved by infusing cells in-vitro and in-vivo with [U - 13 C 6]-glucose. Protein samples were analyzed using proteomic approach based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein identification was performed by MASCOT database search. Protein clustering and functional annotation was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software. RESULTS: Knockdown of TKT or AK 2 in oral cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and displayed enhanced glucose, glutamine consumption, and lactate production. Knockdown of TKT in oral cancer cells displayed a decrease in 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> protein peptides for TKT compared to control. Overall, knockdown of TKT displayed lower frequency of 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> protein peptides compared to control, but comparison of the same 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> peptide displayed no significant difference in peptide mass isotopomer distribution. Enzymes involved in glycolysis including glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, enolase, and phosphoglycerate mutase also displayed enhanced 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> compared to control. 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> proteins among HPDE cells, PDAC cells, and PDAC mouse tumor tissue displayed differential labeling frequency primarily in vimentin, &# 946;-tubulin and cytoskeletal keratin proteins. Peptide mass isotopomer distribution displayed mass shift in 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> peptides compared to unlabeled (natural 12 C) peptide mass isotopomer distribution. Overall, 13 C enrichment of proteins achieved greater yield in cell lines compared to mouse tumor tissue. Structural proteins and metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, cell cycle, and apoptosis signaling pathways were predominately found labeled. CONCLUSION: This study, we have developed a novel methodology based on 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> of de novo synthesized proteins to study cancer cell metabolism. 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> of cancer cells with truncated PPP due to knock down of TKT suggested robust metabolic adaptation for glucose utilization. Differential expression of 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeled</b> proteins between HPDE cells and PDAC cells, suggested alteration in nutrient gene interaction and metabolic pathways for de novo synthesis during oncogenesis. Our findings demonstrated that 13 C stable isotope may serve as a valuable tracer-based tool for studying metabolic regulation of de novo protein synthesis in cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{in combination}} with 13 C-labeled substrate infusion is a unique technique to obtain information about dynamic metabolic fluxes noninvasively in vivo. In many cases, the in vivo information content obtained during dynamic 13 C studies in rodents can be enhanced by high-resolution 1 H-[13 C] NMR spectroscopy on brain extracts. Previously, {{it has been shown}} that 1 H NMR spectra from rat brain extracts can be accurately quantified with a spectral fitting routine utilizing simulated basis sets using complete prior knowledge of chemical shifts and scalar couplings. The introduction of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> into the various metabolites presents complications that demand modifications of the spectral fitting routine. As different multiplets within a given molecule accumulate various amounts of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label,</b> the fixed amplitude relationship between multiplets typical for 1 H NMR spectra must be abandoned. In addition, 13 C isotope effects lead to spectral multiplet patterns that become dependent on the amount of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> accumulation, thereby preventing the use of a common basis set. Here a modified spectral fitting routine is presented that accommodates variable 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> accumulation and 13 C isotope effects...|$|R

40|$|The C isotopic {{composition}} (d 13 C) of pedogenic carbonates reflects the photosynthetic pathway of the predominant local vegetation because pedogenic (secondary) CaCO 3 is formed in isotopic equilibrium with soil CO 2 released by root and rhizomicrobial respiration. Numerous studies show {{the importance of}} pedogenic carbonates {{as a tool for}} reconstructing paleoecological condi-tions in arid and semiarid regions. The methodological resolution of these studies strongly depends on the time scale of pedogenic carbonate formation, which remains unknown. The initial formation rate can be assessed by 14 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> of plants grown on loess and subsequent incorporation of 14 C from rhizosphere CO 2 into newly formed carbonate by recrystallization of loess CaCO 3. We tested the feasibility of 14 C and 13 C tracers for estimating CaCO 3 recrystalliza-tion rates by simultaneous 14 C and 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> and comparison with literature data. 14 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> was more efficient and precise in assessing recrystallization rates than 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling.</b> This is con-nected with higher sensitivity of 14 C liquid scintillation counting when compared with d 13 C mea-surement by IRMS.

40|$|AIM—To {{examine the}} {{gastrointestinal}} handling and metabolic disposal of emulsified [1 - 13 C]palmitic acid esterified into a triglyceride in nine healthy children and seven patients with cystic fibrosis on enzyme replacement treatment.  METHODS—After an overnight fast, each child was given 10 mg/kg body weight  [1, 1, 1 - 13 C]tripalmitin with a standardised test meal of low natural 13 C abundance. The total enrichment of 13 C {{was measured using}} isotope ratio mass spectrometry in stool collected {{for a period of}} up to five days and in breath samples collected over a 24 hour period.  RESULTS—The mean proportion of administered 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> excreted in stool was 6 % (range, 1 - 12. 7 %) in healthy children and 24. 6 % (range, 0 - 64 %) in patients with cystic fibrosis. Healthy children excreted 31. 3 % of the administered label on their breath (range, 14. 2 - 42. 9 %). Correcting the excretion of administered 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> on the breath for differences in digestion and absorption in patients with cystic fibrosis increased the difference between individuals from 0 - 31. 3 % of administered dose (mean, 17. 9 %) to 0 - 49. 1 % of absorbed dose (mean, 23. 2 %) and was poorly related to the amount of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> in stool.  CONCLUSION—Measurements of breath 13 CO 2 do not consistently reflect the gastrointestinal handling of emulsified 13 <b>C</b> <b>labelled</b> tripalmitin because of differences in digestion and absorption in cystic fibrosis. Further studies need to examine whether "breath tests" alone can predict with confidence the gastrointestinal handling of other 13 <b>C</b> <b>labelled</b> triglycerides and fatty acids. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{time series}} {{phospholipid}} fatty acid (PLFA) 13 C-labeling study was undertaken to determine methanotrophic taxon, calculate methanotrophic biomass, and assess carbon recycling in an upland brown earth soil from Bronydd Mawr (Wales, United Kingdom). Laboratory incubations of soils were performed at ambient CH 4 concentrations using synthetic air containing 2 {{parts per million}} of volume of 13 CH 4. Flowthrough chambers maintained a stable CH 4 concentration throughout the 11 -week incubation. Soils were analyzed at weekly intervals by gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry, and GC-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry to identify and quantify individual PLFAs and trace the incorporation of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> into the microbial biomass. Incorporation of the 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> was seen throughout the experiment, with the rate of incorporation decreasing after 9 weeks. The δ 13 C values of individual PLFAs showed that 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> was incorporated into different components to various extents and at various rates, reflecting the diversity of PLFA sources. Quantitative assessments of 13 C-labeled PLFAs showed that the methanotrophic population was of constant structure throughout the experiment. The dominant 13 C-labeled PLFA was 18 : 1 ω 7 c, with 16 : 1 ω 5 present at lower abundance, suggesting the presence of novel type II methanotrophs. The biomass of methane-oxidizing bacteria at optimum labeling {{was estimated to be}} about 7. 2 × 106 cells g− 1 of soil (dry weight). While recycling of 13 <b>C</b> <b>label</b> from the methanotrophic biomass must occur, it is a slower process than initial 13 CH 4 incorporation, with only about 5 to 10 % of 13 C-labeled PLFAs reflecting this process. Thus, 13 C-labeled PLFA distributions determined at any time point during 13 CH 4 incubation can be used for chemotaxonomic assessments, although extended incubations are required to achieve optimum 13 <b>C</b> <b>labeling</b> for methanotrophic biomass determinations...|$|R
