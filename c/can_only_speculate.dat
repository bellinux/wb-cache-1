The reason, it would seem, was … because {{he was convinced that}} any split between the two would be exploited by the politicians to further their own agendas”.|$|E

25|$|By {{manoeuvring}} {{in close}} to Kormoran, Burnett removed the advantage provided by his longer-ranged primary armament, and put Sydney {{in a position where}} the raider's main guns could penetrate the cruiser's armour. Because there were no Australian survivors, Burnett's decision is inexplicable; writers on the subject <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> on his reasoning, and indicate what factors they believe influenced him. Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating to the loss of Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, and placed his ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame {{for his role in the}} cruiser's demise.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Forcade-Biaix branch is {{complicated}} by the publication of false information concerning its origins in several affluent publications on the topic of nobility in Prussia and Europe. The first known publication of such information was in 1767, about 80 years after immigration in Prussia. The same information was reproduced in various forms in publications {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. One <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> if the information was knowingly furnished as false, or if it was the innocent result of confusing names that had been handed down verbally from two earlier generations already deceased. Claims published in the same publications that they held the rank of Marquis were, however, deliberately false.|$|E
25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this question is not very meaningful in the context of his life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
500|$|The two clearest {{examples}} of traditional power are {{the cases of}} [...] "kingly power" [...] and [...] "priestly power". Russell traces both back historically to certain roles which served some function in early societies. The priest is akin to the medicine man of a tribe, who {{is thought to have}} unique powers of cursing and healing at their disposal (Russell 1938:36). In most contemporary cases, priests rely on religious social movements grounded in charismatic authority, which have been more effective at usurping power than those religions that lack iconic founders (Russell 1938:39–40). The history of the king is more difficult to examine, and the researcher <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> on their origins. At the very least, the power of kingship seems to be advanced by war, even if warmaking was not the king's original function (Russell 1938:56).|$|E

500|$|Lisa Henderson {{commented on}} the {{intersection}} between social class and gender in the film, particularly Brandon's working-class status: [...] "My reading of Boys [...] {{through the lens of}} class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears {{to me to be a}} new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. [...] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life."

500|$|On November 11, 2004, it was {{reported}} that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, [...] "As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate.</b> We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota." [...] The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: [...] "We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes." [...] Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, [...] "Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody." [...] The following year Burger King took [...] "extra security precautions", when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|When {{originally}} used in Olney, it {{is unknown}} what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune [...] "Hephzibah" [...] by English composer John Jenkins Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable {{with a variety of}} tunes; more than twenty musical settings of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named [...] "New Britain", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies ("Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy [...] "the wants of the Church in her triumphal march". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but [...] "Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary" [...] had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to [...] "St. Mary", {{but that does not mean}} that he wrote it.|$|E
5000|$|After the 7th World Rover Moot, {{these events}} were {{dropped from the}} {{international}} Scouting calendar for thirty years. The reasons <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>speculated</b> on.

World Moot Years ended in 1982.|$|R
50|$|The word flesh-hook is {{relatively}} modern. The OED gives {{the origin of}} the word as 1325 AD, and defines it as a metal hook with a long stail, used to pull hides out of tan-pits or as a hook for pulling meat from the pot. It may also have been used as a tool to prod animals. The use of this flesh-hook in the Bronze-age <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>speculated.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{ubiquity of}} cameras and on-line photos since {{the rise of}} {{cellphone}} cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is {{to put together a}} slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration.

50|$|In 1827, Joseph Bailly {{chose the}} sand hill as a resting place {{for his son}} Robert.

Why he buried his son on this hill, three-fourths of {{a mile from the}} home, <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>speculated.</b> Perhaps he did so because it had already been used for burials. More likely, since he marked the place with a large cross, he chose the highest point in the area.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{accepted}} by most historians that first contact by Europeans {{was made by}} Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer who entered the bay in his ship La Dauphine in 1524 after visiting New York Bay. Verrazzano called the bay Refugio, the [...] "Refuge". It has several entrances, however, and historians <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> as to the exact route of his voyage and the location where he laid anchor, along with a corresponding uncertainty over which tribe made contact with him. Verrazzano reported that he found clearings and open forests suitable for travel [...] "even by a large army," [...] {{a far cry from}} the impenetrable tangle that resulted when the English suppressed controlled burns in the seventeenth century. Dutch navigator Adriaen Block explored and mapped the bay in 1614, and nearby Block Island is named in his honor.|$|E
2500|$|The Gamemakers' control center, {{about which}} Katniss <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>speculate</b> in the novel, was also {{developed}} as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, [...] "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events {{for the sake of}} an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room." [...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that." ...|$|E
