2500|$|The {{range of}} {{frequencies}} in {{the electromagnetic spectrum}} that makes up the radio spectrum is very large. This means that the types of antennas that are used as radio telescopes vary widely in design, size, and configuration. At wavelengths of 30 meters to 3 meters (10MHz - 100MHz), they are generally either directional antenna arrays similar to [...] "TV antennas" [...] or large stationary reflectors with moveable focal points. Since the wavelengths being observed with these types of antennas are so long, the [...] "reflector" [...] surfaces can be constructed from <b>coarse</b> <b>wire</b> mesh such as chicken wire. At shorter wavelengths parabolic [...] "dish" [...] antennas predominate. The angular resolution of a dish antenna {{is determined by the}} ratio of the diameter of the dish to the wavelength of the radio waves being observed. This dictates the dish size a radio telescope needs for a useful resolution. Radio telescopes that operate at wavelengths of 3 meters to 30cm (100MHz to 1GHz) are usually well over 100 meters in diameter. Telescopes working at wavelengths shorter than 30cm (above 1GHz) range in size from 3 to 90 meters in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Tensile {{experiments}} on cold-drawn Ni microwires with diameters from similar to 115 to 50 gm revealed high strengths, with significant strength variability for finer wires with diameters less than similar to 50 gm. The wires showed pronounced necking at fracture. The <b>coarser</b> <b>wires</b> with diameters > 50 mu m exhibited conventional ductile cup-cone fracture, with dimples {{in the central}} zone and peripheral shear lips, whereas finer wires failed by shear with knife or chisel-edge fractures. Shear bands were observed in all samples. Further, through- section microscopy of selected fractured samples revealed that the shear bands did not go across the enitre specimen for the <b>coarser</b> <b>wires.</b> The shear bands led to grain fragmention, with a reduction in grain aspect ratio as well as rotations away from the initial orientations. The strength data were analysed based on a Weibull approach. The data could be rationalized in terms of failure from volume defects in <b>coarser</b> <b>wires,</b> with a high Weibull modulus, and from surface defects in finer wires, with a low Weibull modulus and greater variability.

40|$|SummaryDespite their {{relatively}} small brains, with only about 100, 000 neurons, fruit flies show many complex behaviours. Understanding how these behaviours are generated {{will require a}} wiring diagram of the brain, and significant {{progress is being made}} towards this goal.

40|$|A self-developed rotary multi-cutter device cuts {{stainless}} steel wire ropes into segments to fabricate twisted wires. Stainless steel porous twisted wire materials (PTWMs) with a spatial composite intertexture structure are produced by the compaction and subsequent vacuum solid-phase sintering of twisted wires. The {{stainless steel}} PTWMs show two types of typical uniaxial tensile failure modes, i. e., a 45 ° angle fracture mode and an auxetic failure mode (the PTWMs expand along the direction perpendicular to the tension). The effects of the sintering parameters, porosities, wire diameters, and sampling direction on the tensile properties of the PTWMs are carefully investigated. By increasing the sintering temperature from 1130 °C to 1330 °C, the tensile strength of the PTWMs with 70 % target porosity increased from 7. 7 MPa to 28. 6 MPa and the total failure goes down to 50 %. When increasing the sintering time from 90 min to 150 min, the tensile strength increases from 12. 4 MPa to 19. 1 MPa and the total failure elongation drops to 78. 6 %. The tensile strength of the PTWMs increases from 28. 9 MPa to 112. 7 MPa with decreasing porosity from 69. 5 % to 46. 0 %, and the total failure elongation also increases from 14. 8 % to 40. 7 %. The tensile strength and the failure strain of the PTWMs with fine wires are {{higher than those of}} the PTWMs with <b>coarse</b> <b>wires</b> under the same porosity. Sampling direction has a small influence on the tensile properties of the PTWMs...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in developing porous metals or metallic foams for functional and structural applications. The study of the physical and mechanical properties of porous metals is very important and helpful for their application. In this paper, a novel sintered multilayer wire mesh porous plate material (WMPPs) with a thickness of 0. 5 mm– 3 mm and a porosity of 10 – 35 % was prepared by winding, pressing, rolling, and subsequently vacuum sintering them. The pore size and total size distribution in the as-prepared samples were investigated using the bubble point method. The uniaxial tensile behavior of the WMPPs was investigated {{in terms of the}} sintering temperature, porosity, wire diameter, and manufacturing technology. The deformation process and the failure mechanism under the tensile press was also discussed based on the appearance of the fractures (SEM figures). The results indicated that the pore size and total size distribution were closely related to the raw material used and the sintering temperature. For the WMPPs prepared by the wire mesh, the pore structures were inerratic {{and the vast majority of}} pore size was less than 10 μm. On the other hand, for the WMPPs that were prepared by wire mesh and powder, the pore structures were irregular and the pore size ranged from 0 μm– 50 μm. The experimental data showed that the tensile strength of WMPPs is much higher than any other porous metals or metallic foams. Higher sintering temperatures led to <b>coarser</b> joints between <b>wires</b> and resulted in higher tensile strength. The sintering temperature decreased from 1330 °C to 1130 °C and the tensile strength decreased from 296 MPa to 164 MPa. Lower porosity means that there are more metallurgical joints and metallic frameworks resisting deformation per unit volume. Therefore, lower porosities exhibit higher tensile strength. An increase of porosity from 17. 14 % to 32. 5 % led to the decrease of the tensile strength by 90 MPa. The <b>coarser</b> <b>wires</b> led to a bigger contact area between the interconnecting wires, resulting in a stronger sintering neck that exhibited higher tensile strength. The wire diameter increased from 81 μm to 122 μm and the tensile strength increased from 296 MPa to 362 MPa. The fracture morphology showed that the wires experience necking deformation and ductile fracture...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the X-ray detector which will provide second-of-arc images for the HEAO-B X-ray observatory. The instrument uses microchannel plates as a photocathode surface and imaging photoelectron multiplier, and a crossed wire grid as a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector. Position determination is accomplished by electronic interpolation between the <b>coarse</b> grid <b>wires.</b> The detector provides the arrival time and position of each event which occurs within its field of view. Measurements of the spatial resolution (15 microns), temporal resolution (7. 8 microsec), image distortion (less than 10 microns), uniformity of efficiency (less than plus or minus 10 %), dark counting rate (0. 2 cts/sq cm/s), and quantum efficiency (10 % at 1. 54 keV) of this detector are described. A summary of the procedure which was found useful during the initial turn-on of microchannel plates is given...|$|R
