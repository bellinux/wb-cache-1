Many foods contain a number of structural features in which the behaviour of microorganisms is influenced in a different way. Predictive microbiology is a research discipline that develops mathematical models to predict the microbial evolution (growth, inactication, survival) in response to (varying) physical and chemical factors. However, until now the development of predictive microbiology models has mainly focused on data derived from microbial growth in broth culture media.

Among the human capital variables vocational training is found to have a strong effect on the innovation activity. However, firms owned by female and old entrepreneurs are less likely to get involved in innovation. In an extended model of firm growth determinants that includes innovation indicators we found strong evidence that innovators grow faster than non-innovators. Firm growth is also affected by other factors such as the firm’s initial size, age, access to finance, sector, and owner character.

Cells on 30 - and 60 -μm strips, like cells on a nonpatterned (NP) surface coated with FN, showed clear actin stress fibers with anchoring spots of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and no significant apoptosis. On 15 -μm strips, cells had few stress fibers, no p-FAK, and significant apoptosis. After seeding for 12 h, the cells were subjected to pulsatile shear stress (12 ± 4 dyn/cm 2) parallel or perpendicular to MP strips, or kept under static condition. Parallel flow caused cell elongation with enhanced stress fibers and p-FAK, {{and a reduction in}} apoptosis, but perpendicular flow did not. The Rho inhibitory C 3 exoenzyme abolished the effects of parallel flow. RhoV 14, the constitutively active Rho, enhanced stress fibers and p-FAK, and prevented apoptosis of HUVECs on 15 -μm strips under static condition. RhoV 14 also reduced cell apoptosis under both parallel and perpendicular flows.

This research examined household attitudes and technical and institutional aspects of the programmes to determine how they could more effectively improve rural livelihoods and increase environmental sustainability. Households surveyed in nine villages (Kebeles) practiced mixed subsistence farming; asset endowments were variable among households, despite the government’s assumption that all households are similarly motivated to participate in forestry interventions. The majority (82 %) of households plant trees on their land; the level of private tree planting is positively correlated with several wealth indicators (e. g., livestock ownership, surplus labour) and frequency of contact with an extension agent. Household tree planting activities are also influenced by Kebele-level attributes, for example, access to forest nurseries {{and the type of}} forestry intervention present in the Kebele. Household proximity to the woodland and agro-ecological potential has no effect on tree planting activities; open grazing <b>constrains</b> tree <b>growing</b> in the region. All three types of rehabilitation intervention examined (i. e., community woodlots, hillside closures, land allocation) were implemented on degraded communal land; the opportunity costs of the interventions, in terms of loss of access, have been felt more deeply by households located near intervention sites than those at a distance. Interventions managed by user groups or directly by participants are viewed more positively than those led by local government authorities (the Kebele Administrations, KA).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} performing real-time text detection and optical character recognition in fairly complex indoor scenery. It is initially intended to provide navigational cues to robot agents and it operates by coupling text detection utilizing localized measures (Mirmehdi) with neural network based optical character recognition techniques through a region growing process. Text detection using statistical measures {{has been shown to}} be strongly invariant to the colour, orientation and size (including illegibly small) of text regions while convolutional neural networks display the same relative invariance with respect to the position and scale of individual characters. The two techniques complement each other and ease the real-time requirement; text detection provides information on where text may be, region growing on its orientation and size, and convolutional networks identify the characters that are actually present. The camera-based reading process works as follows; various local properties of a (video) image such as the variance, edge count, density, and orientation are employed by a feed forward network to identify regions as text or non-text. Likely candidates are then selected using a fast <b>constrained</b> region <b>growing</b> technique and these are normalized and fed to a convolution feed forward neural network which performs optical character recognition. Depending on the application, the resulting characters may be processed further or simply be projected back onto the original location to restore the spatial orientation. While the current project targets robot vision, a robust system would have many applications such as providing an aid to the visually impaired or searching digital media, as well as offering some fascinating possibilities in the fields of augmented reality and wearable computing. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe smeared crack band {{theory is}} {{implemented}} within the high-fidelity generalized method of cells micromechanics model to capture progressive failure within the constituents of a composite material while retaining objectivity {{with respect to}} the size of the discretization elements used in the model. Orientation of the crack band is determined using the maximum principal stress. When oriented perpendicular to the maximum principle stress the faces of the cracks in the crack band are subjected to only normal tractions and grow under pure mode I conditions. The traction–separation law governing the behavior of the crack band is related to the mode I fracture toughness, and formation of the crack band is initiated with a maximum stress criterion. Conversely, if the direction of the principal stress with the largest magnitude is compressive, it is assumed that the cracks within the crack band are <b>constrained</b> from <b>growing</b> in mode I. Instead, it is assumed that mode II cracks form within the crack band oriented along the plane of maximum shear stress. A Mohr–Coulomb initiation criterion is utilized to incorporate the effects of the normal tractions acting on the crack faces, and an effective shear traction is defined accordingly. The effective shear traction versus mode II separation law is a function of the mode II fracture toughness. A repeating unit cell containing 13 randomly arranged fibers is modeled and subjected to a combination of transverse tension/compression and transverse shear loading. The implementation is verified against experimental data and an equivalent finite element model that utilizes the same implementation of the crack band theory.

Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) occurs under these conditions, with the resulting nanoparticles exhibiting spherical, worm-like or vesicular morphologies when using a relatively short PSMA 13 macromolecular {{chain transfer}} agent (macro-CTA), as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Only kinetically-trapped spherical nanoparticles are obtained when using longer macro-CTAs (e. g. PSMA 18 or PSMA 31), with higher mean degrees of polymerization (DPs) for the PBzMA core-forming block simply producing progressively larger spheres. SAXS {{is used for the}} first time to monitor the various morphological transitions that occur in situ during the RAFT dispersion polymerization of BzMA when targeting either spheres or vesicles as the final copolymer morphology. This powerful characterization technique enables the evolution of particle diameter, mean aggregation number, number of copolymer chains per unit surface area (Sagg) and the distance between adjacent copolymer chains at the core-shell interface (dint) to be monitored as a function of monomer conversion for kinetically-trapped spheres. Moreover, the gradual evolution of copolymer morphology during PISA is confirmed unequivocally, with approximate 'lifetimes' assigned to the intermediate pure sphere and worm morphologies when targeting PSMA 13 -PBzMA 150 vesicles. Within vesicle phase space, the membrane thickness (Tm) increases monotonically with PBzMA DP. Furthermore, a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), TEM and post mortem SAXS studies indicate that the lumen volume is reduced while the overall vesicle dimensions remain essentially constant. Thus the <b>constrained</b> vesicles <b>grow</b> inwards, as recently reported for an aqueous PISA formulation. This suggests a universal vesicle growth mechanism for all PISA formulations...|$|R
