However, most of the theoretical results obtained so far are valid only for the restricted class of incoherent dictionaries. This paper investigates a new class of overcomplete dictionaries, <b>called</b> <b>block</b> incoherent dictionaries, where coherence can be arbitrarily big. We show that a simple greedy algorithm can correctly identify stable subdictionaries (<b>called</b> <b>blocks)</b> and demonstrate how one can use the extra coherence freedom for approximation purposes.
