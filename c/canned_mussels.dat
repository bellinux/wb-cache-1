40|$|Abstractβ-N-Methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) is a {{potential}} neurotoxin associated with the aquatic environment. Validated analytical methods for the quantification of both free and total concentrations of BMAA were used in an investigation of seafood purchased from different grocery stores in Uppsala, Sweden. The analysis was performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI–MS/MS) and detection of BMAA as a dansyl derivate. The determined concentrations of free BMAA (after a simple trichloroacetic acid extraction) in mussels and scallops were up to 0. 46 μgg− 1 wet homogenate. The total BMAA (after hydrochloric acid hydrolysis) levels were between 0. 29 and 7. 08 μgg− 1 wet mussel homogenate. The highest concentration of total BMAA was found in imported cooked and <b>canned</b> <b>mussels</b> which contained about ten times the quantity of BMAA measured in domestic cooked and frozen mussels. In this study it was also concluded that BMAA could be detected in seafood origin from four different continents. The risks associated with human exposure to BMAA through food are unknown today. However, {{the results of this}} study show that imported seafood in Sweden contain BMAA, indicating that this area needs more investigation, including a risk assessment regarding the consumption of e. g., mussels, scallops and crab...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{procedure for}} smoking and canning of smoked Mediterranean mussel’s meat (Mytilus galloproincialis) {{was developed and}} studied. The mussels from the mussel’s culture of the East Cost of Thermaikos bay were being washed in running water and steamed at 80 oC for 10 min, in order to remove the shells. The mussel’s meat salted in a brine with 4 % sodium chloride for 15 min in a mussel’s / brine ratio 1 : 2, dried at 60 - 65 oC for 13 min, and smoked at 65 - 80 oC for 17 min, with smouldering hard sawdust, 13 min, smoked at vacuum packed in pouches and cold stored at 2 - 3 oC. Steaming and smoking significantly (p 0. 05) on pH value. During storage of mussels meat for 90 days under the above mentioned conditions the total plate count increased by 1 log 10 cfu/g, the lactic acid bacteria count remained constant, the pH reduced by 0. 2 units, the TBA value slightly increased by 0. 2 mg of malonaldeyde/kg and the TVBN increased from 18 to 29 mg N/ 100 g. Based on sensory attributes the shelf-life of Mediterranean mussel’s meat under the specified smoking procedure and storage conditions can be extended up to 70 days at 2 - 3 oC. The smoked mussel’s meat was placed in cans with specified tomato sauce, in ratio 32 % mussel and 60 % tomato sauce. After the hermetically sealing the cans the content sterilized, so that the Fo value = 4, 1 min to be insured. Chilling with cold water and storage in environmental conditions was followed. The results demonstrated that thermal processing safeguarded the microbiological stability of the <b>canned</b> <b>mussels,</b> due to {{the components of the}} smoke since no swollen cans were observed after incubation at 37 oC for 7 days and during storage at ambient conditions for 15 months. The results of the sensory tests showed that the sauce maintained its attributes unalterable for 15 months. Also the mussel’s tenderness and their total acceptability were tolerable until 15 -month maintenance. But the mussel’s display texture of grain at the mince after the 13 o month of the maintenance. Therefore the procedure which was developed for canning of smoked mussels meat in tomato sauce can provide on acceptable product for 13 months. ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{native of}} western Russia, the zebra mussel most likely {{made its way}} to North America through the release of ballast water from cargo ships {{traveling}} from the Black Sea to the Great Lakes.

40|$|Synopsis Mussels rely on {{a strong}} byssal {{attachment}} to persist {{in a range of}} habitats with differing rates of water flow. Recent studies, however, suggest that the ability of one mussel species to sense and respond adaptively to the flow in its environment is limited under even modest flow conditions because the process of byssal thread formation is disrupted. This study extends these findings to four mussel species,Mytilus trossulus,M. galloprovincialis,M. californianus, andModiolus modiolus. Collectively, the response of byssal thread formation decreased with rates of flow above 25 cm/s and the critical flow threshold was estimated to be 550 cm/s. How <b>can</b> <b>mussels</b> persist on shores where flow is an order of magnitude higher? Using a combination of techniques for measuring flow, velocity profiles were obtained above and within mussel aggregations in the laboratory and in the field. Flow was greatly reduced within mussel aggregations, ranging from 0. 1 % to 10 % of free-stream velocity. These results suggest one key to the success of mussels in habitats with high rates of flow is the ability to form aggregations that ameliorate flows to a level that is conducive to byssal thread formation...|$|R

50|$|Given {{the right}} circumstances, California <b>mussels</b> <b>can</b> {{grow up to}} 200 mm (8 inches) in length and may live for more than 20 years.

50|$|Competition {{can develop}} for the rocky spaces. For example, {{barnacles}} can compete successfully on open intertidal rock faces {{to the point}} where the rock surface is covered with them. Barnacles resist desiccation and grip well to exposed rock faces. However, in the crevices of the same rocks, the inhabitants are different. Here <b>mussels</b> <b>can</b> be the successful species, secured to the rock with their byssal threads.|$|R
25|$|Another {{potential}} benefit of facilitation is insulation from competitive interactions. Like the now familiar example of nurse plants in harsh environments, nurse logs {{in a forest}} are sites of increased seed germination and seedling survival because the raised substrate of a log frees seedlings from competition with plants and mosses on the forest floor. The crab-coral interaction described above is also an example of refuge from competition, since the herbivory of crabs on seaweed reduces competition between coral and seaweed. Similarly, herbivory by sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) on kelps (Laminaria spp.) <b>can</b> protect <b>mussels</b> (Modiolus modiolus) from overgrowth by kelps competing for space in the subtidal zone of the Gulf of Maine, USA.|$|R
