5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a <b>conveyance</b> of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

25|$|Section 34 {{establishes}} the Authorised <b>Conveyancing</b> Practitioners Board as a statutory corporation. The Practitioners Board is tasked with developing competition in <b>conveyancing</b> services to avoid monopolies, supervising {{the actions of}} licensed conveyancers and developing a way of monitoring said conveyancers. The Practitioners Board has the powers to both grant and refuse authorisation to <b>conveyancing</b> practitioners, establish a <b>conveyancing</b> ombudsman and a compensation scheme for parties that suffer {{as a result of}} a conveyancer's actions appoint investigators to look into the behaviour of an authorised conveyancer. There are therefore three regulatory bodies under this Section—the Practitioners Board, the Law Society for regulating solicitors engaged in <b>conveyancing</b> work and the Council for Licensed Conveyancers charged with regulating licensed conveyancers.|$|R

5000|$|In England and Wales, <b>conveyancing</b> {{is usually}} {{done by a}} {{solicitor}} or a licensed conveyancer; either may employ or supervise an unqualified conveyancer. What is being conveyed, or transferred, {{is a piece of}} land or property, that historically (especially in England) may or may not include the [...] "messuage", that would be the principal dwelling, and might include an orchard, any outbuildings, and curtilage if present. The domestic <b>conveyancing</b> market is price competitive, with a high number of firms of solicitors and <b>conveyancing</b> companies offering a similar service. It is possible for someone to carry out their own <b>conveyancing,</b> but it is labour intensive. If the transaction involves a mortgage, it’s almost certain that the lender will insist that a solicitor is used for the <b>conveyancing.</b>|$|R

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped <b>conveyance.</b> Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and <b>conveyance</b> of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E
25|$|The King and noblemen, {{as well as}} high officials, had {{the right}} to receive <b>conveyance</b> from farmers. The right was never a formal right, but rather a {{consequence}} of the ‘conveyance duty’ which was imposed on farmers. <b>Conveyance</b> duty (Norwegian: skyssplikt) is known since the 12th century and functioned as indirect taxation. In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which <b>conveyance</b> farmers had was abolished at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} reform was {{the loss of}} the <b>conveyancing</b> monopoly. Before 1983, only solicitors had been {{authorised}} to take part in <b>conveyancing</b> work—for anyone else to draft documents relating to the transfer of property was a statutory offence. In December 1983 Austin Mitchell, a Labour Member of Parliament who {{had been one of the}} initial supporters of Alf Dubs' private member's bill introduced a private member's bill of his own called the House Buyers Bill. This aimed to remove the restrictions on <b>conveyancing,</b> and although the government opposed it they made it clear that they planned to allow banks and building societies to carry out <b>conveyancing</b> for their customers, and would also be prepared to allow non-solicitors with suitable qualifications to carry out <b>conveyancing</b> work as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>conveyancing</b> process in South Africa with a view to identify how the process might be improved in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness. Land is an asset and still remains a valuable factor in production, even in the modern knowledge economy. In many parts of the world, land is a limited resource, therefore, in most countries, custodianship and ownership of land and landed properties generally tend to be guarded through the meticulous capturing, recording and storage of appropriate data and information. Legislative provisions for the transfer of custodianship and/or ownership require the involvement of a variety of role players in the <b>conveyancing</b> processes that culminate in the registration of land and associated immovable property. In some countries, the <b>conveyancing</b> processes tend to be complex and cumbersome. The study provides a conceptual framework for <b>conveyancing</b> processes based on a content-based review of land and immovable property registration systems in five countries, namely, Barbados, the Netherlands, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The study further investigates the South African <b>conveyancing</b> processes. Quantitative questionnaires were completed by six respondent groups from the <b>conveyancing</b> service chain, and qualitative interviews were conducted with two of the four major banks in South Africa. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data.
