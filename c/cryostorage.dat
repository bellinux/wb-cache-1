50|$|One of the {{directions}} of company's {{development is the}} creation of <b>cryostorage</b> facilities in a neutral country such as Switzerland. This country is one of the primary target countries because it has allowed euthanasia, with the help of which one can create better conditions for cryopreservation. Also, representatives of the company named one of the objectives the improvement of the cryopatient preparation and transportation procedures, which will enable the provision of cryonics services to customers from all over the world, including such countries as Ecuador and China. Among other potential business activities of the company, was mentioned sperm freezing, as were freezing of embryos and organs, Cryobank creation, tours of <b>cryostorage</b> facilities, visiting relatives provided patients are stored in transparent sarcophagi, introduction of cryonics to the voluntary health insurance, etc. Danila Medvedev calls it the Company's Dream — the opportunity to bring members of Robert Scott's doomed expedition, who froze to death in the Antarctic in 1912, to the KrioRus lab.

50|$|Eggs (oocytes) {{are frozen}} using either a controlled-rate, slow-cooling method or a newer flash-freezing {{process known as}} vitrification. Vitrification is much faster but {{requires}} higher concentrations of cryoprotectants to be added. The result of vitrification is a solid glass-like cell, free of ice crystals. Indeed, freezing is a phase transition. Vitrification, as opposed to freezing, is a physical transition. Realizing this fundamental difference, vitrification concept has been developed and successfully applied in IVF treatment with the first life birth following vitrification of oocytes achieved in 1999. Vitrification eliminates ice formation {{inside and outside of}} oocytes on cooling, during <b>cryostorage</b> and on warming. Vitrification is associated with higher survival rates and better development compared to slow-cooling when applied to oocytes in metaphase II (MII). Vitrification has also become the method of choice for pronuclear oocytes, although prospective randomized controlled trials are still lacking.|$|E

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{advantages}} KrioRus possesses is {{the cost}} of its services, primarily for Russian and non-US citizens. Unlike American companies, KrioRus was founded in such a way, that it is not subject to the rules governing medical and funeral activities. As a result, the company does not face regulatory challenges in such fields of activity as acquisition of bodies from hospitals and morgues. Furthermore, it matters that KrioRus has a cleaner reputation than Alcor, which has suffered a few scandals. Danila Medvedev describes this situation as follows: [...] "We didn’t have the crisis that they had in the 1970s. People in Russia have no negative impression of cryonics". Despite skepticism of its US competitors, KrioRus plans to implement the world's first center, where patients would die and be frozen, all in the same building. Company's <b>cryostorage</b> facility is designed to be able to relocate quickly in case of war, natural disasters etc., in which case it can be moved {{in the space of a}} few days, while its storage tanks are capable to work autonomously and to sustain necessary temperature for two days.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Seed {{survival}} of <b>cryostorage</b> (– 196 °C) was examined for Banksia ashbyi (E. G. Baker), a tree species endemic to Western Australia. Seeds were cryostored over a moisture content range of 3 – 30 %. Moisture contents of 18 – 20 % significantly depressed survival for seed {{of all ages}} tested (1 month to 13 years old). <b>Cryostorage</b> at seed moisture contents below 18 % did not affect seed germination or vigour (radicle growth). Seed age influenced sur-vival with freshly harvested seeds showing a greater tolerance to <b>cryostorage</b> at high moisture contents than older seeds. Exotherms, indicating ice formation within seed tissues, were detected by thermal analysis at seed moisture contents above the critical. However, there was no increase in electrolyte efflux from seeds frozen at lethal moisture contents, suggesting the plasma membrane of cells remained intact. This study shows that seed storage physiology of a Western Australian species {{is similar to that}} of other orthodox species and that <b>cryostorage</b> may be successfully applied for conservation of native species without detrimental effects on germination and growth. © CSIRO 200...|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} cryopreservation of a South African maize cultivar (Hybrid 6363) was {{not possible}} due to the large size of the intact caryopses. To overcome the problem the embryonic axes were isolated. Isolation of the axes from dry caryopses proved challenging and resulted in the damage of 50 % of all axes isolated. To ensure the successful removal of the intact axes from the caryopses, imbibition {{over a period of}} 30 minutes to 6. 5 hours was employed to soften the testa and the pericarp. The effects of imbibition and subsequent <b>cryostorage</b> on the sample water content, vigour and viability were assessed. The water contents of excised embryos increased considerably within the first 30 minutes of imbibition without any visible differences in viability for both the control and cryostored samples. Concomitantly, so were the results {{for the rest of the}} imbibition times tested. However, a comparison of the germination indexes indicated that vigour was impeded by <b>cryostorage.</b> In addition to reduced vigour of cryostored material, at the higher imbibition times, morphological aberrations were observed, for example, the lack of root formation. An ultrastructural investigation of the root meristems pre- and post-cryostorage provided information of the changes associated with imbibition as well as the subsequent effects of freezing and thawing. Successful <b>cryostorage</b> seemed to be associated with the lack of obvious metabolic activity at the ultrastructural level (retained desiccation tolerance). The possibility of the leached solutes, out of the caryopses, performing a cryoprotective rôle was considered as a further explanation of the observed post-cryostorage successes. The results confirmed that the combined concentrations of proline, γ-amino butyric acid, glycine, glutamic acid and glucose (known cryoprotectants) were sufficiently high and therefore hypothesized to behave as natural cryoprotectants, but only effectively prior to the acquisition of tissue desiccation sensitivity. Hybrid 6363 had aged in storage prior to and after its purchase, introducing cellular changes at the physiological and biochemical levels prior to any subsequent effects of imbibition and <b>cryostorage.</b> The onset of imbibition itself resulted in many physiological and structural changes and, subsequent <b>cryostorage</b> of tissue at higher water contents proved deleterious to the resulting plantlets. All of these effects were exacerbated in aged seed. It was therefore proposed that aged seed subjected to imbibition and subsequent <b>cryostorage</b> would sustain elevated damage and hence should not be considered for germplasm preservation purposes. Comparative studies were done between freshly harvested seed Hybrid 6321 and Hybrid 6363 (fresh Hybrid 6363 was unavailable). Marked differences were noted ultrastructurally and biochemically, but the lack of root formation was still observed in tissue hydrated for longer periods in Hybrid 6321. The eventuality that damage occurred at the ultrastructural level was investigated and it was found that the changes in cytoskeletal activity within Hybrid 6321, due to imbibition, were extensive within the first 6. 5 hours. <b>Cryostorage</b> at specific hydration levels resulted in additional damage, however, the extent of this damage was dependent on the level of cytoskeletal organisation and is suggested to be associated with the tissue having lost or retained desiccation tolerance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: An {{established}} {{method of}} <b>cryostorage</b> that might preserve the vascular and endothelial responses of human femoral arteries (HFAs) to be transplanted as allografts was studied. Methods: HFAs were harvested from multiorgan donors and stored at 4 °C in Belzer solution before <b>cryostorage.</b> One hundred eleven HFA rings were isolated and {{randomly assigned to}} 1 control group of unfrozen HFAs and 2 groups of HFAs cryopreserved for 7 and 30 days, respectively. Cryopreservation was performed in Elohes solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide (1. 8 mmol/L), {{and the rate of}} cooling was 1. 6 °C/min, until – 141 °C was reached. The contractile and relaxant responses of unfrozen and frozen/thawed arteries were assessed in organ bath by measurement of isometric force generated by the HFAs. Results: After thawing, the maximal contractile responses to all the contracting agonists tested (KCl, U 46619 [a thromboxane A 2 -mimetic], norepinephrine, serotonin, and endothelin- 1) were in the range of 7 % to 34 % of the responses in unfrozen HFAs. The endothelium-independent relaxant responses to forskolin and verapamil were weakly altered, whereas the endothelium-independent relaxant responses to sodium nitroprusside were markedly reduced. <b>Cryostorage</b> of HFAs also resulted in a loss of the endothelium-dependent relaxant response to acetylcholine. The vascular and endothelial responses were similarly altered in the HFAs cryopreserved for 7 and 30 days. Conclusion: The cryopreservation method used provided a limited preservation of HFAs contractility, a good preservation of the endothelium-independent relaxant responses, but no apparent preservation of the endothelium-dependent relaxation. It is possible that further refinements of the cryopreservation protocol, such as a slower rate of cooling and a more controlled stepwise addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, might allow better post-thaw functional recovery of HFAs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a general}} {{requirement}} to determine and correlate water content to viability for the standardization of conservation protocols to facilitate effective <b>cryostorage</b> of plant germplasm. OBJECTIVE: This study examined water content as a critical factor to optimize the <b>cryostorage</b> of Allium sativum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stem discs were excised from post-harvest, stored bulbs prior to cryopreservation by encapsulation-dehydration and water content was determined gravimetrically. RESULTS: Survival of cryopreserved stem discs was 42. 5 %, with 22. 5 % exhibiting shoot regrowth following 6 h desiccation. Gravimetric data demonstrated a correlation between water content corresponding with survival / regrowth from desiccated, cryopreserved stem discs. For encapsulated stem discs a 25 % residual moisture and corresponding water content of 0. 36 g H 2 O g- 1 d. wt correlated with maximal survival following ~ 6. 5 h of desiccation.

Cryopreservation is the only method allowing the safe and cost-effective long-term conservation of recalcitrant seed species such as coconut. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to test the effect of cryopreservation and of <b>cryostorage</b> duration on coconut pollen germination and fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pollen of two coconut varieties (West Coast Tall [WCT] and Chowghat Orange Dwarf [COD]) was collected in March-May over three successive years, desiccated to 7. 5 % moisture content (FW) and cryopreserved by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. RESULTS: Germination and pollen tube length (PTL) of desiccated and cryopreserved pollen {{were not significantly different}} for both WCT and COD over the three harvest months of the three consecutive years of study. Pollen germination ranged from 24 to 32 % in desiccated pollen whereas it was between 26 and 29 % in cryopreserved COD pollen. In the case of WCT, germination ranged from 30 to 31 % in desiccated pollen, while it was between 28 and 32 % in cryopreserved pollen. PTL of cryopreserved pollen ranged between 224 - 390 mu m and 226 - 396 mu m for COD and WCT, respectively. Germination of COD pollen varied between 29. 0 and 44. 1 % after 4 years and 1. 0 / 1. 5 years <b>cryostorage,</b> respectively. Germination of WCT pollen did not change significantly between 0 and 6 years <b>cryostorage,</b> being comprised between 32 (24 h) and 40 % (1. 5 years). Germination and vigour of cryopreserved pollen were generally higher compared to that of pollen dried in oven and non-cryopreserved.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the effect of the freeze-thawing procedure, computer controlled rate freezing and duration for six months, on human sperm chromatin (assessed by acridine orange test), vitality, motility, and morphology. Design: Experimental study Material and Method: Twenty semen samples were obtained from patients attending the infertility unit. The semen analysis was measured according to WHO criteria. Sperm morphology was evaluated by strict Kruger criteria and sperm chromatin were detected by acridine orange test. After semen analysis, each sample was mixed with cryoprotectant and divided into straw. The straw was frozen with computer controlled rate freezing method. After 6 months of <b>cryostorage,</b> semen samples were thawed and then the semen was analyed, and sperm chromatin and morphology were determined. Results: After six months of <b>cryostorage,</b> the mean percentage of normal sperm chromatin decreased signifi-cantly (87. 3 + 9. 0 vs. 51. 9 + 27. 4, p < 0. 001). Vitality, motility, and normal morphology of sperm decreased significantly (78. 7 + 1. 9 vs. 32. 8 + 10. 8, 52. 6 + 1. 9 vs. 24. 1 + 10. 9 and 21. 4 + 4. 3 vs. 18. 0 + 4. 4 respectively, p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The computer controlled rate freezing of sperm for six months and thawing process significantly decreased normal sperm chromatin, vitality, motility, and normal morphology...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cryostorage</b> of nonhuman primate embryos by {{time-consuming}} slow-cooling methods {{is often}} limited to early cleavage stages. Effective rapid-cooling {{methods have been}} developed for many species and represent valuable tools for laboratory- and field-based studies of nonhuman primate reproductive biology. However, few rapid-cooling protocols have been applied to nonhuman primate embryos in terms of comparing various developmental stages. Here we compare slow cooling vs. two- and three-step rapid cooling of two-, four-, and eight-cell Macaca fascicularis (Mf) embryos. Rapid cooling was conducted in open pulled straws (OPS) using cooling solutions containing reduced quantities of ethylene glycol (EG) and supplemented with either of two high-molecular-weight polymers, ficoll and dextran. The survival of the slow-cooled embryos, but not the rapid-cooled embryos, was independent of embryonic stage at <b>cryostorage.</b> Slow cooling was associated with greater cell survival (82 %) post thaw compared to warming following rapid cooling (18 - 29 %). Slow cooling resulted in a high proportion of embryo survival (18 / 20; 90 %) and cleavage (15 / 18; 83 %) post thaw. Rapid cooling resulted in significantly reduced percentages of embryo survival (26 - 32 %) and embryo cleavage in culture (29 - 38 %) after warming. Conventional slow cooling was more effective than the rapid-cooling protocols employed in this study for cryopreservation of early-cleavage-stage Mf embryos...|$|E
