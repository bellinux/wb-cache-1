5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> {{to preserve}} bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> to reduce the heat island effect. In cities, there are many dark colored {{surfaces}} that absorb {{the heat of the}} sun in turn lowering the albedo of the city. White rooftops allow high solar reflectance and high solar emittance, increasing the albedo of the city or area the effect is occurring.|$|E

5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 the GUNT {{rebelled against}} Gaddafi, {{stripping}} Libya {{of its main}} cover of legitimacy for its military presence in Chad. Seeing an occasion to unify Chad behind him, Habré ordered his forces to pass the 16th parallel so as to link with the GUNT rebels (who were fighting the Libyans in Tibesti) in December. A few weeks later a bigger force struck at Fada, destroying the local Libyan garrison. In three months, combining the methods of guerilla and conventional warfare in a <b>common</b> <b>strategy,</b> Habré was able to retake almost all of northern Chad, and in the following months, inflicted new heavy defeats on the Libyans, until a ceasefire {{putting an end to}} the conflict was signed in September. The ceasefire left open the issue of the disputed Aouzou Strip, which was eventually assigned to Chad by the International Court of Justice in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{agreed to}} re-sign with the Lakers on July 2, 2012 {{and was named}} to the Lakers team for the July 1322 Las Vegas NBA Summer League. During the Summer League, Morris led the Lakers in scoring and assists. On November 9, 2012, Darius Morris {{recorded}} 10 points, a career-high 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 steal in a 10177 Lakers win over the Golden State, backing up Blake, while Steve Nash was injured. On November 13, with both Blake and Nash injured, Morris made his first career start against the San Antonio Spurs. As a starter, Morris posted career highs of 31 minutes and 6 assists on November 16 against the Phoenix Suns. On December 4, Chris Duhon overtook Morris as the replacement starter. On December 16, Morris posted a career-high 15 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. A few nights later, Kobe Bryant praised him for his defensive effort. When Nash returned to the starting lineup on December 22, Morris started in place of Metta World Peace, who came off the bench. This was part of a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> employed by Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni to play players out of position. While a starter, Morris' responsibility was to defend against the opponents' most dangerous perimeter player. On January 4, World Peace returned to the starting lineup in Morris' place. Then in late January, Jodie Meeks replaced Morris in the rotation as Blake also returned to the rotation.|$|E

25|$|There {{were several}} reasons {{given for the}} strong legal {{recognition}} in New England, {{in contrast to the}} rest of the United States. For instance, New England has strong libertarian associations, and other social movements, such as abolition of slavery and women's suffrage, started in New England. In addition, voters in most New England states cannot initiate constitutional amendments, which has been a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> in preventing same-sex marriage elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, former Azerbaijani {{football}} star Gurban Gurbanov was appointed {{as head coach}} after the unexpected departure of Rasim Kara to Khazar Lankaran one week {{before the start of}} the 2008–09 season. Led by Gurban Gurbanov, Qarabağ have ignored a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> in Azerbaijani football: eschewing foreign signings in favour of nurturing local talent. Gurbanov brought with him a tiki-taka style of play, characterised by short passes, long periods of build-up and players interchanging positions.|$|E
25|$|In general, acidity of donor sites {{correlates}} {{well with}} {{the strength of the}} donor. For example, it is a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> to add electron-withdrawing aryl substituents on a thiourea catalyst, which can increase its acidity and thus the strength of its hydrogen bonding. However, it is still unclear how donor strength correlates with desired reactivity. Importantly, more acidic catalysts are not necessarily more effective. For instance, ureas are less acidic than thioureas by roughly 6 pKa units, but it is not generally true that ureas are significantly worse are catalyzing reactions.|$|E
25|$|If {{the entire}} process up to the stage of {{printing}} is handled by an outside company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as book packaging. This is a <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights then sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. Indeed, the first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.|$|E

25|$|Coburg's main army {{attacked}} the Army of the North on 17 and 18 May. Because the attacking columns were poorly coordinated, the French repelled the Coalition army with heavy losses at the Battle of Tourcoing. General of Division Joseph Souham led the French army in Pichegru's absence. Pichegru was bloodily repulsed by Coburg at the Battle of Tournay on 22 May. Relations between Coburg and the British Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany became strained {{and the two}} could not decide on a <b>common</b> <b>strategy.</b> On the east flank, the French attacked across the Sambre {{for the third time}} at the end of May but were forced to pull back in the Battle of Gosselies.|$|E
25|$|Another very <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> is the {{protective}} put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the put option and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.|$|E
25|$|Vectors may be {{mechanical}} or biological. A mechanical vector {{picks up}} an infectious agent {{on the outside}} of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A <b>common</b> <b>strategy</b> used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.|$|E
