5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a <b>complete</b> <b>remission.</b> <b>Complete</b> <b>remission</b> {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. <b>Complete</b> <b>remission</b> is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Wilder {{collaborated on}} the book Gilda's Disease with {{oncologist}} Steven Piver, sharing personal experiences of Radner's struggle with ovarian cancer.

5|$|Even after <b>complete</b> <b>remission</b> is achieved, leukemic cells likely {{remain in}} numbers {{too small to}} be {{detected}} with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse.

5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a <b>complete</b> <b>remission</b> by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a <b>complete</b> <b>remission</b> of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E
5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting <b>complete</b> <b>remission.</b> About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E
40|$|Single-fraction {{radiation}} therapy with 5 or 15 Gy (60) Co gamma radiation was combined with intraperitoneal injections of syngeneic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) -transfected cells in rats with intracerebral N 29 or N 32 glioma tumors at days 7, 21 and 35 after inoculation. For intracerebral N 29 tumors, single-fraction {{radiation therapy}} with 5 or 15 Gy had no {{significant effect on}} the survival time. Immunization with IFN-gamma-transfected N 29 cells significantly increased the survival time by 61 %.

25|$|Relatively {{high doses}} of SRIs are needed for {{effectiveness}} {{in the treatment of}} OCD. Studies have found that high dosages of SSRIs above the normally recommended maximums are significantly more effective in OCD treatment than lower dosages (e.g., 250 to 400mg/day sertraline versus 200mg/day sertraline). In addition, the combination of clomipramine and SSRIs has also been found to be significantly more effective in alleviating OCD symptoms, and clomipramine is commonly used to augment SSRIs for this reason. Studies have found that intravenous clomipramine, which is associated with very high circulating concentrations of the drug and a much higher ratio of clomipramine to its metabolite desmethylclomipramine, is more effective than oral clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. There is a case report of <b>complete</b> <b>remission</b> from OCD for approximately one month following a massive overdose of fluoxetine, an SSRI with a uniquely long duration of action. Taken together, stronger serotonin reuptake inhibition has consistently been associated with greater alleviation of OCD symptoms, and since clomipramine, at the clinical dosages in which it is employed, is effectively the strongest SRI used medically (see table above), this may underlie its unique effectiveness in the treatment of OCD.|$|E

40|$|Conventional interferons {{including}} interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are cytokines {{used for}} years {{in the treatment of}} solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Their half-life is short. Pegylated forms of IFN-alpha present an improved pharmacokinetic profile that rendered them the preferred IFNs in hepatitis therapy. In the last decade, pegylated interferons (PegIFNs) have been investigated in melanoma patients. We review the scientific published literature on biology, pharmacokinetics, side effects and clinical applications of PegIFN-alpha in the treatment of stage III and IV melanoma. In the adjuvant setting, PegIFNalpha- 2 b has significant prolonged distant metastases free survival in patients with microscopic nodal involvement (stage TxN 1 aM 0) and therefore is a promising treatment option in this patient population. In the palliative setting, monotherapy with PegIFNalpha- 2 alpha can induce <b>complete</b> <b>remissions</b> in a minority of stage IV melanoma patients.

40|$|Immunotoxins are antibody-toxin fusion {{proteins}} {{directed to}} kill cancer cells displaying specific target antigens on their surface.

In addition, patients with other CD 22 -positive malignancies have not yet achieved <b>complete</b> <b>remissions.</b> In trying to understand 'resistance' to immunotoxin therapy, a number of challenging issues have been raised. These include insufficient dosing, the production of neutralizing anti-immunotoxin antibodies, poor access to malignant cells, and resistance to toxin killing. In designing immunotoxins, we employ truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, which enzymatically inactivates protein synthesis and produces cell death in sensitive cells. To begin to address toxin resistance we have explored combination therapy with the BH 3 -only mimetic, ABT- 737. Our results indicate that immunotoxin-ABT combinations often exhibit greater killing activity than either compound alone {{and in some instances}} overcome resistance.

40|$|BackgroundJuvenile {{dermatomyositis}} {{is a rare}} childhood multisystem {{autoimmune disease}} involving primarily the skin and muscles, and it may lead to long-term disability. This study aimed to describe the clinical course of juvenile dermatomyositis and determine if any early clinical or laboratory features could predict outcome. MethodsMedical charts of patients aged ≤ 18 years and diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis (according to the criteria of Bohan and Peter) at the Pediatric Department, National Taiwan University Hospital, between 1989 and 2009 were reviewed. The endpoints for disease assessment were complete clinical response and <b>complete</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> Cox's proportional hazards model was fitted to identify important predictors of <b>complete</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> ResultsA total of 39 patients with juvenile dermatomyositis were reviewed. Two-thirds were females, and the mean age at disease onset was 81. 97  ±  46. 63 months. The most common initial presentations were Gottron's papule (82. 1 %) and muscle weakness (82. 1 %). After excluding one patient with an incomplete record, the remaining 31 patients who had muscle weakness were analyzed; among them, 22 (70. 97 %) achieved complete clinical response, but only six (19. 4 %) achieved <b>complete</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, negative Gowers' sign at disease onset, and positive photosensitivity at disease onset were favorable factors to achieve <b>complete</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> Moreover, covariate-adjusted survival curves were drawn for making predictions of <b>complete</b> clinical <b>remission.</b> Only 13 (33. 33 %) patients were symptom free {{at the end of}} follow up, whereas the other 26 suffered from different kinds of complications.
