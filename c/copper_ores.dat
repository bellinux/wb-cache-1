5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and <b>copper)</b> <b>ores</b> extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{produced}} mainly from sphalerite, {{it is also}} found in silver, lead, and <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> Another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; coal is also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|In 1700 almost 230 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{was shipped}} from the Dhyrnane Mine mine at Maughold whilst also {{at this time}} the Rushen and Kirk Arbory mines were {{producing}} significant quantities of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historically, Redruth {{was a small}} {{market town}} overshadowed by its {{neighbours}} until a boom in the demand for <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> during the 18th century. <b>Copper</b> <b>ore</b> had mostly been discarded by the Cornish tin-mining industry but was now needed to make brass, an essential metal in the Industrial Revolution. Surrounded by <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> deposits, Redruth quickly {{became one of the}} largest and richest mining areas in Britain and the town's population grew markedly, although most miners' families remained poor.|$|R

5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium {{is one of}} the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903K. Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5000|$|A second mechanism, and {{probably}} the most important in most mining operations, involves chemical oxidation of the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> with ferric (Fe3+) ions formed by the microbial oxidation of ferrous ions (derived from the oxidation of pyrite).Three possible reactions for the oxidation of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> are: ...|$|R
50|$|By weight, more coal than <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{is needed}} for the process of {{smelting}} <b>copper</b> from the <b>ore,</b> so it is more economical to build the smelter near the coal source. Swansea had very local mines, a navigable river, a nearby supply of limestone (necessary as flux), and trading links across the Bristol Channel to Cornwall and Devon, sources of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500BC, {{introducing}} {{drinking and}} food vessels constructed from clay, {{as well as}} vessels used as reduction pots to smelt <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b> It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), {{as well as the}} production of more effective weapons.|$|E
5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and <b>copper</b> <b>ores.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Sternberg Mine at Copper Flat {{produced}} 200 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> between 1911 and 1934. By 1959, Bear Creek Mining Company {{had discovered}} a mineralized breccia pipe within the stock.

5000|$|There were {{probably}} mine workings {{in the area}} of Wheal Busy since the 16th century, {{but it was not until}} the 1720s that the mine started to produce large amounts of <b>copper</b> <b>ore.</b> The principal landowner was the Boscawen family.The mine was located in what was known at the time as [...] "the richest square mile on Earth". During its life it produced over 100,000 tons of <b>copper</b> <b>ore,</b> and 27,000 tons of arsenic. The mine adopted the name of Wheal Busy after 1823. At one time the mine also smelted the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> it produced.|$|R

25|$|Mineral veins {{have been}} formed in many Lake District rocks by {{hydrothermal}} circulation of groundwater though geological faults and are often associated with the granite batholith. Veins containing lead and <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> were found on Wanthwaite Crag where there are several old mineral workings, some very old. The most recent lease was taken out in 1887 by the short-lived and unsuccessful Wanthwaite Crag Mining Company.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the beakers were designed for the consumption of alcohol, and that the introduction of the substance to Europe may have fuelled the beakers' spread. Beer and mead content have been identified from certain examples. However, not all Beakers were drinking cups. Some were used as reduction pots to smelt <b>copper</b> <b>ores,</b> others have some organic residues associated with food, and still others were employed as funerary urns.

25|$|Continuing {{improvements}} led to {{the furnace}} and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability to smelt and forge of gold, copper, silver, and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from {{near the beginning of}} Neolithic times (about 10 ka). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals {{led to the}} discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 BCE.|$|E
25|$|By 1884, {{the quality}} of the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> {{produced}} at Devon Great Consols was poor, yielding more arsenic than copper. After being sorted by the mine's bal maidens, the <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> was sent to south Wales to be smelted. The company began exploring the possibility of tin deposits at the mine but found none.|$|R
50|$|The title Tilva Roš is {{the name}} of the area around Bor where the first {{geological}} explorations of <b>copper</b> <b>ore</b> were done in the late 19th century.

25|$|Spirals {{or plastic}} {{ornament}} {{which is similar}} to Grooved Ware is found on the Aberdeenshire examples, this being a type of late Neolithic pottery not known in the north-east but common in Orkney and Fife. The New Grange carvings in Ireland show strong similarities to those found on some balls. A continuous spiral is found on one and elements of chevrons, zig-zags and concentric triangles are also found, stimulating comparisons with petrosomatoglyph symbolism. Mostly the different knobs have different or sometimes no ornamentation. A 'golf-ball' variety of ornamentation is found on a few balls. The carving {{does not appear to have}} any practical purpose in general, however it has been suggested that one type, with very distinct knobs, was used for processing <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> (see under 'Function'). Some of the bold triangles and criss-cross incisions seem to be more Iron Age in character than Neolithic or Bronze Age.|$|E
500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E
2500|$|Although arsenical bronze {{occurs in}} the archaeological record across the globe, the {{earliest}} artifacts so far known have been found on the Iranian plateau in the 5th millennium BCE. Arsenic is present {{in a number of}} copper containing ores (see table at right, adapted from Lechtman & Klein, 1999) and therefore some contamination of the copper with arsenic would be unavoidable. However it is still not entirely clear to what extent arsenic was deliberately added to copper [...] and how much its use arose simply from its presence in <b>copper</b> <b>ores</b> that were then treated by smelting to produce the metal.|$|E
