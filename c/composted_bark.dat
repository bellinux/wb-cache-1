It {{is expected to}} enhance the benefits of vegetation to the application of hydro-seeding materials. After the plant succession in the test area for one year, the plant society still shows herbaceous plants with increasing varieties. Lolium multiflorum shows the strong growth possibly because that locates on 1, 250 m above sea level with lower temperature, which is suitable {{for the growth of}} Lolium multiflorum. The average vegetation coverage of the slope achieves 80. 4 % after proceeding netting hydro-seeding for two months, but drops down to 75. 5 % after one year. The experimental area therefore presents a transitional plant society with bush layer and herbaceous layer.

The effects of the Scots pine sawdust, <b>composted</b> <b>bark</b> or coarse, post-harvest woody debris from conifers on the abundance and diversity of culturable fungi were investigated. The amendments were aimed at increasing the soil suppressiveness to Armillaria and Heterobasidion. The classical soil-dilution method was chosen for qualitative and quantitative analyses of fungal communities in soils because of its proven reliability and consistency. The soil was inhabited by saprotrophic fungi from Ascomycota and Zygomycota, including species known to be potential antagonists of Armillaria or H. annosum (i. e. Clonostachys + Trichoderma spp., Penicillium commune, P. daleae, P. janczewskii) or stimulants of Armillaria (i. e. Pseudogymnoascus roseus, Trichocladium opacum). Eleven years after treatment, the abundance and diversity of fungi, the abundance of P. commune, and locally the abundance of P. janczewskii increased, while Clonostachys + Trichoderma spp., and locally, P. daleae and T. opacum decreased. Amending the barren soil with organic matter does not guarantee effective, long-term suppressiveness of the sandy loam soil to Armillaria and Heterobasidion.

40|$|International audienceThe {{irrigation}} of pot crops requires considerable follow-up {{because the}} autonomy of the water reserve of the growing medium is low in relation to plant water requirements. Computerised systems for irrigation management are therefore under investigation. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used on different peat-based mixtures to which perlite or <b>composted</b> <b>bark</b> were added in volumetric ratios of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %. Calibration equations (linear or polynomial) established between the water content and dielectric constant were obtained for each mixture. Their precision is highly satisfactory (R 2  >  0. 95), except for the mixture with 100 % perlite. However, this method requires an equation per growing medium. We therefore attempted to establish a general formula that could be applied to binary peat-based mixtures. We tested second-order polynomial calibration equations, a function of the dielectric constant measured as well as the volume percent of complementary material added to the peat (bark or perlite). The precision of these equations is excellent for all mixtures (R 2  >  0. 96). For all practical purposes, this approach would considerably simplify the use of TDR for computerised irrigation management because it would introduce {{only a limited number of}} parametric equations into the irrigation system...|$|E

The constituents of the most attractive growing medium tested were determined by gas chroma-tography analysis using a steam-distillation procedure. We found that fungus gnat adults were more attracted to the growing medium, SB 300 Universal Professional Growing Mix, which contains <b>composted</b> <b>bark,</b> than to another growing medium (Sunshine LC 1 Mix) and their components when tested in a series of laboratory experiments using multiple-choice experimental arenas. A higher percentage of fungus gnat adults were attracted to moist SB 300 (92 %) than SB 300 growing medium that had been oven dried (8 %). In addition, fungus gnat adults preferred SB 300 although they had been reared on Sunshine LC 1 Mix. When comparing the SB 300 fresh from the bag to growing medium that had been pasteurized and moistened with water, gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopic data showed there were declines in several terpenoid constituents as well as an increase in fatty acids and cyclosulfur.

The experiment was carried out in four consecutive seasons from 2002 to 2003 at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. The parameters recorded were cutting position (apical vs. basal), rooting medium (<b>composted</b> pine <b>bark</b> vs. sand), rooting hormone (with Seradix® No. 2 vs. no hormone), sampling days (15, 20, 25 and 30 days) and season (summer, autumn, winter and spring). Cutting position had a highly significant effect (P< 0. 001) on rooting and transplanting survival of bush tea with better rooting percentage, root length, root number and survival percentage from apical than from basal cuttings. <b>Composted</b> pine <b>bark</b> improved the number of roots developed but had no effect on rooting percentage, survival percentage nor on root length of the cuttings. The application of rooting hormone (Seradix® No. 2) during the propagation period increased root number and further increased shoot length after transplanting but not rooting percentage, survival percentage or root length. Season also showed highly significant differences (P< 0. 001) on rooting percentage, root number and root length.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} involving Arabidopsis thaliana {{often involves}} the quantification of phenotypic traits during cultivation on compost or other growing media. Many commercially-available growing media contain peat, but peat extraction is not sustainable {{due to its}} very slow rate of formation. Moreover, peat extraction reduces peatland biodiversity and releases stored carbon and methane into the atmosphere. Here, we compared the experimental performance of Arabidopsis on peat-based and several types of commercially-available peat-free growing media (variously formed from coir, <b>composted</b> <b>bark,</b> wood-fibre, and domestic compost), to provide guidance for reducing peat use in plant sciences research with Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis biomass accumulation and seed yield were reduced by cultivation on several types of peat-free growing media. Arabidopsis performed extremely poorly on coir alone, presumably because this medium was completely nitrate-free. Some peat-free growing media were more susceptible to fungal contamination. We found that autoclaving of control (peat-based) growing media had no effect upon any physiological parameters that we examined, compared with non-autoclaved control growing media, under our experimental conditions. Overall, we conclude that Arabidopsis performs best when cultivated on peat-based growing media because seed yield was almost always reduced when peat-free media were used. This may be because standard laboratory protocols and growth conditions for Arabidopsis are optimized for peat-based media. However, during the vegetative growth phase several phenotypic traits were comparable between plants cultivated on peat-based and some peat-free media, suggesting that under certain circumstances peat-free media can be suitable for phenotypic analysis of Arabidopsis...|$|E

However, casing partially substituted with bark or coir retained less water under applied suction (matric potential - 15 kPa), and resulted in a lower mushroom yield than peat + SBL casing. By contrast, casing substituted with 25 % (v/v) CT retained less water than non-amended peat + SBL near saturation, but the effect of partial substitution on water retention under applied suction was either small or not significant. Partial substitution with CT did not affect mushroom yield. These results indicate that water retention near saturation and under applied suction, i. e. desorption curve characteristics, are important in determining the suitability of a casing for mushroom cropping. Partial substitution of casings based on black peat and brown surface peat with CT resulted {{in an increase in}} mushroom dry matter content and the proportion of marketable mushrooms respectively. Mushroom cleanness was not affected by any of the treatments. The heavy metal contents of the mushrooms were not affected by the inclusion of CT in the casing.

Benefits include diversion of waste from landfill and recycling. Nonetheless, there is limited information on the characteristics needed to support plant growth in the long term, particularly {{the existence of a}} sustainable nitrogen reservoir. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of nitrogen cycling and retention within an artificial soil composed of 25 sand, 10 clay, 32. 5 <b>composted</b> <b>bark</b> and 32. 5 composted green waste over 52 weeks. Leachate was analysed for nitrogen species and nitrogen concentrations, and two of the soil columns had fertiliser added after 26 and 48 weeks. Results show that nitrate concentrations decreased from 6. 73 to 0. 36 mg N L− 1 after 2 weeks, due to poor retention of this anion in soil, and remained low for 6 months, before increasing up to 5. 87 mg N L− 1 after week 26. This sharp increase in dissolved nitrate was preceded by a decrease in the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen in the soil leachate. This finding indicates that the soil had become carbon-limited, leading to mineralisation of organic nitrogen by soil organisms and excretion of nitrogen. We also found that fertilisation of the soil did not alleviate carbon limitation and nitrogen loss was greater in fertilised soils, indicating nitrogen saturation. After the onset of carbon limitation, the dissolved nitrate concentrations in both the fertilised and unfertilised soils were close to exceeding the European Union threshold of concern for nitrate groundwater and river pollution. Thus, while the deployment of artificial soils is a viable option for landscaping projects, loss of nitrogen may be environmentally significant and soil management protocols must take account of both the carbon and nitrogen status of the substrate. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Natur...|$|E

40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the optimal {{conditions}} for composting and factors influencing microbiological changes during the <b>Composting</b> of Eucalyptus <b>bark</b> in the production of a plant growth medium. A bench-scale composter was designed to provide strict control over air composition, moisture content, temperature and mixing. The composter consisted of six 4 -L capacity gas-tight units of PVC plastic, each of which was provided with a mixing paddle coupled to a common drive. A natural temperature rise was simulated by having the units immersed in a water bath, with the temperature increased at rates consistent with those observed in large-scale compost heaps. This provided a companitively inexpensive versatile system, with rates of CO 2 and CH 4 production and 02 consumption automatically monitored by gas chromatography. Levels of volatilized NH 3 and nitrogen oxides (NO.) were manually monitored from acid traps. The reproducibility of the system was as good as the best reported. Optimal conditions for the bench-scale <b>composting</b> of eucalypt <b>bark</b> were considered to be a temperature of 55 0, on aeration rate of at least 20 mL min - 1 and an initial C:N ratio of 25 - 30, depending on the availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen, in decreasing order of availability, was provided in the form of urea, isobutylidene diurea (IBDU), fish wastes or sewage cake. Both respiratory activity and nitrogen loss data were considered to be of value in determining the economic as well as the microbiological optimal C:N ratio of <b>bark</b> <b>compost.</b> No further amendment other than water (giving an initial moisture content of 1147. d. w. basis) was found to be necessary. Ammonification and NH 3 volatilization occurred during the first sixteen days of composting while volatilization of NO was substantial during times of undesirable nitrogen availability. Delaying ammonification in the urea amended composts (by either the addition of quinone or urea's replacement with IBDU) increased ammonia volatilization. Net nitrification followed peak net ammonification, but nitrate appeared to be produced largely chemically rather than biologically. Volatilization of NO. was greatest from compost prepared using sewage cake. Up to five peaks of CO 2 output were observed over a 30 day run, three occurring during the transition to thermophilic conditions and one or two peaks occurring during a plateau temperature of 55 0. The predominant flora comprised Bacillus spp. during the mesophilic and early thermophilic phases (B. brevis and B. sphaericus followed by B. circulans and B. brevis then B. circulans, B. sphaericus or B. stearothersophilus). Bacillus spp. continued to predominate throughout the composting of sewage-bark and most of the fish-bark composts. However, actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp. and Thernomonospora spp.) and coryneforms predominated at latter stages of urea-bark composts. Strictly anaerobic bacteria appeared to be unimportant during the <b>composting</b> of <b>bark.</b> The predominant flora isolated during the mesophilic phase were not inhibited by compost components of any age, while members of the climax flora were inhibited by fresh compost components. Cellulase activity was not correlated with peaks in CO 2 output, but showed a slow increase or decrease, depending on the initial C:N ratio, over 30 days composting. However, lipase activity correlated with the peak in CO 2 output at about day sixteen in a fish-bark compost. The identification of thermophilic Bacillus spp. was aided by a study of their esterase mobilities and the use of numerical taxonomy. Phenolic compounds present after 30 days composting were phytotoxic. However, levels of residual ammonium could largely account for the phytotoxicity exhibited by water extracts from most of these <b>composts.</b> Eucalypt <b>bark</b> <b>composts</b> had a higher density than pine-bark composts or peat moss, but were as good as or better than the latter materials with regard to their water characteristics and particle-size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Production {{of quality}} nursery potted {{seedlings}} requires a proliferous root system that enables adequate acquisition of water, air and soil nutrients and this {{depends on the}} quality of substrate used. Soil has always been used as nursery and pot substrate but it has problems which include: aeration; drainage; non uniformity and chemical suitability. Therefore, development of alternative potting substrates with optimal chemical properties is necessary. The main objective {{of this study was to}} identify, formulate and characterize chemical suitability of forest soil, <b>compost,</b> pine <b>bark</b> and rice husks as alternative components of potting substrates. The experiment was conducted at Maseno University, Kenya between February and Decembe...|$|R
40|$|Suppressive {{effects of}} composts have been {{demonstrated}} mainly by American scientists with <b>composted</b> hard-wood <b>bark</b> {{as a part of}} container media for ornamentals. In this paper we report about experiments with yard waste- (YWC), biogenic waste- (BWC) and cattle manure compost (CMC) towards the soil borne pathogen Pythium ultimum Trow. There are results included from model composting systems and from yard waste composts originating from two commercial composting plants (C-YWC). It was shown that, in comparison to the other tested composts, YWC from the model composting system was superior in reducing disease incidence caused by P. ultimum on peas. In fifteen cases out of eighteen experiments with addition of 15...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocell((TM)) is a urea {{formaldehyde}} resin foam (UFRF) product used as a soil amendment. It is proposed to improve the physicochemical properties (viz. water relations and aeration) of the plant root zone. Flindersia schottiana is a tree species used in the ornamental horticulture industry. This study investigated the potential of Hydrocell (TM) [0 - 50 % (v/v) incorporation rates] to promote growth of F schottiana saplings during containerized nursery production in <b>composted</b> pine <b>bark</b> medium. The growth response of the potted saplings to transient water stress was also assessed. In addition, growth of E schottiana saplings potted into three different soil types (sand, loam, clay) was assessed in the presence and absence of 30 % (v/v) Hydrocell (TM). Under well-watered conditions in <b>composted</b> pine <b>bark,</b> Hydrocell (TM) treatments enhanced sapling leaflet numbers, with 30 % (v/v) being the most beneficial treatment. However, no consistent significant differential effects of incorporation rate on either plant height or stem diameter were recorded. Extended time to wilting upon withholding irrigation was achieved, with the optimum Hydrocell (TM) rate being 10 % (v/v). Among the three soil types compared, use of 30 % (v/v) Hydrocell (TM) resulted in improved growth of potted F schottiana saplings {{in the sand and}} loam soils, but not in the clay soil. These findings suggest that the UFRF, Hydrocell (TM), holds limited promise as a soil amendment for trees in the nursery phase. Optimum incorporation rates (v/v) would need to be determined for individual media types, specific irrigation regimes and individual taxa. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A Trichoderma harzianum strain, {{isolated}} from <b>composted</b> hardwood <b>bark</b> in Western Australia, {{was found to}} produce a metabolite with antifungal and plant growth promoting activity. The structure and absolute configuration of the fungal compound, harzianic acid (1), were determined by X-ray diffraction studies. Harzianic acid showed antibiotic activity against Pythium irregulare, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Rhizoctonia solani. A plant growth promotion effect was observed at low concentrations of 1. The use of new products based on biocontrol agents and/or their metabolites for disease control {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce the dependence on synthetic pesticides in agriculture. 1 Various biocontrol agents have been registered and are available as commercial products, including strains belonging to the genu...|$|R
40|$|CEN {{standards}} {{have helped to}} harmonize analytical methods for substrate analysis. Though, for special substrates or constituents the applicability might be Iimited. In this paper a comparative study of implementation of CEN standards to samples of pine bark and vermiculite has been carried out. For <b>composted</b> pine <b>bark,</b> an elongation of the equilibrium period up to 72 instead of 48 hours might increase the accuracy of determinations physical parameters according to EN 13041. For vermiculite, we suggest pycnometry as a feasible technique for the determination of particle density (PD), as the determination of organic matter (OM) as requested by EN 13041 for the calculation of the PD seems not to be applicable {{for this kind of}} material...|$|R
40|$|<b>Composted</b> {{eucalyptus}} <b>bark</b> (CEB) (Eucalyptus calophylla R. Br. Lindl. and E. diversicololr F. J. Muell) {{has been}} shown to suppress Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands (Sivasithamparam, 1981; Sivasithamparam et al., 1981). Hardy and Sivasithamparam (1991 c) showed that in an in vitro study, most fungi and actinomycetes isolated from the CEB were suppressive of P. drechsleri Sawada. This suppressiveness was shown to predominantly affect infectivity and not pathogen survival. In the present experiment, 44 fungal and 8 actinomycete isolates picked at random from isolations obtained from CEB, were screened against P. drechsleri in a steamed CEB-amended container medium. The aim was to determine whether individual fungal or actinomycete isolates are able to suppress the pathogenic activity P. drechsleri in container-grown plants...|$|R

This was done to permit an increase and stabilization of pH. Rock phosphate was incorporated into the medium at levels of 1. 5, 3, 6 and 12 mgdm− 3, while other nutrients were provided by a modified Hoagland’s solution (lacking phosphate) with a nitrogen level of 70 mgdm− 3. Although poor seedling growth was recorded, it is suggested that seedlings may be pre-adapted to transplantation in a potentially hostile environment...|$|R
