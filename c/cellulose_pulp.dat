40|$|Today’s market {{offers an}} {{ever-increasing}} range of <b>cellulose</b> <b>pulps</b> (derivative pulps) made fromvarious wood types through different delignification processes. Each pulp segment has its uniquecharacteristics, {{which makes it}} difficult for the producer of cellulose derivatives to choose the mostsuitable pulp for optimum processability and product quality. The objective of this study was toimprove knowledge of <b>cellulose</b> <b>pulps</b> and to describe how different pulp properties affectprocessability and quality in the production of viscose dope and <b>cellulose</b> ethers. Ten <b>pulp</b> samples were investigated, originating from both sulfite and sulfate processes, with highand low viscosities and with softwood and hardwood as raw material. The pulps were analyzed fortheir properties and then processed to viscose dope and a cellulose ether in two separate pilotfacilities. The intermediates in the viscose process as well as the quality of the viscose dope andcellulose ether were analyzed and the results correlated to pulp properties. Multivariate regression methods were applied to investigate the dominating physical and chemicalproperties of each pulp and pulp segment, and to study the use of spectroscopic analyses inpredicting pulp origin, concentration and composition of hemicelluloses as well as the content ofreducing end groups in cellulose. For the production of viscose dope, the models presented showedthe most important pulp properties for good cellulose reactivity and viscose filterability. In addition,the properties affecting gel formation, flocculation, degree of substitution and clarity in theproduction of cellulose ether were highlighted. The study also emphasized the need to supplementthe use of conventional analyses on pulps and viscose intermediates with other analytical methods,such as molecular weight distribution and carbohydrate analysis, to better predict the quality ofboth viscose dope and viscose fiber. The {{results of the present study}} could be useful to predict the origin and properties of new pulps, toreplace or supplement otherwise expensive pulp analyses, and to assess the impact of pulpproperties on the production of cellulose derivatives without extensive pilot-scale trials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{chemical}} treatments with selected organic compounds that have been applied to Mis-canthus to upgrade it, for pulp production or fractionation purposes. Organosolv processes have demonstrated their effec-tiveness as fractionation treatments; therefore special {{emphasis is placed on}} these systems and, in particular, those making use of carboxylic acids. That is, Acetosolv process that uses acetic acid-water-hydrochloric acid mixtures as delignifying agents, the process with formic acid-water-hydrochloric acid and the Milox process, which replaces the hydrochloric acid in the medium by hydrogen peroxide, thus forming peroxyacetic acid. Furthermore, we present the results of the charac-terizations that have been made in relation to extractives and lignin of Miscanthus.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} valorization {{of cellulose}} is currently subject of intense research. Isosorbide {{is among the}} most interesting products that can be formed from cellulose as it is a potential platform molecule and can be used for the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and polymers. A promising direct route from cellulose to isosorbide is presented in this work. The strategy relies on a one-pot bifunctional catalytic concept, combining heteropoly acids, viz. H 4 SiW 12 O 40, and redox catalysts, viz. commercial Ru on carbon, under H 2 pressure. Starting from pure microcrystalline cellulose, a rapid conversion was observed, resulting in over 50 [*]% isosorbide yield. The robustness of the developed system is evidenced by the conversion of a range of impure <b>cellulose</b> <b>pulps</b> obtained by organosolv fractionation, with isosorbide yields up to 63 [*]%.

5000|$|These {{flexible}} pulp foragers {{bring back}} cellulose {{back to the}} colony. They spend roughly {{a third of their}} total activity (time moving) actively transporting the <b>cellulose</b> <b>pulp</b> into the nest. Generally, the pulp forager will first meet with a water forager to get a small portion of water to carry with them. They will fly to a fiber source where the water is mixed in with the fiber source at the site of collection, then a small portion is collected with their mandibles and carry the pulp back to the nest. Upon meeting with the builder, portions of the paste are handed off or the entire paste is handed out as a whole. Sometimes the pulp foragers will keep a bit of the plant fiber and assist in the building process themselves. However, most of the time, the pulp forager will drop off its load and then meet with a water forager so that they can replenish their stock of water for the next trip. They are labeled as [...] "flexible" [...] because they have been known to take over other active roles in the nest when there is a deficit of those workers. For this reason, the pulp foragers are the ones who set the tempo of the construction behavior of the colony. However, they are affected by the number of active builders actually working. With a decrease in builders, the pulp foragers have to spend more time finding someone to distribute their load to, which usually just ends with them assisting in the building process instead to speed along the exchange.|$|E

40|$|Nano-fibrillated {{cellulose}} {{was produced}} from flax and wheat straw <b>cellulose</b> <b>pulps</b> by high pressure disintegration. The reinforcing potential of both disintegrated nano-celluloses in a polyvinyl-alcohol matrix was evaluated. Disintegration of wheat straw was significantly {{more time and}} energy consuming. Disintegration {{did not lead to}} distinct changes in the degree of polymerization; however, the fibre diameter reduction was more than a hundredfold, creating a nano-fibrillated cellulose network, as shown through field-emission-scanning electron microscopy. Composite films were prepared from polyvinyl alcohol and filled with nano-fibrillated celluloses up to 40 % mass fractions. Nano-fibrillated flax showed better dispersion in the polyvinyl alcohol matrix, compared to nano-fibrillated wheat straw. Dynamic mechanical analysis of composites revealed that the glass transition and rubbery region increased more strongly with included flax nano-fibrils. Intermolecular interactions between cellulose fibrils and polyvinyl alcohol matrix were shown through differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The selection of appropriate raw cellulose material for high pressure disintegration was an indispensable factor for the processing of nano-fibrillated cellulose, which is essential for the functional optimization of products...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Automated size {{exclusion}} chromatography with a {{differential refractometer}} detector was employed to study the molecular weight distribution patterns in various types of wood <b>pulp</b> <b>cellulose.</b> The results obtained were correlated with the conventional methods of measuring these properties. The dissolution of <b>pulp</b> <b>celluloses</b> in N,N-dimethylacetamide-lithium chloride solvent was optimized. This procedure solubilized the cellulose components directly without prior extraction or derivatization, processes {{that could lead to}} degradation of high molecular weight components. Stable cellulose solutions were obtained. The optimum dissolution conditions in the solvent system was highly dependent on the molecular weight, crystallinity and lignin content of each <b>pulp</b> <b>cellulose</b> sample. The molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of the <b>pulp</b> <b>cellulose</b> solutions were analyzed by {{size exclusion chromatography}}. A series of polystyrene standards were dissolved in the solvent and used as reference materials. The chromatographic data revealed whether depolymerization has taken place uniformly or non-uniformly during the pulp processing operations. The dilute solution intrinsic viscosity of the celluloses in N, N-dimethylacetamidelithium chloride solvent system was measured by capillary viscometry. Likewise, viscosity in cupriethylenediamine solution was analyzed. The measured viscosity values correlate well with the molecular weight data determined by size exclusion chromatography. The effect of acid hydrolysis on the molecular weight distribution pattern of cellulose was likewise studied. Results showed that each acid treatment provided different development of the molecular weight distribution curve, possibly due to the selectivity of hydrolytic attack on the cellulose components. The experimental data showed that dissolution in N,N-dimethylacetamide-lithium chloride solvent system and solution analysis by size exclusion chromatography can be a powerful tool in detecting differences among pulp cellulosic samples of widely different molecular weight and molecular weight distribution...|$|R
