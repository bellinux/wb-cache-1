At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games <b>Carbon</b> <b>Neutrality</b> Kiosk. The World Anti-Doping Agency set up an anti-doping education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is increasingly becoming a priority of governments and businesses, which {{is driven by}} growing environmental awareness. Academic research and industrial {{development is}} broadly exploring new ways to create greener and environmentally friendlier materials {{for a variety of}} applications in a number of sectors, including aeronautics, automotive, and construction industry. The “ 4 th International Conference on Innovative Natural Fibre Composites for Industrial Applications”, planned for October 2013, following the success of the three previous conferences held in Rome in October 2007, April 2009 and October 2011, is a good opportunity to investigate the items raised during the round table discussion which ended the last edition (interface, compatibility, bio-resins, toughness, impact, nanomaterials, etc.). The 4 th Conference aims to make a concrete contribution to our society, from the scientific community working on novel applications of natural fibres and in the development of new “green composites” and renewable nanomaterials. The most recent trends of research in this field aim at exploiting the principal advantages of natural fibre reinforcements, such as lightweight, worldwide availability, ease of recycling, sustainability, renewability, thermal and acoustic insulation, lower manufacturing energy and <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>neutrality.</b> These advantages of natural fibre composites are now more easily quantified through the use of Life Cycle Analysis methodology. This Conference will provide a forum for discussions involving composite users, leading suppliers, engineers, producers, environmentalists, researchers and technicians from industry and universities to share their experience, to present their latest results, discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of natural fibres, analyze the state of the art and future applications. Another objective will be supplying common ground for future collaborations e. g., in European projects...|$|R

5000|$|Recent advancements in {{modified}} porous nano-crystalline {{films have}} enabled {{the creation of}} electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed {{on top of each}} other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or PEDOT:PSS). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor (say Titanium Dioxide, [...] ) with adsorbed chromogens (different chromogens for different colors). These chromogens change color by reduction or oxidation. A passivator is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge <b>neutrality).</b> <b>Carbon</b> is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.|$|R

500|$|The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) is the top-tier {{administrative}} {{body for the}} local governance of Greater Manchester. It was established on 1 April 2011 as a pilot combined authority, unique to local government in the United Kingdom. It consists of ten indirectly elected members, each a directly elected councillor {{from one of the}} ten metropolitan boroughs that comprise Greater Manchester. The authority derives most of its powers from the Local Government Act 2000 and Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, and replaced a range of single-purpose joint boards and quangos in 2011, to provide a formal administrative authority for Greater Manchester with powers over public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, <b>carbon</b> <b>neutrality</b> and planning permission. Functional executive bodies, such as Transport for Greater Manchester, are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. On 3 November 2014, the Devolution to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority agreement was signed to pass further powers and responsibilities, as well as the establishment of an elected Mayor of Greater Manchester with the first election to be held in 2017. From April 2016, Greater Manchester will be the first part of England to [...] "get full control of its health spending" [...] with a devolution deal which aims to unite the region's health and social care systems under one budget under the control of local leaders, including Greater Manchester's new directly elected mayor.|$|E
500|$|Following a bid from AGMA {{highlighting}} {{the potential benefits}} in combatting the late-2000s financial crisis, it was announced in the 2009 United Kingdom Budget that Greater Manchester and the Leeds City Region would be awarded Statutory City Region Pilot status, allowing (if they desired) for their constituent district councils to pool resources and become statutory Combined Authorities with powers comparable to the Greater London Authority. The stated aim of the pilot was to evaluate the contributions to economic growth and sustainable development by Combined Authorities. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enabled {{the creation of a}} Combined Authority for Greater Manchester with devolved powers on public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, <b>carbon</b> <b>neutrality</b> and planning permission, pending approval from the ten councils. Such strategic matters would be decided on via an enhanced majority rule voting system involving ten members appointed from among the councillors of the metropolitan boroughs (one representing each borough with each council nominating one substitute) without the input of central government. The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on 29 March 2010, and submitted final recommendations for a constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport. On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15-week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution. Following requests by the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, which was superseded by the GMCA, the new authority came into being on 1 April 2011. On the same day, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee was also formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population (roughly one councillor per 75,000 residents) to scrutinise the running of Greater Manchester's transport bodies and their finances, approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the Combined Authority. On 3 November 2014, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that there would be an eleventh member of the GMCA — a directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, with [...] "powers over transport, housing, planning and policing" [...] from 2017. This announcement was followed up on 25 February 2015 with news that Greater Manchester would be the first part of England to [...] "get full control of its health spending" [...] with a devolution deal from April 2016.|$|E
