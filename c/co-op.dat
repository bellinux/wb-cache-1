Data from the meters can be viewed at the Solar Ypsi website, allowing anyone to compare generation from different sites.|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{co-operative}} enterprises have prospered in {{the last}} thirty years in various sectors. In this essay we analyze the role played by managerilization in allowing Italian <b>co-ops</b> to compete nationally and internationally with capitalist enterprises. On the basis of a substantial set of company histories and managers interviews, we have built a three generations model of <b>co-ops</b> managers, which shows the changes that have allowed <b>co-ops</b> to become fully equipped with managerial skills. The strong leadership of umbrella organizations, the inner careers of most managers and legislation have been instrumental in avoiding demutualization, the killer of <b>co-ops</b> in many other countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{considers}} {{the factors that}} affect service provision for individuals who present to out-of-hours (OOH) primary care services in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The organisations under consideration are known as OOH <b>co-ops.</b> Specifically, an individual can potentially receive one of four services: nurse advice, doctor advice, a treatment centre consultation or a home visit. Aim: The principal aim was to investigate whether service provision was consistent across <b>co-ops</b> once patient characteristics, patient complaints and other covariates were controlled for. In this paper, service provision {{was seen as a}} necessary but not sufficient condition for quality. Methods: A multinomial logit approach was used to model the choice between the three services offered by <b>co-ops.</b> Results: The results indicate that service provision was relatively homogenous across <b>co-ops.</b> Conclusions: Quality was consistent across <b>co-ops</b> in terms of service provision. Therefore {{the next step is to}} consider whether quality within the treatment received varies. Nevertheless, the result provides some support for using OOH <b>co-ops</b> as a means to provide OOH primary care...|$|R

5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish <b>co-op</b> and kitchen.

50|$|Many utility cooperatives {{strive to}} bring the best service at the lowest {{possible}} cost, but often {{the high cost of}} maintaining the infrastructure needed to cover large, rural areas without the support of large cities as a rich customer base causes prices to be high. However, a few such <b>co-ops</b> have managed to tap into urban markets (due to growth into previously rural territory served by the <b>co-ops)</b> and have proven to be very cost-effective. More recently established energy <b>co-ops</b> began with national coverage: Co-operative Energy in the UK and Enercoop in France are examples of consumer cooperatives. Other <b>co-ops</b> have formed to concentrate on the generation of renewable energy, especially wind energy co-operatives.|$|R
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} <b>co-op</b> mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the <b>co-op</b> was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best <b>co-op</b> experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E
5|$|The River Street Bakery, {{also in the}} Mill Works Building and {{now owned}} by the <b>Co-op,</b> claims to have the only {{wood-fired}} brick oven in commercial use in Washtenaw County. Originally called the Depot Town Sourdough Bakery, the bakery was founded by Tom Kinney as an independent cooperative non-profit with a $20,000 loan from the Cooperative Whole Grain Education Association and pledges from prospective customers. To stretch the limited funds, the brick oven was built by hand in 1989. From the beginning, the Ypsilanti Food <b>Co-op</b> retailed the bread.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{avenues for}} {{resistance}} to precarious and exploited labour {{in the cultural}} sector. It investigates the potential of worker co-operatives to help improve working conditions and radically reimagine cultural work. The concept of worker <b>co-ops</b> focuses on democratising ownership and decision-making power. It challenges class divisions and promises to empower workers by giving them {{more control over their}} working lives. However, <b>co-ops</b> are constrained by competitive market pressures, creating tensions between economic necessity and political goals. Examining current debates on co-operatives the article explores <b>co-ops</b> as a radical pre-figurative political project, mobilised in a reformist attempt to create a more ethical capitalism or be integrated into neoliberal discourses of entrepreneurship and individual responsibility. It goes on to discuss the potentials and limitations of worker <b>co-ops</b> by looking at precariousness, inequality and individualisation of cultural sector work arguing that radical <b>co-ops</b> can play an important role within a larger movement that mobilises collectivity to confront neoliberal individualisation and capitalist realism...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of what co-operatives {{can contribute to the}} left is explored in the light of Rosa Luxemburg’s apparent rejection of reformist organisations in her ‘Reform or revolution’, written {{at the beginning of the}} early twentieth century. Drawing on interviews with worker co-operatives in the UK cultural industries, Sandoval teases out the politics of working in <b>co-ops,</b> and shows that, although the kinds of <b>co-ops</b> she is discussing tend to operate at the small-scale prefigurative level, they help open up the political spaces on which bigger political action can build - although this undoubtedly requires making connections both between individual <b>co-ops</b> and between <b>co-ops</b> and the wider left. Her conclusion is that different times require different tactics, and that, though Luxemburg would not have seen much value in <b>co-ops</b> solely as a form of prefigurative politics, she would have valued them if they could at the same time contribute to advancing the greater goal of building a radical alternative...|$|R
