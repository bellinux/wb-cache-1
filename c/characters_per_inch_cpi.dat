40|$|The design {{requirements}} are given for magnetic oxide coated, {{electronic data processing}} tape, wound on reels. Magnetic recording tape types covered by this specification are intended for use on digital tape transports using the Non-Return-to-Zero-change-on-ones (NRZI) recording method for recording densities {{up to and including}} 800 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>cpi)</b> and the Phase-Encoding (PE) recording method for a recording density of 1600 cpi...|$|E
50|$|Pitch is {{the number}} of {{characters}} and spaces in one inch of running text, that is <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (abbreviated <b>cpi).</b> The pitch is most often used as a measurement of font size of typewriters as well as printers.|$|R
5000|$|Density : Initial {{recording}} density was 100 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Later models supported 200, 556 and 800 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Code 11 is a barcode {{symbology}} {{developed by}} Allais while at Intermec in 1977.In 1977 Intermec’s printing and reading technology limited {{the density of}} Code 39 to 9.4 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> For numeric applications, Codabar provided somewhat higher density (12 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> However, at the time, Intermec was contractually obligated to sell Codabar printers only to Monarch Marking Systems. Interleaved 2 of 5 was not a discrete symbology and thus could not be printed at a high enough density by our drum printers. It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character (-).|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} first used to record {{computer}} data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The recording medium was a thin strip of one half inch (12.65 mm) wide metal, consisting of nickel-plated bronze (called Vicalloy). Recording density was 128 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as physical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A 3/4 inch gap between records allowed the mechanism enough time to stop the tape. Initial tape speed was 75 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> second (2.95 m/s) and recording density was 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> giving a transfer speed of 120 kbit/s. Later 729 models supported 556 and 800 characters/inch (transfer speed 480 kbit/s). At 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> a single 2400 foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 six-bit bytes, or 3 MByte).|$|R

50|$|The columns on {{the paper}} were spaced at the {{standard}} typewriter pitch of 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> 0.1″ <b>per</b> column. The <b>characters</b> on the chain were spaced 0.1505″ apart, so that for each 0.001″ movement of the chain, a new character aligned with a print column. Moving at 7.5 feet per second, one hammer might fire each , but they were never exactly simultaneous.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{acoustic}} {{studies have}} indicated that low-density, open-cell, metal foams may be suitable acoustic liner material for noise suppression in high by-pass engines. Metal foam response under simulated tip rub conditions was studied to assess whether its durability would be sufficient for the foam to serve both as a rub strip above the rotor as well as an acoustic treatment. Samples represented four metal alloys, nominal cell dimensions ranging from 60 to 120 cells <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>cpi),</b> and relative densities ranging from 3. 4 to 10 percent. The resulting rubbed surfaces were relatively smooth and the open cell structure of the foam was not adversely affected. Sample relative density appeared to have significant influence on the forces induced by the rub event. Acoustic responses of various surface preparations were measured using a normal incidence tube. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the foam s open-cell structure was retained after rubbing and that the acoustic absorption spectra variation was minimal...|$|R
25|$|Characters were {{proportionally}} spaced, {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being selectable as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Tab stops could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{computer}} industry often measures mouse sensitivity {{in terms of}} counts <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>CPI),</b> commonly expressed as dots <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (DPI)the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch. In early mice, this specification was called pulses <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (ppi). The Mickey originally referred {{to one of these}} counts, or one resolvable step of motion. If the default mouse-tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen-pixel or dot on-screen per reported step, then the CPI does equate to DPI: dots of cursor motion <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of mouse motion. The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse; the higher the CPI, the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement. However, software can adjust the mouse sensitivity, making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI. [...] software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically, taking into account the mouse's absolute speed and the movement from the last stop-point. In most software, an example being the Windows platforms, this setting is named [...] "speed," [...] referring to [...] "cursor precision". However, some operating systems name this setting [...] "acceleration", the typical Apple OS designation. This term is incorrect. Mouse acceleration in most mouse software refers to the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} first used to record {{computer}} data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The UNISERVO drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of 0.5 in wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze. Recording density was 128 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of 100 in/s m/s, yielding a data rate of 12,800 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a parity track, and one was a clock, or timing track. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.|$|R

25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as logical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A ¾ inch gap between records allowed the mechanism time to stop the tape. At 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> a single 2400-foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 six-bit bytes).|$|R
2500|$|In English-speaking countries, {{the commonplace}} {{typewriters}} printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines <b>per</b> vertical <b>inch,</b> and had either of two variants of character width, called [...] "pica" [...] for ten <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> horizontal <b>inch</b> and [...] "elite" [...] for twelve. This {{differed from the}} use of these terms in printing, where they refer to the height of the characters on the page ("pica" [...] designating ten horizontal lines <b>per</b> vertical <b>inch).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The MT/ ST was {{followed}} by the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer, which differed only in output device, and for which it served as input. (Tapes prepared or edited on the MT/ST could be played back on the MT/SC.) Thus automated line justification, with three type sizes (10, 12, and 15 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> bold, italic, and a variety of type styles (implemented using type [...] "balls" [...] {{similar to those of the}} Selectric typewriter) were made available within the budget of a medium-sized office or publisher. When printing a document, the machine would pause printing at the stop code and wait for an operator to change the Selectric type ball and press a button telling the device to continue.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variation}} {{known as}} [...] "Correcting Selectrics" [...] introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape {{in front of}} the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable [...] "pitch" [...] so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and elite type (12 <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital [...] "W" [...] to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the IBM Executive, proportional spacing was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.|$|R
50|$|The {{limit of}} the line length in 70-80 {{characters}} may well be originated from various technical limitations of various equipment. The American teletypewriters could type only 72 CPL, while the British ones even less, 70 CPL. In the era of typewriters, most designs of the typewriter carriage were limited to 80-90 CPL. The most widespread and standard paper size in the US (8.5×11") also has been imposing limitations on the line length: {{it is possible to}} print only 85 or 102 characters (with the font size either 10 or 12 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> without margins on the typewriter. With various margins (usually from 1 to 1.5 inches for each side, but there is no strict standard) these numbers may shrink to 55-78 CPL.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Futura was {{designed}} by Laird Fortune Covey. A design patent was applied for in 1957 and granted in 1958. The design differs from previous Royal portable typewriters in several ways. The most obvious difference is its curved and aerodynamic shape, {{but there were also}} key construction and materials differences. The Futura had aluminum body panels; this reduced the carrying weight to 22 pounds and provided limited rust protection. In addition to the aluminum body panels, the Futura had a corrugated steel front panel and welded steel internals and frame. The keys were plastic and designed in the recently adopted “Tombstone” style. Two red “Magic Margin” buttons were located on top of the carriage and - on some models - 'tab set' and 'tab clear' keys could be found on the front panel. A plastic red 'Royal' logo also on the front panel doubled as the push-button latch control to open the top of the machine and allow access to the ribbon and internal controls. The Futura had four rubber feet to hold the typewriter in place, an acrylic paper table, and a steel carriage return lever.The standard typeface on all Royal Futura models was [...] "Merit". [...] This typeface was available in Pica (10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and Elite (12 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Keyboards were offered in English and French character sets. Other important design features included a 'Carriage Lock Lever' to protect the typewriter during travel by centering and immobilizing the carriage; a 'Ribbon Color Selector' that could be switched from black ribbon to red ribbon to stencil; 'Segment Shift', which allowed for the character basket rather than the carriage to move when the shift key was pressed; and a 'Clear Writing Line' that permitted an unobstructed character view while typing.|$|R
40|$|The ADNS- 2620 is a {{new entry}} level, small form factor optical mouse sensor. It is used to {{implement}} a nonmechanical tracking engine for computer mice. Unlike its predecessor, this new optical mouse sensor allows for more compact and affordable optical mice designs. It is based on optical navigation technology, which measures changes in position by optically acquiring sequential surface images (frames) and mathematically determining the direction and magnitude of movement. The sensor is housed in an 8 -pin staggered dual inline package (DIP). It is designed for use with the HDNS- 2100 Lens, HLMP-ED 80 -xx 000, and the HDNS- 2200 LED Clip, providing an optical mouse solution that is compact and affordable. There are no moving parts, so precision optical alignment is not required, thereby facilitating high volume assembly. The output format is a two wire serial port. The current X and Y information are available in registers accessed via the serial port. Resolution is 400 counts <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>cpi)</b> with rates of motion up to 12 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> second (ips). Theory of Operation The ADNS- 2620 is based on Optical Navigation Technology. It contains an Image Acquisition System (IAS), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and a two wire serial port. The IAS acquires microscopic surface images via the lens and illumination system provided by the HDNS- 2100, HDNS- 2200, and HLMP-ED 80 -xx 000. These images are processed by the DSP to determine the direction and distance of motion. Feature...|$|R
50|$|HCCB uses a grid {{of colored}} triangles to encode data. Depending on the target use, the grid size (total number of symbols), symbol density (the printed size of the triangles), and symbol count (number of colors used) can be varied. HCCB can use an eight-, four-, or two-color (black-and-white) palette. Microsoft claims that {{laboratory}} tests using standard off-the-shelf printers and scanners have yielded readable eight-color HCCBs equivalent to approximately 3,500 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b>|$|R
500|$|On {{a further}} {{visit to the}} set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office. He was {{informed}} {{that he needed to}} change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with H. Beam Piper's 1962 novel Little Fuzzy. He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name [...] "tribble". He took the name to Coon, who hated it. But after seeing the alternatives, he agreed to it. Gerrold turned in the script on July 17, entitled [...] "You Think You've Got Tribbles...?". While Coon disliked the name of the small furry creatures, he bought the script. Gerrold's submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production's mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold's not having used a typewriter with the 10 point pitch (10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> Pica standard of the TV and film industry. This meant that some twenty pages needed to be cut from the script.|$|R
5000|$|In mid 1971, William [...] "Bill" [...] Crouse {{invented a}} new bar code called Delta C.It {{achieved}} {{four times the}} <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> as Delta B. Delta B compared bar widths to space width to code bits. This was extremely sensitive to ink spread where too much ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward and too little to cause them to shrink. To make it worse as bars spread spaces shrink and vice versa. Delta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread. The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned most or preferably all the character. In August, 1971, Crouse joined the scanner effort. After several months they had made no progress. They {{were aware of the}} RCA bull’s eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight line laser scanner, but a readable label was far too large. Although Litton Industries proposed a bull’s eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area, it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol. The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely. They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world, none of which were feasible.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 3102 {{dot-matrix printer}} used thermal-paper print technology, {{and could be}} {{attached}} to the IBM 3101's auxiliary port. It supported 80 5x7 dot-matrix <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> line, 6 lines <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and output 40 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second.|$|R
5000|$|Gerrold {{turned around}} the first draft script in {{two and a half}} days. Both Coon and Associate Producer Robert Justman gave {{feedback}} on the script, and pointed out a few gaps such as there needing to be some way in the plot for the crew to discover that Darvin was a Klingon agent. The following draft had Cyrano Jones discover that Darvin was an agent, which Coon thought was not [...] "punchy" [...] enough. It was then re-written so that the fuzzies were allergic to Klingons. Both Gerrold and Coon thought the idea was [...] "trite... shtick... hokey" [...] and [...] "had been done before". but Coon agreed that it was the direction the story should go. The re-write of the script took a further week.On a further visit to the set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office.

50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (25 mm): The {{most common}} {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than there are teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 13 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 9 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do.
