5000|$|The {{negation}} of can {{is the single}} word cannot, only occasionally written separately as <b>can</b> <b>not.</b> Though cannot <b>is</b> preferred (as <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>is</b> potentially ambiguous), its irregularity (all other uncontracted verbal negations use at least two words) sometimes causes those unfamiliar with the nuances of English spelling to use the separated form. Its contracted form is cant (pronounced [...] in RP and some other dialects). The {{negation of}} could is the regular could not, contracted to couldnt.|$|R

5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> increased.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> measured only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income {{is not sufficient to}} evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|Mature plasmodia {{can produce}} fruit bodies under {{appropriate}} circumstances, the exact triggers for this process are unknown. According to laboratory researchers, changes in humidity, temperature or pH value {{as well as}} starvation periods {{were thought to be}} the triggers in some species. The plasmodia abandon their nutrient intake and crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores. Once the fructification begins, it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> stopped. If disturbances occur, malformed spore-bearing fruit bodies are often produced.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed.
