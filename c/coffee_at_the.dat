She starts to develop {{feelings}} for the Green Goblin, which is briefly hinted at when she accepts Goblin's offer {{to go out on}} a date for <b>coffee</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of After Hours. At the end of Happy Hour she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still pined for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E

2500|$|A Chickasaw {{delegation}} {{assigned to}} explore the new Chickasaw territory west of the Mississippi stalled removal, much to Jackson's distress, for another two years, after {{they returned to the}} Mississippi Chickasaws saying that the new land was unacceptable. The Senate refused to ratify the Franklin treaty and the Chickasaws refused to leave their territory in Mississippi to these lands. After enduring two more years of whites in Mississippi however, and the devastating effects whiskey and squatters on Chickasaw culture, and of Mississippi state law on Chickasaw tribal governance, the Chickasaw National Council assembled to meet John <b>Coffee</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Council House on Pontotoc Creek on October 20, 1832 to sign a Treaty allowing for the sale of the Chickasaw Mississippi territory in exchange for the surveying of new lands in the west. The preamble written by the Chickasaw chiefs read: [...] "The Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation, by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being ignorant of the laws of the white man, they cannot understand or obey them. Rather than submit to this great evil, they prefer to seek a home in the west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing that they can procure for themselves a home, in a country suited to their wants and condition, provided they had the means to contract and pay for the same, they have determined to sell their country and hunt a new home. The President has heard the complaints of the Chickasaws and like them believes they cannot be happy, and prosper as a nation, in their present situation and condition, and being desirous to relieve them from the great calamity that seems to await them, if they remain as they are - He has sent his Commissioner General John Coffee, who has met the whole Chickasaw nation in Council, and after mature deliberation, they have entered into the following articles..."Although further complications had to be resolved, Arrell M. Gibson writes that the Pontotoc Creek Treaty [...] "was the basic Chickasaw removal document providing for the cession of all tribal land east of the Mississippi River." [...] In the treaty, the Chickasaw land was ceded in return for the U.S. finding suitable land for resettlement –revealing the chiefs' desperation to regain Chickasaw sovereignty from the aggressions of the state of Mississippi. Chickasaw landholders were to be compensated for the improvements made on his land, and all the proceeds made by the Federal government in the sale of the land were to {{be turned over to the}} Chickasaw to pay for finding new territory and the actual removal of the tribe. Unlike other removal treaties, then, the Chickasaw would pay for their own migration. The treaty also provided for the protection the Chickasaw in Mississippi until they emigrated with the allotment of [...] "temporary homesteads." [...] This meant that the Chickasaws were allotted the land they were living on in Mississippi to be protected by the Federal government from squatters, –a benefit not given to the Cherokee when later the Federal government relied on the influx of squatters in Georgia to pressure the Cherokee into removal.|$|E
