25|$|Originally {{called the}} Cappella Nuova, or New Chapel, in 1622 this chapel was {{dedicated}} to Saint Britius (San Brizio), {{one of the first}} bishops of Spoleto and Foligno, who evangelized the people of Orvieto.

This painting is from an anonymous late 13th-century master from Orvieto, who was probably influenced by Cimabue and Coppo di Marcovaldo. The face of the <b>Child</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> restoration from the 14th century. This panel stands on the late-Baroque altar of the Gloria, dating from 1715 and made by Bernardino Cametti.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child.

500|$|In Egyptian accounts, the {{pregnant}} Isis hides from Set, {{to whom the}} unborn <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> threat, in a thicket of papyrus in the Nile Delta.

The thicket's special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated.

500|$|After {{two years}} of discussions, Vikram began a film under the {{direction}} of Selvaraghavan in a project dubbed by the media as Sindubad. The film began shoot and completed a schedule by early 2010 in the Himalayas with Swati Reddy appearing as the female lead. However, the film was reported to be momentarily shelved and subsequently never took off again after the producer Singanamala Ramesh walked out. Vikram then agreed terms to feature in Vikram Kumar's 24 produced by Mohan Natarajan, with Ileana D'Cruz signed on to play the female lead role. The film progressed briefly with shots being canned in caves, before the director was ousted from the project, cancelling the film. Vikram then also shot briefly for a third successive shelved project directed by Boopathy Pandian for the same producer, featuring him in the role of an investigative cop; however the film failed to progress and instead Natarajan financed Vikram's next. His 2011 release, Deiva Thirumagal directed by A. L. Vijay, saw Vikram portray a father with a developmental disability having the mental maturity of a seven-year-old. To prepare for the role, Vikram visited homes for the mentally challenged such as Vidya Sagar and Vidya Sudha for a month, watching their body language and taking notes. He also communicated with the patients, to pick up the nuances of people with impaired speech. Vikram has since gone on to describe his role as Krishna as the best character he has ever portrayed. The film which also featured Sara Arjun, Anushka Shetty and Amala Paul in supporting roles, opened to predominantly positive reviews from critics and enjoyed commercial success at the box office. The reviewer from The Deccan Chronicle described that the film was [...] "Vikram's show all the way" [...] and that [...] "his rendition of a mentally-challenged man trying to cope with the everyday realities of raising a <b>child</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> work of art", praising his [...] "fiery, complex performance as one of the more viciously honest depictions of mental illness cinema has seen". Similarly another critic described that the on-screen chemistry between Vikram and his daughter, played by Sara Arjun, is [...] "magic" [...] and their performances [...] "are sure to leave a lump in your throat". The critic from The Hindu praised the film and Vikram's performance but analysed that [...] "a problem arises only when you stop looking at Krishna as a character, and begin to see him as Vikram, the hero" [...] and that Vikram should have [...] "underplayed a little here and there and it would have worked better". However Vikram once again completed a sweep of the top acting awards that year, with further recognition at the Vijay and Filmfare Awards.|$|E
