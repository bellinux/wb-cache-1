The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) {{has been asked to}} assess the consumer health risk associated with the intake of <b>common</b> <b>groundsel.</b> Cases of poisoning have shown that <b>common</b> <b>groundsel</b> can cause life-threatening liver damage in humans and animals. This is caused by substances in groundsel such as se-necionine and riddelline that belong to the group of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and are among the group’s most poisonous substances. In animal experiments, these alkaloids have been carcinogenic and in various in vitro and in vivo tests genotoxic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies riddeline as probably carcinogenic for humans. A portion size below which unsaturated PAs do not constitute a health risk can-not be determined science-based and therefore a tolerable intake can also not be derived. As a preventive measure, the intake of PAs should be avoided as much as possible. As a result of its exposure assessment, BfR concludes that acute to medium-term liver damage due to the intake of salad mix contaminated with <b>common</b> <b>groundsel</b> cannot be excluded.

40|$|Simazine {{loss from}} soil to surface runoff water produce both a {{decrease}} in the effectiveness of the soil chemical treatment and a water quality hazard in receiving waters. Simazine has been found in 30 % of wells sampled in Fresno and Tulare counties, California and some contamination has been attributed to simazine use in citrus orchards. Contamination of receiving water from herbicides could put important weed control tools at risk and potentially increase risks to human health. In order to better understand the off-site movement of herbicides, studies were conducted in citrus orchards to evaluate weed control efficacy under selected weed management practices and to measure selected management practices for mitigating preemergent herbicide movement in rainfall runoff from citrus orchard middles. The results showed weed management practices that avoid broadcast application of preemergent herbicides during the rainy season were as effective as the standard rate at 2. 0 lb ai /acre for weed control by using spray application to the entire orchard floor.

40|$|The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Terrestrial plant test {{is often}} used for the {{ecological}} risk assessment of contaminated land. However, its origins in plant protection product testing mean that the species recommended in the OECD guidelines are unlikely to occur on contaminated land.

Chloroplasts isolated from naturally occurring triazine-susceptible and triazine-resistant biotypes of <b>common</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio vulgaris L.) showed the following characteristics. (a) Diuron strongly inhibited photosynthetic electron transport from H 2 O to 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol in both biotypes.

(b) Hill plots of electron transport inhibition data indicate a noncooperative binding of one inhibitor molecule {{at the site of}} action for both diuron and atrazine. (c) Susceptible chloroplasts show a strong diuron and atrazine binding (14 C-radiolabel assays) with binding constants (K) of 1. 4 × 10 − 8 molar and 4 × 10 − 8 molar, respectively. In the resistant chloroplasts the diuron binding was slightly decreased (K = 5 × 10 − 8 molar), whereas no specific atrazine binding was detected.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Experiments were {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} cultural management practices on weed growth in nursery containers. Experiments 1 and 2 evaluated the effects of dolomitic lime rate and application method on substrate pH, creeping woodsorrel (Oxalis corniculata L.) establishment in containers, and growth of azalea (Rhododendron ‘Rosebud’) and pieris (Pieris japonica ‘Claventine’). Creeping woodsorrel shoot fresh weight was negatively correlated to substrate pH (r = - 0. 67, p = 0. 0001). Creeping woodsorrel germinated and established poorly in substrates with pH greater than 6. 7. In Experiment 3 and 4 containers were topdressed with a uniform layer of pulverized or pelletized dolomitic limestone at several rates. The most significant pH effect occurred on the surface layer. Topdressing containers with 40 g of lime provided creeping woodsorrel control. In Expeiment 5 incorporating the same lime rates used in Experiment 3 and 4 caused chlorosis in azalea and pieris while topdressed lime ultimately caused no change in growth or foliar color regardless of rate applied. 	The effect of nitrogen (N) form on establishment and growth of bittercress (Cardamine oligosperma Nutt.), prostrate spurge (Chamaesyce maculata L.), pearlwort (Sagina procumbens L.), <b>common</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio vulgaris L.), northern willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum Rafin.), or creeping woodsorrel. Injectors delivered 150 ppm N using either ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4) (AS), ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO３) (AN), calcium nitrate plus magnesium nitrate (Ca(NO３) ２+ Mg(NO３) ２) (CMN), or urea (CO(NH 2) 2) (UR). Weeds in containers receiving no N (non-treated controls) germinated in lower numbers and produced less biomass. Nitrogen form affected container weed establishment and growth especially in creeping woodsorrel and prostrate spurge. Across all species, CMN tended to reduce growth and flower number compared to other N forms. Weeds fertilized with AN were always among the largest with the most inflorescences. 	The effects of substrate particle size and herbicide rate on weed establishment and growth in containers were evaluated in three experiments. Across the three experiments, pearlwort established with higher numbers in containers with the finest substrate. Subsequent pearlwort growth was reduced in two of the three experiments with coarser substrates. As rate of Rout increased pearlwort growth decreased. Northern willowherb (Epilobium ciliatum Rafin) responded more to herbicide rate than substrate particle size in one experiment 2, however, in Experiment 3 it germinated and grew larger in fine bark compared to medium bark. <b>Common</b> <b>groundsel</b> (Senecio vulgaris L.) established and grew larger with decreasing particle size and herbicide rate...|$|E

This resulted in total PA levels in feed of respectively 5. 5, 11. 1, 53. 1, 5. 9 and 21. 7 mg kg – 1, with varying composition. PAs {{were transferred to}} eggs, in particular yolk, with steady-state levels of respectively 12, 21, 216, 2 and 36 µg kg – 1. Overall transfer rates for the sum of PAs were estimated between 0. 02 % and 0. 23 %, {{depending on the type}} of PAs in the feed. In animals slaughtered shortly after the last exposure, levels in meat were slightly lower than those in eggs, levels in livers somewhat higher. When switched to clean feed, levels in eggs gradually decreased, but after 14 days were still above detection limits in the hens exposed to higher PA levels. Similar was the case for meat and especially kidneys and livers. It is concluded that the intake of PA containing herbs by laying hens may result in levels in eggs and meat that could be of concern for consumers, and as such should be avoided. </p...|$|E
40|$|Intercropping leek (Allium porrum L.) {{and celery}} (Apium graveolens L.) was {{recognized}} as an option to reduce growth and reproductive potential of weeds while maintaining yield and product quality of both crops on a high level. To optimise the intercropping system for yield, quality and weed suppression a combined use of mechanistic and descriptive models, together with experimental work, was applied. An eco-physiological model was used to improve understanding of interplant competition based on physiological, morphological and phenological processes. The model was parameterised based on characteristics of the plants in monocultures and its performance was evaluated for the crop mixtures using experimental data from different growing seasons. After validation the model was used to simulate biomass production and quality of leek, celery and seed production of <b>Common</b> <b>Groundsel</b> (Senecio vulgaris L.) {{for a wide range}} of crop densities and times of weed emergence. In a second step, the results of the simulations where summarized using a descriptive hyperbolic yield-density model, which then allowed evaluation of the intercropping system in terms of productivity, product quality, and the ability to suppress weeds. The paper will explain this combined modelling approach and how it was used to design and optimise the leek-celery intercropping system. Moreover, this study shows that functional biodiversity, as represented by the intercropping system, can contribute to the improvement of the economical potential while increasing the sustainability of highly developed agricultural production systems...|$|E
