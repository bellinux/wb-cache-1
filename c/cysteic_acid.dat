50|$|Kalkitoxin {{has five}} chiral centers, {{one of which}} is the ring carbon to which the {{terminal}} alkene is coordinated, with the remaining four occurring at tertiary carbon atoms along the aliphatic chain originating from the imine nitrogen. The total stereochemistry of natural (+)-kalkitoxin is 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R. For this determination, 3JCH values by a variation of the HSQMBC pulse technique, a type of HMBC spectroscopy, and 3JHH values by exclusive correlation spectroscopy (E.COSY). These methods use NMR to evaluate the spin-spin coupling constants which directly relate to the dihedral angle of the atoms being analyzed, allowing for the determination of chirality. This was used to determine the stereochemistry of chiral centers at C7, C8, and C10. Because C7 and C8 are adjacent stereocenters, these techniques allowed for immediate determination of their relative stereochemistry, however C10 is separated from C8 by C9, which carries two diastereotopic protons. This allows for the determination of relative stereochemistry of C8 and C10 to the C9 protons through J-coupling \3J coupling values, so as to relate the relative stereochemistry of C8 to C10. These methods yielded a relative stereochemistry of 7R, 8S, 10S for the aliphatic chain stereocenters. Stereochemistry at C3 was determined by Marfey's analysis, wherein the compound was ozonized and subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> from the thiazoline ring and attached terminal alkene. Marfey's analysis indicated this amino acid derivative was L-cysteic acid, indicating R absolute stereochemistry at C3. The absolute stereochemistry of the total molecule was determined by synthesizing the possible configurations of the already determined relative chiralities, and comparison of these to natural Kalkitoxin via 13C NMR shift differences, revealing the natural (+)-kalkitoxin stereochemistry to be 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R.|$|E

Uptake {{was dependent on}} the availability of glucose and, in all cases, the estimated intracellular concentrations substantially exceeded extracellular levels. During uptake, there was little metabolism of tritiated 2 -amino- 3 -phosphonopropionic acid (APP), the aspartic acid analogue, and a negligible incorporation of isotope from this substance into the nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or cell wall fractions of the cell. Competition studies with APP indicated that its transport in L. plantarum and in Streptococcus faecalis was antagonized only by structurally related compounds such as glutamic, aspartic, and <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids.</b> Kinetic studies showed that APP was taken up by a single catalytic system in S. faecalis. A mutant strain of this organism which lacks one of two kinetically distinguishable dicarboxylic amino acid transport systems failed to accumulate measurable amounts of APP.

40|$|Lactocin S, a {{bacteriocin}} {{produced by}} Lactobacillus sake L 45, has been purified to homogeneity by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase chromatography, and gel filtration. The purification resulted in approximately a 40, 000 -fold {{increase in the}} specific activity of lactocin S and enabled the determination of {{a major part of}} the amino acid sequence. Judging from the amino acid composition, lactocin S contained approximately 33 amino acid residues, of which about 50 % were the nonpolar amino acids alanine, valine, and leucine. Amino acids were not detected upon direct N-terminal sequencing, indicating that the N-terminal amino acid was blocked. By cyanogen bromide cleavage at an internal methionine, the sequence of the 25 amino acids (including the methionine at the cleavage site) in the C-terminal part of the molecule was determined. The sequence was Met-Glu-Leu-Leu-Pro-Thr-Ala-Ala-Val-Leu-Tyr-Xaa-Asp-Val-Ala-Gly-Xaa-Phe- Lys-Tyr-Xaa-Ala-Lys-His-His, where Xaa represents unidentified residues. It is likely that the unidentified residues are modified forms of cysteine or amino acids associated with cysteine, since two <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids</b> per lactocin S molecule were found upon performic acid oxidation of lactocin S. The sequence was unique when compared to the SWISS-PROT data bank...|$|R

The core peptides showed a series of multiply charged ions of homo- and heterodimers. Abnormal peptides in the core region could be detected in dimeric form. The sequence of core peptides was determined by product ion spectra of the peptides from oxidized globin digested with trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase. Oxidation of cysteine residues to <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids</b> in the core region resulted in the strong promotion of y-series ions by product ion analysis with a tryptic peptide from apoprotein B- 100 as previously reported by Burlet, Yang, and Gaskell (J.

Deuterium labeling experiments have established that {{loss of the}} elements of H 2 SO 3 occurs with cleavage of one CH bond and transfer of the hydrogen to a neutral fragment. Prominent d-type ions were observed corresponding to cleavage at the <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> residue. The analysis of structural analogs suggested that the unexpectedly low energy requirement for this process is attributable to a charge-proximal process promoted by intra-ionic interaction of the arginine and <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> side chains. CAD (in the collision hexapole of a tandem quadrupole instrument) of electrospray source-formed fragment ions established that the d-type ions can form via b-type ions; {{there was no evidence of}} formation via (an + 1) or (bn — H 2 SO 3) ions.

40|$|AbstractCollision-induced {{dissociation}} (CID) {{was performed}} on multiply deprotonated ions from three commercial peptides: hirudin (54 – 65), fibrinopeptide B, and oxidized insulin chain A. Ions were produced by electrospray ionization in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Each of these peptides contains multiple acidic residues, which makes them very difficult to ionize in the positive mode. However, the peptides deprotonate readily making negative ion studies a viable alternative. The CID spectra indicated that the likely deprotonation sites are acidic residues (aspartic, glutamic, and <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids)</b> and the C-terminus. The spectra are rife with c, y, and internal ions, although some a, b, x, and z ions form. Many of the fragment ions were formed from cleavage adjacent to acidic residues, both N- and C-terminal to the acidic site. In addition, neutral loss (e. g., NH 3, CH 3, H 2 O, and CO 2) was prevalent from both the parent ions and from fragment ions. These neutral eliminations were often indicative of specific amino acid residues. The fragmentation patterns from several charge states of the parent ions, when combined, provide significant primary sequence information. These results suggest that negative mode CID of multiply deprotonated ions provides useful structural information and can be worthwhile for highly acidic peptides that do not form positive ions in abundance...|$|R

40|$|Disulfide bridges play a {{major role}} in {{defining}} the structural properties of peptides and proteins. However, the determination of the cysteine pairing is still challenging. Peptide sequences are usually achieved using MS/MS spectra of the totally reduced unfolded species but the cysteine pairing information is lost. On the other hand, MS/MS experiments performed on native folded species show complex spectra composed of non-classical ions. MS/MS alone does not allow the cysteine pairing nor the full sequence of an unknown peptide to be determined. The major goal of this work is to set up a strategy for the full structural characterization of peptides including disulfide bridges annotation in the sequence. This strategy was developed by combining Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) and Collision Induced Dissociation(CID). It is assumed that the opening of one S-S bridges in a peptide leads to a structural evolution which results in a modification of IMS drift time. In the presence of multiple S-S bridges, the shift in arrival time will depend on which disulfide(s) has (have) been reduced and on the shape adopted by the generated species. Due to specific fragmentations observed for each species, CID experiments performed after the mobility separation could provide not only information on peptide sequence, but also on the localization of the disulfide bridges. To achieve this goal, synthetic peptides containing two disulfides were studied. The openings of the bridges were carried out following different experimental conditions such as reduction, reduction/alkylation or oxidation. Due to disulfide scrambling highlighted with the reduction approaches, oxidation of S-S bonds into <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids</b> appeared to be the best strategy. Cysteines connectivity was then unambiguously determined for the two peptides, without any disulfide scrambling interference. Peer reviewe...|$|R

However, because interest is increasing {{in the use of}} leucine aminopeptidase for the determination of N-terminal sequence of proteins and peptides (1, 2), it is desirable to examine the susceptibility of <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> amide to this enzyme. L-Cysteic acid amide has already been synthesized in d u Vi g n e au d's laboratory by a method which utilizes the following reactions (3) : dicarbo-benzoxycystine~dicarbobenzoxycystinyl chloride~dicarbobenzoxycystinami de~cysteinamide~cystinamide~cysteic acid amide. It should be noted that their procedure was considerably intricate and the yield was very poor and the over-all yield was only 17 per cent based on dicarbobenzoxycystine. It was found that it's better yield was obtained by the present authors with less manipulation through esterification of L-cysteic acid to produce <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> ethyl ester and its amidation to <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> amide; the over-all ·yield has been made up to 76 per cent based on <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> amide thus obtained was used throughout the enzymatic experiment.

40|$|Oxidation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} forms of chemical modification, and the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are susceptible to modification by a wide array of oxidants. Aberrant oxidation reactions are of particular concern in biotechnology and medicine, where they can lead to protein inactivation or destabilization. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that influence a protein's reactivity toward oxidants from both a bioprocessing and a biomedical perspective. This work characterizes oxidation of methionine and cysteine in recombinant human xcl-antitrypsin, a metastable protein that is a member of the serpin family of plasma protease inhibitors. Analytical techniques were developed to identify and quantify oxidation of each of al-antitrypsin's ten methionine residues, as well as its unpaired thiol, Cys 232. It was found that the protein is not susceptible to oxidation during production in the E. coli cytoplasm, but does contain highly-reactive methionine and cysteine residues that are of considerable importance within the context of in vitro oxidation. At neutral pH, five methionines, Metl, Met 226, Met 242, Met 351, and Met 358, are reactive with hydrogen peroxide. With the exception of Metl, each of these residues is located in or near the protein's active site loop. Methionine oxidation studies revealed that the reactivity of these residues is dependent on environmental conditions, such as pH, that readily perturb the protein's metastable structure. (cont.) Cys 232 oxidation studies showed that oxidation of [alpha]l-antitrypsin's unpaired thiol does not lead to the formation of disulfide-linked aggregates, but rather sulfenic, sulfinic, and <b>cysteic</b> <b>acids</b> in successive steps. These species are rapidly formed in vitro as a consequence of Cys 232 's unusually low pKa of 6. 86. Modulation of Cys 232 's ionization and reactivity could not be accomplished via low pH, however, due to acid-induced structural changes that enhance reactivity. In sum, analytical techniques were developed to study methionine and cysteine oxidation in [alpha] 1 -antitrypsin and it was found that elements of protein structure that have evolved for the physiological functioning of plasma protease inhibitors dictate oxidation susceptibility during bioprocessing and long-term storage. In the case of oxl-antitrypsin, and perhaps other proteins with similar structural biochemistries, unpaired-thiol oxidation, and not methionine oxidation, is the major contributor to oxidative degradation in vitro. by Steven Wesley Griffiths.

From SEM and EDX the nanoparticle coating of the Nomex fibers is uniform, continuous, and conformal. The NPN {{was used as a}} filter for aspirated bacteriophage MS 2 viruses using end-on filtration. All measurements were repeated to give statistical reliability. The NPN fabrics show a large decrease as compared to Nomex alone or alumoxane coated Nomex. An increase in the ferroxane content results in an equivalent increase in virus retention. This suggests that it is the ferroxane that has an active role in deactivating and/or binding the virus. Heating the NPN to 160 C results in the loss of <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> functional groups (without loss of the iron nanoparticleﾒs core structure) and the resulting fabric behaves similar to that of untreated Nomex, showing that the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles is vital for the surface collapse of aspirated water droplets and the absorption and immobilization of the MS 2 viruses.

Addition of sodium molybdate inhibited the uptake of [35 S]SO 2 − 4 as well as its incorporation into SQDG by the leaf discs, suggesting that 3 ′-phosphoadenosine- 5 ′-phosphosulfate may be involved in the biosynthesis of SQDG. Addition of unlabeled <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> to the incubation medium enhanced the uptake of [35 S]SO 2 − 4 but did not affect its incorporation into SQDG. 35 S-labeled <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> was {{taken up by the}} leaf discs and metabolized to sulfoacetic acid but not incorporated into SQ or SQDG.

It is concluded that SQDG is not biosynthesized by the proposed sulfoglycolytic pathway in higher plants.

40|$|In the {{quantitative}} analysis of cystine, cysteine and methionine content of foods and feeds, the sulphur containing amino acids are often oxidised by performic acid before hydrolysis of the protein {{to make the}} determination more punctual. The applicability of the performic acid oxidation to the quantification of the enantiomers of sulphur-containing amino acids has been examined. An reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) method was developed for determination {{of the amount of}} <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> and methionine-sulphon enantiomers and the rate of the conversion during oxidation from cystine and cysteine into <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> and from methionine to methionine-sulphon was determined. Racemization of the L-cysteine and Lmethionine was negligible during performic acid oxidation, and therefore the process can be applied before hydrolysis of the protein during quantification of enantiomers of sulphur containing amino acids. The separation between the acidic amino acids (Asp, Glu) and the oxidised from of the sulphur-containing amino acids at the applied gradient system is very good, and the resolution of the peaks were better than 1. 4 in every case...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that rats fed/-cystine as 5 or 10 per cent of the diet develop portal necrosis and hemorrhage of the liver (1 - 4). In addition, more prolonged feeding of /-cystine results in portal cirrhosis of the liver (4). It has been shown that the metabolism of /-cystine (5) and d/-methionine (6) results in the urinary excretion of the greater part of the sulfur contained in these amino acids as sulfate. Schmidt and Clark (7), however, have demonstrated that the sulfur of <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> is not oxidized by the animal organism but is excreted in the neutral sulfur fraction of the urine. If the formation and excretion of large amounts of sulfate resulting from the metabolism of /-cystine were the cause of the liver lesions previously described, then d/-methionine fed in excess amounts should also result in liver damage. <b>Cysteic</b> <b>acid,</b> on the contrary, should not have this effect. The present paper is a report of experiments in which this hypothesis was put to the test. Method...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the title}} reaction was studied spectrophotometrically in HClO 4 medium at 380 nm. The data suggested that the order with respect to cystine is fractional, whereas chromium(VI) follows first order kinetics. The reaction was second order in [H +]. <b>Cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was found to be}} the main product of oxidation. A suitable mechanism was proposed leading to the rate law. The activation parameters were computed using linear least squares method...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGas-phase ion/molecule {{reactions}} and collision-induced dissociation (CID) {{were conducted on}} [M + 4 H] 4 + of insulin chain B. This Fourier transform mass spectrometry work involved ions from the oxidized peptide (with two <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> residues) and its reduced form (with two cysteine residues). Kinetic behavior during deprotonation and hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions indicates that insulin B (ox) ions have two distinct structural types. In contrast, insulin B (red) ions have only one major reacting population, which has a more compact structure than the oxidized ions. No significant differences in fragmentation patterns for the two insulin B (ox) populations were observed when CID was performed {{as a function of}} deprotonating reaction time. However, markedly different fragmentation was found between [M + 4 H] 4 + of insulin B (ox) and (red). Therefore, the presence of <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> groups in insulin B (ox) significantly impacts dissociation and presumably structure. This suggests that some insulin B (ox) ions are zwitterionic, with the five basic sites protonated and one <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> group deprotonated. Molecular dynamics calculations revealed several viable structures that are consistent with the experimental results. For example, the most stable form of the reduced ion, which is unprotonated at the His 10, is very compact and has lost the α-helix of native insulin. Low energy structures for the oxidized ions include a zwitterion with an intraionic interaction between anionic Cyx 7 and cationic His 10, as well as a nonzwitterionic conformer that lacks a proton at Phe 1; both structures retain the α-helix. These structures may account for the two experimentally observed isomers, although others are possible. In addition, experiments on oxidized insulin B were conducted from methanolic solution, which may denature the conformation, and pure aqueous solution, which may leave a native conformation. These differences in solvent composition had no effect on the gas-phase results...|$|E

Determination of plasma concentrations of homocystine and cysteine-homocysteine disulphide, of urine concentration ratios of homocystine: cystine, cysteine-homocysteine disulphide: cystine, and homocysteic acid: <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> allowed a distinction to be made between the two groups.

40|$|Amino acid {{analyses}} of mitochondrial membranes are {{compared with the}} amino acid composition of whole mitochondria (Alberti, 1964) and found to be very similar except in the cystine content. The composition of the endogenous amino acids found in freshly prepared mitochondria has been established and shown to differ considerably from the amino acid composition of membranes or whole mitochondria. The amino acids produced during anaerobic incubation of mitochondria at pH 7. 4, on the other hand, resemble the membrane in composition, supporting the view that neutral proteinase activity is responsible for their appearance. Aerobic incubation produces a similar pattern of amino acids except that amino acids such as proline, serine, asparagine, glutamic acid and glutamine, which can be metabolically utilized under aerobic conditions, are present to a smaller extent. The presence of large relative concentrations of endogenous taurine, <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> and oxidized glutathione and the accumulation of taurine during incubation is found. The selective retention of taurine and <b>cysteic</b> <b>acid</b> within the mitochondria is established. It is proposed that {{the first step in}} the degeneration of isolated mitochondria results from lipid hydroperoxide accumulation caused by the lack of glutathione reductase in isolated mitochondria...|$|E
