The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. <b>Crime</b> <b>Victims</b> Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State <b>Crime</b> <b>Victims</b> Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the National Enquirer from buying one of his letters. Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia—Dear David (2005)—which he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations. Berkowitz stated that he would only drop the lawsuit if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families. In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State <b>Crime</b> <b>Victims</b> Board.|$|E

Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other <b>crime</b> <b>victims,</b> assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E

25|$|Title VI {{amended the}} Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) {{to change how}} the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, {{improving}} the speedy provision of aid to families of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed {{in the line of}} duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money in the Fund and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total in the Fund. A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the Director may make an annual grant from the <b>Crime</b> <b>Victims</b> Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to <b>crime</b> <b>victims</b> in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to victim service organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and non-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism.|$|E

Grahnke also said, [...] "In one hour, 'Bop Gun' says more about firearms, urban tragedies, <b>crime</b> <b>victims</b> and racial politics than any yammering congressman trying to blame television for our violent society." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker complimented the episode, noting, [...] "Don't let Williams distract you from the real stuff here: the brilliantly jagged murder-investigation scenes and the exceptional performances from homicide-detective costars Daniel Baldwin and Melissa Leo." [...] Tribune Company television critic Kate O'Hare praised [...] "Bop Gun" [...] for focusing on characterization and dialogue rather than action, and said of the episode, [...] "With a mix of intense emotion, dogged police work and humorous banter among the detectives, [...] "Bop Gun" [...] typifies the philosophy of Homicide."

Section 621 of the Patriot Act amended the formula for distributions from the Fund. The Director must distribute not less than 90 percent nor more than 110 percent of the amount distributed from the Fund in the previous fiscal year. However, this does not apply if {{the amount of money}} in the Fund is twice what was distributed in the previous financial year — in this case the Director may distribute up to 120 percent of the amount distributed in the previous fiscal year. The Director is also directed to distribute amounts to cover the judicial branch's administrative costs along with amounts to grant programs. Any funds left over from the distribution were to remain in reserve in the Fund for future fiscal years, without a fiscal year limitation. These changes were later rolled back by section 111 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 (H.R. 2500). The Patriot Act also changed the distribution percentages of the remaining amount in the Fund in a particular fiscal year. The percentage given to <b>crime</b> <b>victim</b> compensation programs and for <b>crime</b> <b>victim</b> assistance was lowered from 48.5% to 47.5%, while funds for demonstration projects, program evaluation, compliance efforts, training and technical assistance services to eligible <b>crime</b> <b>victim</b> assistance programs and for the financial support of services to <b>victims</b> of Federal <b>crime</b> by eligible <b>crime</b> <b>victim</b> assistance programs was raised from 3% to 5%.|$|R
