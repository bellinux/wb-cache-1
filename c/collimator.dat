5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the <b>collimator,</b> mostly by the diameter of the <b>collimator</b> lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the <b>collimator</b> light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} <b>collimator,</b> which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the <b>collimator,</b> a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The <b>collimator</b> was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above and {{in front of the}} sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the <b>collimator</b> as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
40|$|Gamma-ray <b>collimators</b> {{in nuclear}} waste {{scanners}} {{are used for}} selecting a narrow vertical segment in activity measurements of waste vessels. The system {{that is used by}} NRG uses tapered slit <b>collimators</b> of both the single and double knife edge type. The properties of these <b>collimators</b> were investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We found that single knife edge <b>collimators</b> are highly preferable for a conservative estimate of the activity of the waste vessels. These <b>collimators</b> show much less dependence on the angle of incidence of the radiation than double knife edge <b>collimators.</b> This conclusion also applies to cylindrical <b>collimators</b> of the single knife edge type, that are generally used in medical imaging spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|Parallel and {{converging}} hole <b>collimators</b> {{are most}} frequently used in nuclear medicine. Less common {{is the use of}} rotating slat <b>collimators</b> for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The higher photon collection efficiency, inherent to the geometry of rotating slat <b>collimators,</b> results in much lower noise in the data. However, plane integrals contain spatial information in only one direction, whereas line integrals provide two-dimensional information. It is not a trivial question whether the initial gain in efficiency will compensate for the lower information content in the plane integrals. Therefore, a comparison of the performance of parallel hole and rotating slat collimation is needed. This study compares SPECT with rotating slat and parallel hole collimation in combination with MLEM reconstruction with accurate system modeling and correction for scatter and attenuation. A contrast-to-noise study revealed an improvement of a factor 2 - 3 for hot lesions and more than a factor of 4 for cold lesion. Furthermore, a clinically relevant case of heart lesion detection is simulated for rotating slat and parallel hole <b>collimators.</b> In this case, rotating slat <b>collimators</b> outperform the traditional parallel hole <b>collimators.</b> We conclude that rotating slat <b>collimators</b> are a valuable alternative for parallel hole <b>collimators...</b>|$|R
5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a <b>collimator</b> before the catcher. This time, {{they were able to}} find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the <b>collimator</b> handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the <b>collimator</b> forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical <b>collimator</b> that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical <b>collimator</b> produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>collimators</b> improve resolution, {{they also}} reduce {{intensity}} by blocking incoming radiation, which is undesirable for remote sensing instruments that require high sensitivity.

40|$|The Next Linear Collider (NLC) {{requires}} a substantial system of beam <b>collimators</b> {{to minimize the}} halo-related backgrounds at the interaction point, provide machine protection against errant pulses, and limit radiation doses throughout the accelerator. In particular, the NLC design contains a com-plete 5 -dimensional (x,x’,y,y’,energy) collimation system at the entrance and exit of the main linac; transverse <b>collimators</b> at the electron and positron sources, at the 250 MeV point in the injector linac, and immediately upstream of the damping rings; a series of <b>collimators</b> at points with substantial z-energy correlation for longitudinal collimation; and a final set of transverse and energy <b>collimators</b> in the final focus, a few hundred meters from the IP. We describe the systems above and estimate {{the intensity of the}} halo at each point, as well as the efficiency with which the halo is removed by the <b>collimators...</b>|$|R
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a <b>collimator</b> (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large unit cells (over 150 Å).|$|E
5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a <b>collimator</b> C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical <b>collimator</b> set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
40|$|In the LHC, high-amplitude {{particles}} are cleaned by ei- ther betatron <b>collimators</b> or momentum <b>collimators.</b> Previously, betatron losses {{have been studied}} more in detail since considered as a possible performance limitation of the machine. Measurements during {{the first years of}} operation show high losses also in the off-momentum cleaning insertion. This causes a significant radiation dose to warm magnets downstream of the <b>collimators.</b> Our work in this paper aims at simulating with SixTrack the off-momentum particles, driven into the momentum <b>collimators</b> by radiation damping outside the RF system acceptance. The re- sults are an important ingredient in assessing the effective- ness of new passive absorbers to protect the warm magnets...|$|R
40|$|Air – coupled planar {{ultrasonic}} transducers with <b>collimators</b> can {{be effectively}} {{used for a}} wide range of distances when air-coupled focussed transducers are being exploited only at the fixed distance. On the other hand use of attached <b>collimators</b> on the planar transducers allows choosing a relatively wide range of spatial resolutions, what is very important for NDT applications. In this paper investigations of influence of <b>collimators</b> having different diameters of apertures on the width of an ultrasonic beam are presented. The investigations were carried out numerically and experimentally. Experimental investigations of dependence of the width of the ultrasonic beam on a diameter of the <b>collimators</b> were carried out.

5|$|Starting in January 1990, four WATCH instruments, {{designed}} by the Danish Space Research Institute, were in operation on the Granat observatory. The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation <b>Collimator.</b> Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% FWHM at 60keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 second per 36 energy channels.|$|E
5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a <b>collimator.</b> It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
25|$|The best current {{camera system}} designs can {{differentiate}} two separate point sources of gamma photons located at 6 to 12mm depending on {{distance from the}} <b>collimator,</b> the type of <b>collimator</b> and radio-nucleide. Spatial resolution decreases rapidly at increasing distances from the camera face. This limits the spatial accuracy of the computer image: it is a fuzzy image made up of many dots of detected but not precisely located scintillation. This is a major limitation for heart muscle imaging systems; the thickest normal heart muscle in the left ventricle is about 1.2cm {{and most of the}} left ventricle muscle is about 0.8cm, always moving and much of it beyond 5cm from the <b>collimator</b> face. To help compensate, better imaging systems limit scintillation counting to a portion of the heart contraction cycle, called gating, however this further limits system sensitivity.|$|E

A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic <b>collimator,</b> which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized.
