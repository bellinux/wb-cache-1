5|$|On August 8, 2009, a {{photograph}} was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing a banner that was {{hanging from a}} ceiling. The banner was made of two Hinomaru flags <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewn</b> together to form {{the shape of the}} DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E
500|$|The Timothy Everest brand {{has three}} levels of tailoring. 'Bespoke' is aimed at young {{professionals}} with the means to purchase bespoke tailoring, but not necessarily the desire to visit Savile Row. Each customer is measured for an individual pattern to be hand-cut, from which their chosen cloth is <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewn</b> by hand. Although still hand made, 'Made-to-measure' garments use existing 'house' patterns, adapted to the customer's measurements. The 'Ready-to-wear' collection is sold in-house, at Everest's Mayfair branch, and in Japan. Emphasising his Savile Row background, Everest said, [...] "We are tailors who design, not designers who discovered tailoring".|$|E

2500|$|GBB Custom Gunleather was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} Mal's gun holster, {{which was made}} out of oak-tanned carving leather. The character's coat, a relic of his time as a Browncoat, was a collaboration between Firefly costume designer Shawna Trpcic and Jonathan A. Logan, a leather artist. Trpcic sketched her idea and a cloth mockup was created before the final was made with domestic-farmed deerskin. The cuffs are actually the sleeves folded back, evoking the style of Oriental robes with their silk linings. Two coats were made for the character, one called [...] "Number 1" [...] coat and another called [...] "The Hero" [...] coat. The Number 1 coat's bullet hole is drawn in, while The Hero version has a detailed <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewn</b> repair. As with the gun, replicas of Malcolm Reynolds' coat have also been made available commercially for fans.|$|E
60|$|In the {{preparation}} of the umbrella, the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sack-making. After some examination they discovered a plank in the floor, in the corner where they were wont to sleep, which was loose and easily forced up with one of Bill's unfinished paper-knives, which he made very strong for this special purpose! Beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella. To have cabbaged at one time all the sail-cloth that was required would have risked discovery; they therefore appropriated small scraps each day, and sewed these neatly together until they had enough. Soon they had a ring of canvas formed, into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly, and this ring was so <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewn</b> in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella, which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter. All round the extremity or margin of the ring, cords of twisted twine were fixed, at intervals of about six inches. There were about sixty of these cords or stays, all of which met and were fastened {{at the end of the}} handle. A stout line, made of four-ply twine, was fastened at the top of the umbrella, and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside, and twisted down the stick to the handle, to which it was firmly secured. By this means the whole machine was, as it were, bound together.|$|E

40|$|Until the mid 80 s each weft {{knitting}} technology (flatbed, straight bar frame and circular) dominated a distinct area of knitwear. Circular knitting {{had the benefit}} of speed, producing continuous lengths of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> jersey (amongst other structures) in a variety of weights and colours, enabling costs to be driven down and fashion led knitwear brands to flourish. The straight bar frames superior knitting quality combined with the ability to produce 2 -D shaped panels was largely associated with traditional fully fashioned classic knitwear, setting the optimum standard in luxury knitted goods. Flatbed or V-bed knitting was considered the most flexible in terms of needle selection, thus, providing more scope for colour and patterning for the fashion markets, but could not compete with the other technologies knitting speeds. Despite the fact that the flatbed machine was capable of shaping it was considered too costly in production terms and was often limited to producing rectangular panels for high fashion applications that were constructed using the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> technique. For a period in history shaped knitwear was limited to classic merchandised produced on traditional machinery using high quality natural fibres, and the fashion market relied on the less expensive <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> knitwear (often manufactured from synthetic materials) for inspiration which had the added benefit of complex combinations of texture, patterning and colour...|$|R

30|$|Often {{described}} as tiered, {{up to four}} tiers excluding the OEMs, tier 1 supplies interior compartments, e.g. seats, engines, floors; tier 2 carries out subassembly activities such as <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> <b>and</b> supply parts such as headliners; tier 3 supplies the manufacturing for the upholstery whilst tier 4 supplies the materials (Shishoo 2008). Tiers 1 and 2 companies may be integrated, and ‘cut and sew’ operations may {{be carried out by}} the same company. Fabric laminators supply their services the <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> operations (Tier 2). The fabric formation companies may also conduct fabric lamination in-house or out-source. There are many permutations; companies may supply yarn directly to the fabric formation company, foam and scrim directly to a fabric lamination company or only yarn to the fabric formation company and the fabric formation company supplies the scrim to the fabric lamination company. Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument panels, headliners, etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed. The independent status of Sage AI is advantageous because it affords flexibility and speed within the system (Taylor 2012).|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesA {{significant}} {{evolution has}} occurred in surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) toward alternate energy sources, lesion sets, and approaches, {{with the intent of}} simplifying the Cox maze III operation and maintaining similar outcomes. Because no large comparative studies with long-term follow-up exist, we have reviewed our experience. MethodsFrom January 1993 to January 2011, 1540 patients underwent surgical ablation for AF. The operations were performed in conjunction with repair of congenital heart disease in 351 (30 %) and adult-acquired disease in 1189 patients (70 %). In the 1189 patients, preoperative AF was paroxysmal in 598 (50 %) and persistent in 591 (50 %). The energy sources included <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> in 521 (44 %), cryothermy in 267 (22 %), radiofrequency in 262 (22 %), and a combination in 139 patients (12 %). The lesion sets included biatrial in 810 (68 %), isolated pulmonary vein isolation in 269 (23 %), and isolated left atrial in 110 (9 %). AF ablation was performed during isolated mitral valve surgery in 516 patients (43 %). ResultsThe median follow-up was 33 months (maximum, 20. 3 years), and late rhythm follow-up was available for 80 %. The <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> Cox maze III procedure was superior at each follow-up interval (P = . 01, P = . 03, and P  5 years (hazard ratio, 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 12 - 0. 42; P  5 years (hazard ratio, 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 08 - 0. 66; P = . 007). ConclusionsThe <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>sew</b> Cox maze III procedure appears to offer significantly greater freedom from AF without antiarrhythmic medications compared with alternate energy sources and lesion sets. Although alternate energy sources offer the advantage of quicker application and the possibility of minimally invasive applications, the Cox maze III operation arguably remains the reference standard for the surgical treatment of AF and should still be considered, especially for patients for whom AF ablation is of critical importance...|$|R
