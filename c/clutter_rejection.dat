40|$|Multistatic ultra-wideband radar is {{acknowledged}} {{to be useful}} for human tracking in indoor surveillance. In this thesis, a global signal processing chain for detection and localization of moving human targets using a multistatic ultra-wideband radar system is proposed. The design options for the system are presented, and the required signal processing steps are summarized. They include critical steps of tracking, target feature extraction,and target association. A decentralized tracking approach is designed for indoor surveillance. The 1 D bistatic tracking rejects clutter and multipath significantly. The 2 D tracker employs the global nearest neighbor based Kalman filter to track targets in Cartesian coordinates. The algorithm performance is {{compared with that of}} the conventional centralized approach on both simulated and experimental data, and shown to improve <b>clutter</b> and multipath <b>rejection.</b> For feature extraction, the advantages of using range-Doppler imaging are analyzed. The hypothesis-testing based and the Keystone transform based range migration compensation approaches are extended to eliminate the Doppler widening effect in range-Doppler processing of ultra-wideband radar. The proposed compensation approaches are applied to both simulated and experimental data. Special attention is then devoted to the critical issue of target association. Two slow-time features, video time density function and self-similarity matrix, are proposed to characterize target responses in different receiving channels. They indicate the slow-time evolution characteristic of the moving human targets, while staying invariant to radar observation angles. Auction algorithm based global nearest neighbor approach is proposed to tackle the measurement-to-measurement association issue. The decentralized tracking approach is experimentally verified on measured data for indoor detection and location of multiple human targets. Finally, as a by-product of human target feature analysis, range-Doppler surface is proposed to demonstrate the overall target information in range-Doppler video sequence. The conclusion emphasizes the main achievements and highlights the novelties. The recommendation for future work is presented finally to point out potential research topics related to this thesis.

40|$|An optimum {{adaptive}} <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> filter for {{use with}} airborne Doppler weather radar is presented. The radar system is being designed to operate at low-altitudes {{for the detection of}} windshear in an airport terminal area where ground clutter returns may mask the weather return. The coefficients of the adaptive <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> filter are obtained using a complex form of a square root normalized recursive least squares lattice estimation algorithm which models the clutter return data as an autoregressive process.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> when {{processing}} down-looking Doppler radar returns {{from a low}} altitude airborne platform is a paramount problem. With radar as a remote sensor for detecting and predicting windshear {{in the vicinity of}} an urban airport, dynamic range requirements can exceed 50 dB because of high clutter to signal ratios. This presentation describes signal processing considerations in the presence of distributed and/or discrete clutter interference. Previous analyses have considered conventional range cell processing of radar returns from a rigidly mounted radar platform using either the Fourier or the pulse-pair method to estimate average windspeed and windspeed variation within a cell. <b>Clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> has been based largely upon analyzing a particular environment {{in the vicinity of the}} radar and employing a variety of techniques to reduce interference effects including notch filtering, Fourier domain line editing, and use of clutter maps. For the airborne environment the clutter characteristics may be somewhat different. Conventional <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> methods may have to be changed and new methods will probably be required to provide useful signal to noise ratios. Various considerations are described. A major thrust has been to evaluate the effect of <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> filtering upon the ability to derive useful information from the post-filter radar data. This analysis software is briefly described. Finally, some ideas for future analysis are considered including the use of adaptive filtering for <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> and the estimation of windspeed spatial gradient directly from radar returns as a means of reducing the effects of clutter on the determination of a windshear hazard...|$|E
40|$|Track {{initiation}} {{in dense}} clutter {{can result in}} severe algorithm runtime performance degradation, particularly when using advanced tracking algorithms such as the Multiple-Frame Assignment (MFA) tracker. This {{is due to the}} exponential {{growth in the number of}} initiation hypotheses to be considered as the initiation window length increases. However, longer track initiation windows produce significantly improved track association. In balancing the need for robust track initiation with real-world runtime constraints, several possible approaches might be considered. This paper discusses basic single and multiple-sensor infrared <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> techniques, and then goes on to discuss integration of those techniques with a full measurement preprocessing stage suitable for use with pixel cluster decomposition and group tracking frameworks. <b>Clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> processing inherently overlaps the track initiation function; in both cases, candidate measurement sequences (arcs) are developed that then undergo some form of batch estimation. In considering <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> at the same time as pixel processing, we note that uncertainty exists in the validity of the measurement (whether or not the measurement is of a clutter point or a true target), in the measurement state (position and intensity), and in the degree of resolution (whether a measurement represents one underlying object, or multiple). An integrated <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> and pixel processing subsystem must take into account all of these processes in generating an accurate sequence of measurement frames, while minimizing the amount of unrejected clutter.

40|$|In IRST applications, {{cluttered}} backgrounds {{are typically}} much more intensive than the equivalent sensor noise {{and intensity of}} the targets to be detected. This necessitates the development of efficient <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> technology for track initialization and reliable target detection. Experimental study shows that the best existing spatial filtering techniques allow for clutter suppression up to 10 dB, while the desired level (for the reliable detection/tracking) is 25 - 30 dB or higher. This level of clutter suppression can be achieved only by implementing spatial-temporal rather than spatial filtering. In addition, the <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection</b> algorithm should be supplemented by a jitter compensation technique. Otherwise, due to the blurring effect, temporal filtering cannot be applied effectively. This paper discusses a novel adaptive spatial-temporal technique for <b>clutter</b> <b>rejection.</b> The algorithm is developed {{on the basis of}} the application of robust and adaptive methods that are invariant to the prior uncertainty with respect to statistical properties of clutter and adaptive with respect to its variability.
