40|$|A novel {{method to}} form ultrathin, uniform Al 2 O 3 layers on {{graphene}} using reversible <b>hydrogen</b> <b>plasma</b> functionalization followed by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) is presented. ALD on pristine graphene {{is known to be}} a challenge due to the absence of dangling bonds, leading to nonuniform film coverage. We show that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>plasma</b> functionalization of graphene leads to uniform ALD of closed Al 2 O 3 films down to 8 nm in thickness. Hall measurements and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>plasma</b> functionalization is reversible upon Al 2 O 3 ALD and subsequent annealing at 400 °C and in this way does not deteriorate the graphene’s charge carrier mobility. This is in contrast with oxygen plasma functionalization, which can lead to a uniform 5 nm thick closed film, but which is not reversible and leads to a reduction of the charge carrier mobility. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the uniform growth on both H 2 and O 2 plasma functionalized graphene to the enhanced adsorption of trimethylaluminum (TMA) on these surfaces. A DFT analysis of the possible reaction pathways for TMA precursor adsorption on hydrogenated graphene predicts a binding mechanism that <b>cleans</b> off the <b>hydrogen</b> functionalities from the surface, which explains the observed reversibility of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>plasma</b> functionalization upon Al 2 O 3 ALD...|$|R
