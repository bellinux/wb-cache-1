30|$|Wear debris related osteolysis is {{recognised}} {{as being}} {{the main cause of}} failure in joint replacements based on UHMWPE inserts. However, many solutions and “new” polyethylenes have been suggested in order to address this issue. This review discusses “historical” issues associated with UHMWPE, such as oxidation, sterilization method and storage, as well as “new” topics, such as crosslinking and stabilization. The final aim is to aid orthopaedic surgeons in their selection of polyethylene inserts and in the information given to the patients. The main problem for the polymer is degradative oxidation, which is caused by the combination of the irradiation used for sterilization and oxygen, and which leads to a decrease in wear resistance and mechanical properties. Irradiation and packaging in the absence of oxygen can only reduce the oxidation, while sterilization with gas (EtO or gas plasma) is the only method that effectively eliminates it. Manufacturing processes are of great relevance to the clinical duration and must be considered by surgeons. Crosslinked polyethylene has been developed <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> inserts due to its superior wear resistance compared to conventional UHMWPE; to prevent the oxidation, crosslinked polyethylene requires post-irradiation thermal treatment, which reduces its mechanical properties and which depends on the producer. Several good clinical results from the use of crosslinked acetabular cups have reported at mid-term, while early results for knee replacements are also encouraging. Recently, the use of the antioxidant vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) has been introduced <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> in order to prevent the oxidation of both crosslinked and noncrosslinked UHMWPE.|$|R

Methods: In this multicenter, randomized prospective study, a total of 380 patients, scheduled to undergo primary (n= 270) or revision (n= 110) total hip (N= 298) or knee (N= 82) joint replacement with a cementless or a hybrid implant, were randomly assigned, in six European orthopedic centers, to receive an implant either with the antibiotic-loaded DAC coating (treatment group) or without coating (control group). Pre- and postoperative assessment of clinical scores, wound healing, laboratory tests, and x-ray exams were performed at fixed time intervals. Results: Overall, 373 patients were available at a mean follow-up of 14. 5 ± 5. 5 months (range 6 to 24).

Bacterial biofilm formation is central in the pathogenesis of infections related to foreign material, and P. acnes {{has been shown to}} form biofilm both in vitro and in vivo. Here, biofilm formation by 93 P. acnes isolates, either from invasive infections (n = 45) or from the skin of healthy people (n = 48), was analysed. The majority of isolates from deep infections produced biofilm in a microtitre model of biofilm formation, whereas the skin isolates were poor biofilm producers (p < 0. 001 for a difference). This indicates a role for biofilm formation in P. acnes virulence. The type distribution, as determined by sequencing of recA, was similar among isolates isolated from skin and from deep infections, demonstrating that P. acnes isolates with different genetic backgrounds have pathogenic potential. The biofilm formed on plastic and on bone cement was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (EM) and by transmission EM. The biofilm was seen as a 10 -mum-thick layer covering the bacteria and was composed of filamentous as well as more amorphous structures. Interestingly, the presence of human plasma in solution or at the plastic surface inhibits biofilm formation, which could explain why P. acnes primarily infect plasma-poor environments of, <b>for</b> example, <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> and cerebrospinal shunts.

Furthermore, periprosthetic joint infections are now the leading cause of failure <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> arthroplasty <b>prostheses.</b> To address both issues, an improved surface design is required: a controlled micro- and nano-roughness can promote osseointegration and limit bacterial adhesion whereas surface porosity allows loading and delivery of antibacterial compounds.

The purposes of the present study were to determine the compressive fatigue properties of a commercially available cement brand used in vertebroplasty, including the effect of frequency on these properties; to identify the cement failure modes under compressive cyclical load; and to introduce a screening method that may be used to shorten the lengthy character of the standardized fatigue tests. Osteopal®V was used as the model cement in this study. The combinations of maximum stress and frequency used were 50. 0, 55. 0, 60. 0, 62. 5 and 75. 5 MPa at 2 Hz; and of 40. 0, 55. 0, 60. 0, 62. 5 or 75. 5 MPa at 10 Hz.

Raman, infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy was principally used. Calcium silicate cements, such as MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate), are hydraulic materials that can set in presence of water: this characteristic makes them suitable for oral surgery and in particular as root-end filling materials. With the aim to improve the properties of commercial MTA cements, several MTA-based experimental formulations have been tested with regard to bioactivity (i. e. apatite forming ability) upon ageing in simulated body fluids. The formation of a bone-like apatite layer may support the integration in bone tissue and represents an essential requirement for osteoconduction and osteoinduction.

Spectroscopic results suggested different wear mechanisms in the three sets of retrievals.

The basic testing configuration consisted of one 8 -mm diameter stainless-steel ball, rotating between two conforming cups with a minimum thickness of 5 mm. For validation of the testing apparatus, two cup materials, in two lubricants, were tested. Both cup materials, UHMWPE and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were tested in deionized water, {{as well as in}} a serum-based solution. For UHMWPE in serum, eight samples were tested, for the other combinations four samples. For UHMWPE, the tests ran for 7 million cycles, for PTFE between 0. 8 and 1. 7 million cycles. For UHMWPE, the wear rate was 0. 006 and 0. 47 (mm(3) / 10 (6) cycles), in water and in serum, respectively. For PTFE, the wear rate was 2. 8 and 47 (mm(3) / 10 (6) cycles), in water and in serum, respectively. For reason that testing in serum simulates the in vivo situation best, it was concluded that the wear rate of the TMJ prosthesis articulation is 0. 47 (mm(3) / 10 (6) cycles), which is considered acceptable.

Post polishing measurement of the radius of the articulating zone showed the radius to be between 18. 98 and 19. 017 mm. Additionally, the peak-to-valley (PV) value of the spherical error map was reduced from 103 to 1. 36 μm and root mean square (RMS) was from 29. 65 to 0. 318 μm. The machined surface roughness obtained through the process was Sa[*]=[*] 16. 1 nm which is well within the recommendation of ISO 7206 - 2 : 2011 standard <b>for</b> metal hip <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis</b> value of 50 nm. The experimental result confirms that bonnet polishing is a potentially viable choice to finish the new design multi-radius femoral heads systems...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of nuclear {{medicine}} developments in orthopaedics beginning in the early 20 th century. Technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) has a short half-life of six hours, emits 140 keV gamma rays and is the most widely used isotope, imaged with the Anger (gamma) camera. Gamma image quality and test sensitivity in painful prosthetic joints can be improved with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SPECT/CT. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) with Sodium Fluoride (18 F-NaF) and 18 Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET have promising and limited roles respectively in the investigation of painful prosthetic joints. New SPECT/CT and PET-CT isotopes targeting activated macrophages with 99 mTc Tilmanocept (Lymphoseek®) and 68 Gallium labelled Tilmanocept respectively show potential as agents to demonstrate wear particles ingested by macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. An imaging algorithm using SPECT and/or PET agents is proffered as a cost effective way of speedily and accurately arriving a diagnosis. Methods: Review of the historical role of nuclear medicine in orthopaedics and research into the potential role of new radiopharmaceutical agents was undertaken. Guidelines and algorithms for the imaging of complicated <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are provided. Results: There is an established role for nuclear medicine in orthopaedics and particularly in the investigation of complicated <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Imaging with Tilmanocept provides new opportunities to shorten the time to diagnose loosened and infected <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Conclusion: There is a potential new role for Tilmanocept, which can be utilised with both PET-CT and SPECT-CT technologies. Tilmanocept is a relatively new radiopharmaceutical which has a potential role in the imaging assessment of painful <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis...</b>|$|R
40|$|Advancements in wear {{analysis}} methods require accurate technology to measure surface wear in <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> These methods offer {{insight into the}} success of implant material and design, and has potential to influence implant longevity. However, established wear {{analysis methods}} are time-intensive and costly. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to develop a 3 D structured-light scanning wear procedure to accurately detect surface deviations and generate 3 D color maps of surface wear for polyethylene liners used in <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> This procedure followed a three step process, where a novel approach was developed to align specimens and measure surface deviations. It was determined that the 3 D structured-light scanner could detect deviations of 20 μm or greater with reasonable error. This procedure was then applied to hip resurfacing polyethylene liners that experienced wear testing. For all liners, the average, central, and peak wear was 19 ± 7 μm, 28 ± 10 μm, and 57 ± 15 μm, respectively. This is the first study to use 3 D structured-light scanning to detect and visualize surface wear on <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Results from this study suggest that 3 D structured-light scanning may be an appropriate alternative to established wear analysis methods with respect to accuracy, time, and cost...|$|R

40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is one of}} the most successful orthopedic surgical procedures for replacing a broken hip joint. In THR, wear may occur at the articulating surface of the acetabular cup and the femoral head. In Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, most of the inhabitants do salat (praying) every day. THR users are banned from doing salat for fear it will damage the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The previous wear calculation methods on the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> use the gravimetric, coordinate measuring machine (CMM), profiler, and geometric method. The disadvantages of the previous methods are that the geometry of the wear patch and the wear volume are only known at the end of the experiment, so they cannot be used to calculate the specific wear rate values in real time. So far, in every modeling of the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses,</b> the values of the specific wear rate are assumed to be constant. This paper reports on the design modification of a pin-on-ring tribometer that is used to measure the wear volumes in hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The result shows that modifications of the femoral head holder, reciprocating motion, elastic joint, and extra displacement transducer is needed to get the specific wear rate value. The calculation method to find the delta volume that is the value of displacement less than the displacement minimum (δmin) is based on a graph, while the calculation method to find the delta volume that is the value of displacement that is more than the displacement minimum (δmin) is based on an equation. In the salat test protocol, the longest test time was during the sujud (prostration) motion, which took 1034. 17 minutes in the experiment...|$|R
