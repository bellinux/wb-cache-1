The E583c converts 3.5G HSPA mobile signal into Wi-Fi coverage, automatically creating Internet access and individual Wi-Fi hotspots for up to five Wi-Fi-enabled digital devices. It can also provide simultaneous Internet access to a sixth device when it is connected to a laptop computer via a USB cable. The E583c weighs 90 grams and features a 1-inch color OLED display that shows information such as network operator details, signal strength, Wi-Fi <b>connection</b> <b>status,</b> and battery level.

50|$|One {{example of}} a common use of these {{concepts}} with email is a mail user agent (MUA) that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. One such MUA is Microsoft Outlook. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it {{will not attempt to}} make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the <b>connection</b> <b>status</b> between the computer on which it is running and the internet. That is, the computer itself may be online‚Äîconnected to Internet via a cable modem or other means‚Äîwhile Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a dial-up connection on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between motivation {{and participation in}} five agricultural research and development innovation platforms (IPs) in Africa‚Äôs Great Lakes Region is examined. We analyze data from surveys and in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. Although farmers prioritized new knowledge and skills, these were not sufficient to consistently foster active participation. Anticipated economic (markets, income, and credit) and material (agricultural inputs) livelihood benefits did encourage active farmer participation. Few actors mentioned social incentives (network <b>connections</b> and <b>status)</b> as motivating factors. Participation of local policy makers and the private business sector was limited. Overall, participation was curtailed by unfulfilled expectations of tangible immediate benefits, limited understanding of the IP concept, lack of resources, and prior commitments...|$|R
