40|$|Employing {{systematic}} {{document analysis}} and other methods, {{this article analyses}} a long-standing and still relevant issue related to the interpretation and application of the law regulating relationships {{in the field of}} European Union criminal justice {{within the framework of the}} national criminal proceedings that are taking place in EU member states. The article places special emphasis on the explanation and application of the principle of mutual recognition within the framework of one of the newest instruments of international cooperation in the European Union criminal proceedings meant to prevent <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and to solve issues arising between two or more member states. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> provided in this paper is not limited to a mere explanation of the concept as such, but includes an essential analysis of other related issues, such as the principle of mutual recognition, its influence on the recognition of criminal proceedings as parallel proceedings, and including other aspects related to the matching of the form of national criminal proceedings with the criminal proceedings taking place in another member state. Finally, significant attention is given to one of the objectives in terms of prevention and solution <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> namely, the ne bis in idem principle and its application in case of parallel criminal proceedings taking place in two or more member states. One of the key conclusions offered here is that in order to eliminate <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> positive law in the process <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must become an effective measure in criminal justice; however, only on the condition that at least a minimum likelihood in the form of criminal proceedings adopted by different EU members states is ensured as a precondition necessary to enable a smooth application of the principle of mutual recognition...|$|R

Moreover, a forum selection rule might not always be sufficient to prevent <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> If there are norms in an RTA that address matters differently from the WTO-covered agreements, an effective remedy under the RTA is especially crucial for those rights to be enforceable.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of international agreements {{has raised the}} challenge of resolving disputes that simultaneously fall under different specialised regimes within international law. The emergence of specialised regimes, {{and the establishment of}} independent judicial institutions to oversee them, has contributed to the ‘fragmentation’ of international law. Furthermore, recent agreements negotiated within a particular specialised regime have included provisions that address subject matters outside of their ‘specialised’ mandate. The potential for jurisdictional conflict is seen in the tension between the international environmental and trade regimes, where environmental agreements have increasingly included trade-related measures that operate outside of the World Trade Organization framework. Agricultural biotechnology provides a pertinent example following the negotiation of the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity to govern the trans-boundary movement of living modified organisms. This thesis explores the potential for overlapping jurisdiction between the specialised regimes of international environmental and trade law, with a particular focus on trade disputes involving agricultural biotechnology. This thesis initially considers the concept of fragmentation of international law and the consequences of the {{proliferation of}} judicial institutions. Next, the historical development of international environmental law and international trade law is explored, which has laid the foundation for potential parallel dispute proceedings before multiple judicial institutions. The thesis then analyses the principles of <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> that may assist to resolve these disputes, and applies them to the case study of trade disputes involving agricultural biotechnology. The thesis concludes by considering the options available for addressing <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between the international trade and international environmental law regimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the syariah courts to hear matters involving wakaf is provided in List II to the 9 th Schedule of the FC and the provisions in the respective states' enactments on the administration of Islamic affair enactments (hereinafter referred to as 'the said provisions'). Alas, this has otherwise been decided and negated by the civil court. Based on the case's decided, even though the jurisdiction to hear wakaf exclusively is under the {{jurisdiction of}} the syariah court, yet the civil court vehemently decided otherwise, viz it is under their domain. This clearly negates the importance of article 121 (1 A) of the FC. This paper intends to study the decided cases involving wakaf since the inclusion of sub clause 1 A to article 121 of the FC, which has bestowed to the syariah courts, exclusive and unfettered jurisdiction and power to adjudicate and determine their own matters as provided the said provisions and to identify the real legal and jurisprudential issues, causes and stumbling blocks which had hitherto barred the syariah courts from having the freedom and ability to decide on wakaf and further to give suggestion and solution in the problem of <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of between these courts, civil and syariah, in matters pertaining to the same.
