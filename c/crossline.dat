5000|$|This species varies {{geographically}} {{and within}} populations.

Near {{the end of the}} forewing cell there are two rectangular pale spots and three pale spots in a row in the subapical area. The underside of the wings vary form light brown to brown to brownish-orange. Sometimes the hindwing will have a crossband like the <b>crossline</b> skipper, but it is usually much more faint.
