25|$|Chronic fatigue {{associated}} with GSE is a systemic disorder, however there are neurological components that are especially manifest in blood deficiencies like avitaminosis, amineralosis and anemia. Reduced iron {{and the lack}} of vitamins folate, B6, B12 and malabsorption of essential fatty acids can cause depression and chronic fatigue. Anti-gliadin antibodies correlate with higher risk for chronic-fatique when no <b>clinical</b> <b>finding</b> of CD is present.|$|E
2500|$|Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) also {{acts as an}} {{inhibitor}} of angiogenesis. The secretion of PEDF is noticeably decreased under hypoxic conditions {{allowing the}} endothelial mitogenic activity of VEGF to dominate, suggesting {{that the loss of}} PEDF plays {{a central role in the}} development of ischemia-driven NV. One interesting <b>clinical</b> <b>finding</b> shows that the levels of PEDF in aqueous humor of human are decreased with increasing age, indicating that the reduction may lead to the development of AMD. In animal model, an AAV with human PEDF cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter [...] prevented choroidal and retinal NV [...] ( [...] 24).|$|E
5000|$|For a {{definite}} diagnosis to be made, a major radiological finding and one major <b>clinical</b> <b>finding</b> must be present.

40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support systems necessitate a disease knowledge base, which comprises {{a set of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>findings</b> for each disease. To efficiently represent the findings, this paper explores the relationship between <b>clinical</b> vocabulary and <b>findings</b> in medical literature through quantitative and qualitative analysis of representative disease databases. Although the data volume and the analyzed features are limited, the observations suggested the following. First, there are sets of <b>clinical</b> <b>findings</b> that are essential for physicians, {{but the majority of}} findings in medical literature are not the essential ones. Second, deviation of term frequency for <b>clinical</b> <b>findings</b> vocabulary is minimal, and <b>clinical</b> <b>findings</b> require appropriate grammar for efficient representation of findings. Third, appropriate mapping of <b>clinical</b> <b>findings</b> with <b>clinical</b> vocabulary would allow the efficient expression of <b>clinical</b> <b>findings.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{sella turcica}} forms a bony caudal border for the {{pituitary}} gland, a pituitary tumor usually extends upward in the rostral direction into the suprasellar region. This {{can result in}} compression of the optic chiasm, which lies {{on top of the}} pituitary, enveloping the pituitary stalk. Compression of the optic chiasm can lead to bitemporal hemianopsia, and, when there is no relevant trauma, this <b>clinical</b> <b>finding</b> is pathognomonic for a pituitary tumor.|$|E
