40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is twofold. Firstly we review the {{knowledge}} on peri-ictal behaviour change and its importance in people with an intellectual disability. Secondly we explore methods of identifying peri-ictal behaviour change in people with an intellectual disability through data from a pilot project. The literature search identified a clear association between seizure activity and behaviour change in people with epilepsy and no intellectual disability; but for people with intellectual disability research is scarce and conflicting. The pilot project provided data on three individuals. This showed behavioural inconsistencies from one month to the next independent of seizure activity. There is a sparsity of research on peri-ictal behaviour <b>change</b> <b>pertaining</b> to individuals <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Further research into this area is needed to clearly ascertain the presence (or not) of an association between epilepsy and behavioural changes in people with intellectual disabilities. Novel methodology specific to people with an intellectual disability should be considered. One such methodology would be an extended period of descriptive analysis in the form of a prospective single case design...|$|R
