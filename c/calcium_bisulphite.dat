50|$|Calcium {{bisulfite}} (<b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite)</b> is an {{inorganic compound}} {{which is the}} salt of a calcium cation and a bisulfite anion. It may be prepared by reacting lime with an excess of sulfurous acid, essentially a mixture of sulfur dioxide and water. It is a weak reducing agent, as is sulfur dioxide, sulfites, and any other compound containing sulfur in the +4 oxidation state. As a food additive it {{is used as a}} preservative under the E number E227. Calcium bisulfite is an acid salt and behaves like an acid in aqueous solution.|$|E
5000|$|The company's history {{goes back}} to 1892 when Emil Hamburger, an industrialist, {{operated}} a paper mill in Lenzing, Austria. In 1938 Zellwolle Lenzing AG was founded, starting pulp and viscose fiber production and in 1962 the company's name was changed to Chemiefaser Lenzing AG. The old <b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> method was used for fiber production until 1963, when the new more eco-friendly magnesium bisulphite method was introduced. In 1975 the company established a department responsible for the environment and introduced a more [...] "green" [...] bleaching process for pulp in 1977. In 1984 the company name changed to Lenzing AG and its shares were listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1986.|$|E
40|$|Wet {{limestone}} scrubbing is {{the most}} common flue gas desulphurization (FGD) process. In this process, oxidation of <b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> plays a major role both by determining the dewatering properties of the obtained sludge and the production of gypsum of high quality. In order to contribute to the simulation of the wet limestone FGD process, in the present paper a comprehensive model for isothermal gas-liquid stirred tank reactors has been used. Based {{on the assumption that the}} reactions are zeroth order with respect to gaseous reactants, the model requires appropriate physico-chemical parameters which are taken from the literature. The model was used to quantitatively interpret some literature experimental data concerning uncatalysed <b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> oxidation performed in a continuous stirred tank reactor. In particular, the model is capable of confidently predicting the transition from chemically to mass transfer controlled regime occurring when changing the operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the action of sulphurous acid on cellulose is important not only from a technical, but also from a purely scientific viewpoint. Thus, {{on the one hand}} {{it is likely that the}} action of small amounts of sulphurous aoid play an important role with respect to the permanence of "paper" (lA), while on the other hand, the behavior of cellulose (in the form of sulphite pulp) towards sulphurous aoid, under varying conditions of temperature, time and concentration are as yet unknown, although such knowledge is of very great importance to the manufacture of sulphite pulp. In the preparation of the latter material, the wood chips are heated with solutions of sulphurous acid, containing <b>calcium</b> and magnesium <b>bisulphites</b> to remove the lignin. Little or no attention has been paid, hitherto, to the changes brought about in the cellulose itself by the sulphurous acid. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{dealt with}} in this thesis concerns the study of certain factors which influence the "solubilization" of lignin in aqueous media. The specific problem to be investigated was the kinetics of the delignification of spruce wood in <b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> solutions, {{and the manner in}} which the reaction rate is affected by temperature, pressure, pretreatment of the wood sample, and by reagents added to the cooking liouor. It was hoped that such an investigation might lead to a better understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the dellgnification of wood by the sulphite process...|$|E
40|$|As an {{introduction}} to this work, it is pertinent to include a short discussion {{of the nature and}} the action of some of the more common acid and neutral cooking liquors on wood. The nature of the action of <b>calcium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> liquor is outlined in particular and a comparison between it and the other cooking liquors is made. The possible advantages to be derived from the use of sodium bisulphite cooking liquor instead of the other industrially used cooking liquors is mentioned. Providing a method of recovery can be developed, the industrial importance of sodium bisulphite cooking liquor is apparent, and therefore work along the nature of this investigation is worthy of consideration both from a scientific and economic viewpoint.
