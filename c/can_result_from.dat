5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> normal use. This {{may be due}} {{to individual}} ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> {{exposure to}} water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting {{any form of}} mercury.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{can suffer}} serious effects from toxic {{chemicals}} in their environments. These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural chemicals in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|Physiotherapy and {{occupational}} therapy are beneficial {{for patients with}} the neurologic form of the disease. The copper chelating treatment may take {{up to six months}} to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> dystonia.|$|E
50|$|Employers {{may also}} reject workers for reasons {{unrelated}} to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> <b>from</b> discrimination.|$|R

5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> a number of {{underlying}} causes. One {{of the most common}} causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It is more common in those with depression.|$|E
5|$|Tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is {{damage to}} the tracheobronchial tree (the airway {{structure}} involving the trachea and bronchi). It <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.|$|E

5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> various growing conditions, for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to}} have stunted growth than a crop growing in more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals {{are at a}} high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Regionally {{developed}} ecotypes can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E
30|$|Because of myometrial distensibility, cornual pregnancies tend {{to present}} {{relatively}} late, at 7 to 12  weeks gestation. Significant maternal haemorrhage leading to hypovolaemia and shock <b>can</b> rapidly <b>result</b> <b>from</b> cornual rupture.|$|R
50|$|Breathing {{difficulties}} <b>can</b> occur, <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> neuromyotonic {{activity of}} the laryngeal muscles. Laryngeal spasm possibly <b>resulting</b> <b>from</b> neuromyotonia has been described previously, and this highlights that, in patients with unexplained laryngospasm, neuromytonia should {{be added to the}} list of differential diagnoses.|$|R
25|$|Food intolerances can {{be caused}} by enzymatic defects in the {{digestive}} system, <b>can</b> also <b>result</b> <b>from</b> pharmacological effects of vasoactive amines present in foods (e.g. Histamine), among other metabolic, pharmacological and digestive abnormalities.|$|R
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> a variety of causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls <b>can</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the fluctuations induced by irrationality in simple {{games with a}} large number of competing players. We show that Nash equilibria in such games are ``weakly'' stable: irrationality propagates and amplifies through players' interactions so that huge fluctuations <b>can</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> a small amount of irrationality. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, our statistical approach allows to establish which is the globally stable equilibrium. However characteristic times to reach this state can be very large.
