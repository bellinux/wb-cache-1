40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the palatal rugae are stable, and if they can be used as stable landmarks in longitudinal <b>cast</b> <b>analysis.</b> In our study we have used earlier investigations as a basis for knowledge and supported those with our own pilot study. Two casts from Oslo Craniofacial Archives were analyzed by optical scanning at the age of 6 - and 12 years. The measurement of the 12 -year casts was used as reference for the 6 -year casts. The 3 -D images of the 6 -year models were each superimposed onto the reference model in the computer. The cast were scanned and analyzed. The rugae morphology seemed to be stable during normal growth and development. In patients who have received radically orthodontic treatment the rugae position can be markedly changed. The most reliable points were found to be the medial- and lateral third rugae points, which could be used as stable landmarks in longitudinal <b>cast</b> <b>analysis.</b> These findings suggest that ruga landmarks can be used as reliably as cephalometric superimposition to assess anteroposterior molar movements...|$|E

40|$|Many {{clinical}} microbiology laboratories {{report on}} cumulative {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} (cAST) data on a regular basis. Criteria for generation of cAST reports, however, are often obscure and inconsistent. Whereas the CLSI has published a guideline for analysis and presentation of cAST data, national guidelines directed at clinical microbiology laboratories are not available in Europe. Thus, we sought to describe the influence of different parameters {{in the process of}} <b>cAST</b> data <b>analysis</b> in the setting of a German routine clinical microbiology laboratory during 2 consecutive years. We developed various program scripts to assess the consequences ensuing from different algorithms for calculation of cumulative antibiograms from the data collected in our clinical microbiology laboratory in 2013 and 2014. One of the most pronounced effects was caused by exclusion of screening cultures for multi-drug resistant organisms which decreased the MRSA rate in some cases to one third. Dependent on the handling of duplicate isolates, i. e. isolates of the same species recovered from successive cultures on the same patient during the time period analyzed, we recorded differences in resistance rates of up to 5 percentage points for S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae and up to 10 percentage points for P. aeruginosa. Stratification by site of care and specimen type, testing of antimicrobials selectively on resistant isolates, change of interpretation rules and analysis at genus level instead of species level resulted in further changes of calculated antimicrobial resistance rates. The choice of parameters for <b>cAST</b> data <b>analysis</b> may have a substantial influence on calculated antimicrobial resistance rates. Consequently, comparability of cAST reports from different clinical microbiology laboratories may be limited. We suggest that laboratories communicate the strategy used for <b>cAST</b> data <b>analysis</b> as long as national guidelines for standardized <b>cAST</b> data <b>analysis</b> and reporting do not exist in Europe...|$|R

40|$|In today's environment, medical {{technology}} is rapidly advancing to deliver tremendous value to physicians, nurses, and medical staff {{in order to}} support them to ultimately serve a common goal: provide safe and effective medical care for patients. However, these complex medical systems are contributing to the increasing number of healthcare accidents each year. These accidents present unnecessary risk and injury to the very population these systems are designed to help. Thus the current safety engineering techniques that are widely practiced by the healthcare industry during medical system development are inadequate in preventing these tragic accidents. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a new approach to design safety into medical systems. This thesis demonstrated that a holistic approach to safety design using the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) and Causal Analysis based on STAMP (CAST) was more effective than the traditional, linear chain-of-events model of Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The CAST technique was applied to a medical case accident involving a complex diagnostic analyzer system. The results of the <b>CAST</b> <b>analysis</b> were then compared to the original FMECA hazards. By treating safety as a control problem, the <b>CAST</b> <b>analysis</b> was capable of identifying an array of hazards beyond what was detected by the current regulatory approved technique. From these hazards, new safety design requirements and recommendations were generated for the case system that could have prevented the case accident. These safety design requirements can also be utilized in new medical diagnostic system development efforts to prevent future medical accidents, and protect the patient from unnecessary harm. by Vincent H.

We identified a putative cis-acting sequence, TGATTG as Lhx 8 DNA binding element (LBE). In addition, Lhx 8 binds to the LBE with high affinity and augments transcriptional activity of luciferase reporter driven by artificial promoter containing the Lhx 8 binding element. These findings indicate that Lhx 8 directly regulates the transcription of genes containing Lhx 8 binding element in oocytes during early folliculogenesis...|$|E

40|$|In vivo imaging {{technologies}} are presently receiving considerable {{attention in the}} biomedical and pharmaceutical research areas. One of the principal imaging modalities is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The multiparametric nature of MRI enables anatomical, functional and even molecular information to be obtained non-invasively from intact organisms at high spatial resolution. Here we describe the use of one MRI modality, namely angiography (MRA), to non-invasively study the arterial vascular architecture of APP 23 transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease. Because the spatial resolution of the technique is limited, the in vivo studies are complemented by a powerful analysis of the vasculature using vascular corrosion casting. Both techniques revealed age-dependent blood flow alterations and cerebrovascular abnormalities in these mice.

40|$|Identification {{and size}} {{characterization}} of surface pockets and occluded cavities are initial steps in protein structure-based ligand design. A new program, CAST, for automatically locating and measuring protein pockets and cavities, {{is based on}} precise computational geometry methods, including alpha shape and discrete flow theory. CAST identifies and measures pockets and pocket mouth openings, as well as cavities. The program specifies the atoms lining pockets, pocket openings, and buried cavities; the volume and area of pockets and cavities; and the area and circumference of mouth openings. <b>CAST</b> <b>analysis</b> of over 100 proteins has been carried out; proteins examined include a set of 51 monomeric enzyme-ligand structures, several elastase-inhibitor complexes, the FK 506 binding protein, 30 HIV- 1 protease-inhibitor complexes, {{and a number of}} small and large protein inhibitors. Medium-sized globular proteins typically have 10 - 20 pockets/cavities. Most often, binding sites are pockets with 1 - 2 mouth openings; much less frequently they are cavities. Ligand binding pockets vary widely in size, most within the range 10 (2) - 10 (3) A 3. Statistical analysis reveals that the number of pockets and cavities is correlated with protein size, but there is no correlation between the size of the protein and the size of binding sites. Most frequently, the largest pocket/cavity is the active site, but {{there are a number of}} instructive exceptions. Ligand volume and binding site volume are somewhat correlated when binding site volume is < or = 700 A 3, but the ligand seldom occupies the entire site. Auxiliary pockets near the active site have been suggested as additional binding surface for designed ligands (Mattos C et al., 1994, Nat Struct Biol 1 : 55 - 58). Analysis of elastase-inhibitor complexes suggests that CAST can identify ancillary pockets suitable for recruitment in ligand design strategies. Analysis of the FK 506 binding protein, and of compounds developed in SAR by NMR (Shuker SB et al., 1996, Science 274 : 1531 - 1534), indicates that CAST pocket computation may provide a priori identification of target proteins for linked-fragment design. <b>CAST</b> <b>analysis</b> of 30 HIV- 1 protease-inhibitor complexes shows that the flexible active site pocket can vary over a range of 853 - 1, 566 A 3, and that there are two pockets near or adjoining the active site that may be recruited for ligand design...|$|E
