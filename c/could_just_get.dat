She's a young SHO who loves {{her job and}} is fun to be around." [...] Expanding, it was added that: [...] "Maddy's young, fun and up for a laugh while, at the same time, dedicated to her job. She's definitely {{not going to be}} single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> in the way..." [...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's says things I wouldn't. But when she cries, I cry and when she smiles, I smile".|$|E
2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E

When informed his request was impossible, the young man had replied: [...] "You mean you can't fix her up enough so I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> one picture of her?" [...] Sternly informed a second time he {{would not be allowed to}} view the body, the young man had wordlessly exited the funeral home.|$|E

Really, I can see no ground why a parson should be raised above his parishioners. The new-order churches consult the public convenience, and place every body on a level, as it might be. Now, in old times, a family was buried in its pew; it could neither see nor be seen; and I can {{remember}} the time when I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> a look of our clergyman's wig, for he was an old-school man; and as for his fellow-creatures, one might as well be praying in his own closet.

60|$|We {{were still}} so young {{as to be}} very much absorbed in the love affairs of other people; I believe women always remain young enough for that; and Mrs. March talked about the one we fancied we had {{witnessed}} the beginning of pretty much the whole evening. The next morning we got letters from Boston, telling us how the children were and all that they were doing and saying. We had stood it very well, as long as we did not hear anything about them, and we had lent ourselves in a sort of semi-forgetfulness of them to the associations of the past when they were not; but now to learn that they were hearty and happy, and that they sent love and kisses, was too much. With one mind we renounced the notion of going on to Quebec; we found that we <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> the ten-o'clock train that would reach Boston by eleven that night, and we made all haste and got it. We had not been really at peace, we perceived, till that moment since we had bidden the children good-bye.|$|E
60|$|The boys couldn't {{say enough}} about it, {{they were so}} charmed and astonished. The thing that pleased them the most {{was the way it}} would do the Paladin's {{business}} for him. They forgot everything in their anxiety to get him shelved and silenced. Noel Rainguesson was clear beside himself with admiration of the poem, and wished he could do such a thing, but it was out of his line, and he couldn't, of course. He had it by heart in half an hour, and there was never anything so pathetic and beautiful as the way he recited it. For that was just his giftthat and mimicry. He could recite anything better than anybody in the world, and he could take of La Hire to the very lifeor anybody else, for that matter. Now I never could recite worth a farthing; and when I tried with this poem the boys wouldn't let me finish; they would have nobody but Noel. So then, as I wanted the poem to make the best possible impression on Catherine and the company, I told Noel he might do the reciting. Never was anybody so delighted. He could hardly believe that I was in earnest, but I was. I said that to have them know that I was the author of it would be enough for me. The boys were full of exultation, and Noel said if he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> one chance at those people it would be all he would ask; he would make them realize that there was something higher and finer than war-lies to be had here.|$|E

The critical consensus reads, [...] "Penultimate episode [...] "Continuum" [...] forces wrap-ups {{of too many}} open-ended arcs, though it still manages to entertain by throwing more wrenches into the mix." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club thought the episode [...] "embraced all that's wondrous and all that's awful about this season of American Horror Story, occasionally within the same scene or line of dialogue." [...] He added, [...] "This is a horribly messy piece of work that somehow gets {{to the heart of}} madness, and it's occasionally a starkly beautiful piece about survivor's guilt." [...] About the episode, Matt Fowler of IGN stated, [...] "Not that anything was overtly awful, but the pacing was such that you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> never <b>get</b> a hold on what was going on." [...] He added, [...] "I also don't want to fully penalize a show for pulling out all the stops and taking me on a completely unexpected journey." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{have never}} seen anyone with a throw-in like Delap's and I believe his {{missiles}} have created seven out of Stoke's 13 league goals this season.

My team-mate Perry Groves could throw it a long way {{and we have seen}} the likes of Dave Challinor and Andy Leggdo it - but nothing like Delap.

50|$|India was {{a fascination}} for Fred, {{and he had}} a keen {{interest}} in its history, people, religions, scenery and native languages.

Fred loved the people and culture of India, and was actively involved in photography of Indian landscapes, buildings, common Indians, etc. Some of his pictures depict day-to-day life in British India, such as men working the land, women winnowing grains, wild haired fakirs, a child chained to a stone, mother bathing infants, goat about to be slaughtered, etc. It was as though he <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> <b>get</b> enough of India. Fred also authored articles and academic papers on South Indian History, Indian Religions (especially Shaivism) and Tamil Literature which were published in Journals.
