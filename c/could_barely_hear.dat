500|$|Jack Nicholson, {{recounting the}} {{reaction}} to a screening of the film, states that the audience [...] "laughed so hard I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the dialogue. I didn't quite register it right. It was as if I had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|E
500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
60|$|His face darkened with {{a sudden}} dread. His head fell on his breast. His voice sank so low that she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{set down}} again, a-shaking all over, {{and got out}} my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees --something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> a [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] down there. That was good! Says I, [...] "me-yow! me-yow!" [...] as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and {{scrambled}} {{out of the window}} on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.|$|R
5000|$|His {{last two}} birthdays were media {{events in the}} town of Isabela. Civic leaders and {{veterans}} commended Mercado on his endurance and lucid mind, but the [...] "gift" [...] he would enjoy the most was the visit of Puerto Rican vedette and media icon Iris Chacón. In an interview, Mercado claimed to be a great fan of the artist, and particularly of her derrière ("That rump was something serious!", he was quoted as saying). Chacón visited Mercado, who, although he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> see or <b>hear</b> by the time of his 114th birthday, was pleased with her visit. His photo touching Chacón's rear end, with a big smile on his face, made newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico. She returned the following year to greet him. After hearing news of Mercado's death, Chacón was quoted as saying: [...] "I feel like I've lost my own grandfather. I was blessed for knowing him, knowing that I made him happy, and blessed for the anecdotes and wishes he told me the times I met him. His wisdom is something I learned a lot from. His life {{is an example of how}} you're supposed to live your life, happily and doing good, for it will give you longevity and goodwill from everyone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Simon: [...] "Begging your pardon, {{but would}} you two please repeat that exchange? I can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> it over the clamor of mysterious subtext." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} from him, {{and looked into the}} fire. Her firm full tones sank so low, when she spoke next, that he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> them.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{considerable}} pause on the girl's part before she answered, {{and then her}} reply {{was in such a}} low voice that Barney <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was afraid}} to open it in my presence. He got on his feet; he said, in tones so low that I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> him: [...] "Please excuse me for a minute"--and left the room.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} episode of the show, the Cone of Silence is lowered. Once it's in place, Max and the Chief can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> each other. The {{frustrated}} Chief then asks Hodgkins (a CONTROL scientist) to raise it, but Hodgkins can't hear him either.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> utter the words, {{and again}} became insensible from loss of blood.|$|R
50|$|In one episode, {{when the}} Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the Closet of Silence. In the Closet, {{there are so}} many coats and jackets, they can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the lock off, {{injuring}} Larabee in the process.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you please}} say," [...] she went on, [...] "that I am {{only to be}} taken on trial, at first? I am not to be engaged for more"--her voice sunk lower and lower, so that I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the next words--"for more than three months, certain." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{abruptly}} {{left the}} table, {{and went to}} the window. When her back was turned to Rufus, she spoke. [...] "Am I a disgrace to him?" [...] she asked, in tones so faint that he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> them. [...] "I have had my fears of it, before now." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the words: {{even his}} {{strength}} to whisper {{seemed to be}} fast leaving him. He kissed his son--with a panting fatigue under that trifling exertion, pitiable to see. As I placed the boy on his feet again, {{he looked up at}} his dying father, with the one idea still in his mind.|$|E

5000|$|... {{fell from}} {{a height of}} three floors, hit his head on a stone and <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> stand afterwards, ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 he {{recorded}} {{a version of}} Hammerfall's [...] "The Fire Burns Forever", notable for his mic being down so low you can <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> him. Live videos of the event show him drowning out singer Joacim Can's during the first verse of the song before he microphone was turned down for the remainder.|$|R
60|$|Something {{was wrong}} in my call; the birds were suspicious, knowing not what danger had kept their fellows silent so long, and now {{threatened}} {{them out of the}} black alders. A moment's intent listening; then the leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously, halting, hiding, listening, gliding, swinging far out to one side and back again in stealthy advance, till he drew himself up abruptly at sight of my face peering out of the underbrush. For a long two minutes he never stirred so much as an eyelid. Then he glided swiftly back, with a faint, puzzled, questioning kwit-kwit? to where his flock were waiting. A low signal that I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear,</b> a swift movement--then the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent, friendly woods.|$|E
6000|$|Speaking these words, {{always with}} the same calmness which had marked his manner from the first, he looked fixedly {{at her for a}} little while, sighed again, and turned away. Just before he {{disappeared}} among the trees, he said [...] "Farewell," [...] but so softly that she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> it. Some strange confusion clouded her mind as she lost sight of him. Had she injured him, or had he injured her? His words bewildered and oppressed her simple heart. Vague doubts and fears, and a sudden antipathy to remaining any longer near the summer-house, overcame her. She started to her feet, and, keeping the dog still at her side, hurried from the garden to the highroad. There, the wide glow of sunshine, the sight of the city lying before her, changed the current of her thoughts, and directed them all to Fabio and to the future.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took her}} hand. The clammy coldness of his grasp startled her. [...] "Do you still wonder why I {{followed}} you?" [...] he asked. The words were so faintly uttered that she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> them. Heavy drops of perspiration stood on his forehead; his face faded to a gray and ghastly whiteness--he staggered, and {{tried desperately to}} catch at the branch of a tree near them. She threw her arms round him. With all her little strength she tried to hold him up. Her utmost effort only availed to drag him to the grass plot by their side, and to soften his fall. Even as the cry for help passed her lips, she saw help coming. A tall man was approaching her--not running, even when he saw what had happened; only stalking with long strides. He was followed {{by one of the}} keepers of the gardens. Doctor Benjulia had his sick monkey to take care of. He kept the creature sheltered under his long frock-coat.|$|E

50|$|One of her {{favorite}} memories was interviewing Styx for a concert in 1982. She was starstruck and <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> talk.|$|R

60|$|Our night, {{as often}} happens in the Tropics, was not {{altogether}} undisturbed; for, shortly after I had become unconscious of the chorus of toads and cicadas, my hammock came down by the head. Then I was woke by a sudden bark close outside, exactly {{like that of a}} clicketting fox; but as the dogs did not reply or give chase, I presumed it to be the cry of a bird, possibly a little owl. Next there rushed down the mountain a storm of wind and rain, which made the coco-leaves flap and creak, and rattle against the gable of the house; and set every door and window banging, till they were caught and brought to reason. And between the howls of the wind I became aware of a strange noise from seaward--a booming, or rather humming most like that which a locomotive sometimes makes when blowing off steam. It was faint and distant, but deep and strong enough to set one guessing its cause. The sea beating into caves seemed, at first, the simplest answer. But the water was so still on our side of the island, that I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> the lap of the ripple on the shingle twenty yards off; and the nearest surf was a mile or two away, over a mountain a thousand feet high. So puzzling vainly, I fell asleep, to awake, in the gray dawn, to the prettiest idyllic picture, through the half-open door, of two kids dancing on a stone {{at the foot of a}} coconut tree, with a background of sea and dark rocks.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the nineties he was already completely blind and walking with difficulty (as a result of an accident he had in Rio de Janeiro in 1973). He <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> as well, but still had his incredible power of memory and his sharp thinking.|$|E

6000|$|... "Doth he say so, the mincing, hypocritical miser?" [...] vociferated Lambourne. [...] "Why, then, {{he shall}} {{come down and}} receive my {{commands}} here, this blessed night, under my uncle's roof! And I will ring him such a black sanctus, that he shall think the devil hath him by the skirts for a month to come, for <b>barely</b> <b>hearing</b> me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{broadcast}} had technical issues, as the commentators <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> be heard, consistently being {{drowned out}} by the crowd and ring noise.|$|R

50|$|During shooting, Williams {{broke her}} left eardrum, {{which had already}} been broken in five other films. She was fitted with a {{prosthesis}} from latex that covered her nose and ears that prevented water from rushing in. As a result, she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear,</b> taste or smell while wearing it, and her diving had to be limited. Stunt woman Ginger Stanley was Williams' body double {{in some of the}} underwater scenes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, the Bears broke through, {{reaching}} the conference title game before {{losing to the}} San Francisco 49ers. McMahon started the season strongly, though nursing minor injuries like those that would plague him throughout his career. In a violent game against the Los Angeles Raiders in Chicago, McMahon sustained a season-ending injury when he was brutally tackled by two Los Angeles defenders. He suffered bruised ribs and a lacerated kidney on the play, but limped to the huddle and breathlessly called the next play, despite difficulty breathing and increasing pain. The players <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>hear</b> him in the huddle, and when McMahon attempted an audible {{at the line of}} scrimmage the Bears receivers were unable to hear his call. McMahon {{was on the verge of}} collapsing on the field, clutching his flank and rasping in his attempts to convey his situation. Offensive linemen helped McMahon stand and leave the field. McMahon went to the locker room, and reported urine that [...] "looked like grape juice." ...|$|E
