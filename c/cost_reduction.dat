5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over <b>cost</b> <b>reduction,</b> Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E

This paper {{focuses on a}} two-sided platform tied with quality-improving hardware devices that are introduced sequentially. We analyze a monopolist’s dynamic pricing strategies facing de-creasing future production cost and strategic buyers. Findings in both the traditional (buyer-side only) and two-sided business models show that future <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> raise the optimal price of the present product, which shifts the buyer-side demand forward and mitigates intertemporal cannibalization. Furthermore, future <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> may also lead to a higher optimal price for the future product, given a substantial quality improvement. Thus, the monopolist may leverage future <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> to position its product line to the high-end market. By comparing the traditional and two-sided business models, {{we find that the}} impact of future <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> is more pronounced for a two-sided platform...|$|R

25|$|Another {{major method}} of <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> was to utilize {{secondary}} airports, which are generally less congested and charge less to lease space {{though they may}} be farther from the advertised destination. To save even more money at the airport, passengers boarded directly from the apron instead of using the jetway, saving both loading/unloading time as well as operating costs. Finally, ticket sales were entirely online. This not only saved on employee costs, but completely eliminated the need for a reservations call center.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} also known as {{precision}} forging. It was developed to minimize cost and waste associated with post-forging operations. Therefore, the final product from a precision forging needs little or no final machining. Cost savings are gained from the use of less material, and thus less scrap, the overall decrease in energy used, and the reduction or elimination of machining. Precision forging also requires less of a draft, 1° to 0°. The downside of this process is its cost, therefore it is only implemented if significant <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> can be achieved.|$|E

Boeing states that the 747-8 is more than 10 percent lighter per seat and is to consume 11 percent less fuel per passenger than the A380, translating into a trip-cost reduction of 21 percent and a seat-mile <b>cost</b> <b>reduction</b> of over 6 percent.|$|E

In particular, we investigate the implications of railway passengers' anticipating departure behavior when train services were unreliable.

The possible bias incurred by ignoring the reliability and schedule delay <b>costs</b> <b>reductions</b> in the traditional CBA can be quite substantial. Given our assumptions and parameterization, the underestimation of ignoring these costs could range from 33 to 75 % of total generalized user <b>cost</b> <b>reductions.</b> © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>reduction</b> was {{the reason}} for many revisions. Reducing {{manufacturing}} costs was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the price war and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original (NMOS based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and PLA chips. Initially, {{a large portion of the}} cost was eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as diodes and resistors, which enabled the use of a smaller printed circuit board. There were 16 total C64 motherboard revisions, most of them aimed at simplifying and reducing manufacturing costs. Some board revisions were exclusive to PAL regions. All C64 motherboards were manufactured in Hong Kong.|$|E
