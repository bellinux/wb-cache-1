40|$|Narrowband beam {{position}} monitor electronics {{were developed}} in the Forschungszentrum Jlich-IKP for the orbit measurement equipment used at ELSA Bonn. The equipment uses 32 monitor chambers, each with four <b>capacitive</b> <b>button</b> electrodes. The monitor electronics, consisting of an rf signal processing module (BPM-RF) and a data acquisition and control module (BPM-DAQ), sequentially process and measure the monitor signals and deliver calculated horizontal and vertical beam position data via a serial network. INTRODUCTION The beam position monitor system at ELSA Bonn (1) consists of 32 monitor chambers, each having four <b>capacitive</b> <b>button</b> electrodes. For position measurements, the narrowband signal chain tuned to the fundamental harmonic of the bunch frequency is used. The position data are proportional to the quotient of the difference and sum signals and to a coefficient depending on the monitor geometry (K x, K y). The electronics described in this paper uses the sequential proce [...] ...|$|E
40|$|To {{measure the}} beam {{position}} {{at the entrance of}} the FLASH dump a position monitor has been installed outside of the vacuum in a nitrogen atmosphere. When a charged particle travels through the gas it ionizes the atoms. Therefore the signal from a <b>capacitive</b> <b>button</b> BPM would be contaminated by high backgrounds. To avoid this a magnetic coupled monitor has been designed. The monitor consists of four longitudinal loops symmetrically arranged in the pipe wall. An analytical expression of the signal for this monitor is derived and compared with simulations. Measured data are compared with predictions...|$|E

40|$|At the LEP e+/e- {{collider}} at CERN, Geneva, a Spectrometer is used {{to determine}} the beam energy with a relative accuracy of 10 - 4. The Spectrometer measures the change in bending angle in a well-characterised dipole magnet as LEP is ramped. The beam trajectory is obtained using three beam position monitors (BPMs) {{on each side of the}} magnet. The error on each BPM measurement should not exceed 1 micron if the desired accuracy on the bending angle is to be reached. The BPMs used consist of an aluminium block with an elliptical aperture and four <b>capacitive</b> <b>button</b> pickup electrodes. The button signals are fed to customised electronics supplied by Bergoz. The electronics use time multiplexing of individual button signals through a single processing chain to optimise for long-term stability. We report on our experience of the performance of these electronics, describing measurements made with test signals and with beam. We have implemented a beam-based calibration procedure and have monitored the reproducibility of the measurements obtained over time. Measurements show that a relative accuracy better than 300 nm is achievable over a period of 1 hr...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of two portable devices intended for the recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in emergency situations. The topic originated from the EEG in Emergency Medicine (EEGEM) project, which seeks to develop the necessary technology and methodology that will help reduce the cost, the preparation time, and the overall complexity associated with EEG nowadays. The work contained herein builds upon the results obtained during previous Master theses that were completed in this project {{in order to obtain}} two systems {{that can be used in}} to investigate the feasibility and clinical value of EEG in emergency medicine (EM). Before starting the work, a thorough investigation of the EEG signal, which included its origins and its diagnostic potential, was carried out. Existing instrumentation was analyzed as well as factors that influence the quality of the recording. Since the EEG is an established diagnostic tool, it was necessary to follow existing recording guidelines. The recording guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) were summarized and employed in the design stages of this study. A review of commercial EEG recorders and quick application EEG caps revealed the absence of an integrated solution for recording this signal in EM. Two systems were developed, one that is able to measure 1 channel of EEG while the other can measure six. The 1 -channel system's particularity is that it allows a person's EEG to be displayed on a standard electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. It features a high input impedance, low noise amplifier that increases the EEG signal's amplitude in order to allow it to be displayed on an ECG monitor. The amount of amplification is dynamically adjusted depending on the peak-to-peak amplitude of the EEG signal. After every gain change, the EEG recording is temporarily interrupted and a sinusoidal signal with an amplitude equivalent to 100 μV at the current gain level is outputted. The user interface is made up of a red, green and blue (RGB) light-emitting diode (LED) unit and a <b>capacitive</b> <b>button</b> that starts/stops the recording. The 6 -channel system interfaces with a computer and consists of three parts: a wire-less EEG (WEEG) recording device, a quick-application cap, and recording software that runs on a computer. The WEEG device is able to measure 6 channels of EEG and tri-axial acceleration for the identification of movement artifacts. The recorded data is transmitted to a measurement computer by means of a 2. 4 GHz wireless protocol. The author worked with the group from the Department of Automation Science and Engineering (ASE) that developed the previous versions of the device in order to reduce the size of the system and to improve its integration with the measurement computer. An initial prototype of a quick-application electrode cap for out-of-hospital measurements that can be performed by non-EEG specialists was designed by M. Sc. Salmi. It was made up of easily sterilizeable materials that were also elastic. Due to its many straps and adjustment points as well as the floating electrode leads, the band was not easy to apply. This study reports a simplified version of the cap that possesses only two attachment points and can be easily applied even with the patient in the supine position. Also, in the present version, the electrode leads are firmly attached to the cap. The past version of the recording software, which was developed by M. Sc. Pänkälä, had only basic functionality. It displayed the EEG signals, stored them, and allowed the WEEG device to be configured and patient information to be saved. Digital low-pass filtering of the displayed data, the ability to control the vertical sensitivity as well as the time scale, automatic uploading of the recorded file, and an implementation of the aEEG algorithm were added during this thesis. Also, information about the recording can now be stored together with the recorded signals. Furthermore, the software's us-ability was improved by means of a simple graphical user interface (GUI), which makes all functions easily accessible. During the evaluation of the two prototype systems, the electrical and software performance were ascertained. In the electrical tests, the operating time of the device, the common mode rejection (CMR), the frequency response, the noise level, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the two systems were measured. In order to assess the reliability of the software of the two systems, both static and functional tests were conducted. The results obtained from the testing of the systems indicate that they offer similar performance to those offered by commercial EEG recording systems. This demonstrates that they can be used to investigate the clinical indications of EEG in EM. /Kir 1...|$|E

The TE Wave measurement method utilizes <b>capacitive</b> <b>buttons</b> (BPMs) in the ring to excite and detect a propagating electromagnetic wave corresponding to the beampipe's fundamental TE mode. The presence of low-energy electrons along the wave path changes its propagation characteristics, which can be detected by analyzing the received signal. By choosing the machine fill pattern (gaps and bunch trains length) it is possible to modulate the density of the electron cloud and derive information on its rise and fall times by observing the detected signal spectrum. The possibility of circulating both electron and positron beams in the ring enabled us to separate the contribution of primary photoelectrons, which are independent on the circulating particle nature, from the transverse resonant mechanism, which can increase the primary electron density many times over and which only takes place with a circulating positron beam...|$|R
