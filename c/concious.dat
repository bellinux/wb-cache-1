They {{had no money}} to pay for it with, except--except that dreadful cheque. For four days it had lain, burning a hole in Ernest's heart from its drawer by the window, and he had not dared to change it. Now he rose without saying a word, and opened the drawer in a solemn, hesitating fashion. He looked once more at Edie inquiringly; Edie nodded a faint approval. Ernest, pale as death, put on his hat, and went out totteringly with the doctor. He stopped on the way to change the cheque at the baker's where they usually dealt, and then went on to the goat's milk shop. How that {{sovereign}} he flung upon the counter seemed to ring the knell of his seif-respect! The man who changed it noticed the strangeness of Ernest's look, and knew at once he had not come by the money honestly. He rang it twice {{to make sure it was}} good, and then gave the change to Ernest. But Dot, at least, was saved; that was a great thing. The milk arrived duly every morning for some weeks, and, after a severe struggle, Dot grew gradually better. While the danger lasted, neither of them dared think much of the cheque; but when Dot had got quite well again, Ernest was <b>concious</b> of a certain unwonted awkwardness of manner in talking to Edie. He knew perfectly well what it meant; they were both accomplices in crime together.|$|E

Introduction: It is not {{the purpose}} here to discuss the {{relation}} of the <b>concious</b> and subconcious minds, but rather the moral effects of suggestions given with the intention of making a change in the thought channels, and also unconcious suggestions. It {{is becoming more and more}} an acknowledged fact that the human life is molded, not by environment in the old sense, but by such suggestions as are offered in the surroundings. These unconscious suggestions are constantly being pushed upon the mind, from baby-hood days to the grave. The babe is laying up memories in its subconcious mind that we know nothing of, and that may or may not be given to others, or even realized by the <b>concious</b> mind, still these all have their effect upon forming character. The youth during his college days, gains knowledge not only from books and instructors, but he is receiving impressions on his subjective mind that can never be erased. Acts, words and sometimes it seems almost the thoughts of those around him are written indelibly upon this mysterious mind. Parents and teachers do not realize the influence of suggestions given to the subconcious minds of children upon their future actions and character or there would be a reform in the manner of training children in the home and school. The subjective mind of the child has not been trained to accept or reject what may be presented to it, and so is very susceptible to training by suggestions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In model based design model {{fragments}} {{are used}} in everyday work. Concurrent operations on separate parts of a model and communication between stakeholders are some examples. However, the use of model fragments is not always <b>concious,</b> partly because it is typically {{not covered by the}} design process. The concept of model fragment is practically undefined, which leads to adopting loose, ad hoc definitions. Thus, communication using model fragments is prone to misunderstandings and creating and using them is fuzzy. This prevents developing of systematic methods and tools. In this paper we clarify the concept and the problem area of model fragments, and discuss how to create and use them. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation for a model fragmentation mechanism and demonstrate it in a small example. ...|$|E

This agent is capable of learning and remembering events and any related information such as corresponding procedures, stimuli and their emotional valences. Our proposed episodic memory and episodic learning mechanism are closer to the current multiple-trace theory in neuroscience, because they are inspired by it [5] contrary to other mechanisms that are incorporated in cognitive agents. This is because in our model emotions {{play a role in}} the encoding and remembering of events. This allows the agent to improve its behavior by remembering previously selected behaviors which are influenced by its emotional mechanism. Moreover, the architecture incorporates a realistic memory consolidation process based on a data mining algorithm...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was {{to find out whether}} bilingual {{students}} acquire an additional language more easily compared to monolingual students. In order to find evidence of this a field study was carried out focusing on the results of bilingal and monolingual students in National tests in English. The field study indicated that the monolingual students generally performed better {{in all parts of the}} test. The reason for this is mainly because of the fact that the bilingual students' greatest difficulty was spelling. The bilingual students did, however, outperform the monolingual students in a section where they had to explain words in a context by means of using other words. They also managed word ordering better and never used 'Swenglish' expressions in their written productions. It was therefore possible to draw the conclusion that bilingual students have a better metalinguistic awareness, that is, a deeper <b>concious</b> awareness about language and the use of language. No other significant differences between these students were found. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-AThis paper {{describes}} a study investigating attitudes to noise as an occupational hazard. The {{objectives of the}} study were to understand the individual and organizational factors which affect attitudes towards noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and to relate these to the standards of hearing conservation achieved in industry as demonstrated by compliance with the Noise at Work Regulations. The study comprised a survey of 48 organizations across Britain, and a more detailed examination of 10 of these as case studies. Methods used included desk research, audits of hearing conservation programmes, questionnaires and interviews. Whilst there is widespread acceptance that industrial noise is a hazard, it is one that is frequently taken for granted, and measures to deal with it are often inadequate. Most organizations place the onus on the workforce to protect their own hearing through the use of personal hearing protectors Workers reactions to noise tended however to be passive and much of the time neither managers nor the workforce are <b>concious</b> of the noise hazard. This is the case even where some managers are committed to good industrial housekeeping and accident prevention.

For this rather special reason it is defined in the title as an "introduction", {{but the reality is}} that it is an extremely interesting multi-authored survey with two points of entry.

A final theme, "women", is only explored in the "Latina" variant, as if men and women can be treated in isolation when the gender question is raised. It is quite impossible to review the individual essays here, but the overall concept is imaginative and the editor has done extremely well to bring the contributions together from various quarters. In both groups of essays there is a wonderful liveliness, produced by the excitement of opening up this field over a broad range, and inspired by the vitality of the currently observable religious phenomena themselves...|$|E
