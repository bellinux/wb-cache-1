It was seen as important by many that both the theme of the meeting and the discussions in workshops had adequately incorporated the ideas of Internet Governance for Development. Youth participation needs to be strengthened, both physically and remotely, and youth needed to be included in all aspects of the IGF and at all levels, not only in ‘youth’ centered workshops and sessions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} developing countries participation and usage of the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement system. Although the World Trade Organization provides equal rights and obligation {{to enter into the}} dispute settlement process for all member countries, the litigation process is complex and costly for developing countries. There are various limitations for developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> when they want to use the dispute settlement mechanism and this dissertation mainly discusses the lack of legal and financial means of developing countries. In this regard, this dissertation examines possible solution which could increase developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> in the dispute settlement mechanism. These alternative resolutions may address the problem of the participation of developing countries in the dispute settlement system and it also try to develop a more effective working dispute settlement mechanism for developing countries. Therefore, World Trade Organization system could propose significant reforms in the Dispute Settlement Body which encourage developing <b>country</b> <b>participation...</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} alleged since its {{inception}} that the WTO Dispute Settlement (DS) mechanism is biased against developing countries, as manifested in e. g. allegedly too low rates of dispute initiation. To shed light on this issue, this study analyses the determinants of developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> in the DS system, using bilateral industry-level trade data, and a data set on dispute initiation that is significantly richer than what has been employed in the literature. But the study also points {{to a number of}} fundamental conceptual and data problems that beset the whole empirical literature that seeks to draw policy conclusions based on <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> in the DS system. While perhaps appreciated by researchers working in this area, these problems appear to go unnoticed by practitioners drawing on this literature.

40|$|What {{affects a}} country’s {{decision}} {{of whether to}} formally engage in a trade dis-pute directly related to its exporting interests? This paper empirically examines determi-nants of affected <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> decisions in formal trade litigation arising under the World Trade Organization (WTO) between 1995 and 2000. We investigate determi-nants of nonparticipation and examine whether the incentives generated by the system’s rules and procedures discourage active engagement in dispute settlement by developing country members in particular. While we find the size of exports at stake {{to be an important}} economic determinant affecting the decision to participate in challenges to a WTO-inconsistent policy, we also provide evidence that measures of a country’s retalia-tory and legal capacity, as well as its international political-economic relationships matter. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of an implicit “institutional bias ” gen-erated by the system’s rules and incentives that particularly affects developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> in dispute settlement...|$|E
40|$|Two broad interpretations {{currently}} {{prevail in}} the literature on developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> in the GATT. The first suggests that developing countries spent most of their time in the GATT negotiating to be relieved of various commitments, focusing on the pursuit of industrialization through import substitution and/or free-riding on the commitments made by their industrial counterparts. The second interpretation suggests that developing countries spent the majority of their time in the GATT either as quiet bystanders lacking the expertise or political representation to participate fully, or else attempting to redress biases in the institution's design. The problem with both of these interpretations is that while each has merit neither offers a sufficiently rounded account of developing <b>country</b> <b>participation.</b> Our purpose in this paper is to offer an alternative account of developing <b>country</b> <b>participation</b> that shows more accurately the extent and variation of that participation. We argue that throughout the development of the GATT developing countries were active participants that consistently sought {{to have an impact on}} the nature and direction of the multilateral trading system. We also argue that while the energy of developing countries was often directed towards negotiating more favourable treatment for themselves, this was a result more of the asymmetrical manner in which the GATT was deployed and a consequence of their relative underdevelopment than of a desire to free-ride on the favourable trading conditions created by the concession exchanging activities of others. © Rorden Wilkinson and James Scott...|$|E
