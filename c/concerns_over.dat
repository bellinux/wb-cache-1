40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of social <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> reality shows. Couched {{in the theory of}} the influence of presumed influence, it is argued that the degree of <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> the effects of media mediates between beliefs in media power and people’s responses to such beliefs. Survey data show that perceived influence is distinct from <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> effects. Furthermore, the authors show that perceived influence predicts willingness to censor reality shows but that, in addition to this direct effect, there is an indirect effect through the degree of <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> the effects of reality shows. This indirect effect adds to the overall predictive value of the model. Results are discussed in terms of their contribution to explaining the influence of presumed influence...|$|R
