Due to data compression, the actual data transmission rate or throughput (see below) may be higher.|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} file systems, {{a well-known}} congestion collapse called TCP incast (Incast briefly) occurs because many servers almost simultaneously send {{data to the}} same client and then many packets overflow the port buffer of the link connecting to the client. Incast leads to throughput degradation in the network. In this paper, we propose three methods to avoid Incast {{based on the fact}} that the bandwidth-delay product is small in current data center networks. The first method is a method which completely serializes <b>connection</b> <b>establishments.</b> By the serialization, the number of packets in the port buffer becomes very small, which leads to Incast avoidance. The second and third methods are methods which overlap the slow start period of the next connection with the current established connection to improve throughput in the first method. Numerical results from extensive simulation runs show the effectiveness of our three proposed methods. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is three fold: 1. to present an uptodate {{comprehensive}} review of connection admission control (CAC) algorithms, 2. to compare the performance of a mixed set of common and newer CAC algorithms and 3. to discuss reserach directions for CAC algorithms. We start by discussing connection admission control in ATM networks in terms of <b>connection</b> <b>establishments</b> and routing, the quality of service (QoS) parameters which define the CAC operation and a set of desirable properties. A comprehensive review of CAC algorithms then follow covering a wide range of different approaches, from mathematical/statistical, heuristic, measurement to artificial intelligence methods. We also present a simple CAC performance framework discussing various performance metrics, analytical methods and performance assessment criterion. Quantitative performance comparison of a select six CAC algorithms are presented and their eoeectiveness in ATM networks under different operating conditions are discu [...] ...|$|R

Existing works for integrating and utilizing the TMK mainly focus on straightforward <b>connections</b> <b>establishment</b> and pay less attention to make computers interpret and retrieve knowledge correctly and quickly. In this paper, we explore a novel model to organize and integrate the TMK into conceptual graphs. We then employ a framework to automatically retrieve knowledge in knowledge graphs with a high precision. In order to perform reasonable inference on knowledge graphs, we propose a contextual inference pruning algorithm to achieve efficient chain inference. Our algorithm achieves a better inference result with precision and recall of 92 % and 96 %, respectively, which can avoid most of the meaningless inferences. In addition, we implement two prototypes and provide services, and the results show our approach is practical and effective...|$|R

40|$|Topology control (TC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} techniques for <b>connection</b> <b>establishments</b> between entities in Internet of Things, especially in the scenario where there are no fixed infrastructures such as prompt sensor deployments, emergency communications, and vehicle-vehicle communications. The goal of TC is to assign per-node transmission power such that the resulting topology is energy efficient and also satisfies some global graph property such as connectivity. Among the literatures, however, few efforts focused on the issue of TC with interest-independent nodes. Besides, in a distributed mobile networks, nodes' mobility can cause the dynamic network topology. As a result, nodes need to execute the TC algorithm periodically. To jointly consider nodes' selfishness and mobility, we propose a potential game and mobility aware TC (PGMATC) framework based on mobility traces and potential game, where a practical utility function is designed by considering the expected utility for a TC period. Extensive simulations driven by actual data demonstrate that PGMATC can improve the network connectivity with quite a limited increase in energy consumption, compared with the traditional TC algorithms.
