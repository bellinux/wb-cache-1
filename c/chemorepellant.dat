50|$|In both D. discoideum {{and human}} neutrophils, {{there is a}} {{reversal}} of polarity that occurs when converting from a chemoattraction to a chemorepulsion response. Evidenced chemotaxis models have been observed using cAMP analogs. During cAMP-mediated chemoattraction, the chemoattractant cAMP acti vates PI3K {{at the leading edge}} along with the localized activation of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. This in turn activates PLC which leads to the generation of IP-3, which results in a loss of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the leading edge. The chemorepellent 8CPT-cAMP inhibits PLC activity and thereby increases Ptds(3,4,5)P3 accumulation and activation of PTEN. In this manner, the <b>chemorepellant</b> reverses the polarity of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 gradient and induces chemorepulsion. Recent evidence also implicates a role for PI5K and Rho signaling during directional decision making and migration.|$|E
50|$|Both DCC in {{vertebrates}} and UNC-40 in C. elegans {{have shown}} {{to initiate a}} repulsive rather than attractive response when associated with the netrin receptor Unc5. In the same ventral midline gradient discussed above, netrin-1 acts as a <b>chemorepellant</b> for axons of the trochlear motor neurons, thus directing their growth dorsally (away from the ventral midline). Also, antibody inhibition of DCC in embryonic Xenopus spinal cord inhibited both attraction and repulsion in vitro. Likewise, multiple defects were observed in C. elegans unc-40 mutants; however errors in migration patterns were more profoundly affected by mutations in the unc-5 gene, indicating that binding of the netrin-1 homologue UNC-6 to the UNC-5 receptor alone can repel axonal growth. In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems short range chemorepulsion in which the concentration of netrins is high seems to primarily occur via the UNC-5 receptor, while long range repulsive effects at more diffuse concentrations require coordination between DCC (UNC-40 in C.elegans) and UNC-5.|$|E
40|$|Chemorepellants {{may play}} {{multiple}} roles in physiological and pathological processes. However, few endogenous chemorepellants have been identified, {{and how they}} function is unclear. We found that the autocrine signal AprA, which is produced by growing Dictyostelium discoideum cells and inhibits their proliferation, also functions as a <b>chemorepellant.</b> Wild-type cells {{at the edge of}} a colony show directed movement outward from the colony, whereas cells lacking AprA do not. Cells show directed movement away from a source of recombinant AprA and dialyzed conditioned media from wild-type cells, but not dialyzed conditionedmedia fromaprA− cells. The secreted protein CfaD, the G protein Gα 8, and the kinase QkgA are necessary for the <b>chemorepellant</b> activity of AprA as well as its proliferation-inhibiting activity, whereas the putative transcription factor BzpN is dispensable for the <b>chemorepellant</b> activity of AprA but necessary for inhibition of proliferation. Phospholipase C and PI 3 kinases 1 and 2, which are necessary for the activity of at least one other <b>chemorepellant</b> in Dictyostelium, are not necessary for recombinant AprA <b>chemorepellant</b> activity. Starved cells are not repelled by recombinant AprA, suggesting that aggregation-phase cells are not sensitive to the <b>chemorepellant</b> effect. Cell tracking indicates that AprA affects the directional bias of cell movement, but not cell velocity or the persistence of cell movement. Together, our data indicate that the endogenous signal AprA acts as an autocrine <b>chemorepellant</b> for Dictyostelium cells...|$|E
40|$|Diffusible chemoattractants and <b>chemorepellants,</b> {{together}} with contact attraction and repulsion, have {{been implicated in}} the establishment of connections between neurons and their targets. Here we study how such diffusible and contact signals can be involved in the whole sequence of events from bundling of axons, guidance of axon bundles towards their targets, to debundling and the final innervation of individual targets. By means of computer simulations, we investigate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a number of particular mechanisms that have been proposed for these processes...|$|R
40|$|Herein we {{describe}} the molecular characterization of the human leukocyte activation antigen CD 100 and identify it as the first semaphorin, to our knowledge, in the immune system. Semaphorins have recently been described as neuronal <b>chemorepellants</b> that direct pioneering neurons during nervous system development. In this study we demonstrate that CD 100 induces B cells to aggregate and improves their viability in vitro. We show that CD 100 modifies CD 40 -CD 40 L B-cell signaling by augmenting B-cell aggregation and survival and down-regulating CD 23 expression. Thus, {{these results suggest that}} semaphorins as exemplified by CD 100 also play a functional role in the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{process of}} axon {{guidance}} {{is important in}} establishing functional neural circuits. The dif-ferential expression of cell-autonomous axon guidance factors is crucial for allowing axons of different neurons to take unique trajectories in response to spatially and temporally restricted cell non-autono-mous axon guidance factors. A key motivation {{in the field is}} to provide adequate explanations for axon behavior with respect to the differential expression of these factors. Results: We report the characteriza-tion of a predicted secreted semaphorin family member, semaphorin 2 b (Sema- 2 b) in Drosophila embryonic axon guidance. Misexpression of Sema- 2 b in neurons causes highly penetrant axon guidance phenotypes in specific longitudinal and motoneuron pathways; however, expression of Sema- 2 b in muscles traversed by these motoneurons has no effect on axon guidance. In Sema- 2 b loss-of-function embryos, specific moto-neuron and interneuron axon pathways display guidance defects. Specific visualization of the neurons that normally express Sema- 2 b reveals that this neuronal cohort is strongly affected by Sema- 2 b loss-of-function alleles. Conclusions: While secreted semaphorins have been implicated as cell non-autonomous <b>chemorepellants</b> in a variety of contexts, here we report previously undescribed Sema- 2 b loss-of-function and misexpression phenotypes that are consistent with a cell-autonomous role for Sema- 2 b.

40|$|Cellular {{movement}} {{in response to}} a chemical gradient, known as chemotaxis, is a critical behavior in many developmental and pathological processes such as embryo development and cancer metastasis. This cell movement can be directed toward a chemical source (chemoattraction), or away from a chemical source (chemorepulsion). In certain normal and tumor mammalian cells, there is secretion of <b>chemorepellant</b> signals that causes specific cell types to move away from them. For example, Semaphorin 3 A acts as a <b>chemorepellant</b> involved in axon guidance during neuronal development and is implicated in glial cancer cell metastasis (glioblastoma multiforme), but its mechanism of action is not yet well understood. Studies using the eukaryotic unicellular amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as a model showed that proliferating Dictyostelium cells secrete a protein called AprA, and that AprA is an extracellular signal that functions both as a <b>chemorepellant</b> and an inhibitor of cell proliferation. By analyzing the movement of mutant strains in a gradient of recombinant AprA, the role of specific proteins in the AprA chemorepulsion mechanism was assessed. The proteins CrlA, G? 9 and G? have been implicated in AprA cell signaling and growth pathways, but not directly in AprA chemorepulsion signaling. It was found that G?, but not G? 9 or CrlA, is necessary for chemorepulsion by AprA. The proteins IplA, Akt 1 / 2, PiaA, Gca/sgcA and PI 3 K 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5, are components of other chemotaxis signaling pathways, but are not known to be involved in AprA signaling pathways. This study?s results indicate that of these, only Akt 1 / 2 is necessary for chemorepulsion by AprA. These results indicate that G? and Akt 1 / 2 proteins are involved in the <b>chemorepellant</b> signaling pathway for AprA in Dictyostelium discoideum. The presence of functional homologs of G? and Akt 1 / 2 proteins in other cells, for example mammalian neutrophils, suggests that they may be involved in a similar chemorepulsion pathway. Through identifying the components of the transduction pathway of chemorepellants such as AprA, the development of novel therapeutics that can modulate this pathway could help lead to improved treatments in cancer and autoimmune disease...|$|E
40|$|I {{describe}} an assembly of neurons that synthesizes a <b>chemorepellant</b> molecule and transfers this molecule {{to the growth}} cones by axonal transport. From the growth cone, the repellant diffuses in nearby regions, achieving a certain concentration profile, δ, with a gradient. The growth cone migrates preferentially toward the regions of low δ. I show that this process self-consistently generates a profile of finite width, with a relatively sharp front of neuronal growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSlit {{proteins}} {{have previously}} {{been shown to}} regulate axon guidance, branching, and neural migration. Here we report that, in addition to acting as a <b>chemorepellant</b> for cortical axons, Slit 1 regulates dendritic development. Slit 1 is expressed in the developing cortex, and exposure to Slit 1 leads to increased dendritic growth and branching. Conversely, inhibition of Slit-Robo interactions by Robo-Fc fusion proteins or by a dominant-negative Robo attenuates dendritic branching. Stimulation of neurons transfected with a Met-Robo chimeric receptor with Hepatocyte growth factor leads to a robust induction of dendritic growth and branching, suggesting that Robo-mediated signaling is sufficient to induce dendritic remodeling. These experiments indicate that Slit-Robo interactions may exert a significant influence over the specification of cortical neuron morphology by regulating both axon guidance and dendritic patterning...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying axonal pathfinding {{are still}} poorly understood. Skin sensory dermatomes are arranged as segmental areas that originate from {{dorsal root ganglia}} (DRGs) and their outgrowing peripheral spinal nerves. This segmental pattern provides a simple model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of axonal pathfinding in the peripheral nervous system. Likewise, {{the development of the}} dentate gyrus provides a practical model to investigate the molecular mechanisms in the central nervous system. Generally, neurotrophins, guidance molecules and extracellular matrix molecules are known to play a pivotal role in axonal guidance during development. Neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) are essential for the survival of nociceptive neurons and support the extension of their neurites. Axons are guided to their targets by a combination of diffusible and membrane- bound guidance molecules having either an attractive or a repulsive effect on the growth cone. Some of the best characterized <b>chemorepellants</b> are the semaphorins, ephrins and netrins. Furthermore, extracellular matrix molecules like laminin play an important role by interacting with guidance molecules to establish gradients or influence the sensitivity of the growth cones directly. To investigate the guidance mechanisms and molecular cues involved in sensory dermatome patterning, we placed DRGs in close vicinity to each other and used different neurotrophins to stimulate DRG axonal outgrowth and discovered an NGF- but not NT 3 - dependant repulsion between outgrowing neurites of the ganglia in a 3 - dimensional collagen coculture system. This effect was not observed on a collagen culture surface, but on a laminin culture surface. We performed cDNA microarrays and realtime- PCR analysis for known guidance molecules to generate candidates that may have caused the repulsion. Functional antibodies against several of those cues could not block the repulsion, which suggests the presence of an unknown factor that seems to interact with laminin responsible for our observation...|$|R
40|$|Studying neurite {{guidance}} by diffusible or substrate bound gradients {{is challenging}} with current techniques. In this study, we present the design, fabrication and utility of a microfluidic device to study neurite guidance under chemogradients. Experimental and computational studies demonstrated {{the establishment of}} a steep gradient of guidance cue within 30 min and stable for up to 48 h. The gradient was found to be insensitive to external perturbations such as media change and movement of device. The effects of netrin- 1 (0. 1 – 10 µg mL− 1) and brain pulp (0. 1 µL mL− 1) were evaluated for their chemoattractive potential on neurite turning, while slit- 2 (62. 5 or 250 ng mL− 1) was studied for its <b>chemorepellant</b> properties. Hippocampal or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were seeded into a micro-channel and packed onto the surface of a 3 D collagen gel. Neurites grew into the matrix in three dimensions, and a gradient of guidance cue was created orthogonal to the direction of neurite growth to impact guidance. The average turning angle of each neurite was measured and averaged across multiple devices cultured under similar conditions to quantify the effect of guidance cue gradient. Significant positive turning towards gradient was measured in the presence of brain pulp and netrin- 1 (1 µg mL− 1), relative to control cultures which received no external guidance cue (p < 0. 001). Netrin- 1 released from transfected fibroblasts had the most positive turning effect of all the chemoattractive cues tested (p < 0. 001). Slit- 2 exhibited strong <b>chemorepellant</b> characteristics on both hippocampal and DRG neurite guidance at 250 ng mL− 1 concentration. Slit- 2 also showed similar behavior on DRG neuron invasion into 3 D collagen gel (p < 0. 01 relative to control cultures). Taken together, the results suggest the utility of this microfluidic device to generate stable chemogradients for studying neurobiology, cell migration and proliferation, matrix remodeling and co-cultures with other cell lines, with potential applications in cancer biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

40|$|AbstractRho family GTPases {{have been}} implicated in {{neuronal}} growth cone guidance; however, the underlying cytoskeletal mechanisms are unclear. We have used multimode fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) to directly address this problem. We report that actin arcs that form in the transition zone are incorporated into central actin bundles in the C domain. These actin structures are Rho/Rho Kinase (ROCK) effectors. Specifically, LPA mediates growth cone retraction by ROCK-dependent increases in actin arc and central actin bundle contractility and stability. In addition, these treatments had marked effects on MT organization {{as a consequence of}} strong MT-actin arc interactions. In contrast, LPA or constitutively active Rho had no effect on P domain retrograde actin flow or filopodium bundle number. This study reveals a novel mechanism for domain-specific spatial control of actin-based motility in the growth cone with implications for understanding <b>chemorepellant</b> growth cone responses and nerve regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{the size of a}} tissue is {{established}} during development and maintained subsequently. Proliferation-inhibiting signals secreted by cells within a tissue that act specifically on cells within that tissue can provide negative feedback on cell number, thus regulating tissue size. A better understanding of tissue-specific inhibitors of proliferation could be useful for designing therapies for cancer and other diseases. However, few signals of this sort have been identified, and little {{is known about}} how these signals function. Two examples of such signals are the proteins AprA and CfaD, which are secreted by the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and inhibit cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Cells lacking either AprA or CfaD proliferate rapidly, and adding recombinant AprA or CfaD to cells reduces proliferation. However, {{little is known about the}} signal transduction pathways downstream of AprA and CfaD. I identified three proteins that are required for the normal function of AprA and CfaD: the kinase QkgA, the putative transcription factor BzpN, and the putative kinase PakD. Cells lacking any one of these proteins proliferate rapidly, and adding AprA or CfaD to cells lacking these proteins does not cause reduced proliferation, indicating that these proteins are involved in AprA/CfaD signal transduction. I also found that, in addition to its proliferation-inhibiting activity, AprA also functions as an autocrine <b>chemorepellant.</b> Colonies of cells lacking AprA expand less rapidly than wild-type colonies, despite the fact that individual cells lacking AprA show a random motility like that of wild-type cells. Further, two independent assays demonstrate that cells show a biased movement away from a source of AprA. The <b>chemorepellant</b> activity of AprA requires CfaD, QkgA, and PakD, but not BzpN, indicating that AprA affects proliferation and chemorepulsion through distinct but overlapping pathways. These results suggest that AprA functions as a readout of local cell density, to which cells respond by slowing proliferation and chemotaxing to regions of lower cell density, where nutrients are more likely to be present. The study of human AprA, CfaD, QkgA, BzpN, and PakD orthologs may serve to guide therapeutic approaches that modulate chemorepulsive or antiproliferative processes...|$|E
40|$|Migration of {{neuronal}} {{precursor cells}} in the developing brain is guided by extracellular cues, but intracellular signaling processes underlying the guidance of neuronal migration are largely unknown. By examining the migration of cerebellar granule neurons along the surface of cocultured astroglial cells, we found that an extracellular gradient of Slit 2, a <b>chemorepellant</b> for neuronal migration in vivo, caused a reversal {{in the direction of}} migration without affecting the migration speed. A Slit 2 gradient elevated the intracellular concentration of Ca 2 +, probably due to calcium release from the internal store, led to a reversal of the preexisting asymmetric intracellular Ca 2 + distribution in the soma of migrating neurons, and this reversal was closely related with its action of reversing the migrating direction. Asymmetric Ca 2 + distribution in the soma was both necessary and sufficient for directing neuronal migration. These results have demonstrated an important role for Ca 2 + in mediating neuronal responses to Slit 2 and suggest a general mechanism for neuronal guidance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neural crest cells emerge by {{delamination}} {{from the}} dorsal neural tube and {{give rise to}} various components of the peripheral nervous system in vertebrate embryos. These cells change from non-motile into highly motile cells migrating to distant areas before further differentiation. Mechanisms controlling delamination and subsequent migration of neural crest cells are not fully understood. Slit 2, a <b>chemorepellant</b> for axonal guidance that repels and stimulates motility of trunk neural crest cells away from the gut has recently been suggested to be a tumor suppressor molecule. The goal {{of this study was}} to further investigate the role of Slit 2 in trunk neural crest cell migration by constitutive expression in neural crest cells. Results: We found that Slit gain-of-function significantly impaired neural crest cell migration while Slit loss-of-function favored migration. In addition, we observed that the distribution of key cytoskeletal markers was disrupted in both gain and loss of function instances. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Slit molecules might be involved in the processes that allow neural crest cells to begin migrating and transitioning to a mesenchymal type...|$|E
40|$|Semaphorin 3 a (Sema 3 a), a <b>chemorepellant</b> {{guidance}} protein, plays crucial {{roles in}} neural, cardiac and peripheral vascular patterning. Sema 3 a {{is expressed in}} the developing nephron, mature podocytes and collecting tubules. Sema 3 a acts as a negative regulator of ureteric bud branching, but its function in glomerular development has not been examined. Here we tested the hypothesis that Sema 3 a regulates glomerular vascular development using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models. Sema 3 a deletion resulted in defects in renal vascular patterning, excess endothelial cells within glomerular capillaries, effaced podocytes with extremely wide foot processes and albuminuria. Podocyte Sema 3 a overexpression during organogenesis resulted in glomerular hypoplasia, characterized by glomerular endothelial cell apoptosis, delayed and abnormal podocyte foot process development, a complete absence of slit diaphragms and congenital proteinuria. Nephrin, WT 1 and VEGFR 2 were downregulated in Sema 3 a-overexpressing kidneys. We conclude that Sema 3 a is an essential negative regulator of endothelial cell survival in developing glomeruli and {{plays a crucial role}} in podocyte differentiation in vivo. Hence, a tight regulation of Sema 3 a dosage is required {{for the establishment of a}} normal glomerular filtration barrier...|$|E

One of the most considered prototypes is the Pt-silica Janus because of its simplicity and easy construction. Although today Janus can be built within hours, still it lacks some physical knowledge of their behaviour. In an attempt to understand better Janus, in this project I have performed not only an experimental but also a computational approach to Janus. In particular, I have focus on what happens for Pt-silica Janus in a dilute regime near a liquid-liquid interface. Experimental results have shown how the velocity is decreased compared to its usual velocity on bulk up to 45 %. Moreover, interface modifications with surfactants has also shown how on the one hand, surfactants interfere in Janus velocity but also, how Janus are further to the interface. Computational results, could not approximate as much as experimental, {{but at least they}} show how Janus can be modelled and how this model could explain real behaviour of Janus at the bulk by selecting a small region for <b>chemorepellant</b> mobility parameters related to each of the parts of the Janus particl...|$|E
40|$|The active {{movement}} of cells from subendothelial compartments {{into the bloodstream}} (intravasation) has been recognized for several decades by histologic and physiologic studies, yet the molecular effectors of this process are relatively uncharacterized. For extravasation, studies based predominantly on static transwell assays support a general model, whereby transendothelial migration (TEM) occurs via chemoattraction toward increasing chemokine concentrations. However, this model of chemotaxis cannot readily reconcile how chemokines influence intravasation, as shear forces of blood flow would likely abrogate luminal chemokine gradient(s). Thus, to analyze how T cells integrate perivascular chemokine signals under physiologic flow, we developed a novel transwell-based flow chamber allowing for real-time modulation of chemokine levels above (luminal/apical compartment) and below (abluminal/subendothelial compartment) HUVEC monolayers. We routinely observed human T cell TEM across HUVEC monolayers with the combination of luminal CXCL 12 and abluminal CCL 5. With increasing concentrations of CXCL 12 in the luminal compartment, transmigrated T cells did not undergo retrograde transendothelial migration (retro-TEM). However, when exposed to abluminal CXCL 12, transmigrated T cells underwent striking retro-TEM and re-entered the flow stream. This CXCL 12 fugetactic (<b>chemorepellant)</b> effect was concentration-dependent, augmented by apical flow, blocked by antibodies to integrins, and reduced by AMD 3100 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CXCL 12 -induced retro-TEM was inhibited by PI 3 K antagonism and cAMP agonism. These findings broaden our understanding of chemokine biology and support a novel paradigm by which temporospatial modulations in subendothelial chemokine display drive cell migration from interstitial compartments into the bloodstream...|$|E
40|$|The neuropathological {{features}} of schizophrenia are suggestive of a developmentally induced impairment of synaptic connectivity. Semaphorin 3 A (sema 3 A) {{might contribute to}} this process {{because it is a}} secreted <b>chemorepellant</b> which regulates axonal guidance. We have investigated sema 3 A in the cerebellum (an area in which expression persists in adulthood), and measured its abundance in 16 patients with schizophrenia and 16 controls. In adults, sema 3 A was predominantly localized to the inner part of the molecular layer neuropil, whereas infants and rats showed greater labelling of Purkinje cell bodies. Sema 3 A was increased in schizophrenia, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (+ 28 %; P< 0. 05) and immunohistochemistry (+ 45 %; P< 0. 01). We also measured reelin mRNA, since reelin is involved in related developmental processes and is decreased in other brain regions in schizophrenia. Reelin mRNA showed a trend reduction in the subjects with schizophrenia (- 26 %; P= 0. 07) and, notably, was negatively correlated with sema 3 A. Sema 3 A also correlated negatively with synaptophysin and complexin II mRNAs. The results show that sema 3 A is elevated in schizophrenia, and is associated with downregulation of genes involved in synaptic formation and maintenance. In this respect, sema 3 A appears to contribute to the synaptic pathology of schizophrenia, perhaps via ongoing effects of persistent sema 3 A elevation on synaptic plasticity. The findings are consistent with an early neurodevelopmental origin for the disorder, and the reciprocal changes in sema 3 A and reelin may be indicative of a pathogenic mechanism that affects the balance between trophic and inhibitory factors regulating synaptogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Two {{projects}} {{are presented in}} this report. First, a silver resistant strain of Pseudomonas sp. (closest relatives Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas plecoglossicidaI) was isolated from Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, MA. This strain could grow in 2 ppm AgNO 3 and at silver nanoparticle concentrations of 2000 ppm. The lack of a toxic effect of high silver nanoparticle concentrations {{and the formation of}} precipitates in the colonies indicates that the strain may be tolerant of solid silver. Attempts were made to extract and sequence a silver resistance plasmid. Second, chemotaxis experiments using nanoparticles as chemoattractants/repellants were performed using the silver resistant Pseudomonas, Vibrio gazogenes, and swamp water from Cedar Swamp. It was demonstrated that there was no chemoattractant effect of reactive iron nanoparticles in Cedar Swamp water despite the generation of hydrogen, which could be a potentially very strong chemoattractant. Additionally it was shown that while V. gazogenes did not see silver as a <b>chemorepellant,</b> the silver resistant Pseudomonas sp. was repelled by 50 nm silver nanoparticles. Silver resistance and the toxicity of silver nanoparticles The amount of nanoscale silver is increasing rapidly in consumer products the ability to synthesize these particles on a large scale improves. Silver nanoparticles (NPs) are toxic to bacteria, and are currently used in everything from medical devices to sport socks and washing machines to deter microbial growth. Silver is a particularly toxic heavy metal as it interferes with the electron transport chain and binds to DNA (Thurman, 1989) The existence of silver resistant bacteria however is well known, and these bacteria may be less impacted by the presence of silver nanoparticles. Certain bacteria have been shown to accumulate or precipitate silver into silver metal or other insoluble form. To date, studies of silver nanoparticle toxicity have focused on strains of bacteria that lack silver resistance. Therefore it is interesting to study the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to silver resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The enchanting {{process of}} brain {{development}} entails a fragile and finite time window, throughout which biochemical imbalances and external insults can potentially affect developing neuronal circuits. Within the numerous exquisitely orchestrated events {{taking place in}} the foetal brain, axonal pathfinding is of paramount importance. If aberrant, axonal outgrowth can lead to errors in synaptogenesis and impaired connectivity, with potential long-lasting behavioural phenotypes. Despite the prominent role of endocannabinoids (eCBs) in axonal guidance, the molecular determinants of eCB-mediated axonal regulation remain largely unexplored. Aiming to interrogate the eCB machinery in less explored subcortical territories, study I investigates the role of the eCB system and its underlying components in foetal cholinergic projection neurons. Prenatal manipulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1 R) permanently reshaped septo-hippocampal cholinergic projections. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was identified as an upstream molecule capable of regulating 2 -arachydonoylglycerol (2 -AG) via monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) degradation. The compartmentalization of each eCB machinery component along extending neurites is therefore crucial. However, axonal pathfinding takes place within the extracellular matrix, migrating glia and developing oligodendrocytes, generating a convoluted scenario where each growth cone interacts with multiple guidance proteins. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB 2 R) -expressing oligodendrocytes are introduced in study II as an additional player able to drive aberrant callosal axons spread upon supra-physiological 2 -AG levels. Excess 2 -AG engaged CB 2 R-mediated premature proliferation of oligodendrocyte end-feet. The interaction between the oligodendrocyte-derived <b>chemorepellant</b> molecule Slit 2 and its receptor roundabout 1 (Robo 1) on corticofugal axonal ends induced errant CB 1 R-expressing corticofugal axon pathfinding. In addition to being an endogenous receptor of eCBs, CB 1 R is also a target for the principal psychoactive compound of cannabis, ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In study III we undertook an unbiased proteomics screening of the embryonic cortical plate following maternal THC exposure. Superior Cervical Ganglion 10 (SCG 10), a microtubule-binding protein present in extending growth cones, was identified as a direct molecular target of THC. Thus, microtubule dynamics represent a novel target of prenatal THC exposure, whose impairment promotes axonal defects and long-lasting synaptic connectivity impairment. Cholecystokinin (Cck) -containing interneurons, due to their high expression of CB 1 Rs and early appearance in the developing cortex, are likely targets of in utero eCB imbalances. Taking advantage of the recent CckBAC/DsRed mouse line in study IV we achieved a systematic anatomical and physiological characterization of Cck-CB 1 R-expressing cells from embryonic day (E) 10. 5 to adulthood. In sum, multiple upstream and downstream molecular components of the eCBs system were assessed over the course of this thesis investigation, within both physiological brain development and upon maternal cannabis exposure...|$|E
