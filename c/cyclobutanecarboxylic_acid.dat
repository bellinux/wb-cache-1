5000|$|... #Caption: Synthesis of cyclobutanone from <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The Russian chemist Nikolai Kischner first {{reported}} {{the preparation of}} cyclobutanone in 1905. [...] He synthesized cyclobutanone in a low yield from <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> in several reaction steps. This process is cumbersome and inefficient by today's standards.|$|E
50|$|More efficient, high-yielding syntheses {{have since}} been developed. One {{strategy}} involves degradation of five-carbon building blocks. For example, the oxidative decarboxylation of <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> was improved {{by the use of}} other reagents and methods. A newer, more efficient preparation of cyclobutanone was found by P. Lipp and R. KÃ¶ster in which a solution of diazomethane in diethyl ether is reacted with ketene. This reaction is based on a ring expansion of the cyclopropanone intermediate initially formed, wherein molecular nitrogen is split off. The reaction mechanism was confirmed by a reaction using 14C-labeled diazomethane.|$|E
40|$|The {{halogenated}} <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> are {{of importance}} {{in connection with}} projected syntheses of theoretically important cyclobutane derivatives. To facilitate the direct synthesis of such compounds, the free radical chlorination of two simple models, <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> and 1, 1 -cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid, has been investigated. Necessary to {{this study was the}} synthesis, by means indicative of structure, of 5 isomeric monochlorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids. A chromatographic method has been developed capable of effecting the separation of these isomers from a mixture. The results obtained in this work are consistent with modern interpretations of organic chemistry theory and extend the scope of its application in the field of free radical chlorination to carboxyl-substituted carbocyclic systems...|$|E
40|$|Five {{products}} from beta-caryophyllene oxidation (beta-caryophyllonic acid (I), 3, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -(3 -oxobutyl) <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (beta CA 198) (II), beta-nocaryophyllonic acid (III), beta-caryophyllinic acid (IV), and 2 -(2 -carboxyethyl) - 3, 3 -dimethylcyclobutanecarboxylic acid (beta CA 200) (V)) were synthesized and their structures confirmed by {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. Reaction chamber experiments with P-caryophyllene at two different ozone mixing ratios were performed and the carboxylic acid oxidation products in the particle phase were characterized by APCI-MS and HPLC-ESI-MS. All five synthesized acids were found as beta-caryophyllene oxidation products in the reaction chamber aerosol. The main oxidation products of the reaction chamber experiments were beta- 14 -hydroxynocaryophyllonic acid, beta-nocaryophyllonic acid (III) and beta CA 198 (II). Product yields of the acids were estimated based on the chamber experiments {{and the application of}} the atmospheric chemistry box model CAABA/MECCA. Finally, ambient aerosol samples taken during the HUMPPA campaign in Hyytiala, Finland in summer 2010 were analysed for the carboxylic acid beta-caryophyllene oxidation products. All five synthesized compounds were detected and were quantified in the ambient aerosol samples. The major beta-caryophyllene carboxylic acid oxidation products in the ambient air samples were beta-nocaryophyllonic acid (III) and beta CA 198 (II) with concentrations in the range of about 0. 2 - 14 ng m(- 3) and 0. 8 - 6. 8 ng m(- 3). The fact that the concentrations of these two acids in ambient aerosol are generally higher than the concentration of beta-caryophyllinic acid (IV) (often used in previous studies as oxidation tracer) with a concentration of about 0. 16 ng m(- 3) leads to the conclusion that these two acids are better suited as tracer compounds for beta-caryophyllene secondary organic aerosol formation.

40|$|In {{the sensory}} systems, {{peripheral}} neurons project axons in specific loci of the brain. The spatial segregation of the sensory afferents provides topographic maps {{that define the}} quality {{and the location of}} complex sensory stimuli. Electrical activity plays a critical role in the formation of specific synaptic contacts among neurons, although the type of activity required remains a matter of significant debate. In particular the role of spontaneous activity {{in the formation of the}} topographic organization of the olfactory system remains unknown. 	To address this question we investigated the role of spontaneous electrical activity in circuit formation and function in the olfactory bulb. To accomplish this goal, we took advantage of a line of mice engineered to have very little afferent spontaneous activity due to the over expression of the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir 2. 1 in the olfactory sensory neurons (Kir 2. 1 mice). We analyzed the formation of the sensory map, in particular whether the convergence of olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor took place properly in mice with reduced afferent spontaneous activity. The conflation of sensory axons to form homogeneous glomeruli, i. e. glomeruli formed exclusively by axons expressing the same olfactory receptor, in specific loci of the olfactory bulb is a critical feature of the sensory map that in turn defines functional units, i. e. odor columns. We found that in absence of spontaneous activity, the convergence of sensory neurons to form homogenous glomeruli took place but it was coarser than in controls. In particular we observed axons mistargeting that resulted in multiple heterogeneous glomeruli that persist also in adulthood. 	 To ascertain the role of spontaneous activity on the post synaptic elements of the olfactory bulb, we analyzed the mitral cells, the principal output neurons, and the granule cells, the major component of the inhibitor interneurons of the olfactory bulb. We found no difference in the developmental refinement of the apical dendrite of mitral cells in Kir 2. 1 and in control mice. The neurogenesis and the migration of granule cells was unaltered. However the filopodia-spine density on the dendritic tree of the granule cells was significantly reduced in Kir 2. 1 mice. 	To analyze the functional outcome of these anatomical alterations, we performed behaviour experiments. We demonstrated that Kir 2. 1 mice were unable to discriminate between two odors, such as couple of enantiomers, that elicit very similar spatial patterns of activated glomeruli, while retained the ability to differentiate between odorants, such as 2 -methylbutyric acid and <b>cyclobutanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (2 Mb and CB) that activate patterns of glomeruli spatially very distinct. 	Due to the high degree of plasticity of the olfactory system, we asked whether manipulation of electrical activity in adulthood could affect the already refined neural circuitry in the olfactory bulb. Taking advantage of the inducible nature of the Kir 2. 1 construct, we allowed the expression of the Kir 2. 1 channels only in adulthood, for 4 weeks. We found that the expression of the Kir 2. 1 channel in adults disrupted the organization of the sensory map, namely the convergence of olfactory sensory neuron axons. The absence of spontaneous afferent activity in adults induced a regression in the glomeruli organization. We found supernumerary heterogeneous glomeruli that coexist with the main homogeneous glomeruli. 	All together our data suggest that spontaneous activity is required for the developmental refinement and maintenance of the sensory map. Furthermore we found that the unrefined connectivity of the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb could affect olfactory discrimination behaviour. ...|$|E
