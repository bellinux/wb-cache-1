25|$|Tiwanaku monumental {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later Inca, Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular ashlar blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the Akapana and Pumapunku structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The I-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into I-shaped sockets. The blocks have flat faces that {{do not need to}} be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs on some of these blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.|$|E

50|$|The use of alloys {{by humans}} {{started with the}} use of {{meteoric}} iron, a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron. It is the main constituent of iron meteorites which occasionally fall down on Earth from outer space. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was. Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools, weapons, and nails. In many cultures it was shaped by <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.|$|E
5000|$|As widely {{accepted}} as this statement might be {{it should not}} be considered synonymous with a lack of metal objects, as it points out native copper was abundant particularly in the Great Lakes region and [...] "overlooks the simple fact that there was really very little to be gained by smelting..." [...] The latest glacial period had resulted in the scouring of copper bearing rocks. Once the ice retreated, these were readily available for use in a variety of sizes. Copper was shaped via <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> into objects from very early dates (Archaic period in the Great Lakes region: 8000 - 1000 BCE). There is also evidence of actual mining of copper veins (Old Copper Complex), but disagreement exists as to the dates.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} spirals varies {{from six to}} eight. When uncoiled, some bracelets measure 2.30 m and others 2.80 m. The outside diameters range from 91 to 123 mm. The spirals consist of flat {{rectangular}} strips with richly incised decorations and stylized palmettes. In most of them, seven palmettes decorate {{both ends of the}} bracelets. The bracelets terminate with a decorative protoma, a beast-head motif which looks like the head of an animal (a wolf, a snake or a dog). The goldsmith technique, used for manufacturing all of these gold armlets, was the <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> of a rectangular-shaped gold ingot, followed by punching and engraving for their decorations. This was a typical method used by Dacians from the 4th century BC to 1st century AD.|$|E
50|$|The NEGEV has a quick-change chrome-lined barrel that is {{manufactured}} using a <b>cold</b> <b>hammer</b> forging process. The barrel is {{fitted with}} a slotted flash suppressor and a fixed carry handle, {{which is used to}} transport the weapon and change-out an overheated barrel. The barrel can be changed only after lifting open the feed tray cover.|$|R
50|$|The SAR 21 {{is made of}} a rugged, {{high impact}} polymer, most of the {{manufacturing}} is done utilising CNC machines, with ultrasonic welding for the steel-reinforced receiver halves and the gun barrel being <b>cold</b> <b>hammer</b> forged.

50|$|Current model AK's {{are made}} using modern {{manufacturing}} processes and have many component parts produced by investment casting. This method gives a detailed and accurate product with excellent metallurgical properties. They come in 7.62×39mm (AK-103), 5.45×39mm (AK-74M) and 5.56×45mm (AK-101), with <b>cold</b> <b>hammer</b> forged barrels.

50|$|The {{strength}} and hardness of iron increases with {{the concentration of}} phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel. High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by <b>cold</b> <b>hammering.</b> The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can increase hardness {{by as much as}} 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%. It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, {{but at the same time}} also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures. This would decrease its usefulness in making blister steel (cementation), where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{features}} at Pumapunku are -shaped architectural cramps, {{which are}} composed of a unique copper-arsenic-nickel bronze alloy. These -shaped cramps were also used on a section of canal found {{at the base of}} the Akapana pyramid at Tiwanaku. These cramps were used to hold the blocks comprising the walls and bottom of stone-lined canals that drain sunken courts. -cramps of unknown composition were used to hold together the massive slabs that formed Pumapunku's four large platforms. In the south canal of the Pumapunku, the -shaped cramps were cast in place. In sharp contrast, the cramps used at the Akapana canal were fashioned by the <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> of copper-arsenic-nickel bronze ingots. The unique copper-arsenic-nickel bronze alloy is also found in metal artifacts within the region between Tiwanaku and San Pedro de Atacama during the late Middle Horizon around 600 - 900.|$|E

5000|$|Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America is the {{extraction}} and purification of metals, {{as well as}} creating metal alloys and fabrication with metal by Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European contact in the late 15th century. Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155 - 1936 BCE. and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would {{have been found in}} nature without need for smelting techniques and shaped into the desired form using heat and <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> techniques without chemically altering it by alloying it. To date [...] "no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America." [...] In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed. Metallurgy in Mesoamerica and Western Mexico developed from contacts with South America through Ecuadorian marine traders.|$|E
5000|$|The torc {{dates from}} 200-50 BC and {{is made from}} twisted gold wires. Forty-eight 2mm wires were twisted in pairs to form 24 wires. Then three of these paired wires were twisted {{together}} {{in the opposite direction}} to make a rope (comprising six original wires). These eight thicker ropes were then twisted together to form the body of the torc. In total, 25 metres of gold wire was used to form the torc. The hollow gold terminals, in a ring shape, were cast using the lost wax method, and is decorated in the La Tène style with moulded raised decoration of trumpet voids and circles, highlighted with pellets and <b>cold</b> <b>hammering.</b> [...] The torc is similar to the Great Torc from Snettisham and also to the Ipswich torcs, all of which are also in the British Museum. It is considered so similar to the Newark Torc, found in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, that it might have been made by the same craftsman.|$|E
5000|$|The {{artisans}} and blacksmiths of Iberia {{in what is}} now southern Spain and southwestern France produced various iron daggers and swords of {{high quality}} from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, in ornamentation and patterns influenced by Greek, Punic (Carthaginian), and Phoenician culture. [...] The exceptional purity of Iberian iron and the sophisticated method of forging, which included <b>cold</b> <b>hammering,</b> produced double-edged weapons of excellent quality. [...] One can find technologically advanced designs such as folding knives rusted among the artifacts of many Second Iberian Iron Age cremation burials or in Roman Empire excavations all around Spain and the Mediterranean. [...] Iberian infantrymen carried several types of iron daggers, most of them based on shortened versions of double-edged swords, but the true Iberian dagger had a triangular-shaped blade. Iberian daggers and swords were later adopted by Hannibal and his Carthaginian armies. [...] The Lusitanii, a pre-Celtic people dominating the lands west of Iberia (most of modern Portugal and Extremadura) successfully held off the Roman Empire for many years with a variety of innovative tactics and light weapons, including iron-bladed short spears and daggers modeled after Iberian patterns.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} after 1868, Plains Indian jewelers {{were able to}} easily acquire sheets of German silver. They used them to cut, stamp, and <b>cold</b> <b>hammer</b> {{a wide range of}} accessories and also horse gear. Continuing into the present, Plains metalsmiths have used German silver for pendants, pectorals, bracelets, armbands, hair plates, conchas (oval decorative plates for belts), earrings, belt buckles, necktie slides, stickpins, dush-tuhs, and tiaras. Nickel silver is the metal of choice among contemporary Kiowa and Pawnee metalsmiths in Oklahoma. Many of the metal fittings on modern higher-end equine harness and tack are of nickel silver.|$|R
5000|$|The {{one area}} in Mesoamerica which had {{developed}} copper work {{before the arrival}} of the Spanish was in west Mexico in what are now the states of Jalisco and Michoacán, mostly in the Purépecha Empire. [...] Most pre Hispanic copper work occurred in what are now the municipalities of Churumuco, La Huacana, Nuevo Urecho, Tacámbaro and Turicato, with a percentage of this production paid as tribute to the capital at Tzintzuntzan [...] [...] There is evidence {{that at least some of}} this copper and other minerals were extracted from shallow pits or tunnel mines. The Purépecha developed some techniques for extracting copper from rock as well as techniques for shaping it. The working of the metal had advanced enough that it was used for utilitarian objects as well as ornamental and religious ones. The Purépecha made a number of objects from the metal including axes, boxes, fish hooks, knives, small bells, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. [...] Copper was first worked by <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> but as copper loses elasticity as it is worked this way, heating was soon discovered to recondition it. The creation of objects by casting was not common for copper but was used to make small delicate objects such as bells.|$|E

40|$|In {{both the}} Andean zone of South America and in Mesoamerica, copper-silver alloys were {{important}} {{in the production of}} thin, silver-colored sheet metal artifacts. This thesis examines the mechanical and physical properties of the copper-silver alloy system that are important to understanding why copper-silver alloys became central to the metallurgies that developed among prehistoric societies of the Andean zone and Western Mexico. These properties include their range of malleability, the microstructures behind their toughness, and the recrystallization and annealing behaviors that led to their development of silver-enriched surfaces. To determine these properties, a series of cold rolling, <b>cold</b> <b>hammering,</b> and annealing experiments were performed on five Cu-Ag alloys and pure copper. Results of the cold rolling and <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> experiments reported here indicate that over the copper-silver alloy compositional range studied, the alloys can be cold rolled without annealing to over 90 % reduction in thickness. Similar reductions in thickness were also achieved in two alloys (95 wt% Cu - 5 wt% Ag and 30 wt% Cu - 70 wt% Ag) by <b>cold</b> <b>hammering.</b> The rate of work hardening and the Vickers Hardness Number, as functions of the percent reduction in thickness, are similar for alloy compositions containing between 30 wt% and 80 wt% Cu. This suggests that ancient metalsmiths likely annealed the copper-silver alloy artifacts intentionally to produce the desired silver surface color rather than for any improvement in malleability. The silver surface colors were important for their cultural associations. The recrystallization temperature for the copper-silver alloys tested (70 wt% Cu - 30 wt% Ag and 30 wt% Cu - 70 wt% Ag) is determined to be 500 °C given a 30 minute anneal time. by Shannon L. Taylor.

40|$|Object of {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} is a socketed axe (‘celt’) which is a stray find from {{the region of the}} village Knizhovnik, south of Haskovo. As reported by D. Aladzhov there is an Early Iron Age settlement in this area. The artefact belongs to type Varbitsa T 1 A after the typology of Lower Danubian socketed axes offered by V. Dergachev. This type is common for the central parts of Northern Bulgaria, west of the Yantra River. That kind of ‘celt’ is predominantly found in hoards of the HaA-HaB period. The stray find from the region of Haskovo is among the smallest tools of this type and probably dates to the X-IX century BC or {{the first phase of the}} Early Iron Age in Bulgaria. It is important to take into consideration that it is the only representative of type Varbitsa T 1 A south of the Balkan mountains. However, the moulds for production of this type of socketed axes are from South Bulgaria. The chemical composition of the ‘celt’ (As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, and Zn) has been determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The artefact is made of tin bronze with 93, 15 % copper and 3, 3 % tin. Such concentration of tin is common for archaeological bronze finds, it lowers the melting point of the alloy and improves its malleability, hardness and tensile strength. The quantity of antimony is 1, 6 % which is an evidence that the element was deliberately added to increase the hardness of the metal. The concentrations of trace elements such as zinc, nickel, lead, iron, arsenic, phosphorus, manganese and selenium are so low that it could not be suggested that they have been intentionally included in the alloy. In general, ‘celts’ are usually made of tin bronze in bivalve stone moulds. A socketed axe from Northeast Bulgaria was examined by the methods of metallography. The revealed production technique is casting which was followed by a cycle or cycles of <b>cold</b> <b>hammering</b> and annealing with annealing as final operation...|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} is {{made from}} a high quality 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, while the steel bolt has three lugs that lock into a barrel extension. It also has overpressure vent holes allowing high-pressure gases a channel of escape in the rare event of a cartridge case head failure. The barrel was designed by the German firm Lothar Walther and is <b>cold</b> <b>hammer</b> forged. The match grade fluted barrel is mounted fully floated and sports an integrated muzzle brake with a 50% recoil reduction effectiveness. The barrel features a non-conventional 305 mm (1:12 in) right-hand twist rate optimized for firing 16.2 gram (250 grain) [...]338-calibre very-low-drag bullets (VLD). Longer, heavier VLD bullets, like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing 19.44 gram (300 grain) projectile require a 254 mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate.|$|R
5000|$|M16 type rifles {{are made}} by dozens of {{manufactures}} around the world, to the highest standards [...] "the goal {{of which is to}} ensure that products designed for military use meet the necessary requirements with regard to quality, durability, ruggedness, commonality, interchangeability, total cost of ownership, logistics and other military and defense-related objectives." [...] The M16's barrel life is approximately 15,000 rounds for standard issue M16A4s and M4s. <b>Cold</b> <b>hammer</b> forged steel barrels such as those used on the HK416 have service life of 20,000 to 50,000 rounds depending on the intensity of use. A badly worn M16 barrel will cause the bullets to tumble in flight. However, the M16’s upper receiver/barrel may be swapped out in a matter of seconds, without the use of tools, simply by pushing out two pins. The M16 was designed to be a serviceable assault rifle, perfectly matching American military doctrine where units are resupplied on a continuous basis, and are expected to perform most of their own maintenance and repairs in the field. As such, American units are well supplied and are quickly provided with whatever spare-parts they need by their logistical support systems.|$|R
