In monetary term, one tael of gold was in exchange of 10 taels of silver. Where appropriate and necessary, the government established new coin-minting mill, ensuring the adequacy of money for trade and economic activity. Apart from silver and gold coins, lower-value coins were also minted by the government, consisting of copper and zinc coins from 1803, viz. his second year as king. The government also stipulated the weight measure systems to facilitate trade. In addition, roads were repaired or built new. Dykes and irrigation systems were renovated and protected to facilitate agricultural production. Rice reserves were built in many towns so that in emergency, the government could supply foods to people in time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the medium-term effects <b>of</b> {{a carbon}} <b>tax</b> on growth and CO 2 emissions in Ireland, a small open economy. We {{find that a}} double dividend exists if the carbon tax revenue is recycled through reduced income taxes. If the revenue is recycled by giving a lump-sum transfer to households, a double dividend is unlikely. We also determine that a greater incidence <b>of</b> the carbon <b>tax</b> falls on capital than on labour. When combined with a decrease in income tax, there is a <b>clear</b> shift <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> burden from labour to capital. Finally, most of {{the effect on the}} economy is due to changes in the competitiveness of the manufacturing and market services sectors. These results hold even if we allow changes in energy prices to have an enhanced (detrimental) effect on Ireland’s competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|In an {{increasingly}} global market, the Hollywood film industry is evolving rapidly. Once a stand-alone entity, the Hollywood blockbuster is now integrated {{more closely than}} ever with the internet, computer games and news media. This growing synergy {{has given rise to}} a new phenomenon: the event film. As a work that transcends the boundaries and expectations of conventional film, Peter Jackson's epic trilogy The Lord of the Rings makes a perfect case study for this emerging phenomenon. In a carefully-structured collection of essays, the authors cover every aspect of the event film from its inception through to marketing of the finished product. The financial implications of planning and producing an event film are examined, with <b>clear</b> analyses <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> breaks and marketing strategies. Consideration is also given to the philosophical and social impact of event films, including effects on national identity and tourism in an age of globalisation. The twenty-five contributors to this volume come from an eclectic range of backgrounds, but share a perspective grounded in Aotearoa New Zealand, the land of Middle-earth. Their expertise in fields as diverse as business, communications, geography, music, film and media studies combines to provide a <b>clear</b> understanding <b>of</b> how 'creative industries' will figure in future economics. Studying the event film offers a unique entry point for studying twenty-first century media, and is essential reading for fans of The Lord of the Rings and for anyone interested in contemporary Hollywood as a global industrial and cultural phenomenon...|$|R
5000|$|On 15 October 2004, Tamihere {{requested}} {{leave from}} his Ministerial portfolios after accusations of dishonest financial dealings made against him.

Tamihere said that he had [...] "done nothing to bring shame", but portrayed standing down from his Ministerial roles during investigation as the [...] "honourable" [...] course. On 22 October, the Waipareira Trust accepted that it, not Tamihere, had the responsibility for tax on any payment, but other allegations relating to the financial management of the Trust persisted. On 3 November Tamihere resigned from his Ministerial portfolios, citing as untenable the retention of his responsibilities during on-going investigations.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that {{an increasing number of}} enterprises plot together to evade tax in an unperceived way. At the same time, the taxation information related data is a classic kind of big data. These issues challenge the effectiveness of traditional data mining-based tax evasion detection methods. To address this problem, we first investigate the classic tax evasion cases, and employ a graph-based method to characterize their property that describes two suspicious relationship trails with a same antecedent node behind an Interest-Affiliated Transaction (IAT). Next, we propose a Colored Network-Based Model (CNBM) for characterizing economic behaviors, social relationships, and the IATs between taxpayers, and generating a Taxpayer Interest Interacted Network (TPIIN). To accomplish the tax evasion detection task by discovering suspicious groups in a TPIIN, methods for building a patterns tree and matching component patterns are introduced and the completeness of the methods based on graph theory is presented. Then, we describe an experiment based on real data and a simulated network. The experimental results show that our proposed method greatly improves the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion detection, as well as provides a <b>clear</b> explanation <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> evasion behaviors <b>of</b> taxpayer groups...|$|R

40|$|The unusual {{behavior}} {{of investment in}} the 1990 s and early 2000 s—abnormally high investment in the 1990 s and abnormally low investment in the 2000 s, despite several major tax cuts intended to stimulate investment — prompts two questions that we tackle in this paper: Did “capital overhang ” contribute to the dramatic investment collapse of the early 2000 ’s? and Why has fiscal policy been unable to revive investment? We use firm level {{evidence to show that}} capital overhang – the notion that the late 1990 s stock market bubble led to excess investment and prevented a rebound – is not a factor in explaining the fall of investment. Controlling for fundamentals, there is little evidence of capital overhang. We then modify the tax-adjusted q model to allow for <b>clearer</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> effects in the presence of mismeasured q. This modification yields estimates that are much larger and more precisely measured suggesting that the taxadjusted q model does a reasonable job in explaining investment patterns. Using this q model we show why tax policy did not stimulate investment. First, in keeping with the “new ” view of dividend taxation, the evidence suggests that dividend taxes do not affect marginal investment incentives and, instead, provide windfall gains to existing shareholders. The dividend tax cut, with forecast revenue cost of more than $ 400 billion from 2003 - 2008, has essentially no impact on investment according to the evidence. Second, the partial expensing of equipment provisions (revenue cost of approximately $ 130 billion from 2002 - 2004) did have an effect on investment but were much too small to counteract the large aggregate investment declines. The results put the investment increases resulting from the <b>tax</b> policies <b>of</b> 2002 - 2004 at less than two percent...|$|R
