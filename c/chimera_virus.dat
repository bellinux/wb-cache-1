40|$|Human a-defensins are {{proteins}} of {{the innate}} immune system that suppress viral and bacterial infections by multiple mechanisms including membrane disruption. For viruses that lack envelopes, such as human adenovirus (HAdV), other, less well defined, mechanisms must be involved. A previous structural study on the interaction of an a-defensin, human a-defensin 5 (HD 5), with HAdV led to a proposed mechanism in which HD 5 stabilizes the vertex region of the capsid and blocks uncoating steps required for infectivity. Studies with <b>virus</b> <b>chimeras</b> comprised of capsid proteins from sensitive and resistant serotypes supported this model. To further characterize the critical binding site, we determined subnanometer resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of HD 5 complexed with both neutralization-sensitive and-resistant HAdV chimeras.

40|$|Trans-{{membrane}} domains (TMDs) from single-spanning membrane proteins {{are commonly}} viewed as membrane anchors for functional domains. Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) exemplifies this concept, as it retains enzymatic function upon proteolytic {{release from the}} membrane. However, the subtype 1 NA TMDs have become increasingly more polar in human strains since 1918, which suggests that selection pressure exists on this domain. Here, we investigated the N 1 TMD-head domain relationship by exchanging a prototypical “old” TMD (1933) with a “recent” (2009), more polar TMD and an engineered hydrophobic TMD. Each exchange altered the TMD association, decreased the NA folding efficiency, and significantly reduced viral budding and replication at 37 °C compared to at 33 °C, at which NA folds more efficiently. Passaging the <b>chimera</b> <b>viruses</b> at 37 °C restored the NA folding efficiency, viral budding, and infectivity by selecting for NA TMD mutations that correspond with their polar or hydrophobic assembly properties. These results demonstrate that single-spanning membrane protein TMDs can influence distal domain folding, as well as membrane-related processes, and suggest the NA TMD in H 1 N 1 viruses has become more polar to maintain compatibility with the evolving enzymatic head domain...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFeline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) induces neurological abnormalities in domestic cats. Previously, we demonstrated that two disparate strains of FIV (FIV- 34 TF 10 and FIV-PPR) varied greatly {{in the ability}} to replicate in feline cortical astrocytes. To investigate the impact of the env region on the replication efficiency of these strains, we constructed two env <b>chimera</b> <b>viruses,</b> FIV- 34 TF 10 -PPRenv and FIV-PPR- 34 TF 10 env, to infect feline cortical astrocytes in vitro. Although all of these viruses infected cortical astrocytes, the efficiency of replication depended on strain, and the env region played an essential role. The viruses containing the env of 34 TF 10, FIV- 34 TF 10, and FIV-PPR- 34 TF 10 env had the greatest replication rate, whereas the viruses containing the env of PPR replicated at a lower level. Other viral regions had modulatory effects on the replication rate, with the FIV-PPR genome providing a slight replication advantage over the FIV- 34 TF 10 genome. We also monitored the effects of these viruses on an important astrocyte function, glutamate uptake; all viruses significantly decreased this activity, but only the viruses containing the env of PPR significantly impaired glutamate uptake without altering the culture viability. These results may be particularly relevant in the context of lentivirus-induced central nervous system disease in which a selective breakdown of astroglial function may contribute to neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{interactions}} between nucleocapsids and glycoproteins required for budding of alphaviruses, using Ross River virus-Sindbis <b>virus</b> <b>chimeras</b> {{in which the}} nucleocapsid protein is derived from one virus and the envelope glycoproteins are derived from the second virus. A virus containing the Ross River virus genome in which the capsid protein had been replaced with that from Sindbis virus was almost nonviable. Nucleocapsids formed in normal numbers in the infected cell, but very little virus {{was released from the}} cell. There are 11 amino acid differences between Ross River virus and Sindbis virus in their 33 -residue E 2 cytoplasmic domains. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to change 9 of these 11 amino acids in the chimera from the Ross River virus to the Sindbis virus sequence in an attempt to adapt the E 2 of the chimera to the nucleocapsid. The resulting mutant chimera grew 4 orders of magnitude better than the parental chimeric virus. This finding provides direct evidence for a sequence-specific interaction between the nucleocapsid and the E 2 cytoplasmic domain during virus budding. The mutated chimeric virus readily gave rise to large-plaque variants that grew almost as well as Ross River virus, suggesting that additional single amino acid substitutions in the structural proteins can further enhance the interactions between the disparate capsid and the glycoproteins. Unexpectedly, change of E 2 residue 394 from lysine (Ross River virus) to glutamic acid (Sindbis virus) was deleterious for the chimera, suggesting that in addition to its role in nucleocapsid-E 2 interactions, the N-terminal part of the E 2 cytoplasmic domain may be involved in glycoprotein-glycoprotein interactions required to assemble the glycoprotein spikes. The reciprocal <b>chimera,</b> Sindbis <b>virus</b> containing the Ross River virus capsid, also grew poorly.

40|$|Recent {{genome-wide}} screens {{have highlighted}} {{an important role}} for transportin 3 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection and preintegration complex (PIC) nuclear import. Moreover, HIV- 1 integrase interacted with recombinant transportin 3 protein under conditions whereby Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) integrase failed to do so, suggesting that integrase-transportin 3 interactions might underscore active retroviral PIC nuclear import. Here we correlate infectivity defects in transportin 3 knockdown cells with in vitro protein binding affinities for an expanded set of retroviruses that include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) to critically address the role of integrase-transportin 3 interactions in viral infection. Lentiviruses, {{with the exception of}} FIV, display a requirement for transportin 3 in comparison to MLV and RSV, yielding an infection-based dependency ranking of SIV > HIV- 1 > BIV and EIAV > MLV, RSV, and FIV. In vitro pulldown and surface plasmon resonance assays, in contrast, define a notably different integrase-transportin 3 binding hierarchy: FIV, HIV- 1, and BIV > SIV and MLV > EIAV. Our results therefore fail to support a critical role for integrase binding in dictating transportin 3 dependency during retrovirus infection. In addition to integrase, capsid has been highlighted as a retroviral nuclear import determinant. Accordingly, MLV/HIV- 1 <b>chimera</b> <b>viruses</b> pinpoint the genetic determinant of sensitization to transportin 3 knockdown to the HIV- 1 capsid protein. We therefore conclude that capsid, not integrase, is the dominant viral factor that dictates transportin 3 dependency during HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
40|$|Lentiviruses likely infect nondividing cells by commandeering host nuclear {{transport}} {{factors to}} facilitate the passage of their preintegration complexes (PICs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) within nuclear envelopes. Genome-wide small interfering RNA screens previously identified karyopherin β transportin- 3 (TNPO 3) and NPC component nucleoporin 153 (NUP 153) as being important for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). The knockdown of either protein significantly inhibited HIV- 1 infectivity, while infection by the gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) was unaffected. Here, we establish that primate lentiviruses are particularly sensitive to NUP 153 knockdown and investigate HIV- 1 -encoded elements that contribute to this dependency. Mutants lacking functional Vpr or the central DNA flap remained sensitive to NUP 153 depletion, while MLV/HIV- 1 <b>chimera</b> <b>viruses</b> carrying MLV matrix, capsid, or integrase became less sensitive when the latter two elements were substituted. Two capsid missense mutant viruses, N 74 D and P 90 A, were largely insensitive to NUP 153 depletion, as was wild-type HIV- 1 when cyclophilin A was depleted simultaneously or when infection was conducted {{in the presence of}} cyclosporine A. The codepletion of NUP 153 and TNPO 3 yielded synergistic effects that outweighed those calculated based on individual knockdowns, indicating potential interdependent roles for these factors during HIV- 1 infection. Quantitative PCR revealed normal levels of late reverse transcripts, a moderate reduction of 2 -long terminal repeat (2 -LTR) circles, and a relatively large reduction in integrated proviruses upon NUP 153 knockdown. These results suggest that capsid, likely by the qualities of its uncoating, determines whether HIV- 1 requires cellular NUP 153 for PIC nuclear import...|$|R
40|$|Chimeric mice {{generated}} with {{bone marrow}} from RelB-deficient (-/-), RelB-heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice {{were used to}} determine how total or partial absence of the transcription factor RelB in haematopoietic cells affects the immune response generated after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. In RelB(-/-) <b>chimeras,</b> early <b>virus</b> replication was enhanced and LCMV clearance was impaired. Although plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers were similar, serum interferon (IFN) -alpha levels in RelB(-/-) and RelB(+/-) chimeras were markedly lower than in RelB(+/+) chimeras during early LCMV infection. Further, both RelB(-/-) and RelB(+/-) chimeras mounted a lower-magnitude LCMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cell response than their RelB(+/+) counterparts, although the LCMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells present were differentiated into functional cytotoxic cells. In LCMV-infected RelB(-/-) mice, induction of cross-priming to an independently injected soluble protein, which depends on the IFN-alpha/beta made during the viral infection, was also impaired. Notably, provision of exogenous IFN-alpha did not restore the ability of RelB(-/-) mice to cross-prime. In summary, these results show that the RelB/NF-kappaB pathway is required for optimal IFN-alpha production after LCMV infection and suggest a crucial role for RelB in IFN-alpha-stimulated cross-priming of CD 8 (+) T cell responses...|$|R

Truncated gIII (i. e., lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region) was readily released from infected cells and was not detected on mature virus particles. In contrast, replacement of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with the carboxyl-terminal portion of hDAF restored the expression of gIII on the membranes of infected cells as well as on virion surfaces. The presence of the gIII. hDAF <b>chimera</b> on <b>virus</b> particles was also associated with normal gIII function, i. e., the mediation of virus attachment and penetration. The gIII-hDAF chimera, which is present on both infected cell surfaces and virions, could be cleaved by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicating that it was anchored in the membrane via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol. Our results from this study suggest that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the gIII molecule serve as a general membrane anchor, but they do not contain structural signals required for the specific assembly of envelope proteins into mature virions...|$|R

The prM and E proteins appeared to be properly processed and glycosylated, and in plaque reduction neutralization tests and other assays of antigenic specificity, the E proteins exhibited profiles which resembled those of the homologous dengue virus serotypes. Both chimeric viruses replicated in cell lines of vertebrate and mosquito origin to levels {{comparable to those of}} homologous dengue viruses but less efficiently than the YF 5. 2 iv parent. YFV/dengue- 4 virus, but not YFV/dengue- 2 virus, was neurovirulent for 3 -week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation; however, both viruses were attenuated when administered by the intraperitoneal route in mice of that age. Single-dose inoculation of either chimeric virus at a dose of 105 PFU by the intraperitoneal route induced detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against the homologous dengue virus strains. Mice which had been immunized in this manner were fully protected from challenge with homologous neurovirulent dengue viruses by intracerebral inoculation compared to unimmunized mice. Protection was associated with significant increases in geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody compared to those for unimmunized mice. These data indicate that YFV/dengue <b>virus</b> <b>chimeras</b> elicit antibodies which represent protective memory responses in the mouse model of dengue encephalitis.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) vpu protein increases the release of virus particles from infected cells. Mutations that abrogate vpu function {{have a profound effect}} on HIV- 1 replication in primary macrophage cultures. About 1. 24 % of primary isolates in the HIV databases have vpu start-codon mutations. In addition, the envelope of the AD 8 isolate was reported to compensate for the lack of vpu, whilst the YU- 2 virus (cloned directly from the brain tissue of an infected individual) is macrophage-tropic, despite having a vpu start-codon mutation. These observations raise the possibility that envelopes evolve to compensate for the loss of vpu function in vivo. Chimeric vpu+ and vpu- replication-competent clones were constructed that contained the envelopes of SF 162, AD 8 or YU- 2. Macrophages were infected with these <b>chimeras</b> and <b>virus</b> release was measured over time by a reverse transcriptase ELISA. It was found that vpu-deficient chimeras carrying AD 8 and YU- 2 envelopes were consistently released at lower levels than their wild-type (wt) vpu counterparts, indicating that these envelopes did not compensate for the lack of vpu. Non-chimeric vpu+ and vpu- AD 8 and YU- 2 followed similar patterns, although replication by vpu-deficient AD 8 was variable, with virion release reaching 60 % of that recorded for AD 8 with a wt vpu.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the surface of poliovirus type 1 can be extensively modified to incorporate antigenic domains from other poliovirus serotypes and from unrelated viruses. The fact that the modified (chimeric) viruses exhibit dual antigenicity and immunogenicity led us to explore {{the possibility of using}} the Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus type 1 as a vector for the presentation of antigenic domains from human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV- 16), a virus associated with the development of cervical carcinoma. We report here the construction and characterization of a chimeric poliovirus containing a 16 -residue sequence derived from the major capsid protein (L 1) of HPV- 16. This <b>virus</b> <b>chimera</b> stimulated the production in rabbits of antibodies which recognized the HPV- 16 -derived peptide and an L 1 fusion protein synthesized in Escherichia coli and detected HPV- 16 in human biopsy material by immunoperoxidase staining. The possibility that poliovirus-HPV chimeras could be used as vaccines against HPV- 16 is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{currently}} no effective AIDS vaccine, emphasizing {{the importance of}} developing alternative therapies. Recently, a patient was successfully transplanted with allogeneic, naturally resistant CCR 5 -negative (CCR 5 D 32) cells, {{setting the stage for}} transplantation of naturally resistant, or genetically modified stem cells as a viable therapy for AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using vectors that express various anti-HIV transgenes has also been attempted in clinical trials, but inefficient gene transfer in these studies has severely limited the potential of this approach. Here we evaluated HSC gene transfer of an anti-HIV vector in the pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model, which closely models human transplantation. Methods and Findings: We used lentiviral vectors that inhibited both HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) /HIV- 1 (SHIV) <b>chimera</b> <b>virus</b> infection, and also expressed a P 140 K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene to select gene-modified cells by adding chemotherapy drugs. Following transplantation and MGMT-mediated selection we demonstrated transgene expression in over 7 % of stem-cell derived lymphocytes. The high marking levels allowed us to demonstrate protection from SHIV in lymphocytes derived from gene-modified macaque long-term repopulating cells that expressed an HIV- 1 fusion inhibitor. We observed a statistically significant 4 -fold increase of gene-modified cells after challenge of lymphocytes from one macaque that received stem cells transduced with an anti-HIV vector (p, 0. 02, Student’...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChimeric cDNA clones, pMWE 1000 and pMWE 2000, differing by five {{nucleotides}} {{at their}} 5 ′ termini, were constructed of the 5 ′ {{two-thirds of the}} western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus genome (encoding nonstructural proteins) and the 3 ′ one-third of the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus genome (encoding structural proteins). The WEE virus sequences were derived from full-length cDNA clones, pWE 1000 and pWE 2000, which were isogenic except for five nucleotide differences at their 5 ′ termini and were responsible for significant differences in mouse virulence. Each cDNA clone was placed downstream from a T 7 promoter to allow in vitro transcription of full-length RNA. Transfection of BHK- 21 cells with the chimeric RNA by electroporation gave rise to high-titer infectious virus. The in vitro characteristics of each <b>chimera</b> <b>virus</b> were determined by electrophoretic analysis of its structural proteins, plaque morphology, neutralization characteristics, replication kinetics, and rate of viral RNA synthesis. With the exception of plaque morphology, the in vitro characteristics of MWE 1000 and MWE 2000 were indistinguishable from the parental EEE virus. Subcutaneous inoculation of 5 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice with varying doses of MWE 1000 or MWE 2000 virus demonstrated that both chimeric viruses were significantly attenuated compared to the parental WEE virus (Cba 87) and EEE virus (PE- 6). Animals infected with 105 PFU or more of either MWE 1000 or MWE 2000 were completely protected from lethal challenge with the virulent EEE virus, FL 91 - 4679, but were not protected from virulent WEE virus Cba 87 challenge. Construction of viable virus chimeras often results in attenuated viruses that may hold promise as genetically engineered alphavirus vaccine candidates (R. J. Kuhn, D. E. Griffin, K. E. Owen, H. G. M. Niesters, and J. H. Strauss, 1996, J. Virol. 70, 7900 – 7909) ...|$|E

We observed a statistically significant 4 -fold increase of gene-modified cells after challenge of lymphocytes from one macaque that received stem cells transduced with an anti-HIV vector (p< 0. 02, Student's t-test), but not in lymphocytes from a macaque that received a control vector. We also established a competitive repopulation assay in a second macaque for preclinical testing of promising anti-HIV vectors. The vectors we used were HIV-based and thus efficiently transduce human cells, and the transgenes we used target HIV- 1 genes that are also in SHIV, so our findings can be rapidly translated to the clinic. Here we demonstrate the ability to select protected HSC-derived lymphocytes in vivo in a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model of HIV/SHIV infection. This approach can now be evaluated in human clinical trials in AIDS lymphoma patients. In this patient setting, chemotherapy would not only kill malignant cells, but would also increase the number of MGMTP 140 K-expressing HIV-resistant cells. This approach should allow for high levels of HIV-protected cells in AIDS patients to evaluate AIDS gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{liver disease}} caused by {{infection}} with hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is an important}} global health problem that currently affects 170 million people. A major impediment in HCV research and drug development has been the lack of culture systems supporting virus production. This obstacle was recently overcome by using JFH 1 -based full-length genomes that allow production of viruses infectious both in vitro and in vivo. Although this improvement was important, because of the restriction to the JFH 1 isolate and a single chimera consisting of J 6 CF and JFH 1 -derived sequences, broadly based comparative studies between different HCV strains were not possible. Therefore, {{in this study we}} created a series of further chimeric genomes allowing production of infectious genotype (GT) 1 a, 1 b, 2 a, and 3 a particles. With the exception of the GT 3 a/JFH 1 <b>chimera,</b> efficient <b>virus</b> production was obtained when the genome fragments were fused via a site located right after the first transmembrane domain of NS 2. The most efficient construct is a GT 2 a/ 2 a chimera consisting of J 6 CF- and JFH 1 -derived sequences connected via this junction. This hybrid, designated Jc 1, yielded infectious titers 100 – to 1, 000 -fold higher than the parental isolate and all other chimeras, suggesting that determinants within the structural proteins govern kinetic and efficiency of virus assembly and release. Finally, we describe an E 1 -specific antiserum capable of neutralizing infectivity of all HCV chimeras...|$|R
40|$|An ideal vaccine {{delivery}} system would elicit persistent protection following a single administration, preferably by a noninvasive route, and be safe {{even in the}} face of immunosuppression, either inherited or acquired, of the recipient. We have exploited the unique life cycle of the autonomous parvoviruses to develop a nonproliferating vaccine platform that appears to both induce priming and continually boost a protective immune response following a single inoculation. A crippled parvovirus vector was constructed, based on a <b>chimera</b> between minute <b>virus</b> of mice (MVM) and LuIII, which expresses Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA) instead of its coat protein. The vector was packaged into an MVM lymphotropic capsid and inoculated into naive C 3 H/HeNcr mice. Vaccination with a single vector dose, either intravenously or intranasally, elicited high-titer anti-OspA-specific antibody that provided protection from live spirochete challenge and was sustained over the lifetime of the animal. Both humoral and cell-mediated Th 1 immunity was induced, as shown by anti-OspA immunoglobulin G 2 a antibody and preferential gamma interferon production by OspA-specific CD 4 + T cells...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of the relaxed-circular (RC) genome of hepadnaviruses is a multistep {{process that}} {{requires}} template switching during reverse transcription. Studies of duck hepatitis B virus indicated {{the presence of}} cis-acting sequences, distinct from the donor and acceptor sequences for the template switches, which contribute to the synthesis of RC DNA. However, knowledge about cis-acting requirements distinct from the donor and acceptor sites for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) was lacking. In this study, we searched for cis-acting sequences for synthesis of HBV RC DNA by analyzing a set of deletion variants that collectively represent most of the HBV genome. Sequences of epsilon, DR 1, DR 2, 5 ′r, and 3 ′r were not analyzed in the study. Results from Southern blotting showed that multiple cis-acting sequences {{were involved in the}} synthesis of HBV RC DNA. Analysis of several HBV/woodchuck hepatitis <b>virus</b> <b>chimeras</b> corroborated the findings from the analysis of deletion variants.
