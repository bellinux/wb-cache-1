40|$|Activation of the Escherichia coli malEp {{promoter}} {{relies on}} {{the formation of a}} higher order structure involving cooperative binding of MalT to promoter-proximal and promoter-distal sites as well as CRP binding to three sites located in between. MalT is the primary activator and one function of CRP is to facilitate cooperative binding of MalT to its cognate sites by bending the intervening DNA. It is shown here that CRP also participates directly in malEp activation. This function is carried out by the molecule of CRP bound to the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> centered at – 139. 5 (<b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> 3). This molecule of CRP recruits RNA polymerase by promoting the binding of the RNA polymerase α subunit C-terminal domain (αCTD) to DNA immediately downstream from <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> 3, via a contact between αCTD and activating region I of CRP.

40|$|Escherichia coli's cAMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP), {{the archetypal}} bacterial transcription factor, regulates {{over a hundred}} promoters by binding 22 bp symmetrical sites with the consensus core half-site TGTGA. However, Haemophilus influenzae has two types of <b>CRP</b> <b>sites,</b> one like E. coli's and one with the core sequence TGCGA that regulates genes required for DNA uptake (natural competence). Only the latter ‘CRP-S’ <b>sites</b> require both <b>CRP</b> and the coregulator Sxy for activation. To our knowledge, the TGTGA and TGCGA motifs are the first example of one transcription factor having two distinct binding-site motifs. Here we show that CRP-S promoters are widespread in the γ-proteobacteria and demonstrate their Sxy-dependence in E. coli. Orthologs of most H. influenzae CRP-S-regulated genes are ubiquitous in the five best-studied γ-proteobacteria families, Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae and Xanthomonadaceae. Phylogenetic footprinting identified CRP-S sites in the promoter regions of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae orthologs, and canonical <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> in orthologs of genes known to be Sxy-independent in H. influenzae.

We conducted a study to characterize and compare soil hydraulic properties on adjacent native grassland, cropland, and Conservation Reserve Program (<b>CRP)</b> <b>sites</b> at three locations in the Texas High Plains. A tension infiltrometer {{was used to measure}} unconfined, unsaturated infiltration over a range of water tensions (0. 05, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 kPa) at the soil surface. Intact soil cores were sampled within the Ap and Bt horizons to determine bulk density and water desorption curves, (h). Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity over the range of tensions K(h) was estimated using Wooding’s equation for steady state flow from a disk source. The van Genuchten-Mualem model was simultaneously fitted to K(h) and (h) data to obtain parameter values for each land use treatment. Mean near-saturated hydraulic conductivities of cropland were not significantly different from grassland. However, at 1. 5 kPa supply tension, cropped soils had a mean unsaturated conductivity four times greater than grassland. <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> had the lowest (P < 0. 05) near-saturated hydraulic conductivities, which suggests that, after 10 years, grasses had not fully ameliorated changes in pore structure caused by tillage. Results of a 10 -day simulation of evaporation from a bare soil suggest that the larger unsaturated conductivities measured for sweep-tilled cropland leads to increased evaporative losses of water as compared with other land uses.

Aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the potential of grass straws from conservation reserve program (CRP) lands as feedstocks for ethanol production. The CRP was initiated to ensure reduction in soil erosion with a concomitant improvement in water quality and aquatic habitats. Species and abundance of various grasses in <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> can vary substantially. Ethanol yield from biomass is directly correlated to sugar content among other factors. It therefore becomes important to study the variability in the biomass composition from different <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> to reliably estimate biofuel production potential. Grass samples were collected from five fields contracted to CRP in Umatilla County in Northeastern Oregon. Composition of these samples was experimentally determined and was statistically verified to be similar for most of the sites. Sugar content was highest (60. 70 %) and statistically different for only one site (CRA 8. 2). Our results suggest that biomass harvested from different sites did not significantly vary in terms of their chemical composition and therefore could be used in a single integrated process to produce bioethanol. Total potential ethanol yield from various CRP lands in Oregon, assuming a 10 yr harvesting frequency, was estimated to be 40 x 10 (6) 1 of ethanol (28. 5 - 53. 7 x 10 (6) 1 /yr) with current management practices subject to other constraints.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the stoichiometry of CRP binding to various DNA fragments carrying the lac, malT or gal promoters {{in the presence}} of cAMP, using a gel electrophoresis method. In each case, one dimer of CRP binds to the functional <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> upstream of the transcription start. At the lac promoter, a second CRP dimer can bind to the operator region. Direct binding analysis and competition experiments performed at 200 microM cAMP allow us to measure the affinity of CRP for these different sites and to correlate them with variations in the consensus sequences, already proposed. The order is lac greater than malT greater than gal greater than lac operator greater than lac L 8 much greater than non specific sites. No strong coupling exists between the two lac sites when on the same fragment. Conversely, we have studied, at constant CRP concentrations, the cAMP levels required to obtain half maximal binding to a particular DNA site : the required cAMP level increases inversely as the affinity for CRP. These variations may account for the differential activation of various cAMP sensitive operons in vivo. Anomalies in the migrations of the 1 : 1 complexes between CRP and DNA have been analysed and related to the size and to the position of the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> in the fragment. The electrophoretic mobility of the complexes depends not only {{on the size of the}} fragment but on the position of the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> : the mobility is lower when CRP binds near the center of the fragment. This effect is due to a clear change in the persistence length of the DNA induced by CRP binding.

Insertions or deletions of non-integral helical turns, which displace the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> onto the opposite face of DNA helix compared to the original promoter, eliminated completely the activation of transcription. In contrast, changing the spacer length by integral helical turns allowed the promoter to respond to CRP, although the degree of activation varied with the length of the spacer.

40|$|Maximum {{expression}} of the adjacent but divergently transcribed araBAD operon and araC gene requires the presence of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). DNase I protection studies have previously revealed a high-affinity CRP-binding site in the ara regulatory region. Deletion mutations introduced into this site resulted in reduced {{expression of}} araBAD and araC. However, other experiments have demonstrated that spacing changes in the ara regulatory region may have multiple effects due to disruption of a DNA loop. Thus, the deletions could have destroyed the CRP-binding site, the ability to form a loop, or both. In the present study, substitution mutations were introduced into the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> {{in order to avoid}} creating spacing changes. We found that a 3 -base-pair substitution resulted in a 30 % reduction in araBAD expression, whereas a 6 -base-pair substitution resulted in an 80 % reduction.

We have previously identified 13 H. influenzae <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> that differ from canonical (CRP-N) sites in the following features: (1) Both half-sites of these noncanonical (CRP-S) sites have C 6 instead of T 6, although they otherwise have an unusually high level of identity with the binding site consensus. (2) Only promoters with CRP-S sites require both the CRP and Sxy proteins for transcription activation. To study the functional significance of CRP-S site sequences, we purified H. influenzae (Hi) CRP and compared its DNA binding properties {{to those of the}} well-characterized E. coli (Ec) CRP. All EcCRP residues that contact DNA are conserved in HiCRP, and both proteins demonstrated a similar high affinity for the CRP-N consensus sequence. However, whereas EcCRP bound specifically to CRP-S sites in vitro, HiCRP did not. By systematically substituting base pairs in native promoters and in the CRP-N consensus sequence, we confirmed that HiCRP is highly specific for the perfect core sequence T 4 G 5 T 6 G 7 A 8 and is more selective than EcCRP at other positions in <b>CRP</b> <b>sites.</b> Even though converting C 6 →T 6 greatly enhanced HiCRP binding to a CRP-S site, this had the unexpected effect of nearly abolishing promoter activity.

Expression of cya was reduced about fourfold in cultures grown in acetate minimal medium as compared to cultures grown in glucose- 6 -phosphate minimal medium. Expression of cya was also reduced about fourfold by addition of 5 mM cAMP to cultures grown in glucose minimal medium. We constructed in vitro deletion and insertion mutations altering a major cya promoter (P 2) and a putative <b>CRP</b> binding <b>site</b> overlapping P 2. These mutations were recombined into the chromosome by allele replacement with M 13 mp::cya recombinant phages and the regulation of the mutant promoters was analyzed.

This mutant retained a Cya(+) phenotype. Taken together, the results establish that the cya gene is transcribed from multiple promoters one of which, P 2, is negatively regulated by the cAMP-CRP complex.

We show here that one can successfully replace all of the <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> by the binding site of another DNA-bending protein, integration host factor, or by a sequence-directed bend without altering the process of malKp activation. This observation indicates that CRP action at malKp does not involve critical interactions with MalT and that CRP promotes MalT repositioning primarily through DNA bending.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a number of {{mutations}} in the E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) have been determined by monitoring the in vivo expression and in vitro open complex formation at two semi-synthetic promoters that are totally CRP-dependent. At one promoter the CRP-binding site is centered around 41. 5 base pairs upstream from the transcription start whilst at the other promoter it is 61. 5 base pairs upstream. The CRP mutation E 171 K reduces expression from both promoters whilst H 159 L renders CRP totally inactive: neither mutation stops CRP binding at either promoter. The mutations K 52 N and K 52 Q reverse the effect of H 159 L and 'reeducate' CRP to activate transcription. CRP carrying both H 159 L and K 52 N activates transcription from the promoter with the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> at - 41. 5 better than wild type CRP. In sharp contrast, this doubly changed CRP is totally inactive with respect to the activation of transcription from the promoter carrying the <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> at - 61. 5.

40|$|The {{divergent}} structural operons caiTABCDE and fixABCX of Escherichia coli {{are required}} for anaerobic carnitine metabolism. Transcriptional monocopy lacZ fusion studies showed that both operons are coexpressed during anaerobic growth {{in the presence of}} carnitine, respond to common environmental stimuli (like glucose and nitrate), and are modulated positively by the same general regulators, CRP and FNR, and negatively by H-NS. Overproduction of the CaiF specific regulatory protein mediating the carnitine signal restored induction in an fnr mutant, corresponding to its role as the primary target for anaerobiosis. Transcript analysis identified two divergent transcription start points initiating 289 bp apart. DNase I footprinting revealed three sites with various affinities for the binding of the cAMP-CRP complex inside this regulatory region. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that previously reported perfect CRP motif 1, centered at − 41. 5 of the cai transcriptional start site, plays a direct role in the sole cai activation. In contrast, mutation in <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> 2, positioned at − 69. 5 of the fix promoter, caused only a threefold reduction in fix expression. Thus, the role of the third <b>CRP</b> <b>site,</b> located at − 126. 5 of fix, might be to reinforce the action of site 2.

Here, we further investigated our previous finding that rhaS deletion resulted in a threefold increase in rhaSR promoter activity, suggesting RhaS negative autoreg-ulation of rhaSR. We found that RhaS autoregulation required the cyclic AMP receptor protein (<b>CRP)</b> binding <b>site</b> at rhaSR and that RhaS was able to bind to the RhaR binding site at rhaSR. In contrast to the expected repression, we found that in the absence of both RhaR and the <b>CRP</b> binding <b>site</b> at the rhaSR promoter, RhaS activated expression to a level comparable with RhaR activation of the same promoter. However, when the promoter included the RhaR and <b>CRP</b> binding <b>sites,</b> the level of activation by RhaS and CRP was much lower than that by RhaR and CRP, suggesting that CRP could not fully coactivate with RhaS. Taken together, our results indicate that RhaS negative autoregulation involves RhaS competition with RhaR for binding to the RhaR binding site at rhaSR. Although RhaS and RhaR activate rhaSR transcription to similar levels, CRP cannot effectively coactivate with RhaS. Therefore, once RhaS reaches a relatively high protein concentration, presumably sufficient to saturate the RhaS-activated promoters, there will be a decrease in rhaSR transcrip-tion.

A key event {{in the evolution of}} the highly virulent plague bacterium Yersinia pestis was the acquisition of plasmid pPCP 1, which carries the plasminogen activator gene, pla. This promoted the bubonic form of the disease by increasing bacterial dissemination from flea bite sites and incidentally enhanced replication in respiratory airways during pneumonic infection. We determined that expression of pla is controlled by the global regulator cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp). This transcription factor is well conserved among distantly related bacteria, where it acts as a soluble receptor for the ubiquitous signaling molecule cAMP and controls a global network of metabolic and stress-protective genes. Crp has a similar physiological role in Y. pestis since loss of its function resulted in an inability to metabolize a variety of nonglucose substrates. Activation of pla expression requires a transcription activation element of the pla promoter that serves as a <b>Crp</b> binding <b>site.</b> <b>Crp</b> interaction with this site was demonstrated to occur only in the presence of cAMP. Alteration of the <b>Crp</b> binding <b>site</b> nucleotide sequence prevented in vitro formation of Crp-DNA complexes and inhibited in vivo expression of pla.

Expression of the yiaK-S operon is controlled in the wild-type strain by a repressor encoded by yiaJ. No inducer molecule of the yiaK-S operon has been identified among over 80 carbohydrate or derivative compounds tested, the system being expressed only in a mutant strain lacking the YiaJ repressor. The lacZ transcriptional fusions in the genetic background of the mutant strain revealed that yiaK-S is modulated by the integration host factor and by the cyclic AMP (cAMP) -cAMP receptor protein (Crp) activator complex. A twofold increase in the induction was observed during anaerobic growth, which was independent of ArcA or Fnr. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the YiaJ repressor binds to a promoter fragment extending from − 50 to + 121. These studies also showed that the cAMP-Crp complex can bind to two different sites. The lacZ transcriptional fusions of different fragments of the promoter demonstrated that binding of cAMP-Crp to the <b>Crp</b> <b>site</b> 1, centered at − 106, is essential for yiaK-S expression.

40|$|The {{structure}} of complexes formed between cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and various restriction fragments from the promoter {{region of the}} lactose operon has been analysed by measurements of electrodichroism. Binding of CRP to a 62 -bp fragment containing the major site leads to an increase of the rotation time constant from 0. 33 to 0. 43 microseconds; addition of cAMP to the complex induces a decrease to 0. 25 microseconds. Similar data are obtained for a 80 -bp fragment containing the operator site; however, {{in this case the}} decrease of the rotation time for the specific complex is only observed when the salt concentration is increased from 3 to 13 mM. A 203 -bp fragment containing both sites showed a corresponding change after pre-incubation at 50 mM salt. The salt dependence of the rotation time for the specific complex formed with the 203 -bp fragment also indicates that a compact structure is formed at 13 mM salt, whereas the structure is not as compact at 3 mM salt.

The rotation time constants together with the dichroism amplitudes indicate that binding of <b>CRP</b> to specific <b>sites</b> in the presence of cAMP leads to the formation of compact structures, which are consistent with bending of DNA helices. The observed strong salt dependence of the structure is apparently due to electrostatic repulsion between adjoining helix segments...|$|R
40|$|Glucose causes catabolite {{repression}} {{by lowering the}} intracellular levels of both cAMP and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) in Escherichia coli. The molecular mechanism underlying the down-regulation of CRP by glucose has been investigated. We show that glucose lowers the level of crp mRNA without affecting its stability. Replacement of the crp promoter with the bla promoter almost completely abolishes the glucose-mediated regulation of crp expression. Only a slight reduction in the crp expression by glucose is observed in cya- or crp- strains, suggesting that a CRP-cAMP complex is needed for this regulation. We previously showed that transcription of the crp gene is regulated both negatively and positively. Positive autoregulation of crp {{is caused by the}} binding of CRP-cAMP to the <b>CRP</b> binding <b>site</b> II located upstream of the crp promoter. Here we show that disrupting the <b>CRP</b> binding <b>site</b> II essentially eliminates the down-regulation of crp expression by glucose. We conclude that the autoregulatory circuit of the crp gene {{plays a key role in}} the down-regulation of CRP by glucose...|$|R

Its destruction {{has been accompanied by}} a similar decline in grassland passerines. Over the past 12 years, tallgrass habitat has been restored to a minor extent by the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). This paper presents data on passerine populations on CRP land and conventional no-till farmland in Whiteside County, Illinois. Data were collected using the line transect method developed by Emlen (1971). Collectively, the <b>CRP</b> <b>sites</b> had greater species densities and total number of species than the conventional no-till sites. Three distinct types of bird populations were identified: grassland, farmland, and edge species. The grassland species appear to be extremely dependent on the CRP as a habitat source since without the CRP, grassland passerines would have been absent from this study. It is concluded that certain CRP plantings may provide habitat similar to that {{of the native}} tallgrass prairie and consequently support populations of small grassland birds. M. S.

40|$|Five minicircles of 284 bp were {{constructed}} {{with a reporter}} sequence located approximately opposite a CRP binding site. The spacing between {{the center of the}} <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> and this sequence is varied within 1. 2 helical turns. The reactivity of the reference sequence to DNAse I was determined on the minicircles and on the corresponding fragments, in both the absence and presence of CRP. A rigorous mathematical analysis of the data shows that in the absence of CRP no preferred rotational orientation of the DNA is observed. In contrast, binding of CRP fixes, in a phase-dependent manner, the rotational orientation of the reporter sequence in the minicircles. This result illustrates the transmission at a distance along the DNA molecule of a structural modification. Such effects modulate the extent of synergy between activators and polymerases during the initiation of transcription...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure runoff, erosion, and soil quality characteristics of a site in southwestern Oklahoma the first year following conversion from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Treatments included undisturbed CRP, Old World bluestem (Bothriochlora ischaemum L.), no-till wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and conservation-till wheat. Significant differences in surface cover were found between each of the experimental treatments, with values ranging from 100 % on the undisturbed <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> to 42 % for the conservation-till treatment. No significant difference in runoff was found among the various experimental treatments. The Old World bluestem and winter wheat treatments had only minimal erosion during the first year following conversion from the CRP. Production of Old World bluestem maintained levels of soil quality {{similar to those of the}} undisturbed CRP. Conversion of this CRP area to winter wheat production significantly reduced biological nutrient reserves, suggesting a degradation of soil quality. If this trend continues, long term productivity and the quality of air and water resources at this site could be affected...|$|E
40|$|The binding of the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP) to {{its specific}} {{site on the}} P 4 promoter of pBR 322 has been studied by gel electrophoresis. Binding to the P 4 site was about 40 - 50 -fold weaker than to the principal <b>CRP</b> <b>site</b> on the lactose promoter at both low (0. 01 M) and high (0. 1 M) ionic strengths. CRP-induced bending at the P 4 site was investigated from the mobilities of CRP bound to circularly permuted P 4 fragments. The estimated bending angle, based on comparison with Zinkel & Crothers [(1990) Biopolymers 29, 29 - 38] A-tract bending standards, {{was found to be}} approximately 96 degrees, similar to that found for binding to the lac site. These observations suggest {{that there is not a}} simple relationship between strength of CRP binding and the extent of induced bending for different CRP sites. The apparent centre of bending in P 4 is displaced about 6 - 8 bp away from the conserved TGTGA sequence and the P 4 transcription start site...|$|E
40|$|Polyacrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} {{has been used}} to visualise and quantitate complexes between the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and DNA fragments containing the promoter region of either the E. coli galactose or lactose operons. We show that, although CRP binding to the gal fragment is weaker than binding to the lac fragment, in each case, stable complexes are formed between one dimer of CRP and one molecule of DNA. We have examined the effects of a series of deletions and point mutations in the gal promoter region on CRP binding. From the position of deletions and mutations which prevent the formation of stable complexes, we deduce the location and extent of the sequence at the <b>CRP</b> binding <b>site.</b> We show that it covers approximately the same length of sequence as the binding site at the lac promoter. Unlike the lac site, the gal site contains no palindromic sequence. We discuss the importance of symmetry in the sequence at <b>CRP</b> binding <b>sites</b> and the validity of CRP binding consensus sequences which have been proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cyclic AMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP), {{also known}} as {{catabolite gene activator protein}} (CAP), is an important transcriptional regulator widely distributed in many bacteria. The biological processes under the regulation of CRP are highly diverse among different groups of bacterial species. Elucidation of CRP regulons in cyanobacteria will further our understanding of the physiology and ecology of this important group of microorganisms. Previously, CRP has been experimentally studied in only two cyanobacterial strains: Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120; therefore, a systematic genome-scale study of the potential CRP target genes and binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes is urgently needed. Results We have predicted and analyzed the <b>CRP</b> binding <b>sites</b> and regulons in 12 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using a highly effective cis -regulatory binding site scanning algorithm. Our results show that cyanobacterial <b>CRP</b> binding <b>sites</b> are very similar to those in E. coli; however, the regulons are very different from that of E. coli. Furthermore, CRP regulons in different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes are also highly diversified, ranging from photosynthesis, carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation, to chemotaxis and signal transduction. In addition, our prediction indicates that crp genes in modern cyanobacteria are likely inherited from a common ancestral gene in their last common ancestor, and have adapted various cellular functions in different environments, while some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes as well as <b>CRP</b> binding <b>sites</b> during the course of evolution. Conclusion The CRP regulons in cyanobacteria are highly diversified, probably as a result of divergent evolution to adapt to various ecological niches. Cyanobacterial CRPs may function as lineage-specific regulators participating in various cellular processes, and are important in some lineages. However, they are dispensable in some other lineages. The loss of CRPs in these species leads to the rapid loss of their binding sites in the genomes. </p...|$|R
