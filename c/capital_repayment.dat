While announcements as well as <b>capital</b> <b>repayments</b> may provoke positive wealth effects and a decrease in bank risk, equity capital injections to banks are observed to be a severe impediment to restore market confidence and financial stability. Furthermore, while TARP announcements and capital injections may increase systemic risk, no significant effect on systemic risk is found for <b>capital</b> <b>repayments...</b>|$|R

40|$|The latest global {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the need for}} financial services firms to adopt comprehensive risk management techniques to identify, manage and mitigate risks promptly and efficiently. To this end, a key risk management tool is to hold sufficient capital to back the risks a business is running. In recent times, financial services regulators have also initiated a move towards risk-based economic capital approach with different regulations for banks (Basel 2 and 3) and insurance firms (Solvency 2). In this paper, a generic definition of economic capital is proposed using a stochastic approach, which is then used to quantify economic capital for a <b>capital</b> <b>repayment</b> mortgage, a lifetime mortgage, a life insurance annuity and a conglomerate operating a range of financial services.

50|$|Negative gearing {{is a form}} of {{financial}} leverage whereby an investor borrows money to acquire an income-producing investment property and expects the gross income generated by the investment, {{at least in the short}} term, to be less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including depreciation and interest charged on the loan (but excluding <b>capital</b> <b>repayments).</b> The investor may enter into such an arrangement and expect the tax benefits (if any) and the capital gain on the investment, when the investment is ultimately disposed of, to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is tax-deductible against the investor's other taxable income and if the capital gain on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment. Some countries, including Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other OECD countries, including the US, Germany, Sweden, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. In Canada, losses cannot be offset against wages or salaries. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the UK or the Netherlands. With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as stamp duties and capital gains tax may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.|$|R
