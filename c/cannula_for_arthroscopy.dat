30|$|Introduction: The {{physical}} structure {{and design of}} <b>cannulas</b> used <b>for</b> peritoneal access determine the distribution and parameters of gas flow. To date all <b>cannulas</b> <b>for</b> laparoscopic gas delivery are hollow tubes with gas entering the top and exiting the bottom. The side walls are continuous uninterrupted and smooth creating a characteristic physical and gas distribution signature due to its design. It was hypothesized that a newly designed cannula with perforations would show a difference.|$|R
30|$|Of note, {{predicting}} the cardiac output {{required to maintain}} tissue perfusion potentially during CPB is challenging. Usually, the flow on CPB {{is based on the}} cardiac index of 2.0 – 2.5  L/min/m 2 using BSA computed by various formulas and nomograms. However, none of the formulas is validated for patients with achondroplasia. In addition, the size of various <b>cannulas</b> <b>for</b> conducting CPB remains unclear. To date, four case reports have described the size of the cannula in adult patients with achondroplasia [6 – 9]. Scafuri et al. used a pediatric <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> aortic valve replacement with root enlargement in a 56 -year-old woman with achondroplasia; however, they encountered no problem during CPB [6]. Other studies have reported using adult <b>cannulas</b> <b>for</b> the repair of type A aortic dissection [7], aortic valve replacement [8], and pulmonary endarterectomy [9]. Despite no consensus on this matter, an adult cannulation can often be performed successfully and should be considered given that these studies reportedly mentioned increasing their CPB flow to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. In our case, we adjusted the flow rate by monitoring the perfusion parameters such as lactate, SvO 2, or cerebral rSO 2. Overall, our patient responded well to CPB.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) {{syndrome is}} recognized {{as a cause of}} hip ailments in young and middle aged adults, and the number of hip arthroscopies treating FAI syndrome has increased. There is no evidence for better results after hip arthroscopy compared to conservative treatment. There is a large heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and criteria <b>for</b> hip <b>arthroscopy</b> treating FAI syndrome. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to compare patient characteristics and function among patients with FAI syndrome eligible <b>for</b> hip <b>arthroscopy</b> to those eligible for conservative treatment. Method: This is a cross sectional study including female and male participants who were diagnosed with FAI syndrome and eligible <b>for</b> either hip <b>arthroscopy</b> (N= 19) or conservative treatment (N= 24). Baseline data from a hip arthroscopy cohort study and a conservative pilot RCT treating FAI syndrome were used. Patient characteristics, symptoms (pain), function, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging were compared between groups. Results: We found no significant differences in patient characteristics, hip range of motion (ROM) or hip muscle strength between groups for involved leg. The arthroscopy group revealed significantly lower HOOS sport and recreational score, and performed worse on single leg hop distance. Conclusion: Patient characteristics do not differ between patients with FAI syndrome eligible <b>for</b> hip <b>arthroscopy</b> and those eligible for conservative treatment.

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of knee-injuries in Dutch general practice, with an incidence of acute meniscal injury of 2 per 1000 patients. The menisci are structures in the knee joints, whose principal functions are load transmission and shock absorption. Tearing of the meniscus can occur after abnormal rotational force in the weight-bearing knee or gradually if there are degenerative changes of the meniscal tissue. The management of meniscal tears can be conservative (mainly strengthening of leg-muscles to create stability in the knee joint) or surgical by arthroscopy (repair, resection, transplantation). The Dutch Orthopedic Society initiated the development of a Dutch guideline <b>for</b> <b>arthroscopy</b> of the knee joint. Since 2009 the University Medical Centre Groningen has streamlined the treatment of knee-injuries in the so called ‘Meniscusstraat’. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if the management of patients of the ‘Meniscusstraat’ is according to the Dutch guideline <b>for</b> <b>arthroscopy</b> of the knee joint and whether or not there have been unnecessary arthroscopies and/or MRI’s. Methods: In this retrospective case-referent study, the visits of the first 150 unique patients of the ‘Meniscusstraat’ in 2011 were assessed. Each visit was assigned to a group (watchful waiting, conservative, MRI, arthroscopy), based on the actual management path (observed group). With information from the medical charts the visits were then reassessed based on the recommendations from the Dutch guideline <b>for</b> <b>arthroscopy</b> of the knee joint, and assigned to 1 of the 4 management path groups (virtual group). If the observed and the virtual management path were similar, it was considered to be according to the guideline. Information about the radiological findings from MRI’s and indications <b>for</b> <b>arthroscopies</b> and given treatment were gathered for evaluation. Results: Of the 241 assessed visits, 211 were according to the guideline. Statistical analysis with Pearson’s Chi-Square test showed this difference was significant (P = 0. 000). MR-imaging was requested by the ‘Meniscusstraat’ in 73 cases, of which 50 (68. 5 %) showed intra articular injury. In this study 45 patients underwent an arthroscopy, a meniscal tear was the most common indication (39 / 86. 7 %), the most common therapy given was a meniscectomy (31 / 68. 9 %) and in 10 (20. 2 %) cases there was no therapy given. Discussion: The statistical analysis shows that the ‘Meniscusstraat’ does not adhere to the Dutch guideline <b>for</b> <b>arthroscopy</b> of the knee joint. However, closer inspection of the largest contributors reveals that these results are clouded by the fact that some decisions made by the physician are because a patients’ wishes and the patient-tailored approach of the ‘Meniscusstraat’. The number of unnecessary performed MRI’s and arthroscopies are within the expected range. Because of the retrospective design of this study, assessment of the visits was limited. This study should therefore be considered explorative in nature, a more standardized assessment of the visits is needed to formulate a reliable conclusion. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transanal {{endoscopic}} microsurgery is a {{safe and}} efficacious surgical approach for local excision of benign adenomas and early-stage rectal cancer. However, utilization of the technique has been limited due to the unavailability of high-priced specialized instrumentation at many institutions and the technically demanding training required. To avoid these obstacles, we have explored an alternative approach called Transanal Endoscopic Video-Assisted excision, which combines the merits of singleport access and local transanal excision. Methods: A disposable single-incision port is inserted into the anal canal for transanal access. The port contains 3 <b>cannulae</b> <b>for</b> introducing instrumentation into the rectal lumen, and a supplementary <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> carbon dioxide insufflation. Pneumorectum results in rectal distention and optimizes the visual field during the procedure. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation is utilized for visualization and transanal excision of rectal pathologies. Conclusions: Transanal endoscopic video-assisted excision is an innovative approach to local excision of benign and malignant rectal lesions. The approach averts several of the pitfalls commonly experienced with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Continued investigation and development of this novel modality will be important in establishing its role in minimally invasive surgery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Inhalation of {{nitric oxide}} with oxygen {{could be a}} {{promising}} treatment in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. However, the current methods of delivery of NO are cumbersome and unsuitable for long term use. The present study was undertaken to investigate the safety and efficacy of a mixture of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen administered via a nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours in patients with oxygen dependent COPD.  METHODS—Twenty five parts per million (ppm) of NO was administered by inhalation combined with supplemental oxygen at a flow rate of 2 l/min via a nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours to 11 ambulatory men with stable, oxygen dependent COPD. Room air with supplemental oxygen at 2 l/min was administered in an identical manner for another 24 hours as control therapy in a randomised, double blind, crossover fashion to all patients. Pulmonary function tests, exercise tolerance, dyspnoea grade, and lung volumes were measured at baseline, 24, and 48 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), arterial blood gas tensions, and minute ventilation were measured at baseline, after 30 minutes and 24 hours of breathing NO and oxygen. Venous admixture ratio (Qs/Qt) and dead space ratio (Vd/Vt) were also calculated. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and NO in the inhaled and ambient air were monitored continuously. Differences in pulmonary function, arterial blood gas tensions, pulmonary haemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and dyspnoea between oxygen and NO breathing periods were analysed for significance using paired t tests.  RESULTS—A significant (p< 0. 05) fall was observed in PVR (183. 1 (116. 05) and 137. 2 (108. 4) dynes. s. cm- 3 before and after breathing NO for 24 hours, respectively) with NO administration without significant changes in symptoms, pulmonary function, arterial oxygen tension, or exercise tolerance.  CONCLUSIONS—NO at a concentration of 25 ppm blended with oxygen can be safely administered by nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours without significant adverse effects and lowers PVR in stable patients with COPD receiving long term oxygen therapy. ...|$|R
