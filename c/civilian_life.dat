5|$|Combined Operations {{examined}} {{a number of}} options while planning {{the destruction of the}} dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties. This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of <b>civilian</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Families at {{the base}} {{were able to take}} {{advantage}} of many of the opportunities that the facility provided for them, as life at Loring was not all military-related. Although Loring was constructed with support facilities including a hospital, chapel, and schools, other forms of <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> were added over the years as well.|$|E

Hugh Cott was an exception, being an expert in animal camouflage with his then recently published textbook, Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), a book that had the distinction of being popularly carried for practical advice by army officers.|$|E

2500|$|But the city's image wasn't {{negative}} in everyone's view. American diplomat Charles Dunbar {{said that the}} Soviet troops' presence was [...] "surprisingly modest". He said in a July 1983 article that whilst Soviet troops are a common sight, they [...] "do not {{give the impression of}} invaders who are enforcing their occupation at the point of a bayonet". Soviet men and women were very common in the city's shopping roads, with the large availability of Western products. An December 1983 article from Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where the author stayed two weeks in the city, said that the Soviet soldiers had a friendly atmosphere in which they would greet friends and have a chat with the population. Most Soviet civilians (numbering between 8,000 and 10,000) lived in the north eastern Makroyan (microraion) suburb, in an apartment housing complex. It was surrounded by barbed-wire and armed tanks, for their safety. The residents were often unsafe when walking through the streets, receiving verbal abuse, rude gestures and even kidnappings from anti-PDPA/anti-Soviet Afghan <b>civilians.</b> <b>Life</b> for PDPA politicians and their families were also insecure. The city's population increased from around 500,000 in 1978 to 2million in 1988, due to rural refugees but also the return of Afghan refugees from neighboring Pakistan and Iran under President Najibullah, who came into power in 1985.|$|R
50|$|The privations of {{the home}} front are seen to have rearranged the social {{hierarchy}} as stately homes are requisioned by {{the armed forces and}} individuals like Widmerpool, propelled by force of will, take charge.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that an elaborated military pastoral care provided {{a significant contribution}} to the efficiency of the Swedish army during the Great Northern War (1700 – 1721). Usually battle preparations and the chaplains’ efforts to instil morale and discipline among the soldiers are emphasized. In this article my aim is to provide a somewhat different idea {{on the nature of the}} religious life in the army of Charles XII. By focusing in turn on the chaplains’ duties, the military sermons, the hymns sung in the army and the soldiers’ reading of prayer books, I point at the similarities between military and <b>civilian</b> religious <b>life</b> in early 18 th-century Sweden...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, the {{demobilisation}} process {{began and}} slowly the battalion's numbers began to dwindle as its personnel were repatriated back to Australia and returned to <b>civilian</b> <b>life.</b> The 23rd Battalion was disbanded in Belgium on 30 April 1919. Throughout its service during the war, it suffered 686 killed and 2,317 wounded (including gassed). For its involvement during the war, the 23rd Battalion received a total of 19 battle honours; these were bestowed upon the battalion in 1927.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to <b>civilian</b> <b>life,</b> Horne resumed working at Triplex, and was {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} sales director.

He combined his two roles by working full-time, and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends.|$|E
5|$|Osborn {{returns in}} Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown {{up at the}} end of the issue.

However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|E
5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in <b>civilian</b> <b>life.</b> They were denied {{the benefits of the}} G.I. Bill by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E
5000|$|The Democratic National Union Movement (DNUM) is a Cambodian {{political}} party founded after senior Khmer Rouge official Ieng Sary's defection from the Cambodian National Unity Party in August 1996. A magazine entitled Phka Rik (Flower in Bloom) {{is associated with}} it. It was created primarily to facilitate Ieng Sary's reentry into <b>civilian</b> political <b>life,</b> claiming neutrality {{and that he had}} broken away from the Khmer Rouge and from the [...] "fascism and cruelty of Pol Pot's regime," [...] naming Nuon Chea, Ta Mok, Son Sen and Yun Yat as Pol Pot's cohorts and [...] "mass murderers of Cambodia."

After {{attending}} St. John's College in Winnipeg, he took {{a position in the}} employ of the Cockshutt Plow Company as a clerk.

50|$|International aid: the Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Order of St John {{is engaged}} in 30 {{countries}} of the world. Medical treatment is thereby based {{on the experience of}} Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe in Germany.

The focus remains on basic health care for people in areas affected by disasters and otherwise aggrieved regions of the world. Together with Cyprus Civil Defense the European Technical Assistance Cooperation ist formed. Its purpose is to operate a Technical Assistance and Support Team.|$|R
5|$|Skipper Thomas Crisp VC, DSC, RNR (28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917) was an English posthumous {{recipient}} of the Victoria Cross.

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> was {{facilitated by}} {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for <b>civilian</b> <b>life.</b> Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
