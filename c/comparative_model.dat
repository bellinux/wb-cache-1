50|$|A <b>comparative</b> <b>model</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} for the 3D protein structure of TmTx by using information from homologous proteins with known structures. Based on this model, it is highly likely that TmTx blocks calcium activated potassium channels by binding to the S5-S6 segment and thus blocking its pore. The active site of TmTx in this model consists of 5 amino acids, which {{is essential for the}} activity of TmTx. These amino acids would be responsible for inhibiting transport of ions. On the other hand, TmTx does not seem to inhibit 125I apamin binding to synaptic membranes in the rat brain or ionomycin-induced 86Rb+ fluxes in C6 cells in vitro. This suggests that TmTx does not have an effect on SK channels or charybdotoxin-sensitive IK channels (calcium-activated potassium channel), respectively. Another suggested target is the Kv1.6 channel, a voltage-gated potassium channel. There are two suggestions for the mode of action. Either it works via blocking the open channel, or there could be a modulation of slow inactivation of this channel. Upon wash, a complete reversal of the block occurred, suggesting that the binding of the toxin to the channel is not very strong.|$|E

In the last two decades, significant {{progress has been made}} on <b>comparative</b> <b>modeling</b> methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Although <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> is {{routinely}} {{used to produce}} three-dimensional models of proteins, very few automated approaches are formulated {{in a way that}} allows inclusion of restraints derived from experimental data as well as those from the structures of homologues. Furthermore, proteins are usually described as a single conformer, rather than an ensemble that represents the heterogeneity and inaccuracy of experimentally determined protein structures. Here we address these issues by exploring the application of the restraint-based conformational space search engine, RAPPER, which has previously been developed for rebuilding experimentally defined protein structures and for fitting models to electron density derived from X-ray diffraction analyses. Results A new application of RAPPER for <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> uses positional restraints and knowledge-based sampling to generate models with accuracies comparable to other leading modelling tools. Knowledge-based predictions are based on geometrical features of the homologous templates and rules concerning main-chain and side-chain conformations. By directly changing the restraints derived from available templates we estimate the accuracy limits of the method in <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling.</b> Conclusion The application of RAPPER to <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> provides an effective means of exploring the conformational space available to a target sequence. Enhanced methods for generating positional restraints can greatly improve structure prediction. Generation of an ensemble of solutions that are consistent with both target sequence and knowledge derived from the template structures provides a more appropriate representation of a structural prediction than a single model. By formulating homologous structural information as sets of restraints we can begin to consider how <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> might be used to inform conformer generation from sparse experimental data. </p...|$|R
