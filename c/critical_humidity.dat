In a structure demonstrated recently, for example, nanoscale rods of silicon were embedded vertically in a swollen hydrogel, and the rods tilted by a large angle {{in response to a}} drying environment (Sidorenko, et al., Science 315, 487, 2007). Here we describe a model to show that this behavior corresponds to a bifurcation at a <b>critical</b> <b>humidity,</b> analogous to a phase transition of the second kind. The structure adapts to the drying environment in two ways. Above the <b>critical</b> <b>humidity,</b> the rods stand vertical, enabling the hydrogel to develop tension and retain water.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of types of drying on seeds' quality, as recalcitrant, Ocotea puberula and determine their degree of <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> and lethal degree. Seeds harvested in Brunópolis, SC, with an initial moisture content of 38 %, were dried to 18 %, with gradients of 2 %; using the equation of target weight to ensure that gradient in the stove (35 oC) and in a desiccator with silica gel (25 oC). After drying, the seeds were evaluated for water content, percentage and germination speed index (GSI), tetrazolium and T 50. It was observed that up to 32 % water content did not change in seed quality, regardless {{of the type of}} drying and verified significant loss of germination after this value. We conclude that the type of drying does not affect the quality of the seed; however, because it is a recalcitrant seed, reducing the water content below 32 % decreased germination, and its degree of <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> and seeds with 22 % moisture content had no germination in this study is the degree of lethal humidity of this species...|$|E
40|$|Independent {{of thermal}} loading scenarios, the waste {{packages}} at the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{will be exposed}} to environmental conditions of temperatures below 100 C {{with a range of}} possible relative humidities. Under high relative humidities, the formation of thin water films on the metal surfaces will occur. Previous work at ambient conditions has shown that on susceptible metals, the water-film-covered metal has an enhanced corrosion rate relative to the dry oxidation of the metal. The transition relative humidity where oxidation changes from dry oxidation to aqueous electrochemical corrosion is called the critical relative humidity. Determination of this transition is important in estimating the performance of the candidate materials (especially corrosion allowance materials), because of the marked increase in degradation rate above the critical relative humidity, typically 10 - 10 {sup 2 } times This activity is concerned with short term measurements of corrosion and oxidation rates using a high sensitivity microbalance.

40|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} objectives for this thesis. The first {{was to develop}} a methodology and evaluation model of moisture redistribution {{in order to make the}} future relative humidity in a screeded concrete slab predictable. The second objective {{was to develop a}} method to determine the <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> for ion transport in concrete. Residual moisture in screeded concrete slabs may be redistributed to the top screed surface under a semi-permeable flooring, thus elevating the relative humidity, RH, and possibly exceeding the <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> level. Passing the <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> level may result in material damage to the flooring and adhesive. In order to avoid such damage there is a need of a methodology to estimate the maximum humidity obtained underneath flooring. The redistribution of residual moisture may increase the concentration of alkali at the contact area between the adhesive and concrete. This alkali increase may initiate and sustain adhesive deterioration, which is a common moisture related damage. Several screeded concrete slabs with PVC flooring were prepared to reproduce and monitor moisture distribution and the subsequent redistribution. The moisture distribution before flooring and after a certain period of redistribution is presented. In addition, sorption isotherms including scanning curves were determined in a sorption balance for materials used in the floor constructions, viz, w/c 0. 65 concrete, w/c 0. 4 concrete, w/c 0. 55 cement mortar, and Floor 4310 Fibre Flow, a self levelling flooring compound. Repeated absorption and desorption scanning curves starting from the desorption isotherm were also investigated. The measurements performed made it possible to develop both a qualitative and quantitative model of moisture redistribution and to quantify the humidity achieved under the flooring. The hysteresis phenomenon of the sorption isotherm is considered in the model. The model is well suited for estimations of the future RH underneath flooring in a screeded concrete slab and may also be used on homogeneous slabs. Results from previous research suggested that early drying of the concrete slab can mitigate the increase in relative humidity that occurs when an impermeable floor covering is installed. A study was conducted to verify these results. The results of this new study of the effects of early drying could not demonstrate any significant difference between an early and late dehydration. The redistribution of ions under different moisture conditions was investigated with a newly developed method. The method is divided into a preconditioning of test specimens and also a method to determine the redistribution of potassium ions. This preconditioning provides a well defined moisture condition of the specimen, which is important for determining the <b>critical</b> <b>humidity</b> for the transport of ions. The redistribution is detected by examining the ion content distribution before and after the preconditioning of ion species already present in the concrete. Previous research in this area has been conducted through adding chloride ions to the specimens. However, redistribution of chloride ions is impeded in that they bind to the inner pore surfaces, which poses a risk that the critical moisture level may be affected/misjudged...|$|E

A limit state for onset of mould growth is defined as the occurrence of traces of mould observed by microscopy. A dose-response model is proposed by which onset of mould growth can be predicted for an arbitrary climate history of combined relative humidity phi and temperature T. The model is calibrated and verified against a comprehensive set of experimental data published by Viitanen et al. [Viitanen H, Ritschkoff A-C.

The model is designed to facilitate continuous improvement of prediction capability by further laboratory testing of various materials under specified climate conditions.

The increasing use of urea is due to its numerous advantages, although this nitrogen (N) source is highly susceptible to volatilization losses, particularly when applied to the soil surface of management systems with conservation of crop residues. The volatilization losses can be minimized by slow or controlled-release fertilizers, with controlled water solubility of the urea-coating materials; and by stabilized fertilizers, which prolong the period during which N remains in the amide or ammonia forms by urease inhibitors.
