50|$|An {{interesting}} {{characteristic of}} commercially made ice cubes {{is that they}} are completely clear, lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made ice cubes. <b>Cloudy</b> <b>ice</b> cubes result when water is frozen quickly, or when the water is high in dissolved solids. When water is cooled to its freezing point, and ice starts to form, dissolved gases can no longer stay in solution and come out as microscopic bubbles. However, as ice floats in water, once there is enough ice to form a layer on the surface, the ice layer traps all bubbles within the ice cube. Commercial ice-makers use a flowing source of purified water to make ice with cooling elements at the bottom, allowing the bubbles to be washed away from the top as the cube grows.|$|E
40|$|We {{are keeping}} Dome Fuji ice core samples at two storage {{temperatures}} (- 50 and - 20 ℃) after deep ice core drilling reached 2503 m at the Dome Fuji station, Antarctica. Since we {{aimed to develop}} new methods for studying physical properties of ice cores, cold storage down to - 50 ℃ was necessary to avoid volume relaxation of ice cores during storage. To compare the volume relaxation process of an ice core under different storage temperatures, we captured images using a digital camera. Many tiny bubbles and plate-like inclusions (cleavage cracks) were observed in the ice core kept at the high storage temperature (- 20 ℃). The clear ice seen just after ice core recovery changes to milky coloured <b>cloudy</b> <b>ice</b> because of the many tiny bubbles and cleavage cracks generated. We analyzed the volume relaxation rate of each ice core sample based on the digital images; {{it was clear that}} the generation of tiny bubbles and cleavage cracks and the decomposition of air hydrate crystals were avoided effectively at a storage temperature of - 50 ℃. In cold storage down to - 50 ℃, various physical properties of the ice core have been successfully investigated. In the present paper, we emphasize the importance of low-temperature storage to maintain high-quality ice cores. I. Microphysical properties, deformation, texture and grain growt...|$|E
40|$|Cloudy bands {{probably}} {{caused by}} the high dust concentrations of winter snow deposited during glacial periods are characteristic stratigraphic features of Greenland ice cores. While sofar no (Vostok and Dome C) or only few (Dome Fuji) cloudy bands were reported from Antarctic ice cores the EDML ice core drilled in Dronning Maudland contains abundant cloudy bands like the GRIP, GISP 2 or NGRIP ice cores. Number and intensity of cloudy bands vary with climate, the colder the more and the more intense cloudy bands are observed. Cloudy bands indicate the layering in an ice sheet {{and can be used}} to detect flow induced disturbances in an ice core. We find increased wavyness of cloudy bands below about 2050 m depth. Clear ice contains about 1 - 100 optically visible particles but <b>cloudy</b> band <b>ice</b> on the order of > 10 000, intense cloudy bands typically 105 to 106 per cm 3 and more. Microscopic observations show that grain size is much smaller in cloudy bands than in the clear <b>ice</b> between the <b>cloudy</b> bands but the distribution of micro-particles is not related to grain boundaries or triple junctions...|$|R

60|$|The frown did {{not pass}} from Douglas's face, {{although}} he made the answer which was expected of him. In a sense {{he felt that he}} had been trapped. Opposite to him was Emily de Reuss in her favourite attitude, leaning a little forward, her hands clasped around her right knee, rocking herself backwards and forwards with a slow, rhythmical motion. She wore a gown of vivid scarlet, soft yet brilliant in its colouring. Her arms and shoulders were bare, and a string of pearls around the neck was her only ornament. Dressed exactly as she now was, he had once told her with honest and boyish frankness that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. That she, whose wardrobe was a miracle, and jewel-case the envy of every woman in London, should have chosen to appear to-night in precisely the same toilette, was at the same time an embarrassment and a warning to him. The image of Drexley rose up, the sound of his despairing warning seemed still in his ears. There was a colour in her cheeks, a light in her eyes--subtle indications that his visit was a thing looked forward to, no ordinary occasion. They were in one of the smaller rooms; outside a round table was laid for dinner in the palm-lined conservatory. Presently they sat there together; through the glass was a dazzling view of blue sky, starlit and clear; within, a vista of exotics, whose perfume hung heavy upon the air. Great palms were above their heads, the silver waters of a fountain rose and fell a few feet behind. They were served by a single servant in the de Reuss liveries of grey and silver; everything on the table was daintily fashioned and perfect of its sort. To Douglas, who at heart was passionately fond of beautiful things, it seemed after his gloomy garret a retaste of paradise. Champagne was served to them in a long glass jug of Venetian workmanship, rendered <b>cloudy</b> by the <b>ice,</b> like frosted ware. Emily herself filled his glass and pledged him a toast.|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} {{preliminary}} {{estimates of the}} column averaged carbon dioxide (CO 2) dry air mole fraction, X CO 2, retrieved from spectra recorded over land by the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite, GOSAT (nicknamed "Ibuki"), using retrieval methods originally developed for the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) mission. After screening for clouds and other known error sources, these retrievals reproduce much of the expected structure in the global X CO 2 field, including its variation with latitude and season. However, low yields of retrieved X CO 2 over persistently <b>cloudy</b> areas and <b>ice</b> covered surfaces at high latitudes limit the coverage of some geographic regions, even on seasonal time scales. Comparisons of early GOSAT X CO 2 retrievals with X CO 2 estimates from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) revealed a global, − 2 % (7 – 8 parts per million, ppm, with respect to dry air) X CO 2 bias and 2 to 3 times more variance in the GOSAT retrievals. About half of the global X CO 2 bias {{is associated with a}} systematic, 1 % overestimate in the retrieved air mass, first identified as a global + 10 hPa bias in the retrieved surface pressure. This error has been attributed to errors in the O 2 A-band absorption cross sections. Much of the remaining bias and spurious variance in the GOSAT X CO 2 retrievals has been traced to uncertainties in the instrument's calibration, oversimplified methods for generating O 2 and CO 2 absorption cross sections, and other subtle errors in the implementation of the retrieval algorithm. Many of these deficiencies have been addressed in the most recent version (Build 2. 9) of the retrieval algorithm, which produces negligible bias in X CO 2 on global scales as well as a ~ 30 % reduction in variance. Comparisons with TCCON measurements indicate that regional scale biases remain, but these could be reduced by applying empirical corrections like those described by Wunch et al. (2011 b). We recommend that such corrections be applied before these data are used in source sink inversion studies to minimize spurious fluxes associated with known biases. These and other lessons learned from the analysis of GOSAT data are expected to accelerate the delivery of high quality data products from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory- 2 (OCO- 2), once that satellite is successfully launched and inserted into orbit...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} basis is explored for inferring the microphysical properties of ice crystal from high-spectral resolution infrared observations. A radiative transfer model is employed to simulate spectral radiances to address relevant issues. The extinction and absorption efficiencies of individual ice crystals, assumed as hexagonal columns for large particles and droxtals for small particles, are computed {{from a combination}} of the finite- difference time-domain (FDTD) technique and a composite method. The corresponding phase functions are computed {{from a combination of}} FDTD and an improved geometric optics method (IGOM). Bulk scattering properties are derived by averaging the single- scattering properties of individual particles for 30 particle size distributions developed from in situ measurements and for additional four analytical Gamma size distributions for small particles. The non-sphericity of ice crystals is shown to {{have a significant impact on}} the radiative signatures in the infrared (IR) spectrum; the spherical particle approximation for inferring ice cloud properties may result in an overest&ation of the optical thickness and an inaccurate retrieval of effective particle size. Furthermore, we show that the error associated with the use of the Henyey-Greenstein phase function can be as larger as 1 K in terms of brightness temperature for larger particle effective size at some strong scattering wavenumbers. For small particles, the difference between the two phase functions is much less, with brightness temperatures generally differing by less than 0. 4 K. The simulations undertaken in this study show that the slope of the IR brightness temperature spectrum between 790 - 960 /cm is sensitive to the effective particle size. Furthermore, a strong sensitivity of IR brightness temperature to cloud optical thickness is noted within the l 050 - 1250 /cm region. Based on this spectral feature, a technique is presented for the simultaneous retrieval of the visible optical thickness and effective particle size from high spectral resolution infrared data under <b>ice</b> <b>cloudy</b> con&tion. The error analysis shows that the uncertainty of the retrieved optical thickness and effective particle size has a small range of variation. The error for retrieving particle size in conjunction with an uncertainty of 5 K in cloud'temperature, or a surface temperature uncertainty of 2. 5 K, is less than 15 %. The corresponding e m r in the uncertainty of optical thickness is within 5 - 2096, depending on the value of cloud optical thickness. The applicability of the technique is demonstrated using the aircraft-based High- resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) data from the Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects Special Study (SUCCESS) in 1996 and the First ISCCP Regional Experiment - Arctic Clouds Experiment (FIRE-ACE) in 1998...|$|R
