Since the antioxidant activity of the extracts greatly depends {{on the quality of}} compounds, the phytochemical examination for alkaloid- and element content were also examined. According to the results the antioxidant activity does not depend on the alkaloid content of the drug during the vegetation period and on the alkaloid content of the alcoholic extracts. It seems that the antioxidant activity of the extracts is also independent from the transition metal element content.

A number of enzymes of the virus such as DNA polymerase can be targeted antiviral drugs. Acyclovir is used to treat infections of the virus, today due to drug resistance, need to do more research on finding new drugs, especially herbal medicines has increased. This study aimed to investigate the antiviral effect of methanol extract of Chelidonium majus compared with acyclovir against the virus in HeLa cell culture. Methods: In this experimental study, the toxicity of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> methanol extract and acyclovir on HeLa cell was determined with both MTT and Trypan blue methods. The antiviral effect of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> extract and acyclovir was evaluated in different concentration (1800 - 1700 - 1600 - 1500 - 1400 and 500 - 100 - 75 - 50 - 30 - 10 µg/ml) and also in different times before, after and during of virus adsorption respectively.   The virus titer was measured by tissue culture infectious dose 50) TCID 50 ( method. The T-test method was used to comparing the effects of both compounds on virus. Results: The maximum non-toxic concentration of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> extract on HeLa cell was determined 1600 µg/ml that has the maximum inhibitory effect on HSV- 1 replication. Acyclovir was shown low toxicity on HeLa cells. The 30 µg/ml concentration of acyclovir was considered for the next steps of the study. The highest inhibitory effect of the extract was observed 1 hour after absorption and the virus replication was suppressed completely by the acyclovir immediately after virus adsorption up to 8 hours after infection. Conclusion: The <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> methanol extract has less effect than the acyclovir on inhibition of herpes simplex virus replication in a first few hours of infection.

40|$|Abstract Background The anticancer drug Ukrain (NSC- 631570) {{which has}} been {{specified}} by the manufacturer as semisynthetic derivative of the <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> alkaloid chelidonine and the alkylans thiotepa was reported to exert selective cytotoxic effects on human tumour cell lines in vitro. Few clinical trials suggest beneficial effects {{in the treatment of}} human cancer. Aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate the importance of apoptosis induction for the antineoplastic activity of Ukrain, to define the molecular mechanism of its cytotoxic effects and to identify its active constituents by mass spectrometry. Methods Apoptosis induction was analysed in a Jurkat T-lymphoma cell model by fluorescence microscopy (chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation), flow cytometry (cellular shrinkage, depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-activation) and Western blot analysis (caspase-activation). Composition of Ukrain was analysed by mass spectrometry and LC-MS coupling. Results Ukrain turned out to be a potent inducer of apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Ukrain induced depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases. Lack of caspase- 8, expression of cFLIP-L and resistance to death receptor ligand-induced apoptosis failed to inhibit Ukrain-induced apoptosis while lack of FADD caused a delay but not abrogation of Ukrain-induced apoptosis pointing to a death receptor independent signalling pathway. In contrast, the broad spectrum caspase-inhibitor zVAD-fmk blocked Ukrain-induced cell death. Moreover, over-expression of Bcl- 2 or Bcl-x L and expression of dominant negative caspase- 9 partially reduced Ukrain-induced apoptosis pointing to Bcl- 2 controlled mitochondrial signalling events. However, mass spectrometric analysis of Ukrain failed to detect the suggested trimeric chelidonine thiophosphortriamide or putative dimeric or monomeric chelidonine thiophosphortriamide intermediates from chemical synthesis. Instead, the <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> alkaloids chelidonine, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, protopine and allocryptopine were identified as major components of Ukrain. Apart from sanguinarine and chelerythrine, chelidonine turned out to be a potent inducer of apoptosis triggering cell death at concentrations of 0. 001 mM, while protopine and allocryptopine were less effective. Similar to Ukrain, apoptosis signalling of chelidonine involved Bcl- 2 controlled mitochondrial alterations and caspase-activation. Conclusion The potent proapoptotic effects of Ukrain are not due to the suggested "Ukrain-molecule" but to the cytotoxic efficacy of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> <b>L.</b> alkaloids including chelidonine. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of alcoholic extract of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> concentration of cholesterol and thyroid hormone levels in the male rats having hypercholesterolemia. Methods: In this study, 40 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups of control group (n= 8) with normal diet, observing group with fat dietary, and three experimental groups receiving the same fat diet plus ethanol extract of the <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> plant of 100, 200, 300 (mg/kg). After this period (21 days) blood samples were collected and after measuring the amount of thyroid hormones of T 3, T 4, TSH and also the amount of cholesterol, the data were analyzed by using SPSS software, ANOVA and t-test. Results: There was {{a significant increase in the}} amount of cholesterol, T 3 and T 4 serum level in observation group comparing with control group (P< 0. 05) and the amount of T 3 and T 4 in groups receiving the maximum dose of <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> extract had the minimum decrease comparing to the group receiving moderate dose (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that <b>Chelidonium</b> <b>majus</b> alcoholic extract can reduce the concentrations of thyroid hormones and the amount of cholesterol and increase the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormones as well, which is probably due to the existence of plant’s alkaloids and flavonoids, as well as the negative feedback mechanism of thyroid hormones. ...|$|R
