5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing <b>chipsets</b> that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed <b>chipsets</b> to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E
5|$|PCs with a DVI {{interface}} {{are capable}} of video output to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's motherboard <b>chipsets</b> since the 945G and NVIDIA’s GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard <b>chipsets</b> {{are capable of}} 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C <b>chipsets</b> {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5000|$|This feature also {{requires}} a <b>chipset</b> that supports VT-d like the Q87 <b>chipset</b> or the X99 <b>chipset.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{successor}} to the NEAT <b>chipset</b> was the SCAT <b>chipset,</b> which amalgamated all of the chips of the NEAT <b>chipset</b> into a single chip, the 82C836. The DS8223 LEAP <b>chipset</b> provided support for LIM EMS 4.0.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Atheros shipped its 500-millionth WLAN <b>chipset</b> and 100-millionth Align 1-stream <b>chipset.</b> They {{released}} the first HomePlug AV <b>chipset</b> with a 500 Mbit/s PHY rate.|$|R
5|$|The device uses a 65nm process, {{includes}} {{two to four}} cores, up to 24MB on-die caches, Hyper-Threading technology and integrated memory controllers. It implements double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory errors. Tukwila also implements Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus-based architecture. It has a peak interprocessor bandwidth of 96GB/s and a peak memory bandwidth of 34GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly, using QPI interfaces to directly connect to other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used on Intel processors using the Nehalem microarchitecture, making it probable that Tukwila and Nehalem {{will be able to}} use the same <b>chipsets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite taking massive {{losses on}} the Saturn, {{including}} a 75 {{percent drop in}} half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would arrive {{in time for the}} Dreamcast's launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.s Tokyo premiere was a grand event–three stadium-packed showings, a demonstration of the game and more... Afterward, Segata Sanshiro led the crowd in a Sonic chant, which will be used in the game.}} However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR <b>chipsets</b> caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out {{by the end of the}} day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of Virtua Fighter 3, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast software titles Sonic Adventure and Sega Rally Championship 2, which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. Seaman, released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcast's first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of Namco's Soul Calibur helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the launch}} of Athlon 64 {{processors}} in 2003, AMD designed <b>chipsets</b> for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations. The <b>chipsets</b> include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 <b>chipsets.</b> The situation changed in 2003 {{with the release of}} Athlon 64 processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own <b>chipsets</b> for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design <b>chipsets.</b> This was the “Open Platform Management Architecture” with ATI, VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon 64 processors and later Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX processors, including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia.|$|E
5000|$|Renamed as AMD 480X CrossFire <b>chipset</b> {{after the}} {{acquisition}} of AMD and ATI, with Intel CrossFire <b>chipset</b> retained the use of Radeon Xpress 200 CrossFire <b>chipset.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Originally codenamed [...] "RS690T", the <b>chipset</b> is for mobile {{platforms}} only. Featuring {{an optional}} 16-bit DDR2 side-port memory with maximum 128 MiB [...] capacity as local frame buffer. Sources {{revealed that the}} RS690T <b>chipset</b> may pair with SB700 southbridge and named as the [...] "trevally" [...] platform focusing the mobile market. It is worth {{to note that the}} RS690T <b>chipset</b> has been added to AMD [...] "longevity programme", that is AMD committed to supply the <b>chipset</b> {{for at least five years}} after general availability. However, currently, M690T <b>chipset</b> was coupled with SB600 southbridge. The <b>chipset</b> was officially referred as [...] "M690T <b>chipset</b> with Radeon X1270 graphics".|$|R
50|$|The 690G <b>chipset</b> also {{supports}} {{a maximum of}} 24 additional PCI Express lanes and a PCI Express x16 expansion slot, and the <b>chipset</b> mixes audio and video signals and output through the HDMI interface. The mobile version of the <b>chipset</b> is the M690 <b>chipset</b> (codenamed RS690M).|$|R
25|$|The {{initiative}} {{went further}} {{with the release}} of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server <b>chipsets</b> in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop <b>chipsets</b> for Opteron processors. As of today, Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server <b>chipsets</b> for Opteron processors.|$|E
25|$|AMD {{released}} new <b>chipsets</b> in 2017 {{to support}} the release of their new Ryzen products. As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4 based <b>chipsets</b> primarily varied {{in the number of}} additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available. These AM4 <b>chipsets</b> were designed in conjunction with ASMedia.|$|E
25|$|The Core 2 {{processor}} {{does not}} require the use of DDR2. While the Intel 975X and P965 <b>chipsets</b> require this memory, some motherboards and <b>chipsets</b> support both Core 2 processors and DDR memory. When using DDR memory, performance may be reduced because of the lower available memory bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|The three Channel-Link <b>chipset</b> {{configurations}} provide varying user interfaces. For example, the three-lane <b>chipset</b> has 21 single-ended {{inputs and}} outputs for the user interface, and the four-lane <b>chipset</b> has 28 single-ended {{inputs and outputs}}. The eight-lane <b>chipset</b> has 48 single ended inputs and outputs because it uses one of the 7 serialized bits/lane to DC-balance the other six bits.|$|R
50|$|The Intel P55 is {{the first}} desktop <b>chipset</b> from Intel based on the PCH <b>chipset</b> design. The P55 Express <b>chipset</b> uses the LGA 1156 socket. Compatible CPUs include the first {{generation}} Core i series i3, i5, and i7 processor line along with a Pentium G6950. Like any PCH <b>chipset,</b> the P55 uses a Direct Media Interface connection.|$|R

25|$|Approximately five chipset {{versions}} {{were built}} by Agere and approximately 4 versions were built by STMicroelectronics {{after the initial}} prototypes, although all of the early receivers included an Agere chipset known as Northstar. This platform enjoyed the highest volume of <b>chipsets</b> to date, representing the bulk of total production from 2002 to 2010. As of 2010, most of the <b>chipsets</b> are produced by STMicroelectronics.|$|E
25|$|Adding modules to {{the single}} memory bus creates {{additional}} electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the memory bottleneck, new <b>chipsets</b> employ the multi-channel architecture.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a {{breakout}} device, some docking stations produce multiple connections from one port, only instead of extracting them from internal <b>chipsets,</b> they create them inside the dock using converters. They are functionally identical to a hub with various converters plugged in. Typically USB- or Thunderbolt-based, they incorporate {{a range of}} converters such as USB display adapters or a full external GPU, audio <b>chipsets,</b> NICs, storage enclosures, modems and memory card readers even PCI Express card slots connected through an internal USB hub or PCI Express bridge to give the host computer access to extra connections it did not previously possess. Simpler “docking stations” consist of {{nothing more than a}} hub inside a stand.|$|E
