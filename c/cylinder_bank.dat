5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
25|$|A single {{overhead}} camshaft for each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> operated two valves per cylinder, {{in an almost}} identical manner to the inline six-cylinder German Mercedes D.III and BMW III engines. Each camshaft was driven by a vertical driveshaft that was placed {{at the back of}} each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank,</b> again identical to the Mercedes and BMW straight-six powerplants. Delco Electronics provided the ignition system and Zenith the carburetor. Dry weight was 844lb (383kg).|$|E
25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank,</b> which {{is known as a}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual overhead cam (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|E

25|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, the camshaft {{is used to}} operate poppet valves. It consists of a cylindrical rod running {{the length of the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via intake air volume metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank),</b> and were sequentially 'fired' or activated {{in accordance with the}} engine's firing order. [...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95RON in the 4.2V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine was}} equally [...] "civilized" [...] as the interior, {{given that it}} was {{provided}} with just one overhead cam head through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank,</b> two chain driven valves per cylinder and three dual Weber carburetors bodies placed {{on top of the}} V, against six versions typically on the sports cars.|$|E
2500|$|Like the BMW VI and the Mikulin M-17, the AM-34FRN and {{subsequent}} models used articulated connecting rods which caused a different stroke of [...] and [...] {{between right and}} left <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank.</b> The displacement was 46.9l (2,863.7 in3).

2500|$|Two magnetos were {{mounted on}} the outside of each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank.</b> [...] Each magneto fired all eight {{cylinders}} for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's single overhead camshaft. [...] Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. [...] Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water jacketed manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{has four}} valves per cylinder, with {{chain-driven}} double overhead camshafts, and {{variable valve timing}} for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. [...] Charged intake air is cooled by two side-mounted intercoolers (SMIC)s. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic ME9.1.2 engine control units, which act as 'master' and 'slave': two ECUs are required due to the high revs the engine can achieve. [...] It also uses mapped direct ignition system with ten individual direct-acting spark coils, an electronic drive by wire throttle (Bosch [...] "E-Gas"), cylinder-selective knock control, and <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> adaptive lambda control, utilising eight lambda sensors.|$|E
2500|$|For the C5 RS6 {{powertrain}} detail, {{the internal}} combustion engine is an all-aluminium alloy [...] twin-turbocharged ('biturbo'), double overhead camshaft, 5 valve per cylinder version of Audi's 4.2-litre 90° V8 petrol engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: BCY), developed and manufactured in Germany and the UK by quattro GmbH and Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). [...] With the addition of the two turbochargers (one per <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank),</b> the motive power output of the V8 engine was increased to [...] at 5,700 to 6,400rpm, and generated [...] of torque. [...] The combination of the 4.2-litre V8, variable inlet valve timing, and twin turbochargers gave the RS6 an exceptionally wide power band, with peak torque available from 1,950 to 5,600rpm.|$|E
25|$|The Hyena {{arrangement}} of <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks</b> arranged as a radial engine was continued with further designs, but with little commercial success. Only the Deerhound and Hyena were built.|$|R
2500|$|More {{unusual is}} the modern W engine (also {{known as a}} 'VV' engine to {{distinguish}} itself from the pre-war W engines) that has four <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks</b> arranged in a [...] "W" [...] pattern with two pairs narrowly arranged with a 15-degree separation. Even when there are four <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks</b> (that would normally require a total of eight individual camshafts), the narrow-angle design allows the use of just four camshafts in total. For the Bugatti Veyron, which has a 16-cylinder W engine configuration, the four camshafts are driving a total of 64 valves.|$|R
2500|$|Four Kestrel/Peregrine <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks</b> {{attached}} to a single crankcase and driving a single common crankshaft would produce the contemporary Rolls-Royce Vulture, a [...] X-24 which {{would be used for}} bombers.|$|R
2500|$|The wooden {{monocoque}} fuselage {{was equally}} refined and polished, its oval section tapering towards the tail. [...] Towards the nose the fuselage flattened {{to accommodate the}} three four-cylinder blocks of its 340kW (450hp) W-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Gb engine, driving a low-set two-blade propeller with a large spinner. [...] This was water-cooled, with under-wing radiators from the root to half span, assisted by a single ventral radiator just aft of the undercarriage. [...] The fixed, tricycle undercarriage had unfaired single mainwheels on a single axle, attached by bungee cord to two flat, faired, tapered legs. These legs were cross-braced with streamlined stays. [...] The open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge. [...] Because the Hispano engine of the V.2 was mounted lower in the nose than the Lorraine-Dietrich, another W-12, of the V.1, the central <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> did not so completely obscure the pilot's forward view.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last two}} V8's, the T and the 100hp were not successful. [...] Though tested, they never flew. [...] The type T {{introduced}} steel cylinders {{and was an}} overhead-valve engine with vertically mounted valves operated from a central camshaft by thin pull rods and rockers. [...] The carburettor was mounted centrally at the front, feeding a central tube which ran {{to the back of}} the engine, divided and ran back along each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank.</b> Dual magneto/coil and battery ignition was provided. [...] The 100hp engine was also an overhead-valve engine in the sense that the port opened directly into the cylinder head, though the valves were mounted horizontally. [...] This arrangement required an unusual shape of combustion chamber but enabled the valves to be operated directly from a central crankshaft raised on pillars to cylinder head height. Vibrations of this crankshaft and weakness of a new cylinder head restraint system dogged the engine, the last E.N.V. made.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{detail of}} the engine {{includes}} fully sequential electronic multi-point fuel injection with intake manifold-sited fuel injectors, mapped direct ignition system with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark ignition coils and NGK longlife spark plugs, and three knock sensors. [...] Engine management uses a Bosch Motronic ME7.1.1 engine control unit, which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, ignition system, valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control—the latter operating {{in conjunction with the}} Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, as part of the [...] "Anti Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR) traction control system. [...] The engine is compliant with the European Union Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary catalytic converters (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated oxygen sensors which manage the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> selective lambda control. [...] This results in a CO2 emissions rating of 350g/km for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration.|$|E

2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, in the 90° V8 engine with {{a simple}} flat-plane crankshaft, each <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> acts like a straight-4, which is much {{smoother}} than a straight-3. In addition, in 1915 the crossplane crankshaft was invented, which allowed the secondary vibrations from one <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank</b> of a V8 to cancel those from the other <b>cylinder</b> <b>bank.</b> This resulted in an almost perfectly smooth V8 engine which has been popular in luxury and sports cars since 1923.|$|E

50|$|The BMW VI was {{the first}} twelve-cylinder engine built by the BMW. It {{essentially}} consisted of two <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks</b> from the six-cylinder BMW IV bolted to a common cast aluminium crankcase at a 60-degree included angle between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>banks.</b> Series production commenced in 1926 after type approval had been granted. From 1930 on, after 1000 engines of the BMW VI type had already been delivered, Germany was again permitted to construct military aircraft. The sudden additional demand resulted in the production figures increasing rapidly. In 1933 the BMW VI was used for BMW's first experiments with direct fuel injection.|$|R
