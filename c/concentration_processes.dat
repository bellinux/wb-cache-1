50|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{can involve}} four general types of unit operation: comminution - particle size reduction; sizing - separation of particle sizes by screening or classification; concentration by {{taking advantage of}} physical and surface chemical properties; and dewatering - solid/liquid separation. In all of these processes, the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this is dictated by the grade and recovery of the final product. To do this, the mineralogy of the ore needs to be considered as this dictates the amount of liberation required and the processes that can occur. The smaller the particles processes, the greater the theoretical grade and recovery of the final product, but this however is difficult to do with fine particles as they prevent certain <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> from occurring.|$|E
40|$|A gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) {{method for}} {{the determination of}} propofol in human plasma has been developed and validated. Propofol was extracted from human plasma by using mixed-mode cation exchange/reversed-phase (MCX) cartridges. As propofol easily volatilizes during concentration, 100 % methanol was injected directly into GC-MS to elute propofol. Despite avoiding concentration process of the eluted solution, lower limit of quantization (LLOQ) of propofol was 25 [*]ng/mL. The validated method exhibited good linearity (R 2 = 0. 9989) with accuracy and precision − 5. 8 %~ 11. 7 % and 3. 7 %~ 11. 6 %, respectively. The other validation parameters, recovery and matrix effect, ranged from 96. 6 % to 99. 4 % and 95. 3 % to 101. 4 %, respectively. Propofol standard was quantified to evaluate possible loss due to the <b>concentration</b> <b>processes,</b> nitrogen gas and centrifugal vacuum. These two <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> resulted in notable decrease in the quantity of propofol, signifying avoiding any <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> during propofol quantification.

Models currently available are reviewed, with particular reference to those incorporated in the JKMRC Simulator, JKSimMet. and its derivatives.

Like zymogen granules, the resulting aggregates were moderately sensitive to ionic strength and insensitive to osmolality. Moreover, their pH dependence was similar to that of isolated zymogen granules. When sulfated glucosaminoglycans isolated from the zymogen granules of the guinea pig pancreas were used instead of chondroitin sulfate, the same kind of interactions with chymotrypsinogen were obtained.

40|$|International audienceMilk {{concentration}} and spray drying are highly energy-intensive operations, for which energy consumption {{accounts for about}} 25 % of the French dairy processing industry. A major challenge consists then {{in the design and}} development of sustainable dairy <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> which integrate technical, economic and environmental criteria. For this purpose, systems oriented tools have already been developed in the chemical industry by using a systemic approach combining modelling, simulation, and optimisation. Despite the proximity of chemical with food and bioengineering sectors, the utilization of such an approach for the modelling of dairy processes suffers from a lack of process models, more particularly when the whole process is considered and when <b>concentration</b> <b>processes</b> are involved. In that context, this work constitutes a preliminary study towards the development of a methodological framework for modelling and optimizing dairy processes. The proposed strategy consists in the combination of a chemical process simulator (ASPEN PLUS 7. 3, AspenTech, Inc.) with an environmental model based on Life Cycle Assessment concepts. The simulated process concerns milk powder production, and more particularly milk concentration prior to drying, involving pre-heating, pasteurization, and evaporation steps.
