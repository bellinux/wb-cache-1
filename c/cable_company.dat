5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
50|$|Vidéotron and Cogeco are {{the largest}} <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> in Quebec, {{although}} {{a large number of}} independent <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> exist. These compete against satellite companies Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as Bell's IPTV service Bell Fibe TV.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli {{satellite}} television provider Yes {{was established in}} 2000, introducing strong competition in the cable television market. Prior {{to the establishment of}} Yes there were only three other <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> in Israel: Tevel, Matav and Arutzay Zahav. The competition with Yes caused a big loss of members amongst the <b>cable</b> TV <b>companies</b> which urged them to merge. In order to strengthen Yes, which was relatively new, the regulator postponed his approval to the merger of the <b>cable</b> <b>companies.</b> The merger was completed in 2003, and the <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> were renamed under the singular company called Hot.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>companies</b> {{and sports}} leagues have {{embarked}} upon parallel courses of vertical integration by creating and acquiring interests in cable sports networks. <b>Cable</b> <b>companies</b> carry regional sports networks (RSNs) on basic cable tiers. Some league-owned networks have sought high prices for carriage on basic tiers, causing some <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> to balk {{because of the}} price increase {{they would have to}} pass on to consumers. The 1992 Cable Act prohibits <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> from discriminating in carriage terms between affiliated and nonaffiliated networks. <b>Cable</b> <b>companies</b> that own RSNs are, therefore, left vulnerable to discrimination complaints by league-owned networks. This Note argues that the leverage given to league-owned networks by the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s carriage regulations is contrary to the public interest and is due to an unreasonable interpretation of the 1992 Cable Act. Further, it suggests a variety of responses available to policymakers that have the potential to curtail increases in the price of cable due to the proliferation of cable sports networks...|$|R
25|$|In December 1899, The Bell Telephone Company of Canada {{bought a}} cabling company for $500,000; a Canadian charter named it The Wire and <b>Cable</b> <b>Company.</b> Northern Electric and Manufacturing further {{expanded}} its product line in 1900, manufacturing the first Canadian wind-up gramophones that played flat discs. In 1911 the Wire and <b>Cable</b> <b>company</b> {{changed its name}} to the Imperial Wire and <b>Cable</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E

50|$|The CRTC {{mandated}} that <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> across Canada provide a Channel {{for the use}} of the Community. They had the revolutionary idea that Canadian airwaves belong to the Canadian people. The <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> were expected to spend ten per cent of their income on a Community Channel.|$|R
50|$|A {{community}} {{channel is}} a form of community television, much like public-access television cable TV in the United States and other forms of citizen produced content. The provision of a community channel is required by CRTC regulations governing the licensing of <b>cable</b> <b>companies.</b> <b>Cable</b> <b>companies</b> are required to allocate a small percentage of cable subscription revenues for the provision of a community channel. This amounts to over $116 million annually in Canada. The community channel is viewed as a public trust that the <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> manage on behalf of the Canadian public.|$|R

25|$|Major Canadian cable {{companies}} include Rogers, Shaw, Cogeco, Vidéotron and EastLink/Persona. Most Canadian cities {{are served by}} only one <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> per market; in the few cities that are served {{by more than one}} <b>cable</b> <b>company,</b> each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in Hamilton, Cogeco Cable, Mountain Cablevision and Source Cable are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.|$|E

25|$|The Mackay Radio & Telegraph Company {{was founded}} in 1884 by John William Mackay (a wealthy silver mine owner) and James Gordon Bennett as the Commercial <b>Cable</b> <b>Company</b> {{with the goal of}} {{providing}} transatlantic telegraph service. Mackay next incorporated the Postal Telegraph Company to expand the system across the continental United States. In 1901, Mackay formed the Commercial Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Company</b> to provide cable telegraphic service across the Pacific Ocean. Although Mackay died in 1902, his son, Clarence Mackay, continued to head the company. In 1925, Clarence Mackay founded Mackay Radio, and added a radio network to the telegraph business. In 1928, the Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. merged with its two cable siblings and All America Cables to form the American Cable & Radio Corporation. The majority shareholder in the new company was the International Telephone & Telegraph Co.|$|E
50|$|The legal {{precedent}} for carriage disputes {{dates back to}} 1934 legislation, which required a broadcaster to get permission before using programming from another broadcaster. The law was later applied to <b>cable</b> <b>companies,</b> as well. In the 1950s, <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> operating in the western United States began retransmitting broadcast signals {{for the benefit of}} customers situated too far from the station's transmitter to receive programs with an antenna. Stations objected that they were not being compensated for this retransmission or that they were having to compete with more distant stations that duplicated their content. From February 15, 1966 to December 18, 1968, the United States Federal Communications Commission barred <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> from importing non-local broadcast signals into the top 100 television markets - while allowing <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> to petition for exceptions. After an interim period, the FCC partially lifted these restrictions in 1972, eliminating them entirely {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|R

25|$|In 1903, {{workers for}} the Commercial Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Company</b> took up {{residence}} on the island {{as part of the}} effort to lay a trans-Pacific telegraph cable. These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the canary, cycad, Norfolk Island pine, she-oak, coconut, and various deciduous trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 1903 the United States Navy {{opened a}} radio station in {{response}} to complaints from <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> workers about Japanese squatters and poachers. Between 1904 and 1908, Roosevelt stationed 21 Marines on the island to end wanton destruction of bird life and keep Midway safe as a U.S. possession, protecting the cable station.|$|E
40|$|Network {{operators}} of competing infrastructures in European electronic communications markets face asymmetric regulation: incumbent telecommunications firms {{are required to}} open their networks for retail broadband competition, while <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> have no such obligation. Furthermore, for historical reasons, <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> have better quality networks thanks to the DOCSIS 3. 0 technology than DSL-based telecom firms. How would the market structure of electronic communications markets {{and the quality of}} networks develop in the presence of asymmetric regulation and original quality differences? Based on a location model for product differentiation, i find that access revenues can compensate incumbent telecom firms for the loss due to having a lower quality network than <b>cable</b> <b>companies.</b> Therefore, access obligation reduces the incentives of telecom firms to compete with <b>cable</b> <b>companies</b> by upgrading network quality. In the absence of retail competitors without networks, however, telecom firms need to upgrade network quality to be able to remain competitive with <b>cable</b> <b>companies.</b> Furthermore and in line with the existing literature, the exclusion of retail competitors is more likely in the presence of higher access prices and stronger substitutuion between firms' products. Finally, if the original differences between network quality is large and high returns on investments are unlikely, telecom firms {{may not be able to}} invest sufficiently and lose substantially from their market shares...|$|R

25|$|Al Jazeera: Was {{approved}} by the CRTC in 2004 as an optional cable and satellite offering, but {{on the condition that}} any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost, the end-result was that no <b>cable</b> <b>company</b> elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using free-to-air satellite dishes to watch the station. The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed its opinion over possible anti-Semitic incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian B'nai Brith is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada. The CRTC ruling applied to Al Jazeera and not to its English-speaking sister network Al Jazeera English, which was launched two years after the ruling.|$|E
