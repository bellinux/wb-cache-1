5|$|After then-front-runner Herman Cain {{was damaged}} by {{allegations}} of past sexual harassment, Gingrich gained support, and {{quickly became a}} <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> the race, especially after Cain suspended his campaign. By December 4, 2011, Gingrich was leading in the national polls. However, after an abundance of negative ads run by his opponents throughout December, Gingrich's national polling lead had fallen to a tie with Mitt Romney.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2011 Aintree {{released}} {{the names of}} 102 horses submitted to enter, including 34 Irish-trained and three French-trained horses. Ten were trained by Paul Nicholls, including a leading <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> Niche Market; nine were handled by Irish trainer Willie Mullins, and three by Jonjo O'Neill, the trainer of last year's winner. Ballabriggs, another leading contender, was trained by Donald McCain, Jr., the son of Ginger McCain who trained Red Rum to three National victories in the 1970s and returned with another winner, Amberleigh House, in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, when Seoul, South Korea {{hosted the}} 1988 Summer Olympics, she swam the {{freestyle}} leg for the silver medal-winning U.S. {{team in the}} women's 4×100-meter medley relay with teammates Beth Barr (backstroke), Tracey McFarlane (breaststroke), and Janel Jorgensen (butterfly). The U.S. women's medley relay team was fraught with last-minute drama, as several previously selected swimmers dropped out to focus on individual events, or were replaced because they had performed below expectations, only hours before the event final. In the event final, the U.S. medley relay team included women with no history of competing together, no relay exchange practice, and no coach; the East German favorites taunted the Americans before the race. Wayte would later characterize the race {{as one of her}} proudest moments. She also captured a bronze medal with the third-place U.S. women's 4×100-meter freestyle relay team that included Mitzi Kremer, Dara Torres and Laura Walker. Individually, she finished fourth in the women's 200-meter freestyle; she was also a medal <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> the women's 200-meter individual medley, but was disqualified when the judges ruled she used an illegal butterfly kick on the breaststroke leg of the medley.|$|E

5|$|The 2004 season {{represented}} a breakthrough for Zersenay and he {{established himself as}} a serious <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> distance running. He signed a contract with Adidas Spain and brought the team victory at the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup in February. The following month he bettered his previous showings at the World Cross Country Championships with a sixth-place finish. With the help of team mates Yonas Kifle and Tesfayohannes Mesfen, among others, he took Eritrea to third position in the team competition – the first time the country had reached the podium at a world cross country event. Two months later he finished second in the 10km Great Manchester Run; his time of 27:59 was five seconds behind winner Craig Mottram. He took to the track in June at a meeting in Gavà, Spain, and recorded another national record, this time in the 10,000m with a time of 27:32.61.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{athletics}} season saw Gay {{rise to the}} top of {{the rankings}} for the first time and become a genuine <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> the 100m. He became the 2006 US Outdoor Champion in unfortunate circumstances: Gay originally finished second in 10.07s with a strong headwind, but Justin Gatlin's first-place finish was later rescinded for use of a banned substance. Gay significantly improved upon his previous 200m personal best by over two-tenths of a second at the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne. However, his time of 19.70s was not enough to beat newcomer Xavier Carter who ran the second fastest time ever with 19.63s. Improvements in the 100m followed, as he won the Rethymno track meet and set another personal best with 9.88s. Gay scored another sub-10 second 100m at the Stockholm Grand Prix, finishing second to Asafa Powell with a 9.97s, and beating Michael Johnson's British all-comers 200m record with a 19.84s win in London. Gay continued to improve at the 100m, revising his personal best to 9.84s at the Zürich Golden League meet, but it was not enough to beat Powell, who equaled his own world record of 9.77s.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one <b>contender.</b> <b>In</b> this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} clear that other monarchs were not going to acquiesce to a de facto {{partition}} of Bavaria, Joseph and his foreign minister, Anton von Kaunitz, scoured the Habsburg realm for troops and concentrated six hundred guns and a 180,000–190,000-man Austrian army in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. This amounted to most of Austria's two hundred thousand effectives, leaving much of the Habsburg border regions with the Ottoman Empire under-guarded. On 6 April 1778, Frederick of Prussia established his army of eighty thousand men on the Prussian border with Bohemia, near Neisse, Schweidnitz, and the County of Glatz, which Frederick had acquired from the Wittelsbach <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> 1741 in exchange for his electoral support of Charles VII. At Glatz, Frederick completed his preparations for invasion: he gathered supplies, arranged a line of march, brought up his artillery and drilled his soldiers. His younger brother, Prince Henry, formed a second army of seventy-five to a hundred thousand men to the north and west, in Saxony. In April, Frederick and Joseph officially joined their armies in the field, and diplomatic negotiations ended.|$|E
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. The drivers' fastest lap times {{determined the}} starting {{order for the}} first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. The session was held in cooler night-time weather conditions. Drivers used soft-compound tyres for their first timed laps before entering the pit lane for new tyres {{for the remainder of}} the session. Vandoorne set the pace in the early part of the session and improved to clinch his first pole position of the season, and his fifth consecutive in the series, with a time of 1:39.237. He was joined on the grid's front row by his teammate Matsushita who was three-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Lynn was ninth after his first timed lap but recovered to qualify in third place. Pic, who was Vandoorne's closest <b>contender</b> <b>in</b> the session's opening segment, took fourth, ahead of Marciello who was stuck in second gear until his team corrected the issue. King was relegated to sixth by Marciello's fastest lap. Norman Nato and Rossi were seventh and eighth. Gasly made a mistake late in the session which restricted him to ninth and Sirotkin rounded out the top ten. Artem Markelov was the fastest driver to not qualify in the top-ten starting positions; his best lap time was seven-tenths of a second slower than Vandoorne. Haryanto ran strongly in the session's early period but took 12th after he was unable to improve on his second set of soft-compound tyres. He was ahead of Evans, Robert Visoiu, and Richie Stanaway. The two Carlin drivers qualified in 16th and 18th (with Julián Leal ahead of Marco Sørensen). They were separated by Sergio Canamasas in the faster of the two MP Motorsport cars. André Negrão, Daniël de Jong, Nathanaël Berthon, René Binder, Marlon Stöckinger, and Zoël Amberg were the last of the qualifiers.|$|E
