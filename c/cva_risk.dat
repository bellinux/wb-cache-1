CVA has to be calculated for each market risk scenario, resulting in 250 million simulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurologic {{complication}} is {{an adverse}} event associated with mechanical circulatory support. To decrease {{the incidence of}} embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) during support with the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS), an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) inflow conduit has been developed and introduced clinically. METHODS: Using clinical data from Europe and Canada, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of embolic CVA with the ePTFE inflow conduit (n= 88) {{in comparison with the}} previously used polyester inflow conduits (n= 310, including Vascutek n= 155 and Cooley n= 155). We calculated freedom from embolic <b>CVA,</b> <b>risk</b> reduction for embolic CVA, and linearized rates of embolic CVA. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the incidence of embolic CVA was demonstrated with the ePTFE conduit (ePTFE 10 % vs polyester 23 %, p= 0. 002). Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from embolic CVA at 180 days after implantation was 86 % for the ePTFE group vs 72 % for the polyester group (log-rank test, 0. 0185). We also found an associated risk reduction of 55 % in CVA occurrence in the ePTFE group when compared with the Polyester group (hazard ratio, 0. 445; 95 % confidence limit, 0. 222 - 0. 890; p= 0. 0221). Linearized CVA rates also were decreased at all time intervals after implantation in the ePTFE group. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical results with the newly introduced ePTFE inflow conduit provide compelling evidence that the ePTFE conduit material significantly decreases thromboembolic complications during mechanical circulatory support with the Novacor LVAS. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} insulin therapy, age and gender on the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) according to glycemic control. Methods and Results We performed a prospective cohort study (Japan Cholesterol and Diabetes Mellitus Study) of type 2 diabetes patients (n = 4014) for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the onset of fatal/non-fatal IHD and/or CVA, which occurred at rates of 7. 9 and 7. 2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. We divided diabetic patients into four groups based on age (≤ 70 and > 70) and hemoglobin A 1 C levels (≤ 7. 0 and > 7. 0 %). Multiple regression analysis revealed that IHD was associated with high systolic blood pressure and low HDL-C in patients under 70 years of age with fair glycemic control and was associated with low diastolic blood pressure in the older/fair group. Interestingly, insulin use was associated with IHD in the older/poor group (OR = 2. 27, 95 % CI = 1. 11 - 5. 89; p = 0. 026) and was associated with CVA in the older/fair group (OR = 2. 09, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 4. 25; p = 0. 028). CVA was associated with lower HDL-C and longer duration of diabetes in younger/poor glycemic control group. Results by stepwise analysis were similar. Next, patients were divided into four groups based on gender and diabetic control(hemoglobinA 1 C 7. 0 %). Multiple regression analysis revealed that IHD was associated with high systolic blood pressure in male/fair glycemic control group, age in male/poor control group, and short duration of diabetic history in females in both glycemic control groups. Interestingly, insulin use was associated with IHD in the male/poor group(OR = 4. 11, 95 % CI = 1. 22 - 8. 12; p = 0. 018) and with CVA in the female/poor group(OR = 3. 26, 95 % CI = 1. 12 - 6. 24; p = 0. 02). CVA was associated with short duration of diabetes in both female groups. Conclusions IHD and <b>CVA</b> <b>risks</b> are affected by specific factors in diabetics, such as treatment, gender and age. Specifically, insulin use has a potential role in preventing IHD but {{may also be a}} <b>risk</b> factor for <b>CVA</b> among the diabetic elderly, thus revealing a need to develop improved treatment strategies for diabetes in elderly patients.

40|$|IntroductionContradictory {{outcomes}} {{exist for}} different methods of carotid artery revascularization. Here we provide the comparative rates of adverse events in patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid artery stenting (CAS) with a distal embolic protection device (EPD), and CAS with a proximal flow reversal system (FRS) {{from a single}} institution by various specialists treating carotid artery disease. MethodsProcedural billing codes and the electronic medical records of patients undergoing revascularization for carotid artery stenosis from February 2007 through March 2010 were used for data collection. Primary outcome was the incidence of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), or death after CEA and CAS. Each practitioner determined the choice of therapy, with five of the 14 specialists providing both CAS and CEA. Baseline characteristics were examined for effect on outcome. Planned comparisons between and within groups were analyzed using χ 2, t tests, and analysis of variance, as appropriate. ResultsA total of 495 procedures were documented, comprising 226 CEA, 216 CAS with EPD, and 53 CAS with FRS. Preoperative comparisons of patient comorbidities were similar among the cohorts. The carotid artery stenosis was symptomatic in 42 % of these patients. Prior CEA was an indication for CAS rather than another CEA (P <. 001). Significantly fewer patients undergoing CEA were receiving preoperative antiplatelet therapy (P <. 001). The {{groups did not differ}} significantly in the overall composite end point of death, CVA, and MI (4 %, 5. 1 %, 0 %; P =. 1) or any individual major adverse event. Overall, patients undergoing CAS with EPD had a statistically significant greater incidence of minor CVAs than CEA patients (P =. 031), which was driven by the increased <b>CVA</b> <b>risk</b> for asymptomatic patients. Secondary end points occurred rarely (< 2 %). There have been no reoperations or interventions in these patients to date within this institution. ConclusionsWe have established a similar and low incidence of MI, CVA, and death among patients undergoing CEA and CAS, of whom approximately 40 % were symptomatic. FRS provided superior results in this series; however, its use was limited to 20 % of the CAS procedures. Still, zero adverse events in this cohort make FRS an exciting technology that warrants a large-scale prospective comparative study...|$|E
40|$|What have we learnt {{from the}} 2006 - 2012 crisis, {{including}} {{events such as}} the subprime crisis, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers or the European sovereign debt crisis, among others? It is usually assumed that in firms that have a CDS quotation, this CDS is the key factor in establishing the credit premiumrisk for a new financial asset. Thus, the CDS is a key element for any investor in taking relative value opportunities across a firm’s capital structure. In the first chapter we study the most relevant aspects of the microstructure of the CDS market in terms of pricing, to have a clear idea of how this market works. We consider that such an analysis is a necessary point for establishing a solid base {{for the rest of the}} chapters in order to carry out the different empirical studies we perform. In its document “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems”, Basel sets the requirement of a capital charge for credit valuation adjustment (<b>CVA)</b> <b>risk</b> in the trading book and its methodology for the computation for the capital requirement. This regulatory requirement has added extra pressure for in-depth knowledge of the CDS market and this motivates the analysis performed in this thesis. The problem arises in estimating of the credit risk premium for those counterparties without a directly quoted CDS in the market. How can we estimate the credit spread for an issuer without CDS? In addition to this, given the high volatility period in the credit market in the last few years and, in particular, after the default of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, we observe the presence of big outliers in the distribution of credit spread in the different combinations of rating, industry and region. After an exhaustive analysis of the results from the different models studied, we have reached the following conclusions. It is clear that hierarchical regression models fit the data much better than those of non-hierarchical regression. Furthermore,we generally prefer the median model (50 %-quantile regression) to the mean model (standard OLS regression) due to its robustness when assigning the price to a new credit asset without spread,minimizing the “inversion problem”. Finally, an additional fundamental reason to prefer the median model is the typical "right skewness" distribution of CDS spreads [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} concept of credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) focusing on the regulatory CVA capital charge. Regulatory <b>CVA</b> capitalizes the <b>risk</b> of losses due to deterioration in a counterparty's credit quality within a bilateral OTC trade. The two approaches defined in Basel III, the standardized and the advanced method, are analyzed and compared. The individual steps in the complex advanced method are uncovered and a simplified methodology is suggested, replacing banks' internal models. Capital charges are computed under both methods for several hypothetical portfolios. Furthermore, sensitivities of both models to trade parameters are quantified {{as well as the}} effect of risk mitigators such as netting and collateral.

40|$|In this work, {{we think}} to a {{possible}} real situation where two defaultable counterparties want to de fine a CSA in which both of them need the flexibility and the possibility to activate the collateralization during {{the life of the}} underlying claim/contract. We refer speci cally to a contingent risk mitigation mechanism that allows the counterparty to switch from zero to full/perfect collateralization (or even partial) and switch back whenever she wants until maturity paying some switching costs and taking into account the running costs that emerge over time. The running costs that we model and consider in the analysis of this problem are - by one side - those related to <b>CVA</b> namely counterparty <b>risk</b> hedging costs and - by the other side - the collateral and funding/liquidity costs that emerge when collateralization is active. We show the solution existence and uniqueness for the problem so defined, we build also an algorithm to determine numerically the value function and the optimal switching strategy. We also generalize the analysis allowing the strategic interaction between the parties and facing in the end the pricing problem of a general contract of this kind through reflected backward SDE technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a methodologic {{analysis}} of (trends in) incidence and mortality of cerebrovascular accidents (<b>CVA,</b> stroke), and <b>risk</b> factors for stroke are presented. Special {{attention has been paid}} to the design, analysis and comparability of the data and validity of the results. Countries differ widely in incidence and mortality of stroke. In the past three decades the incidence and mortality of non-hemorrhagic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhages have been decreasing mondially with 18 - 50 %. Hypertension is the most important independent risk factor for all types of stroke. This has been confirmed results of clinical trials evaluating the effect of treatment of hypertension. Transient ischemic attacks and stenosis of the carotid artery increase the risk for stroke. Cardial disorders, smoking of cigarettes and diabetes mellitus are also risk factors for stroke. Alcohol consumption gives a greater risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Serum cholesterol appears to be inversely associated with the hemorrhagic types of stroke. Vitamine C and potassium are possibly protective against death from hemorrhagic resp. thrombo-embolic stroke. Clinical trials provide evidence that treatment of persons with aspirin who had one or more transient ischemic attachs (TIA) lowers the incidence and mortality from stroke.

40|$|Introduction: Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) infections can have various presentations {{including}} Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) which may go unrecognized as {{a presentation of}} infection. We describe three cases of different CNS infections complicated by CVA. Presentation: Case 1 describes a 27 -year-old man, presenting with symptoms consistent with a transient ischemic attack found to have racemose neurocysticercosis. Case 2 describes a 55 -year-old man with low grade fevers for 4 weeks accompanied by visual and gait disturbances and delayed speech diagnosed with multiple small left thalamocapsular and superior cerebellar infarcts secondary to cryptococcal meningitis. The third case describes a man with pneumococcal meningitis complicated by cerebellar infarcts. Discussion: CNS vascular compromise secondary to infections {{may be due to}} vasculitis, an immune-mediated parainfectious process causing vasospasm or thrombosis, or a hypercoagulable state with endothelial dysfunction. Patients with <b>CVAs</b> are at <b>risk</b> for aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections (especially catheter related) and other nosocomial infections and their clinical presentation may be very similar to CNS infections. Conclusion: The cases described demonstrate that CNS infections need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of CVAs presenting with fevers. The signs and symptoms of non-CNS infections associated with CVAs may be clinically indistinguishable from those of CNS infections. The outcomes of untreated CNS infections are extremely poor. It is thus imperative to have a high index of suspicion for CNS infection when evaluating CVAs with fevers or other signs of infection...|$|R
40|$|An uncollateralized swap hedged {{back-to-back}} by a CCP swap is used {{to introduce}} FVA. The open IR 01 of FVA, however, is {{a sure sign of}} risk not being fully hedged, a theoretical no-arbitrage pricing concern, and a bait to lure market risk capital, a practical business concern. By dynamically trading the CCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure hedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully replicated, leaving out no IR 01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained by applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to counterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a liability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of funding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is redefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation adjustment, coherent with <b>CVA,</b> the default <b>risk</b> component. A Longstaff-Schwartz style least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the recursive fair value and adjustments. A separately developed finite difference scheme {{is used to}} test and find regression necessary to decouple the discount rate switch. Preliminary results show the impact of counterparty risk to swap hedge ratios, swap bid/ask spreads, and valuation adjustments, and considerable errors of calculating CVA by discounting cash flow or potential future exposure.

The {{aim of this study}} was to set a profile of the patients diagnosed with CVA, who had been assisted at the Physical Therapy Neurological Clinic of Passo Fundo University, from March- 2005 to March- 2006. This was a quantitative, descriptive and retrospective documental study with data collecting on 43 medical records, in which the following variables were studied: the patient’s gender, race, age group and origin, illness occurrence, type of <b>CVA,</b> functional diagnosis, <b>risk</b> factors, secondary complications, and the situation of the assistance. The outcomes showed that 31 (72. 09 %) patients were males, 39 (90. 7 %) were whites and the predominant age group was 50 to 59 years old.

Prevention, including CVA education and education regarding behavioral modifications, should be an essential aspect of health care to lower overall risk and incidence of CVAs in women. The primary purpose of this project was to develop and implement an educational session that would incorporate behavioral modification interventions for women who are at high-risk for CVAs. This project was conducted by a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student and implemented through an education and behavioral modification empowerment class. The class consisted of 30 women currently enrolled in the well-integrated screening and evaluation for women across the nation (WISEWOMAN) program at Jordan Valley Community Health Center. Outcomes of the interventions evaluated through the Stroke Knowledge Test and the Cerebrovascular Attitudes and Beliefs Scale and results were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank-test.
