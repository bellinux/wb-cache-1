2500|$|Both <b>carvones</b> {{are used}} in the food and flavor industry. [...] R-(−)-Carvone is also used for air {{freshening}} products and, like many essential oils, oils containing <b>carvones</b> {{are used in}} aromatherapy and alternative medicine.|$|R
2500|$|S-(+)-Carvone is the {{principal}} constituent (60–70%) of the oil from caraway seeds (Carum carvi), which is produced {{on a scale of}} about 10 tonnes per year. [...] It also occurs to the extent of about 40–60% in dill seed oil (from Anethum graveolens), and also in mandarin orange peel oil. R-(–)-Carvone is also the most abundant compound in the essential oil from several species of mint, particularly spearmint oil (Mentha spicata), which is composed of 50–80% R-(–)-carvone. [...] Spearmint is a major source of naturally produced R-(–)-carvone. [...] However, the majority of R-(–)-carvone used in commercial applications is synthesized from R-(+)-limonene. The R-(–)-carvone isomer also occurs in kuromoji oil. Some oils, like gingergrass oil, contain a mixture of both enantiomers. Many other natural oils, for example peppermint oil, contain trace quantities of <b>carvones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Subjects {{were able}} to detect quality {{differences}} between /?-<-) - and S-(+) -carvone solutions when the solutions were equated for subjective intensity or concentration. When the two <b>carvones</b> were mixed, both qualities were perceived. A number of investigators have suggested that, in some cases, enantiomers of a com-pound provide different odor sensations (Friedman and Miller, 1971; Leitereg et al., 1971; Russell and Hills, 1971; Borden etai, 1975). Thus, for some compounds, the olfactory receptors seem capable of differentiating odor quality when {{the only difference between}} these compounds is their chirality. The {{purpose of the present study}} was (i) to examine the intensity estimates of/?-(—) -and 5 - (+) -carvone over a range of suprathreshold concentrations; (ii) to compare estimates of quality when the two enantiomers were matched for subjective intensity or concentration; and (iii) to compare the two enantiomers when presented in equal concentration mixtures. The experiment was conducted in three parts using a total of 50 undergraduate students experimentally naive to the psychophysical techniques of scaling odorants. The sub...|$|R

25|$|<b>Carvone</b> forms two {{mirror image}} forms or enantiomers: R-(–)-carvone smells like {{spearmint}} leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, smells like caraway seeds. The {{fact that the}} two enantiomers are perceived as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also {{been found to be}} able to discriminate between <b>carvone</b> enantiomers.|$|E

The less common L-isomer is found in mint oils and has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|E
40|$|The {{trigeminal nerve}} {{responds}} {{to a wide}} variety of irritants. Trigeminal nerve fibers express several receptors that respond to chemicals, including TRPV 1 (vanilloid) receptors, acid-sensing ion channels, P 2 X (purinergic) receptors, and nicotinic acetylcho-line receptors. In order to assess whether TRPV 1 plays a role in responses to a broad array of substances, TRPV 1 (along with green fluorescent protein) was expressed in human embyonic kidney cells (HEK) 293 t cells which were then stimulated with diverse trigeminal irritants. Calcium imaging was used to measure responses to capsaicin, amyl acetate, cyclohexanone, acetic acid, toluene, benzaldehyde, () -nicotine, (R) -(+) -limonene, (R) -() -carvone, and (S) -(+) -carvone. Three irritants (acetic acid and the 2 <b>carvones)</b> stimulated nontransfected controls. Two irritants (capsaicin and cyclohexanone) stimulated only transfected cells. The response could be eliminated with capsazepine, a TRPV 1 blocker. The 5 remaining irritants were nonstimulatory in both nontransfected and transfected cells. Because all the compounds tested on HEK cells elicited neural responses from the ethmoid branch of the trigeminal nerve in rats, the 5 nonstimulatory compounds must do so by a non-TRPV 1 receptor. These results suggest that TRPV 1 serves as a receptor for both cyclohexanone and capsaicin in trigeminal nerve endings.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{comprehend}} the strategy of odor encoding by odorant receptors, we isolated 2740 mouse receptor neurons from four olfactory epithelial zones and classified {{them in terms of}} their sensitivities and tuning specificities to a chiral pair of odorants, S(+) -carvone (caraway-like odor) and R(–) -carvone (spearmint-like odor). Our approach revealed that the majority of receptors at the lowest effective stimulus concentration represented the principal odor qualities characteristic of each enantiomer by means of the principal odor qualities of the odorants for which the receptors were most sensitive. The chiral-non-discriminating receptors became 3. 7 times of R(–) -carvone-sensitive receptors in the subpopulations when the stimulus concentration was increased 10 -fold. More than 80 % of the responsive receptors (an estimated 70 ± α types) exhibited overlapping sensitivities between the enantiomers. The signals from the non-discriminating receptors may be reduced to decode the characteristic odor identity for R(–) -carvone in the brain over an adequate range of stimulus strengths. The information processing of odors appears to involve the selective weighting of the signals from the most sensitive receptors. An analysis of the overall receptor codes to <b>carvones</b> indicated that the system employs hierarchical receptor codes: principal odor qualities are encoded by the most sensitive receptors and lower-ranked odor qualities by less sensitive receptors.
