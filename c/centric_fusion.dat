The karyotype of the house mouse normally consists of 40 telocentric chromosomes, but in certain regions in Europe, mice with karyotypes containing fewer than 40 chromosomes can be found. The reduction in chromosome number is due to <b>centric</b> <b>fusion</b> (Robertsonian translocation) of two telocentrics into a single metacentric. Klein’s group found populations with metacentric chromosomes in different regions of Europe, but concentrated its effort on the system of metacentrics in southern Germany. An in-depth study of these populations revealed subdivision into subpopulations, which correlated with that established by the studies of H2 polymorphism.|$|E

We suggest that the fusion burst may be induced by the physical proximity of telomeres on the nuclear membrane, and the exchange of DNA strands by errors of telomere replication mechanisms. The cytogenetical significance of the fusion burst is discussed with regard to the minimum interaction hypothesis proposed by Imai et al. (1986). We suggest two closely linked possibilities that (1) the fusion burst in man and mouse can theoretically be placed in karyotype evolution as a transitional phase in the main stream of the fission-inversion cycle, and (2) it may be accelerated by some unknown (mutagenic) factors other than ionizing radiation...|$|E

They {{exist in a}} variety of taxonomic groups (Walker 1964, Gupta and Sundaran 1994, Baimai 1998, He et al. 2003). Among genetic variations, karyotype differentiation is frequently found among the most closely related species (Miller and Stone 1962, Wilson et al. 1969, Baimai and Chumchong 1980, He et al. 2003). Within the Drosophila immi-grans species group, D. albomicans and D. nasuta are a pair of such species. Drosophila albomicans has neo-sex chromosomes (3 -X and 3 -Y), and D. nasuta contains the ancestral chromosome set (3 / 3, X, and Y) (Fig. 1). Interspecific mating suc-cess between these 2 species reaches 93 % in the laboratory (Chang and Ayala 1989), and their fer-tile hybrids can be maintained for over 300 gener-ations (Tanuja et al. 1999). However, no hybrids have ever been found in natural populations. The hypothesis that a <b>centric</b> <b>fusion</b> between the X chromosomes and the ancestral 3 rd chro-mosome occurs, followed by another <b>centric</b> <b>fusion</b> between the Y chromosome and the 3 rd chromo-some producing the karyotype of D. albomicans (2 n = 6), has been proposed (Ranganath and Hägele 1981, Yu et al. 1997).

However, mammalian case studies are essentially restricted to pathologic fusions in human, {{or to the}} house mouse Roberstonian (Rb) races. We here provide an example in a wild gerbil rodent, Gerbillus nigeriae, which displays an extensive Rb polymorphism, with 2 n ranging between 2 n = 60 and 74. The distribution of two closely related repeats, GERB 1 and GERB 2 that were previously isolated by Volobouev et al. (Chromosoma 104 : 252 - 259, 1995) in this African species, were investigated in the genomes of seven individuals with various diploid numbers. Our results clearly show that GERB 1 and GERB 2 are organized in a non-random manner, with GERB 2 and GERB 1 being clearly juxtacentromeric and centromeric, respectively. Finally, cloning and sequencing revealed that, unlike GERB 2, GERB 1 monomers display a more homogeneous organization at both the nucleotide and structural levels. Altogether, our results point toward a pivotal role of GERB 1 repeats in the mediation of Rb fusions through heterologous recombination, with some evidence of subsequent loss of repeats after the Rb fusion {{during the course of}} evolution of metacentric elements. Moreover, the repeat pattern observed in G. nigeriae closely matches the organization and sequence structure of satellite DNAs described in human acrocentrics. Consequently, G. nigeriae appears as an additional model for the study of repeat evolution and its role in <b>centric</b> <b>fusions</b> and their consequences in mammals...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Robertsonian translocations are {{the most}} {{frequent}} chromosomal aberrations in cattle. The first robertsonian translocation described was the 1 / 29 translocation. Like other <b>centric</b> <b>fusions,</b> this abnormality reduces fertility {{as a consequence of}} genetic excess or deficiency in the germ cells, increasing early embryonic mortality. The incidence of 1 / 29 translocationin in 89 Aberdeen Angus cattle (38 dams and 51 sires) belonging to 4 farms of the Buenos Aires Province was analyzed, as well as the Y chromosome morphology. Heparinized blood samples were obtained and cultured for cytogenetic analysis. The results obtained showed the absence of the 1 / 29 translocation in all the animals studied. In all the bulls analyzed Y chromosome morphology was submetacentric. The results obtained in the present work are in concordance with previously results reported for the British beef breeds, like Aberdeen Angus. On the other hand the animals studied did not show fertility reduction, then this could be associated with the absence of the 1 / 29 translocation.

Studies on synaptic behavior of chromosomes at pachytene substage of meiotic prophase I in carriers of <b>centric</b> <b>fusions</b> (cattle, sheep, goat, pig, and blue fox) showed that the trivalent is rarely involved in an association with the sex bivalent. In carriers of reciprocal translocations (pig and cattle) a wide range of synaptic configurations were found. Besides the expected cross-shaped quadrivalent, the following configurations were observed: open quadrivalent, trivalent plus univalent, and two heteromorphic bivalents. The latter configurations were quite frequently involved in the association with XY bivalent. Studies of synaptonemal complexes in interspecies hybrids (cattle x zebu, river x swamp buffalo, blue fox x silver fox) revealed a wide range of synaptic disturbances. Cases of pericentric inversions, aneuploidy, and chromosomal polymorphisms are also reviewed. This survey shows that synaptonemal complex analysis is a very useful tool in studies on causes of altered fertility in carriers of abnormal chromosome complemen...|$|R
