500|$|The Terrans are {{displayed}} as standard humans, {{and are often}} seen in-game in powered <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> and with other war machines such as futuristic tanks and space battlecruisers in use by their militaries. Some Terrans {{are displayed}} with cybernetic implants. Human behavior in the fictional history presented in StarCrafts manual also points to the Terrans having the ability to access and deplete a planet's natural resources at an [...] "alarming" [...] rate. The Terrans are also noted in the backstory of the series as having a developing psionic potential. This psionic potential is what entices the Zerg to attack the Terrans, in hope of incorporating these traits into the Zerg gene pool. This psionic element is shown in Terran military technology through Assassins known as Ghosts. Established {{as one of the}} iconic parts of StarCraft, Ghosts are Terrans who are born with ranging psionic abilitiesfrom simple telepathy to advanced powers such as telekinesis or a special ability shown by Nova, where she can kill an entire skyscraper of people in a single thought known as a mind blast. [...] These agents are cultivated by the military after being abducted from their former lives and put through an espionage training regime that can cost them their lives. In-game, the Ghost unit is equipped with a cloaking device and is designed for scouting and designating targets for nuclear strike, and has been developed further through the lore of the series {{to the extent that the}} [...] sub-series was once planned, specifically focusing on the life of a Ghost, Nova.|$|E
2500|$|War {{within the}} Culture is mostly fought by the Culture's sentient warships, the most {{powerful}} of these being war-converted GSVs, which are described as powerful enough to oppose whole enemy fleets. The Culture has little use for conventional ground forces (as it rarely occupies enemy territory); combat drones equipped with knife missiles do appear in Descendant and [...] "terror weapons" [...] (basically intelligent, nano-form assassins) are mentioned in Look to Windward, while infantry <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> of great power (also usable as capable combat drones when without living occupants) are used in Matter.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Combat</b> <b>Suit</b> Monster - The meteor monster {{featured}} in Act III. Kawamata's nemesis, Sergei, becomes this monster after an accident which thawed a captured amoeba {{that was in}} possession of Sergei's unit. After it escapes, it bonds with Sergei driving him mad resulting in Sergei devouring his own unit. Iba, Kawamata's successor, is sent to combat the newly born monster before it goes out of control. It is armed with an extending mandible and covered with <b>Combat</b> <b>Suit</b> armor.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the level}} of heat stress {{imparted}} by the in-service Chemical and Biological (CB) Mk IV overgarment a new lightweight CB <b>combat</b> <b>suit</b> has been developed. This has subsequently led to a requirement to develop a CB flying suit. The major prerequisite for the CB flying suit is that it must not ignite or support combustion while still providing adequate CB protection. This report details the evaluation of a range of alternate textile fabrics for use in developing a CB <b>combat</b> <b>suit</b> that is suitable both as a flying suit for aircrew and as a specialised item for ground troops. Bench scale flammability testing of the in-service Mk IV overgarment, the CB <b>combat</b> <b>suit</b> and various ensembles and laminates was undertaken. The relationship between these results and the physical properties of the fabrics is outlined...|$|R

Portable version of Garmony air defence radar is supplied to the VDV. Airborne Troops have received new technology military binoculars.|$|E
5000|$|Matsuzaki - He is Kawamata’s sidekick, so to speak. Originally, an {{engineer}} {{who developed the}} designs for the combat suit. When he and Kawamata escaped to Japan, he upgraded the combat suit to Type D status, which is far stronger than the [...] "Type C" [...] <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> the Russians had. He was somewhat of a mad scientist. He and Kawamata are not friends who share a shaky business relationship.|$|E
50|$|Joe Haldeman's novel The Forever War (1974) {{featured}} armored vacuum <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> {{which were}} similar in principle but more advanced in design. Because the novel takes place over the timespan of several hundred years, {{the evolution of the}} battle suits can be observed and commented on by the lead character throughout with new features introduced — such as emergency hydraulic-powered joints which sever the limb of a soldier and inject anesthetics and blood plasma if enough damage is inflicted and a risk of decompression is apparent.|$|E

5000|$|Overlord's initial strike put all {{the major}} capitals {{of the world in}} the Zone. The chaos sparks {{international}} cooperation even between the United States and the Soviet Union. To counter the effects of the Zone bacteria, British scientists create a rare material called Neutron-90. However, only a limited amount of Neutron-90 is remaining in the world after the British government orders the destruction of the only laboratory where the material is produced. There is only enough material left to build <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> for five specially-trained soldiers called the Spiral Force, also known as the [...] "Zone Riders." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mills is a {{founding}} member of Underground Resistance, a techno collective that he started with former Parliament bass player 'Mad' Mike Banks. The group embraced revolutionary rhetoric and only appeared in public dressed in ski masks and black <b>combat</b> <b>suits.</b> Mills never [...] "officially" [...] left the group, but did begin to pursue his own ventures outside of the collective. Many of Underground Resistance's labelmate's early releases were the product of various experiments by Banks and Mills, both solo and in collaboration, before Mills left the collective in 1991 to achieve international success as a solo artist and DJ. The collective continues to be a mainstay of Detroit's music scene.|$|E

5000|$|A {{report by}} the National Audit Office stated that [...] "given that the joint rapid {{reaction}} forces are intended {{to be able to}} operate anywhere in the world, it is a concern that the MoD does not hold sufficient stocks of desert <b>combat</b> <b>suits</b> to equip the Forces." [...] Despite these myriad problems, the MoD called the exercise a [...] "success" [...] and said that [...] "the key point of major exercises is that they allow us to identify the challenges our forces might face when actually operating in such testing conditions. We have made comprehensive arrangements for identifying lessons and, where necessary, we will make improvements to our equipment and procedures." ...|$|E

50|$|Kawamata is a {{psychotic}} {{soldier who}} fell {{in with the}} Russian Special Operation Forces. It was {{at this time that}} Kawamata became the guinea pig for this secret scientific research organization. The Russians wanted to ensure that they were ahead of the U.S. in the arms race, and used this organization to develop a mobile <b>combat</b> <b>suit,</b> armed to the teeth with all kinds of weapons imaginable. During his tenure on the project, Kawamata met Matsuzaki, a twisted scientist who was kicked out of Japan for unscrupulous practices. Matsuzaki became lead engineer on the <b>combat</b> <b>suit</b> project and coded Kawamata’s thought impulses into the control mechanism, so only he can operate the walking arsenal. But when Communist Russia collapsed, Kawamata and Matsuzaki stole the armored battle suit and snuck it into Japan.|$|R
5000|$|The Combat Suit was {{originally}} {{developed by the}} Russian Special Forces and acts {{sort of like a}} mobile tank. It was created due to Russia and America's arms race during the Cold War. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the project was rendered obsolete. During its manufacturing, Russia was only able to get their Combat Suit line up to [...] "Type C" [...] status. Kawamata and Matsuzaki steals one of the Russian [...] "Type C" [...] <b>Combat</b> <b>Suits</b> after the collapse and escape to Japan. There, it was given modifications and upgrades including the latest control devices, gun tracks, and turbine engines. In addition, the suit was programmed to be piloted by Kawamata only and served as a fail safe should anyone else attempt to take it.|$|E
50|$|Learning from Commander Qom that he {{has been}} {{relieved}} of duty, Geki finds himself being attacked by Gavan as he ends the youth's indecision as only he can stop the rebirth of Don Horror.

Sergei arrived at Kawamata’s home and successfully killed him despite Iba’s attempts to protect his mentor. Suddenly, another meteor appeared and was secured by Sergei’s commandoes, but in a freak accident, the meteor thawed from its confinement and the ooze infected Sergei turning him into the Combat Suit Monster and went on a rampage and ate the other commandos. Now it was up to Iba to fight this beast. The end of the movie ended in a cliffhanger, where Kawamata’s brain is preserved for study; further denying him any peace even after death.|$|E
