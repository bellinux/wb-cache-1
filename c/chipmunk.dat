5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern <b>chipmunk</b> characters, or {{borrowed}} a pet <b>chipmunk</b> from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animals are}} unique to Craters of the Moon and the {{surrounding}} area. Subspecies of Great Basin pocket mouse, American pika, yellow-pine <b>chipmunk,</b> and yellow-bellied marmot are found nowhere else. Lava tube beetles and many other cave animals are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Small mammal {{species that}} inhabit along the trails are beaver, squirrel, river otter, <b>chipmunk,</b> porcupine, bobcat, {{two species of}} fox, boar, woodchuck, raccoon, and coyote. Bird species that reside in the trails are wild turkey, ruffed grouse, {{mourning}} dove, raven, two species of eagle, wood duck, three species of owl, and three species of hawk as well as warblers.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911. Timmy Tiptoes is a squirrel believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows, and imprisoned by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement. Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee, a friendly, mischievous <b>chipmunk</b> who has run away from his wife and is camping-out in the tree. Chippy urges the prisoner to eat the nuts stored in the tree, and Timmy does so but grows so fat he cannot escape the tree. He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree. The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less than harmonious marriage of the <b>chipmunk.</b>|$|E
5|$|The artwork {{became one}} of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of a brick wall dressed in ripped jeans and leather jackets was copied by Alvin and the Chipmunks in <b>Chipmunk</b> Punk. Ramoness artwork was ranked number 58 on Rolling Stones 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.|$|E
5|$|Species {{lists for}} the park include about 50 mammals, 86 birds, 11 {{reptiles}} and amphibians, 8 bats, more than 200 arthropods, 8 snails and slugs, 75 butterflies, more than 55 moths, and 8 aquatic macroinvertebrates. Of these species, 160 are found inside the cave. Outside the cave, the black-tailed deer, Steller's jay, the common raven, and Townsend's <b>chipmunk</b> are among animals often seen in the park. Less commonly sighted are the black bear, cougar, northern flying squirrel, and Pacific giant salamander. Springs and other wet places support flatworms, frogs, and snails.|$|E

5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, <b>chipmunk,</b> snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, <b>chipmunk,</b> brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, eastern <b>chipmunk,</b> and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September 2011 Trafalgar Square staged International Paralympic Day, {{hosted by}} Rick Edwards, Ade Adepitan and Iwan Thomas, to {{coincide}} with a visit to London by representatives of the IPC. The event celebrated the Paralympic Games, showcasing and demonstrating the 20 sports that would feature during the Games (with some sessions also made inclusive to people with hearing disabilities). It also featured appearances by Paralympic athletes Oscar Pistorius, Ellie Simmonds and Sascha Kindred, and the unveiling of a bronze statue of Pistorius by Ben Dearnley. British Prime Minister David Cameron and London's mayor Boris Johnson also appeared. Two days later on 10 September, supermarket chain Sainsbury's and Channel 4 presented Sainsbury's Super Saturday, a family event at Clapham Common. The event featured showcases of Paralympic sports, and a concert featuring pop music acts including Nicola Roberts, Olly Murs, The Wanted, Will Young, Pixie Lott, Dappy, Sugababes, The Saturdays, <b>Chipmunk</b> and Taio Cruz.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least <b>chipmunk,</b> muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E

25|$|Both Italy and Israel {{bought a}} single TE-1B Buckaroo in 1948.

25|$|Species {{that are}} {{typically}} found in these forested areas are black bear, red fox, mule deer, marten, cougar, brown creeper, {{a variety of}} <b>chipmunk</b> species, raccoon, mountain chickadee, pika, a variety of squirrel species, white-headed woodpecker, coyote, bobcat, weasel, a variety of mouse species, long-toed salamander, skunk, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
