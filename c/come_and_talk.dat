5|$|On September 6, 1915, {{police detective}} Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is {{summoned to the}} siege of a {{decrepit}} manor house in Boston. The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with {{no option but to}} investigate. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years.|$|E
