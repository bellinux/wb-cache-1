5|$|Chandler's mentor Harry F.

In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting U.S. military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate <b>conservatives.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Lynch is {{considered}} a conservative to moderate Democrat. He is pro-life and has been attacked by pro-choice group NARAL. He sided with <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2005 Terri Schiavo case, voting for federal court intervention in the case. In more recent years, he has advocated for and defended funding for Planned Parenthoood. He has sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, however, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. He supports same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding of Yorkshire Council {{is based}} in Beverley, in the former {{headquarters}} of Humberside County Council, and East Riding County Council before that. There are 26 wards electing a total of 67 councillors in the District. The council elects on a four-yearly cycle with all seats up for election at the same time. It first had elections in 1995—a year before it came into its powers—as a shadow authority. Between 1995 and 2007 the council had No overall control. In the 2007 local elections the Conservative Party gained a majority of seats, {{including those of the}} Liberal Democrat and Labour Party leaders. The council has a leader-and-executive system, the leader being Stephen Parnaby of the <b>Conservatives.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Audit Commission report covering 2007 the council was given a four-star rating, which places the authority {{as one of the best}} in the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if {{in the way of}} his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were for the betterment of South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party for the rest of his career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E

5|$|In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a {{separate}} campaign from the LCL as a whole. The {{majority of the}} LCL's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and {{it was hoped that}} enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LCL would be better off losing to Labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party, as Labor's vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to {{a separate}} Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL's defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in tune with urban mainstream, but {{there was no evidence that}} urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.|$|E
