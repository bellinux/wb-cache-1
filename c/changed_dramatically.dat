It has not <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> for over four billion years, and will remain fairly stable {{for more than five}} billion more. However, after {{hydrogen}} fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both internally and externally.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b> Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b> Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E

5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia with Love, although this situation <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{records from}} 1906 show around 5,000 Circassians living in Amman and {{virtually}} no inhabitants who spoke Arabic. The city's demographics <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> after the Ottoman government's decision {{to construct the}} Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically,</b> as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically,</b> as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|Florida Atlantic has <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{since its}} opening in 1964. As of 2013, {{there are more}} than 30,000 {{students}} attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120miles (193km). The university consists of ten colleges and employs more than 3,200 faculty and staff. The university's endowment decreased from $182 million in June 2008 to $142 million in January 2009 due to a worsening economy. However, with the national economic recovery the endowment has increased to $179 million by the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b> I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b> Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship to travel from Barfleur in Normandy across to England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|E
5|$|In {{his years}} as the Bengals' head coach, Brown took the team to the playoffs three times, {{including}} in 1970. Yet despite finding a franchise quarterback in Ken Anderson, Brown's team never got past {{the first round of}} the postseason tournament. Four days after the Bengals were eliminated from the playoffs in 1975, Brown announced he was retiring after 45 years of coaching. The game had <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> during his time in the NFL, growing from America's second sport to the country's biggest and most lucrative pastime. Brown was 67 years old.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored {{personnel}} carriers and 30 cars had been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots were exchanged {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; {{it has not}} <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{for more than four}} billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After {{hydrogen}} fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring {{became one of the}} brightest features in the Uranian ring system.|$|E
