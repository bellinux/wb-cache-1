There was also a need for extending pedagogical repertoires of pre-service and practicing teachers to recognize TPACK as a beginning to multiliteracies as well as adopting a pedagogy of design, and incorporating critical literacy into instruction.

2500|$|<b>Cornell</b> <b>notes</b> that Rome also {{conquered the}} Praetutii. They lived {{to the east}} of the Sabines, on the Adriatic coast and were at odds with the Picentes, who were Roman allies. With these two conquests the Roman {{territory}} extended into the Apennines area next to her and a strip of it stretched to the Adriatic Sea. [...] This, combined with the mentioned alliances struck after the Second Samnite War with the Marsi, Marrucini, and Paeligni (304 BC) and the Vestini (302 BC), gave Rome control of this part of central Italy. The Samnites were forced to become allies of Rome which must have been on unequal terms. Rome offered a friendship treaty (foedus amicitiae) to those who allied with her voluntarily, but not to those who became allies as a result of defeat. The Romans also established a colony at Venusia, an important strategic point in south-eastern Samnium. The Lucanians retained their alliance with Rome. The result of the Samnite Wars was that Rome became the great power of Italy and controlled a large portion of it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cornell</b> <b>notes</b> that, {{according}} to Livy and his sources, the regular and unbroken sharing of the consulship {{stemmed from the}} Lex Genucia proposed by the plebeian tribune Lucius Genucius in 342 BC which, it is claimed, allowed plebeians to hold both consulships. However, the Fasti consulares (a chronicle of yearly events in which the years are denoted by their consuls) suggest that this law made it obligatory for one consulship to be held by a plebeian. This most probably explains why the first instance of plebeians holding both consulships was in 173 BC despite Livy's interpretation. It might be {{that it was the}} Lex Genucia which truly introduced power-sharing between patricians and plebeians and that the Lex Licinia Sextia may simply have been an administrative adjustment which transferred plebeian access to the highest office from the consular tribunes to the consulship and, thus, Lucius Sextius becoming the first plebeian consul [...] "becomes rather less impressive." [...] Von Fritz and Sordi also think that the Lex Licinia Sextia on the consuls and the praetors was an administrative reform.|$|R
