5|$|In 1986, {{a larger}} 100cc HA05E engine model was {{introduced}} especially for Asian markets. The newer 100cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new {{features such as}} a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The 100cc model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the <b>carbureted</b> EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.|$|E
25|$|At AirVenture 2011, {{the company}} {{announced}} that the engine was commencing volume production and was flying in both fuel-injected and <b>carbureted</b> versions.|$|E
25|$|The Continental A40 {{engine is}} a <b>carbureted</b> four-cylinder, {{horizontally}} opposed, air-cooled aircraft engine {{that was developed}} especially for use in light aircraft by Continental Motors. It was produced between 1931 and 1941.|$|E
2500|$|Acetylene was {{discovered}} in 1836 by Edmund Davy, who identified it as a [...] "...new <b>carburet</b> of hydrogen." [...] It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who coined the name acétylène.|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} {{shows no sign}} of {{reduction}} in the rate of increase, it seems inevitable that the price must continue to rise until demand is reduced either by {{reduction in the number of}} motors used or by the introduction of other kinds of <b>carburetting</b> material.

5000|$|In 1836, Edmund Davy {{discovered}} a gas which he recognised as [...] "a new <b>carburet</b> of hydrogen." [...] It was an accidental discovery {{while attempting to}} isolate potassium metal. By heating potassium carbonate with carbon at very high temperatures, he produced a residue {{of what is now}} known as potassium carbide, (K2C2), which reacted with water to release the new gas. (A similar reaction between calcium carbide and water was subsequently widely used for the manufacture of acetylene.) ...|$|R
25|$|It was marketed in Ecuador, Chile, Canada and the U.S. from 1985 to 1988 – with Suzuki {{offering}} the supermini {{with either a}} <b>carbureted</b> 1.0-liter inline-three cylinder or fuel injected 1.0-liter inline 3 cylinder turbocharged engine.|$|E
25|$|The 75 engine range at launch {{featured}} four-cylinder 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol <b>carbureted</b> engines, a 2.0-litre intercooled turbodiesel made by VM Motori, and a 2.5-litre {{fuel injected}} V6. In 1986, the 75 Turbo was introduced, which featured a fuel-injected 1779 cc twin-cam engine using Garrett T3 turbocharger, intercooler and oil cooler.|$|E
25|$|The -A, -C and -E {{variants}} of the <b>carbureted</b> O-320, {{but none of}} the high compression or fuel-injected versions, have available STCs that allow the use of automotive fuel as a replacement for more expensive avgas. However, in some cases the D series engine, with a fuel-pump modification, is allowed to use minimum 91 octane automotive gas as part of an STC for the Piper aircraft to which it is attached.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} (American English) or carburettor (British English; see spelling differences) is {{a device}} that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine in the proper ratio for combustion. It is sometimes colloquially shortened to carb in the UK and North America or carby in Australia. To carburate or <b>carburet</b> (and thus carburation or carburetion, respectively) is to blend the air and fuel or to equip (an engine) with a carburetor for that purpose. A buret or burette is equipment for measuring liquids accurately.|$|R
5000|$|Acetylene was {{discovered}} in 1836 by Edmund Davy, who identified it as a [...] "new <b>carburet</b> of hydrogen". It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who coined the name [...] "acétylène".Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (C4H2), {{as well as the}} alternative name [...] "quadricarbure d'hydrogène" [...] (hydrogen quadricarbide) were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the effluent. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a carbon arc. Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities hydrogen sulfide and phosphine. However, as purity increases it will become odourless.|$|R
2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original air blast is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second air blast in the other two chambers in which the oil for <b>carburetting</b> is decomposed. These chambers contain a quantity of loose fire brick called “checker work,” and the air gas is burned in them during the time the air blast is on the main producer. When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the air blast is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between air blast for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|R
25|$|This {{engine was}} used in the 1970 AMX as the base engine and also in the 1970 Rebel, 1971-1978 Matador, Jeep J-series trucks 1970-1987, Wagoneer (SJ) models from 1972 to 1984, Cherokee (SJ) from 1974 to 1983, {{as well as in the}} {{full-sized}} Grand Wagoneer from 1984 to 1991 - becoming the last <b>carbureted</b> engine used in an American-built vehicle. The 360 V8 was also installed in the Bricklin SV-1 sports car for 1974 model year.|$|E
25|$|The NASCAR Pinty's Series is a NASCAR racing {{series in}} Canada that {{derives from the}} old CASCAR Super Series (founded in 1981 and bought out by NASCAR in 2006). The new series has races through six of Canada's provinces {{for a total of}} 13 events with TV {{coverage}} on TSN. Many drivers are content running in Canada while others move up to bigger NASCAR series including J. R. Fitzpatrick and Andrew Ranger. The cars are a bit different from the cars seen in America with more of a street look with steel tube-framed silhouette bodies powered by <b>carbureted</b> spec V8 engines.|$|E
25|$|Power {{comes from}} {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, <b>carbureted</b> 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
25|$|For the 1991 model year, Mexico enacted new-vehicle {{emission}} regulations {{similar to}} those in the U.S. and Canada. The <b>carbureted</b> leaded-fuel engine was too dirty to comply with the new regulations, so a fully integrated engine management system with fuel injection was added to the Spirit. This was not the TBI system used in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Rather, the Mexican-market Spirits came with a more advanced MPFI setup. The MPFI 2.5 improved performance and driveability, as well as achieved cleaner emissions than its TBI counterpart, but was not used in the U.S., Canadian, or rest-of-world export markets except on turbocharged and FFV models. The Chrysler Spirit with MPFI 2.5L engine was sold in Mexico from 1991 through 1995, and was exported to Argentina and Brazil from 1993 through 1995. It was employed by the Argentine police in Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|By November, 1990, the 52/55hp (carbureted/EPI) non-turbo F6A SOHC 4-valve engine became {{available}}, {{available in}} {{a whole range of}} versions: M as three- or five-door (later only five), with manual or automatic transmissions and FWD or 4WD, a sportier S only as a three-door, and the luxurious L only as a five-door with the more powerful EPI engine - which also appeared in 4WDs equipped with automatics. In September 1991 the range was revised, receiving side impact protection and a high mounted brakelight. Since these were considered structural changes the car received a new set of model codes, becoming the CN22S/CP22S/CN32S/CP32S. The SR-Four now came with all-around disc brakes while the S-Turbo was discontinued. An FWD automatic MC version joined the range at the lower end, equipped with a column-mounted shifter. Other special versions abounded, with the luxurious F-Limited EPI 3-door joining in December 1991 and the somewhat cheaper, <b>carbureted</b> M Selection in April 1992. In July of that year, the 3-door, automatic only S Selection managed to find a slot in a pricelist now comprising a faintly ridiculous 27 variants. This didn't hinder Suzuki from adding more versions, the well-equipped LoFt (sic), in June 1994 and the A in April of that year.|$|E
500|$|SYM Motors of Taiwan {{licensed}} the Super Cub {{design as}} the Symba 100, previously called the Symba 110, which they exported to the US. While keeping the basic design, SYM increased {{the size of}} the front brake from , and added an LED fuel gauge. Instead of leading link front forks, it uses telescopic forks. The Symba engine has a <b>carbureted</b> [...] single claimed to produce [...] at 8500rpm, with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch semi-automatic transmission.|$|E

2500|$|... 1965 styling {{alterations}} were subtle, {{confined to}} a smoothed-out hood now devoid of scoop indentations, a trio of working vertical exhaust vents in the front fenders that replaced the previous nonfunctional horizontal [...] "speedlines," [...] restyled wheel covers and rocker-panel moldings, and minor interior trim revisions. The 1965 Corvette Sting Ray became ferocious with the mid-year debut of the [...] "Big-Block" [...] engine producing [...] Ultimately, this spelled the end for the Rochester fuel injection system, as the <b>carbureted</b> 396ci/425hp option cost $292.70 to the fuel injected 327ci/375hp's $538.00. Few buyers could justify $245 more for [...] less, even if the FI cars offered optional bigger brakes not available on <b>carbureted</b> models. After only 771 fuel injected cars were built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option. It would be 18 years until it returned.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Sprint" [...] and [...] "Sprint Metro" [...] {{differed}} in their engines, though both were computer controlled carb systems. From 1985 to 1988, the <b>carbureted</b> 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine used a hemispherical head design. Later, fuel injection required the cylinder head for 1989 be redesigned {{to add the}} additional cooling required, reducing gas mileage.|$|E
2500|$|The venerated XY was {{released}} in October 1970, with variations to grille and tail lights but otherwise unchanged bodywork from the XW. The six-cylinder motors were bigger— and [...] A two-barrel (2V) <b>carbureted)</b> version of the 351 Cleveland V8 was an option on all sedans. All GT models remain valuable collectors' cars and {{this is especially true}} of the XY GT and XY GTHO Phase III, released in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|The early HSC engines were <b>carbureted,</b> with a 1-barrel Holley 6149 carburetor. Single point Central Fuel Injection (CFI) {{was added}} in 1985. [...] It was {{switched}} over to multi-port fuel injection in 1988 which raised horsepower to 95. [...] Sequential fuel injection was added for 1992 increasing horsepower to 98, but the HSO variant was dropped (as the sportier {{versions of the}} Tempo/Topaz received the 3.0L Vulcan as standard equipment for 1992).|$|E

Rocker panel trim was seen for the first time, exposed headlights for the last, until 2005. This was the last Corvette model to offer an optional power convertible top mechanism. Rare options: RPO 488 24-gallon fuel tank (65), RPO 687 heavy-duty brakes and steering (246), RPO 473 power convertible top (350), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (561).|$|E
2500|$|The Swift {{featured}} a 993cc inline three cylinder engine producing [...] The G10 engine weighed [...] {{and was the}} same as used in the Geo Metro and other North American iterations. Other engine configurations included a <b>carbureted</b> or fuel injected SOHC eight-valve 1.3-liter G13. Trim levels included the 1.0 GA and the 1.0 GL. The GA model included plastic wheelcovers, four-speed gearbox and cloth trim. The GL model included more equipment such as a five-speed gearbox, alloy wheels, a sunroof, and air conditioning in some markets.|$|E
2500|$|All Rebels {{came with}} a manual (with {{overdrive}} unit) or GM's four-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission, {{as well as other}} performance enhancements such as a dual exhaust system, heavy-duty suspension with Gabriel (brand) shock absorbers, and front sway bar. The Rebel was capable of 0 to 60mph (0-97 km/h) acceleration in just 7.5 seconds with its standard [...] <b>carbureted</b> engine. The car's light monocoque (unibody) construction afforded a power-to-weight ratio of about 13pounds per horsepower, a better ratio than other 1957 model year automobiles and a contrast to Volkswagen's 45.|$|E
2500|$|The {{optional}} [...] "Go Package" [...] {{included a}} four-barrel <b>carbureted</b> [...] AMC V8, power front disc brakes, heavy-duty suspension, dual exhausts with chromed outlets, wide body-side stripes, and E70x14 red-line tires mounted on chrome-plated [...] "Magnum 500" [...] styled road wheels.

All derived from the same external sized block. However, the three engines differed vastly internally, with the smallest engine having small intake and exhaust valves, thin block webbing, and a cast nodular iron crankshaft; the 343 used larger valves with a thicker block webbing; and the 390 moved up to a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods, as well as larger rod bearings, [...] compared to [...] in the smaller two versions.|$|E
2500|$|... 1989 {{marked the}} first year of a fuel-injected V8 engine. The 305cuin V8 was updated with {{throttle}} body electronic fuel-injection (RPO LO3), first introduced in 1987 on Chevrolet/GMC pickups and vans. This engine was rated at [...] and , which was only a slight increase in torque over the <b>carbureted</b> engine. However, the cold weather starts, drivability, fuel economy and emissions were all improved as a result of fuel injection. The 4.3L V6 was no longer the base engine, and was now only available in taxi and police optioned Caprices. The 307 engine remained unchanged for station wagons. Rear-seat passengers received shoulder belts for the outboard positions and air conditioning was standard on all models.|$|E
