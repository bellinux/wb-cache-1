500|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the controlled}} addition of fluoride {{to a public}} water supply to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{at a level that}} is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes {{in the early stages of}} cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. [...] Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.|$|E

50|$|The Alaska Native {{population}} {{has one of}} the highest rates of oral disease in the world. Children 2 to 5 years of age have almost five times the amount of tooth decay as do children of the same age elsewhere in the United States. Children ages 6 to 14 have 4.5 times the amount, and adults are 2.5 times higher. There are over 200 Native Alaskan Villages, many of which are very remote. Travelling to these villages are usually by boat, airplane, or snow machine. The cost of transportation is expensive and prohibits many of the villagers from leaving to get dental care and having dental care reached out to them for more than a few weeks a year. These villages are so remote, that all of their groceries are flown in causing them to be very expensive as well and it’s really hard for these families to afford the healthy foods that they need. Another problem in these villages is not having running water that <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride,</b> which helps keep teeth healthy. All of these factors lead to poor dental health. Plus, Alaska’s rural villages don’t have the resources readily available to them, and most native populations have little to no access to education.|$|E

METHODS: Six varnishes were selected for analysis: (1) Enamel Pro containing amorphous calcium phosphate; (2) Clinpro White containing functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP); (3) MI Varnish containing casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP); (4) Duraphat (first no added calcium control); (5) Profluorid (second no added calcium control); and (6) placebo (no added calcium or fluoride control). Human enamel slabs (36) were each cut into half-slabs and covered with one of the six dental varnishes to create a window. The half-slabs were then individually immersed in a polyacrylate demineralization buffer pH 4. 8 for four days at 37  °C with a change of solution each day. Mineral content was determined using transverse microradiography. RESULTS: All fluoride-containing varnishes significantly inhibited enamel demineralization when compared with the placebo varnish. However, out of the calcium phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> <b>containing</b> varnishes only MI Varnish, <b>containing</b> <b>fluoride</b> and CPP-ACP was superior to the fluoride-alone varnishes.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fluoride retention in plaque is limited by available binding sites. We determined the effects of fluoridated or placebo dentifrices on plaque and salivary fluoride concentrations [F]s in communities with different water fluoride concentrations (0. 04, 0. 85, 3. 5 ppm). After one week of dentifrice use, samples were collected 1. 0 and 12 hrs after the last use of dentifrices. After the use of fluoridated dentifrice, plaque fluoride concentrations were higher at both times, except at 12 hrs in the 3. 5 -ppm community. Plaque concentrations at 1. 0 hr after the use of fluoridated dentifrice increased almost constantly (6. 5 mmol/kg), but then decreased approximately 50 % at 12 hrs in each community. Unlike previous studies, the present findings suggest that the use of fluoridated dentifrice is likely to increase plaque fluoride concentrations significantly for up to 12 hrs in areas where the water <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride</b> close to 1. 0 ppm.

40|$|Background: Fluoride {{increases}} tooth {{resistance to}} dental caries, but mild toxicity due to excessive ingestion of fluoride can cause dental fluorosis. Drinking water naturally <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{and is a}} major source of fluoride. In Bushehr port, drinking water is supplied from limestone springs with normal fluoride levels but dental fluorosis is observed. Methods: A total of 95 native school children (between the ages of 10 - 12 years old) were randomly selected from four Bushehr port regions. Dental fluorosis, height and weight were examined. Probable attributing factors of dental fluorosis were also questioned. A 16 to 18 hours urinary fluoride concentration was measured with a fluoride ion selective electrode. Results: Dental fluorosis in four upper incisors was apparent in 52. 6 % of the subjects. The urinary fluoride concentration was 2. 18 mg/lit. Fluoride concentration in drinking water of schools ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 58 mg/lit. Forty percent of subjects were caries free. Conclusion: In spite of the normal range of fluoride concentration in the drinking water of Bushehr, dental fluorosis and urinary fluoride concentration are higher than the recommended ranges. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the amount and effects of fluoride ingestion in residents of Bushehr province...|$|E

3000|$|Fluoride in {{drinking}} water is known for both beneficial and detrimental effect on health. The presence of fluoride {{in drinking}} water at low concentrations is considered essential in guarding against dental caries. However, excess fluoride {{in drinking water}} results in many bone diseases, including mottling of teeth and lesions of the endocrine glands, thyroid, liver and other organs (Tang et al. 2009). Excess fluoride is generally encountered in ground water and in rural population of developing countries which use that ground water as their drinking source. Taking the health effect into consideration, World Health Organization (WHO) has set a guideline value of 1.5  mg/L as the maximum permissible level of fluoride for drinking water (WHO 1993). Many countries have regions where water <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration more than the prescribed limit. Cases of endemic fluorosis are reported in parts of Assam state (situated in the north eastern region of India) where supplied water <b>contains</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentration as high as 23.5  mg/L (Chakraborti et al. 2000), The high fluoride levels in drinking water and their impacts on human health have prompted many researchers to study {{about the importance of}} defluoridation. In recent years, several methods have been developed to remove fluoride and improve the quality of drinking water. Various fluoride removal technologies based on the principle of adsorption (Ghorai and Pant 2004; Chauhan et al. 2007; Ganvir and Das 2011; Thakre et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2007; Tripathy et al. 2006; Srimurali et al. 1998), precipitation (Larsen and Pearce 1992), electrolysis (Mameri et al. 1998), ion exchange (Varamaa and Lehto 2003), membrane (Joshi et al. 1992), etc. are known. Coagulation methods are generally effective in defluoridation, but are unsuccessful in bringing down fluoride to the desired levels. The electrochemical techniques in general suffer due to high cost factor, both during installation and maintenance. Membrane separations can be performed under isothermal conditions and at low temperatures leading to low energy consumption. But it is relatively expensive to install and operate and prone to fouling and scaling. Also membrane degradation {{is one of the reasons}} of its disadvantages. Any particular process of water defluoridation suitable at a particular region may not work at some other region because of presence of different matrix composition of minerals in water (Meenakshi and Maheshwari 2006; Ayoob and Gupta 2007). The adsorption-based technique is one of the approaches for defluoridation of water. Report on the removal efficiency of excess of fluoride from drinking water as well as industrial effluent using quicklime as adsorbent shows positive results, which implies that adsorption technique is suitable to bring down the fluoride concentration in a particular water sample (Islam and Patel 2007) [...]...|$|E
