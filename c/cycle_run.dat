40|$|To {{improve the}} initial {{conditions}} of tropical cyclone (TC) forecast models, a dynamical initialization (DI) scheme using cycle runs is developed and implemented into a real-time forecast system for northwest Pacific TCs {{based on the}} Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. In this scheme, cycle runs with a 6 -h window before the initial forecast time are repeatedly conducted to spin up the axisymmetric component of the TC vortex until the model TC intensity {{is comparable to the}} observed. This is followed by a 72 -h forecast using the Global Forecast System (GFS) prediction as lateral boundary conditions. In the DI scheme, the spectral nudging technique is employed during each <b>cycle</b> <b>run</b> to reduce bias in the large-scale environmental field, and the relocation method is applied after the last <b>cycle</b> <b>run</b> to reduce the initial position error. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DI scheme, 69 forecast experiments with and without the DI are conducted for 13 TCs over the northwest Pacific in 2010 and 2011. The DI shows positive effects on both track and intensity forecasts of TCs, although its overall skill depends strongly on the performance of the GFS forecasts. Compared to the forecasts without the DI, on average, forecasts with the DI reduce the position and intensity errors by 10 % and 30 %, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed DI scheme improves the initial TC vortex structure and intensity and provides warm physics spinup, producing initial states consistent with the forecast model, thus achieving improved track and intensity forecasts. close 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{system is}} able to oscillate by itself owing to the transcriptional-translation feedback loop. Components of this loop do not affect just their own run, {{but they also have}} an impact on some other functions of the cell, for example cell cycle.

These proteins participate in the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>run</b> and have an impact on check-points.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that cycling can {{directly}} influence neuromuscular control during subsequent running in some highly trained triathletes. A relationship between this altered neuromuscular control of running and musculoskeletal pain and injury has been proposed; however, this link has not been investigated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of cycling on neuromuscular control during subsequent running in highly trained triathletes with and without exercise-related leg pain (ERLP). METHODS: Participants were 34 highly trained triathletes: 10 triathletes with a history of ERLP and 24 training-matched control triathletes with no history of ERLP. Knee and ankle kinematics and leg muscle recruitment were compared between a baseline run (no prior exercise) and a transition run (preceded by cycling; i. e., run vs <b>cycle</b> <b>run).</b> RESULTS: Knee and ankle joint kinematics were not different between baseline and transition runs for any triathletes: absolute mean difference (+/- 95...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper examines the multi-level, primitive equation, global ocean circulation model of Semtner and Chervin {{for its ability}} to simulate the seasonal cycle in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The result of a 20 -year integration of this model using annual mean wind forcing was reported in Semtner and Chervin (1988). This was the first global eddyresolving ocean calculation and it showed many realistic features of ocean circulation. The phase of the simulation analyzed in this report incorporates seasonally varying wind forcing from the Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983) global data set. These wind stress values were defined on a grid with 2 ° spacing which have been interpolated to the onehalf degree grid points of the Semtner and Chervin model. There is no interannual variability in the wind fields of this data set. The results presented here are from the fourth year of a 10 -year seasonal <b>cycle</b> <b>run.</b> [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{method for}} the {{selection}} of suitable molecular recognition element (MRE) for the quantification of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is presented. Two types of hEGF antibody, monoclonal and polyclonal, were immobilized {{on the surface of}} chip and validated for its characteristics and performance in the quantification of hEGF. Validation of this analytical procedure was to demonstrate the stability and suitability of antibody for the quantification of target protein. Results: Specificity, accuracy and precision for all samples were within acceptable limit for both antibodies. The affinity and kinetic constant of antibodies-hEGF binding were evaluated using a 1 : 1 Langmuir interaction model. The model fitted well to all binding responses simultaneously. Polyclonal antibody (pAb) has better affinity (K D = 7. 39 e- 10 M) than monoclonal antibody (mAb) (K D = 9. 54 e- 9 M). Further evaluation of kinetic constant demonstrated that pAb has faster reaction rate during sample injection, slower dissociation rate during buffer injection and higher level of saturation state than mAb. Besides, pAb has longer shelf life and greater number of <b>cycle</b> <b>run.</b> Conclusions: Thus, pAb was more suitable {{to be used as a}} stable MRE for further quantification works from the consideration of kinetic, binding rate and shelf life assessment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} {{the changes in the}} individual contribution of each discipline to the overall performance of Olympic and Ironman distance triathlons among males and females. Between 1989 and 2013, overall performances and their component disciplines (swim, <b>cycle,</b> <b>run)</b> were analyzed from the top 50 overall male and female finishers. Regression analyses determined that for the Olympic distance, the split times in swimming and running decreased over the years (r = 0. 25 - 0. 43, p 0. 05), for both sexes. For the Ironman distance, the cycling and running splits, and total time decreased (r = 0. 19 - 0. 88, p 0. 05). Across the years, in the Olympic distance, swimming contribution significantly decreased for females and males (r = 0. 51 and 0. 68, p < 0. 001, respectively), while running increased for males (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 014). In the Ironman distance, swim and cycle contributions changed in an undulating fashion, being inverse between the two segments, for both sexes (p < 0. 01), while running contribution decreased for males only (r = 0. 61, p = 0. 001). These findings highlight that strategies to improve running performance should be the main focus on the preparation to compete in the Olympic distance. Whereas in the Ironman both cycling and running are decisive and should be well developed...|$|E
