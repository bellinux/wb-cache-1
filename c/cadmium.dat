5|$|Although <b>cadmium</b> {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. <b>Cadmium</b> and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. <b>Cadmium</b> burns in air to form brown amorphous <b>cadmium</b> oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve <b>cadmium</b> by forming <b>cadmium</b> chloride (CdCl2), <b>cadmium</b> sulfate (CdSO4), or <b>cadmium</b> nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving <b>cadmium</b> in a mixture of <b>cadmium</b> chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|After the {{industrial}} scale production of <b>cadmium</b> started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of <b>cadmium</b> was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the <b>cadmium</b> in the United States was used for plating. In 1956, 24% of the <b>cadmium</b> in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of <b>cadmium.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, these {{decreases}} in consumption were compensated {{by a growing}} demand for <b>cadmium</b> for nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the <b>cadmium</b> consumption in the United States in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the adverse}} effects of <b>cadmium</b> on the {{environment}} and human health, the supply and use of <b>cadmium</b> is restricted in Europe under the REACH Regulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of <b>cadmium.</b> In the 1970s, the output of <b>cadmium</b> was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. <b>Cadmium</b> is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or <b>cadmium</b> sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> is a {{component}} of some compound semiconductors, such as <b>cadmium</b> sulfide, <b>cadmium</b> selenide, and <b>cadmium</b> telluride, used for light detection and solar cells. HgCdTe is sensitive to infrared light {{and can be used}} as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike most other metals, <b>cadmium</b> is resistant to corrosion and {{is used as a}} protective plate on other metals. As a bulk metal, <b>cadmium</b> is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. <b>Cadmium</b> was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and <b>cadmium</b> compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. <b>Cadmium</b> use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is <b>cadmium</b> telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium-selective sensors {{based on}} the {{fluorophore}} BODIPY {{have been developed for}} imaging and sensing of <b>cadmium</b> in cells. One of the most popular way to monitor <b>cadmium</b> in aqueous environments is the use of electrochemistry, one example is by attaching a self-assembled monolayer that can help obtain a <b>cadmium</b> selective electrode with a ppt-level sensitivity.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 86% of <b>cadmium</b> {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative <b>cadmium</b> electrode plate separated by an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union put a limit on <b>cadmium</b> in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%, with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on <b>cadmium</b> content to 0.002%.|$|E
5|$|In PVC, <b>cadmium</b> {{was used}} as heat, light, and {{weathering}} stabilizers. Currently, <b>cadmium</b> stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. <b>Cadmium</b> is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, because a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It {{is also found in}} some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal.|$|E
5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to <b>cadmium</b> is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble <b>cadmium</b> compounds. Inhalation of <b>cadmium</b> fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{sensitive}} {{semiconductor material}} is formed by alloying tellurium with <b>cadmium</b> and mercury to form mercury <b>cadmium</b> telluride.|$|E
5|$|On average, <b>cadmium</b> {{concentrations}} {{in the blood of}} smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high <b>cadmium</b> content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to <b>cadmium</b> from passive smoking.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} <b>cadmium</b> (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of <b>cadmium</b> used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the <b>cadmium</b> emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to <b>cadmium</b> emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of <b>cadmium.</b> Life-cycle <b>cadmium</b> emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} <b>cadmium,</b> {{resulting in a}} <b>cadmium</b> concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high <b>cadmium</b> content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of <b>cadmium,</b> which ends up mostly in flue dust. <b>Cadmium</b> in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of <b>cadmium</b> above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and <b>cadmium</b> from soil.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} <b>cadmium</b> and <b>cadmium</b> compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to <b>cadmium</b> {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of <b>cadmium</b> in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of <b>cadmium</b> through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of <b>cadmium</b> in current and former smoking females.|$|E
5|$|The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set the}} {{permissible}} {{exposure limit}} (PEL) for <b>cadmium</b> at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has not set a recommended exposure limit (REL) and has designated <b>cadmium</b> as a known human carcinogen. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for <b>cadmium</b> is 9mg/m3.|$|E
5|$|The {{biogeochemistry}} of <b>cadmium</b> and {{its release}} {{to the environment}} {{has been the subject}} of review, as has the speciation of <b>cadmium</b> in the environment.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{concentration}} of <b>cadmium</b> is {{absorbed in the}} kidneys of humans, and up to about 30mg of <b>cadmium</b> is commonly inhaled throughout human childhood and adolescence. <b>Cadmium</b> is under preliminary research for its toxicity in humans, potentially affecting mechanisms and risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} <b>cadmium</b> chemicals like the carboxylates <b>cadmium</b> laurate and <b>cadmium</b> stearate on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for <b>cadmium</b> in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined {{as a result of}} environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total <b>cadmium</b> consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>cadmium</b> salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. <b>Cadmium</b> {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called <b>cadmium</b> red. To painters who work with the pigment, <b>cadmium</b> provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of <b>cadmium</b> absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or <b>cadmium</b> were other choices. <b>Cadmium</b> was the choice {{for most of the}} tests. The first shot was performed with an iron mockup of the plutonium pit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of <b>cadmium</b> plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement <b>cadmium</b> electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> is {{a common}} {{component}} of electric batteries, pigments, coatings, and electroplating.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> {{is also an}} {{environmental}} hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration. Bread, root crops, and vegetables {{also contribute to the}} <b>cadmium</b> in modern populations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cadmium</b> oxide {{was used}} {{in black and white}} {{television}} phosphors and in the blue and green phosphors of color television cathode ray tubes. <b>Cadmium</b> sulfide (CdS) is used as a photoconductive surface coating for photocopier drums.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, a sale of {{the seats}} from Arsenal F.C.'s old stadium, Highbury in London, England was {{cancelled}} when the seats were discovered to contain trace amounts of <b>cadmium.</b> Reports of high levels of <b>cadmium</b> use in children's jewelry in 2010 led to a US Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation. The U.S. CPSC issued specific recall notices for <b>cadmium</b> content in jewelry sold by Claire's and Wal-Mart stores.|$|E
5|$|Mercury and <b>cadmium</b> are toxic and {{may cause}} {{environmental}} damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This {{may result in}} contaminated crops {{as well as the}} bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and <b>cadmium</b> poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>cadmium</b> can {{be found}} in the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} of many <b>cadmium</b> complexes with nucleobases, amino acids, and vitamins have been determined.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population <b>cadmium</b> exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although <b>cadmium</b> is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. <b>Cadmium</b> is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to <b>cadmium</b> in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with <b>cadmium</b> and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, <b>cadmium</b> accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>cadmium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase {{has been found}} in marine diatoms.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{analysed}} {{the tissues}} of Adamussium colbecki and compared them {{with those of}} Pecten jacobaeus, a temperate water species of scallop. It was found that copper, iron, <b>cadmium</b> and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. <b>Cadmium</b> levels in particular {{were higher in the}} Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, <b>cadmium</b> and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, <b>cadmium</b> and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive <b>cadmium</b> and selenium in either food or water found that <b>cadmium</b> in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while <b>cadmium</b> in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, <b>cadmium</b> and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
