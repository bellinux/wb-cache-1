5|$|Daisy Fay Buchanan– an {{attractive}} and effervescent, if shallow and self-absorbed, young Louisville, Kentucky debutante and socialite, {{identified as a}} flapper. She is Nick's second cousin, once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Daisy {{is believed to have}} been inspired by Fitzgerald's own youthful romances with Ginevra King. Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby, before she married Tom. Her <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
50|$|Although {{transport}} systems {{follow the same}} supply and demand theory as other industries, the complications of network effects and <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> dissimilar goods (e.g. car and bus travel) make estimating the demand for transportation facilities difficult. The development of models to estimate the likely <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> the goods involved in transport decisions (discrete choice models) {{led to the development}} of an important branch of econometrics, as well as a Nobel Prize for Daniel McFadden.|$|R

5|$|In {{cases of}} {{conflict}} between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and Søren Kierkegaard), there is no order of precedence, and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of their close association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> one or the other.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} suggests that choice behaviour has a stochastic element. Much of this evidence is based on studying <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> lotteries – <b>choice</b> under risk. Binary choice probabilities admit a strong utility representation (SUR) {{if there is a}} utility function such that the probability of choosing option A over option B is a strictly increasing function of the utility difference between A and B. Debreu (1958) obtained a simple set of sufficient conditions on binary choice probabilities for the existence of a SUR. More recently, Dagsvik (2008) considered binary <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> lotteries and provided axiomatic foundations for a SUR in which the underlying utility function is linear (i. e., conforms with expected utility). Our paper strengthens and generalises Dagsvik’s result. We show that one of Dagsvik’s axioms can be weakened, and we extend his analysis to encompass <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> uncertain prospects, as well as various non-linear specifications of utility...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} tasks {{that have been used}} in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to measure <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> smaller immediate and larger delayed rewards: real and hypothetical temporal discounting tasks, and single-choice paradigms. Methods: Participants were 55 undergraduate psychology students. Tasks included a real and hypothetical version of a temporal discounting (TD) task with <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> a large reward (10 cents) after delays up to 60 seconds, and smaller immediate rewards (2 - 8 cents); two versions of a hypothetical temporal discounting task with <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> a large reward ($ 100) after delays up to 120 months, and smaller immediate rewards ($ 1 -$ 95); a Choice Delay Task with <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> one point now and two points after 30 seconds (one point is worth five cents). Results: Correlation analyses showed that the real and the hypothetical TD tasks with 10 cents were very strongly associated. However, the hypothetical TD tasks with $ 100 did not correlate with either the real or the hypothetical TD task with 10 cents. Principal component analysis extracted two components: one for small amounts and short delays, and a second one for large rewards and long delays. Conclusions: Temporal reward discounting is not a uniform construct. Functional brain imaging research could shed more light on unique brain activation patterns associated with different forms of temporal reward discounting...|$|R
40|$|In five {{experiments}} {{we studied}} {{the extent to}} which theories of judgment, decision-making and memory can predict people's preferences. Applying Prospect Theory and Support Theory to these data we find that (a) the weighting function required to model decisions with 'high-accessible' features in memory differs from the function required to model <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> monetary gambles and (b) the accessibility (Fox & Levav, 2000; Kahneman, 2003; Koriat, 2001) of events in memory affects <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> options, influencing participants' decisions about, but not their judgments of, these options.

5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E

40|$|We use two {{different}} approaches to measure intertemporal preferences. First we employ the classical method of inferring preferences {{from a series of}} <b>choices</b> (subjects choose <b>between</b> $X now or $Y in D days). Second we adopt the novel approach of inferring preferences using only response time data from the same choices (how long it takes subjects to choose between $X now or $Y in D days). In principle, the inference from response times should work, since <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> items of nearly equivalent value should take longer than <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> items with substantially different values. We find that choice-based analysis and response-time-based analysis yield nearly identical discount rate estimates. We conclude that response time data sheds light on both our revealed (choice-based) preferences and on the cognitive processes that implement those preferences. ...|$|R
5|$|These {{leaders were}} divided {{as to whether}} Edward or Æthelred should succeed Edgar. Neither law nor {{precedent}} offered much guidance. The <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> the sons of Edward the Elder had divided his kingdom, and Edgar's elder brother Eadwig {{had been forced to}} give over {{a large part of the}} kingdom to Edgar. The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son Æthelred, aided by Bishop Æthelwold; and Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman Ælfhere and his allies supported Æthelred and that Æthelwine and his allies supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting.

Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
5|$|While Sherman {{stood against}} {{printing}} additional greenbacks, {{as late as}} 1872 he remained a proponent of keeping existing greenbacks backed by bonds in circulation. Over the next two years, Sherman worked to develop what became the Specie Payment Resumption Act. The Act was a compromise. It required gradual reduction of the maximum value of greenbacks allowed to circulate to $300 million and, while earlier drafts had allowed the Treasury the <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> paying in bonds or coin, {{the final version of}} the Act required payment in specie, starting in 1879.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} examined adult humans' {{choices in}} situations with contrasting short-term and long-term consequences. Subjects were given repeated <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> two time-based schedules of points exchangeable for money: a fixed schedule and a progressive schedule that began at 0 s and increased by 5 s with each point delivered by that schedule. Under "reset" conditions, choosing the fixed schedule not only produced a point {{but it also}} reset {{the requirements of the}} progressive schedule to 0 s. In the first two experiments, reset conditions alternated with "no-reset" conditions, in which progressive-schedule requirements were independent of fixed-schedule choices. Experiment 1 entailed <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> a progressive-interval schedule and a fixed-interval schedule, the duration of which varied across conditions. Switching from the progressive- to the fixed-interval schedule was systematically related to fixed-interval size in 4 of 8 subjects, and in all subjects occurred consistently sooner in the progressive-schedule sequence under reset than under no-reset procedures. The latter result was replicated in a second experiment, in which <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> progressive- and fixed-interval schedules were compared with <b>choices</b> <b>between</b> progressive- and fixed-time schedules. In Experiment 3, switching patterns under reset conditions were unrelated to variations in intertrial interval. In none of the experiments did orderly choice patterns depend on verbal descriptions of the contingencies or on schedule-controlled response patterns {{in the presence of the}} chosen schedules. The overall pattern of results indicates control of choices by temporarily remote consequences, and is consistent with versions of optimality theory that address performance in situations of diminishing returns...|$|R

5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a <b>choice</b> <b>between</b> two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons.
