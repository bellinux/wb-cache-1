5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional <b>crew</b> <b>station,</b> and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{integrated}} {{avionics system}} (IAS) has been developed by Northrop Grumman. The system includes two mission computers, an automatic flight control system (reportedly [...] "stops short of a fly-by-wire system"), and a glass cockpit; Bell suggests the system can withstand 23 mm caliber fire. Each <b>crew</b> <b>station</b> has two [...] multifunction liquid crystal displays (LCD) and one [...] dual function LCD display.

50|$|MiG-23U: ("Flogger-C") The MiG-23U was a twin-seat {{training}} variant. It {{was based}} on the MiG-23S, but featured a lengthened cockpit with a second <b>crew</b> <b>station</b> behind the first. One forward fuel tank was removed to accommodate an extra seat; this was compensated for by adding a new fuel tank in the rear fuselage. The MiG-23U had the S-21 weapon system, although the radar was later mostly removed. During its production run, both its wings and engine were improved to the MiG-23M standard. Production began at Irkutsk in 1971 and eventually converted to the MiG-23UB.|$|E

5000|$|In anti-shipping operations, the USAAF had {{urgent need}} for hard-hitting aircraft, and North American responded with the B-25G.

XVIII and the German Henschel Hs 129B-3, and Ju 88P heavy cannon (up to a 75 mm long-barrel Bordkanone BK 7,5). The shorter nose placed the cannon breech behind the pilot where it could be manually loaded and serviced by the navigator; his <b>crew</b> <b>station</b> was moved to just behind the pilot. The navigator signalled the pilot when the gun was ready and the pilot fired the weapon using a button on his control wheel.|$|E
