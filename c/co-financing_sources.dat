The {{development}} of the Romanian rural area following the 1989 Revolution and until the present has undergone important variations {{in terms of economic}} and financial instruments. The failure of the support policy in the fields of agriculture and rural development during the first stages of transition was determined by the slow pace of the economic reform and shaping of the market-viable agricultural structures. The research undertaken allowed for the depiction of tendencies and theoretically and practically-fundamented conclusions for the efficient access and employment of European funding for rural development. The method for data collection and processing selected for both studies was the inquiry, while the research instrument employed was the survey. Other methods utilized in the present paper include the determination of causal relationships by means of the Hi-square criterion. The preamble of the study involved the analysis of the general regulatory framework of European funding for rural development in Romania. Research objectives aimed at the main <b>co-financing</b> <b>sources</b> of private beneficiaries in Cluj county and beneficiaries ’ assessment of project filing methods...|$|E
40|$|The major {{significance}} of the actual financing context is that, through the community budget, the rural communities can receive {{money in order to}} support development strategies, the financing under programs specific to the rural sector can be correlated to the financing programs by regional policy, environment policy, enterprise policy, education sector policy, etc. But, in order to benefit efficiently by the community interventions system, the major problem for the Romanian rural communities is related to: the identification of the different funding opportunities;the elaboration of a project portfolio adequate for the won development options; finding <b>co-financing</b> <b>sources.</b> Taking into consideration the complexity of such an approach and considering the particular situation of the Romanian rural sector it results that the key role in the rural development and use of the opportunities provided by the European context belongs to the public administration. The good information and information dissemination at the community level, possibly with best practice examples from other EU counties can have an essential role in attracting funds and projects that improve the effectiveness of the development strategies...|$|E
30|$|First, {{insufficient}} {{qualifications of}} researchers and technical personnel {{working in a}} number of research directions hamper intersectoral mobility. Second, it is low mobility of labor resources which hampers creation of temporary research groups that may work in/with the laboratory. Here, an additional hampering factor was an unclear future of this initiative as a whole. The government promised the support for 3 years only, with possible but unguaranteed extension for another 2 years. In practice, out of the first group of laboratories established in 2010, 60 % received a continued support after 3  years. New laboratories, created in 2012 to 2013, {{had to deal with the}} already changed government requirements, which required the laboratories to guarantee a 25 % <b>co-financing</b> from non-budgetary <b>sources.</b> In practice, universities and research institutes paid this share from their own funds; therefore, the new requirement has not achieved its goal of enhancing ties with industry.|$|R
30|$|The Structural Funds {{represent}} {{financial instruments}} of the EU regional policy, intended {{to pursue the}} goal of economic, social and territorial cohesion by narrowing the development disparities among regions and member states. For the period 2007 – 2013, the budget allocated to the Structural Funds amounts to around € 278 billion, which represents 28 % of the Community budget. There are two Structural Funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), set up in 1975, providing support {{for the creation of}} infrastructures and productive job-creating investment, mainly for businesses; the European Social Fund (ESF), set up in 1958, contributes to the integration into working life of the unemployed and disadvantaged sections of the population, mainly by funding training measures. The bulk of Structural Funds expenditure flows to Objective “Convergence” (former Objective 1) areas, which are EU regions with GDP per capita less than 75 % of the EU average. Structural Funds always involve <b>co-financing</b> from national <b>sources.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} data of international institutions indicate that Poland {{is the only}} European country enjoying economic growth in 2009. Since the beginning of 2008 the GDP of the EU was systematically falling down, while in Poland the fall of only 0, 1 % percentage change on previous year) was observed only in the Q 4 of 2008. In 2009 Poland as the only EU Member State reached the positive economic growth (1. 7 % according to Eurostat data), although individual Polish regions differed {{in terms of the}} key socio-economic indicators for 2009. On of the key factors stabilizing the economy and preventing recession – alongside relatively limited openness of the economy, large and relatively stable internal market, moderate public debt and moderate level of business sector debt – was among others inflow of EU funding, which enabled increase of the volume of private and public investment <b>co-financed</b> from EU <b>sources.</b> Utilization of funds varies among Polish regions, depending on the degree of compatibility of regional allocations with the expectations of recipients, on the level of activeness of target groups and in particular on the institutional capacities for EU funding operations. The article discusses the assessment of the level of structural funds utilization by Polish regions in the conditions of lowering dynamics of economic growth, with particular focus on Łódź Voivodship, for which results are presented in relations between metropolis and region...|$|R
