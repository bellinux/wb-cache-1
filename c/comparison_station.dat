40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the climate of a large area with few reporting stations requires a special approach. Northern Saskatchewan, examined in this study, {{is an example of}} such an area. The objectives of this study, therefore, are to determine how to evaluate the climatic environment of a large area with few reporting stations and to apply the methods to an analysis of the climate of northern Saskatchewan. A completeness index, developed by the author, was used to measure how satisfactory the climatological records were in terms of length and number of gaps. A correlation analysis, the point distribution coefficient and the spatial pattern of the completeness index were employed for the {{evaluation of}} the network of observing stations. Methods for temporal and spatial estimation were applied and the results were tested. It was found that monthly data and normals could be estimated satisfactorily but that daily data could not be as adequately estimated. The results of the spatial estimation were found to be acceptable, although estimated precipitation values were usually less acceptable than estimated temperature values. The improved data base was then used to evaluate the temperature and precipitation climate of northern Saskatchewan. Several intriguing features were disclosed. For example, it was found that stations in the central portion of the study area have January extreme minima that are as much as 6 Â° C. higher than those of the stations of the southern margin of the study area. The frequency of occurrence of mean monthly temperatures proved useful in both temporal and spatial analyses. Cold and warm spells, that is, periods of consecutive days with temperatures below or above certain levels, respectively, were also examined. A noticeable pattern in the distribution of cold spells was found. The distribution shows an abrupt increase in the average number of cold spells per winter north of about 57 Â° North. Other aspects of the climate of northern Saskatchewan such as the frost-free season, growing degree-days, heating degree-days, wind chill and humidex were evaluated, where possible. It was found that wind chill factors at locations in the study area are less than those at Regina, the <b>comparison</b> <b>station</b> in southern Saskatchewan. The length of the frost-free season was found to be just as long in parts of the northern margin as in the southern margin of the study area. Climatic classifications and the continentality of the study area were also examined...|$|E

This presentation focuses on recent developments and enhancements to the infrasound, seismic, and hydroacoustic resources, most {{of which can be}} accessed from the RDSS website at www. rdss. info. In particular, on-going and recent developments and improvements are related to (1) the nuclear explosion database archive and (2) infrasound signals and associated source information. The RDSS project has traditionally maintained an archive of information on source metadata and seismic waveforms from worldwide nuclear explosions. These resources were previously documented in the year 2000, and we are now completing a major revision and update which includes newly published or revised information about historical explosions, access to additional or corrected waveform data for some explosions, and new data from more recent nuclear tests (e. g., North Korea). In addition to maintaining these research data archives, we have been developing a number of web tools which enable visualization of and easier access to these explosion resources, including tabular-, map-, and imagery-based event selection and <b>comparisons,</b> <b>station</b> coverage and response information, as well as review of data quality and acquisition of the available seismic waveform data.

40|$|The {{benthic fauna}} was {{investigated}} during the expedition ANT-XXIV/ 2 (2007 / 08) {{in relation to}} oceanographic features, biogeochemical properties and sediment characteristics, {{as well as the}} benthic, pelagic and air-breathing fauna. The results document that Maud Rise (MR) differs distinctly from surrounding deep-sea basins investigated during previous Southern Ocean expeditions (ANDEEP 2002, 2005). Considering all taxa, the overall similarity between MR and adjacent stations was low (~ 20 % Bray-Curtis-Similarity), and analyses of single taxa show obvious differences in species composition, abundances and densities. The composition and diversity of bivalves of MR are characterised by extremely high abundances of three species, especially the small sized Vesicomya spp. Exceptionally high gastropod abundance at MR is due to the single species Onoba subantarctica wilkesiana, a small brooder that may prey upon abundant benthic foraminiferas. The abundance and diversity of isopods also show that one family, Haplomunnidae, occurs with a surprisingly high number of individuals at MR while this family was not found at any of the 40 bathyal and abyssal ANDEEP stations. Similarly, polychaetes, especially the tube-dwelling, suspension-feeder fraction, are represented by species not found at the <b>comparison</b> <b>stations.</b> Sponges comprise almost exclusively small specimens in relatively high numbers, especially a few species of Polymastiidae. Water-column sampling from the surface to the seafloor, including observations of top predators, indicate the existence of a prospering pelagic food web. Local concentrations of top predators and zooplankton are associated with a rich ice-edge bloom located over the northern slope of MR. There the sea ice melts, which is probably accelerated by the advection of warm water at intermediate depth. Over the southern slope, high concentrations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occur under dense sea ice and attract Antarctic Minke Whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and several seabird species. These findings suggest that biological prosperity over MR is related to both oceanographic and sea-ice processes. Downward transport of the organic matter produced in the pelagic realm may be more constant than elsewhere due to low lateral drift over MR...|$|R

Taxonomical and ecological informations of this species in Sabah were still at the initial stage and very limited. The Lower Kinabatangan River is the place when it was first recorded and became the focus area in this study. Samples of S. molesta from twelve stations along the Lower Kinabatangan River and three <b>comparison</b> <b>stations</b> from the Sandakan inland were analyzed to determine morphological differences between: quadrates (within the same population), between populations (from different stations), and between two types of water bodies (open and closed water bodies). By considering the maximum level of individual's maturity stage, the statistical analysis of One-way ANOVA and t-test were used to compare the means of morphometric measurements and meristic counts on six quantitative characters of this species. The quantitative characters were from the vegetative structure (floating leaf length and width, submerged leaf length, rhizome diameter) and reproductive structure (number of fertile axis, number of sporocarps). All the samples analyzed showed that there were morphological differences within the S. molesta populations in the study area. Variation between quadrates was significant (p< 0. 001) within the S. molesta populations with the size of more than five meter square. Variation between populations along the Kinabatangan River resulted with a highly significant (p< 0. 001) morphological differences from one stations to another. Morphological differences for samples from the two type of water bodies (open and closed water bodies) were also showed a highly significant (p< 0. 001) different; samples from the open water body were bigger in sizes of leaves and rhizome. Based on regression and correlation analysis, relationship between the quantitative characters were positive and significant (p< 0. 01). However, regression between the characters and the stations positioned showed that the plants were bigger at the upper stream area. The cluster analysis of Ward's method showed samples from the Sg. Koyah was a distinctive group among others. No consistent morphological characters can be used to distinguish between intraspecific populations of this species. The data obtained from this present study agrees with the hypothesis that there was an intraspecific variation occurred within the S. molesta populations in the Kinabatangan and rejected the null hypothesis. This study also added evidence on S. molesta as a single species of a highly morphological variability even in a narrow environmental gradient area, such as the tropic...|$|R
