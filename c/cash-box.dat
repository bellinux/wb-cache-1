60|$|All these Farnie {{observed}} with considerable interest, {{but as he}} moved towards the book-shelf his eye was caught by an object more interesting still. It was a <b>cash-box,</b> simple and unornamental, but undoubtedly a <b>cash-box,</b> and as he took it up it rattled.|$|E
60|$|With still {{reluctant}} hands, and {{not without}} several glances towards the skeleton hands, {{as if he}} mistrusted {{that a couple of}} them might spring forth and clutch the document, Wegg opened the hat-box and revealed the <b>cash-box,</b> opened the <b>cash-box</b> and revealed the will. He held a corner of it tight, while Venus, taking hold of another corner, searchingly and attentively read it.|$|E
60|$|She beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a {{battered}} English <b>cash-box</b> under her cot.|$|E
5000|$|Vesa-Matti Loiri - Treasurer, King's {{treasurer}} who accidentally deposits the <b>cash-boxes</b> containing {{his sandwich}} making materials, {{instead of the}} company's 500'000 marks.|$|R
50|$|While this {{is going}} on, King's Treasurer {{suddenly}} comes into possession of {{a large amount of}} excess money even though all of the company's cash has been deposited in the bank. Not realising that he has actually turned in the <b>cash-boxes</b> which contain his sandwich-making materials, the Treasurer begins to spend the money on driving lessons, a new car, hygiene products and in putting an ad in the paper to find himself a woman.|$|R
5000|$|Harmsworth {{considered}} it his moral duty {{to put the}} Penny Dreadfuls out of business, though some considered his papers to simply be [...] "halfpenny dreadfullers". The first issues of the Union Jack stated {{that it was a}} [...] "Library of high class fiction". The editorial {{at the end of the}} very first issue stated [...] "there will be nothing of the 'dreadful' type in our stories. No tales of boys rifling their employers' <b>cash-boxes</b> and making off to foreign lands, or other such highly immoral fiction products".|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} case there would, of course, remain the chance that he might induce Gethryn to lend him the four pounds, but this had never {{been more than a}} forlorn hope; and {{in the light of the}} {{possibilities}} opened out by the <b>cash-box,</b> he thought no more of it. The real problem was, should he or should he not take the money from the <b>cash-box?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|He {{brought the}} money back in an {{envelope}} placed in his breast pocket, and asked his shopman, on getting home, {{to look for a}} small, flat, tin <b>cash-box,</b> which had not been used for years, and which, as Mr. Yatman remembered it, was exactly of the right size to hold the bank-notes. For some time the <b>cash-box</b> was searched for in vain. Mr. Yatman called to his wife to know if she had any idea where it was. The question was overheard by the servant-of-all-work, who was taking up the tea-tray at the time, and by Mr. Jay, who was coming downstairs on his way out to the theater. Ultimately the <b>cash-box</b> was found by the shopman. Mr. Yatman placed the bank-notes in it, secured them by a padlock, and put the box in his coat pocket. It stuck out of the coat pocket a very little, but enough to be seen. Mr. Yatman remained at home, upstairs, all that evening. No visitors called. At eleven o'clock he went to bed, and put the <b>cash-box</b> under his pillow.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} <b>cash-box</b> {{out of the}} drawer, and turning to leave the shop, became aware that Stevie was still downstairs.|$|E
50|$|In a final desperate effort, Krakström hires Nitti to rob a {{bank and}} involuntarily {{involves}} King, {{who is trying to}} help Sylvi who has discovered that the bank is missing 500,000 marks. The money is obviously that found by King's Treasurer. While King attempts to return the money to the bank, Nitti then decides to do as Krakström originally instructed and rob the bank clean. King manages to defuse the situation with some laughing gas and when the police take Nitti, Krakström, King and his associates to the station, Nitti's bag is revealed only to contain the <b>cash-boxes</b> with the Treasurer's sandwich equipment.|$|R
60|$|Ricardo disregarded the question. The {{material}} {{vision of}} the spoil absorbed all his faculties. A great vision! He seemed to see it. A few small canvas bags tied up with thin cord, their distended rotundity showing the inside pressure of the disk-like forms of coins--gold, solid, heavy, eminently portable. Perhaps steel <b>cash-boxes</b> with a chased design, on the covers; or perhaps a black and brass box with {{a handle on the}} top, and full of goodness knows what. Bank notes? Why not? The fellow had been going home; so it was surely something worth going home with.|$|R
60|$|The same face: {{the very}} same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights, and boots; the tassels {{on the latter}} bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge {{observed}} it closely) of <b>cash-boxes,</b> keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "My <b>cash-box!</b> My--he--look here, Captain Davidson! He ran {{off with}} a girl. What do I care for the girl? The girl is nothing to me." ...|$|E
60|$|With that comforting reflection, he {{drew out}} a {{battered}} tin <b>cash-box</b> {{from the inner}} recesses of the drawer, and locked up the stolen correspondence to bide its time.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. Dear innocence, {{how should}} you? Your brains {{are in your}} fists. Go and keep watch. (He goes {{into the office and}} returns with the <b>cash-box.)</b> Keep watch, I say.|$|E
5000|$|It {{would be}} Marley's ghost {{who would be}} Scrooge's first visitor (before the three other spirits to come); Marley preys upon Scrooge's mind in many {{different}} ways, notably his face manifesting on the knocker on Ebenezer Scrooge's front door and causing the bells in his house to ring. The ghost maintains the same voice, hairstyle and sense of dress that he had in life, but is translucent. He wears a handkerchief tied about his jaws, and [...] "captive, bound and double-ironed" [...] with chains which are described as [...] "long, and wound about him like a tail; it was made... of <b>cash-boxes,</b> keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel." [...] He often, in moments of great despair or impatience at Scrooge's scepticism, flings these upon the ground before him and almost induces his former partner [...] "into a swoon". He explains {{that it is the}} chain he unknowingly forged himself in life, {{as a result of his}} greed and selfishness. As he spent his life on this earth obsessing over money and mistreating the poor and wretched to fill his pocket, Marley is condemned to walk the earth for eternity never to find rest or peace, experiencing an [...] "incessant torture of remorse", lamenting that Christmas is the time he suffers most of all.|$|R
60|$|Grief made no reply, and {{the other}} busied himself in {{attempting}} to unlock a large and much-dented <b>cash-box.</b> From on deck came falsetto cries and the creak and rattle of blocks as the black crew swung up mainsail and driver. Grief watched a large cockroach crawling over the greasy paintwork. Griffiths, with an oath of irritation, carried the <b>cash-box</b> to the companion-steps for better light. Here, on his feet, and bending over the box, his back to his visitor, his hands shot out to the rifle that stood beside the steps, {{and at the same}} moment he whirled about.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not. Ye see, {{ever since}} old Cap'n Bissile {{was held up}} the army {{officers}} keep mum about {{the movements of the}} <b>cash-box.</b> I reckon they have orders from Washington to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Three weeks later, {{after putting}} his <b>cash-box</b> {{away in the}} safe which filled with its iron bulk a corner of their room, Schomberg turned towards his wife, but without looking at her exactly, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' replied Ralph. 'Show her in! Stay.' He hastily {{put away}} a {{padlocked}} <b>cash-box</b> {{that was on}} the table, and substituted in its stead an empty purse. 'There,' said Ralph. 'NOW she may come in.' ...|$|E
60|$|Reaching the {{settlement}} they visited the hardware dealer, who remembered having sold Jernyngham a small cheap <b>cash-box</b> about twelve months earlier. On being shown the bent-up iron, he expressed {{his belief that}} it was the article in question.|$|E
60|$|This was {{addressed}} to the gipsy, who crawled into the low tent on all fours, and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a <b>cash-box,</b> which {{the man who had}} spoken opened with a key he wore about his person.|$|E
60|$|Ralph pushed {{some papers}} {{from him as}} he spoke, and {{carelessly}} rattled his <b>cash-box,</b> as though by mere accident. The sound {{was too much for}} Mr Mantalini. He closed the bargain directly it reached his ears, and Ralph told the money out upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a meat can; top {{edges are}} turned over a wire--here's a bit {{sticking}} out--and it's had a handle. There's a hinge in another place. The {{thing has been}} a box--a <b>cash-box,</b> I guess--one of the rubbishy kind they sell for about a dollar." ...|$|E
6000|$|MACAIRE (aside to BERTRAND). Hang on. (Aloud.) Charles, Charles, my lost boy! (He falls weeping at L. table. DUMONT {{enters the}} office and brings down <b>cash-box</b> to table R. He feels in all his pockets: BERTRAND from behind him making signs to MACAIRE, which the latter does not see.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allowing {{for some}} of the ash {{slipping}} down the pile and for our having moved a little that was there before Wandle threw the <b>cash-box</b> in, it fixes the time he did so pretty close to Jernyngham's disappearance," [...] he remarked. [...] "Looks bad against the Austrian, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '--Hear me out!' said Wegg. 'The Pump.--When I {{struck it}} against the Pump, and found, {{not only that the}} top was loose and opened with a lid, but that {{something}} in it rattled. That something, comrade, I discovered to be a small flat oblong <b>cash-box.</b> Shall I say it was disappointingly light?' ...|$|E
60|$|So far the {{circumstances}} of the case are perfectly clear. They point unmistakably {{to the conclusion that the}} robbery must have been committed by some person living in the house. Suspicion falls, therefore, upon the servant-of-all-work, upon the shopman, and upon Mr. Jay. The two first knew that the <b>cash-box</b> was being inquired for by their master, but did not know what it was he wanted to put into it. They would assume, of course, that it was money. They both had opportunities (the servant when she took away the tea, and the shopman when he came, after shutting up, to give the keys of the till to his master) of seeing the <b>cash-box</b> in Mr. Yatman's pocket, and of inferring naturally, from its position there, that he intended to take it into his bedroom with him at night.|$|E
60|$|Ieremia did {{not reply}} immediately. Reaching under the rear corner of the mats, he drew forth a large <b>cash-box.</b> Grief noted and {{wondered}} {{that it was not}} locked. The Samoan had always been fastidiously cautious in guarding cash. The box seemed filled with paper money. He skinned off the top note and passed it over.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jay, on {{the other}} hand, had been told, during the afternoon's {{conversation}} {{on the subject of}} joint-stock banks, that his landlord had a deposit of two hundred pounds in one of them. He also knew that Mr. Yatman left him with the intention of drawing that money out; and he heard the inquiry for the <b>cash-box</b> afterward, when he was coming downstairs. He must, therefore, have inferred that the money was in the house, and that the <b>cash-box</b> was the receptacle intended to contain it. That he could have had any idea, however, of the place in which Mr. Yatman intended to keep it for the night is impossible, seeing that he went out before the box was found, and did not return till his landlord was in bed. Consequently, if he committed the robbery, he must have gone into the bedroom purely on speculation.|$|E
60|$|I {{have only}} one word more to add, and it is this: If any {{individual}} ventures to assert that Mr. Jay and his confederates are innocent o f all share in the stealing of the <b>cash-box,</b> I, in return, defy that individual--though he may even be Chief Inspector Theakstone himself--to tell me who has committed the robbery at Rutherford Street, Soho.|$|E
60|$|This waiter, who was {{middle-aged and}} spare, looked {{for help to}} a waiter of more authority--a stout, {{potential}} old man, with a double chin, in black breeches and stockings, {{who came out of}} a place like a churchwarden's pew, {{at the end of the}} coffee-room, where he kept company with a <b>cash-box,</b> a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers.|$|E
60|$|Now, though Wilson {{at present}} {{suspected}} nothing, not knowing {{of the existence}} of the <b>cash-box,</b> Farnie felt that when the money came to be missed, and inquiries were made as to {{who had been in the}} study, and when, he would recall the interview. Two courses, therefore, remained open to him. He could leave the money altogether, or he could take it and leave himself. In other words, run away.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, Pip," [...] said Joe; [...] "and {{they took}} his till, {{and they took}} his <b>cash-box,</b> and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles, and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him up to his bedpust, and they giv' him a dozen, and they stuffed his mouth full of {{flowering}} annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, she'll {{not be in}} the way," [...] {{answered}} Big Sam with a laugh. [...] "If he doesn't {{take her}} off before I sail, that's his business. If I am obliged to leave port without his <b>cash-box,</b> I will marry his daughter and become his son-in-law--I don't doubt we can find a parson among all the rascals on board--then, perhaps, he will think it his duty to send me drafts to the different ports I touch at." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} it, he {{soon found}} an iron <b>cash-box</b> in a cupboard and succeeded in forcing {{it with a}} screw-driver. It contained a few papers, among which were one or two relating to {{the purchase of the}} quarter-section, and Wandle put these in his pocket. The others he threw into the cupboard--Jernyngham's carelessness was well known--and then hastily studied a railroad time-table. By starting promptly, he could catch a train at the station next after Sebastian, which he thought would be wiser, and reach a new wooden town of some importance in the evening. Having ascertained this, he hurried out and rode home, taking the <b>cash-box</b> with him. On arriving, he smashed it flat with an ax and flung it into his stove in which a fire was burning; then he made a hasty meal, changed his clothes, and saddling a horse, rode hard across the prairie. There was, he realized, some risk in what he meant to do, {{but it was not a}} very serious one, and he was thankful that the sale of land is attended by few formalities in western Canada.|$|E
