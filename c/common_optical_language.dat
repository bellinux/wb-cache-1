40|$|Coherence {{multiplexing}} (CM) is {{a relatively}} unknown form of optical CDMA, which is particulary suitable in medium bit rate, short-range optical networks like LANs. The main purpose of the technique is to allow multiple users to transmit through a <b>common</b> <b>optical</b> fiber simultaneously. When this number is too large, however, the BER will become unacceptably high. Therefore a protocol is needed to control the traffic. In this paper several protocols are presented. An adapted version of synchronous TDMA, two new protocols and a central control unit will be proposed and discussed. Finally, the protocols will be compared with respect to performance and practical implementation aspects. 1 Coherence multiplexing (CM) Coherence multiplexing (CM) [1] {{is a form of}} optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) that enables distributed users to transmit through a <b>common</b> <b>optical</b> fiber, us-ing broadband optical sources (like LEDs) and Mach-Zehnder interferometers with very large path length differences.

50|$|All three <b>common</b> <b>optical</b> disc media (Compact disc, DVD, and Blu-ray) use {{light from}} laser diodes, for its {{spectral}} purity {{and ability to}} be focused precisely. DVD uses light of 650 nm wavelength (red), as opposed to 780 nm (far-red, commonly called infrared) for CD. This shorter wavelength allows a smaller pit on the media surface compared to CDs (0.74 Âµm for DVD versus 1.6 Âµm for CD), accounting in part for DVD's increased storage capacity.|$|R
50|$|The most <b>common</b> <b>optical</b> {{system uses}} spherical collimators and thus {{contains}} optical aberrations that curve the field where the slit images come to focus, so that slits are sometimes curved {{instead of simply}} straight, to approximate the curvature of the image. This allows taller slits to be used, gathering more light, while still achieving high spectral resolution. Some designs take another approach and use toroidal collimating mirrors to correct the curvature instead, allowing higher straight slits without sacrificing resolution.|$|R
50|$|A third {{approach}} to digital matting is using three video streams with different focusing distances and depths of field. As {{with the previous}} method, all three image sensors share a <b>common</b> <b>optical</b> axis, though now the algorithm uses information about {{what part of the}} image is in focus in which video feed to generate its foreground matte. With this technique, both the foreground and background can have dynamic content, and there are no restrictions on what colors or complexity the background has.|$|R
