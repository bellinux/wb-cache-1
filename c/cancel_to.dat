50|$|Similar to <b>cancel</b> <b>to</b> {{order is}} postmarked to order which {{occurs when the}} stamps are {{purchased}} at full value, placed {{on a piece of}} mail, and then cancelled by the clerk on request. The mail then is handed back to the customer instead of traveling through the post. This is sometimes called favour cancellation, or hand-back,. Some countries' postal regulations permit this and others forbid it. It is misleading because the cancelled envelope appears to have gone through the mails though it has not. For instance, it is missing additional postal markings typically applied to real mail.|$|E
50|$|For example, the Poynting vector {{within the}} {{dielectric}} insulator of a coaxial cable is nearly {{parallel to the}} wire axis (assuming no fields outside the cable and a wavelength longer than {{the diameter of the}} cable, including DC). Electrical energy delivered to the load is flowing entirely through the dielectric between the conductors. Very little energy flows in the conductors themselves, since the electric field strength is nearly zero. The energy flowing in the conductors flows radially into the conductors and accounts for energy lost to resistive heating of the conductor. No energy flows outside the cable, either, since there the magnetic fields of inner and outer conductors <b>cancel</b> <b>to</b> zero.|$|E

50|$|Kent tricks the {{telephone}} operator by {{giving him a}} false confirmation code, proving he isn't the real agency operator; the operator offers Kent a deal, and Kent pretends to have killed Katherine. Kent escapes to his car, where he recovers a cell phone, and then races back to protect Katherine, who has cracked the code and is broadcasting orders to <b>cancel</b> <b>to</b> previous instructions. Katherine leaves her station when she sees the assassin, but he manages to wound her before Kent kills him. Katherine insists that Kent complete the final cancellation order, and he leaves her side briefly. When he returns, he administers an anesthetic, and she asks him if she will wake. Kent reassures her {{that he will not}} kill her, but he reports her as dead to Grey. Kent spreads C4 explosives throughout the base and drops Katherine's jewelry on the floor. After he carries Katherine outside, the base explodes, destroying all evidence.|$|E
