40|$|Shale gas is a {{hydrocarbon}} gas occurring in organic-rich argillaceous shale {{in a free}} and adsorbed state. The shale in shale gas reservoirs is source rock and also <b>container</b> <b>rock,</b> which {{is different from the}} situation in conventional gas reservoirs; the gas content in shale is mainly related to the abundance, type, and evolution degree of organic matter. The Taiyuan Formation in the Ordos Basin is marine-continental transitional sediments; the argillaceous shale of the Taiyuan Formation has features such as high organic matter abundance and high thermal evolution degree and has better reservoir-forming conditions, compared with the shale gas reservoirs outside China. The argillaceous shale in the Taiyuan Formation strata is mixed with thin gas-bearing sand layers, which indicates a high hydrocarbon-generating potential of the argillaceous shale. According to the main reservoir-forming conditions of shale gas, it is predicted that the favorable zones of shale gas in the Taiyuan Formation are primarily located in areas such as the northwestern corner of the Tianhuan Depression, the northeastern corner of the Shanbei Slope Belt, and the central and southern parts of the Ordos Basin. With the rapid progress in shale gas exploration and exploitation technologies, the shale gas in the Taiyuan Formation in the Ordos Basin has become an important exploration target because of its huge potential...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although adult {{mosquito}} vectors of sylvatic arbovirus [yellow fever (YFV), dengue- 2 (DENV- 2) and chikungunya (CHIKV) ] {{have been}} studied for the past 40 years in southeastern Senegal, data are still lacking on the ecology of larval mosquitoes in this area. In this study, we investigated the larval habitats of mosquitoes and characterized their seasonal and spatial dynamics in arbovirus foci. Methods: We searched for wet microhabitats, classified in 9 categories, in five land cover classes (agriculture, forest, savannah, barren and village) from June, 2010 to January, 2011. Mosquito immatures were sampled monthly in up to 30 microhabitats of each category per land cover and bred until adult stage for determination. Results: No wet microhabitats {{were found in the}} agricultural sites; in the remaining land covers immature stages of 35 mosquito species in 7 genera were sampled from 9 microhabitats (tree holes, fresh fruit husks, decaying fruit husks, puddles, bamboo holes, discarded <b>containers,</b> tires, <b>rock</b> holes and storage containers). The most abundant species was Aedes aegypti formosus, representing 30. 2 % of the collections, followed by 12 species, representing each more than 1 % of the total, among them the arbovirus vectors Ae. vittatus (7. 9 %), Ae. luteocephalus (5. 7 %) ...|$|R

These shortcomings reduces the barrier role of the rock and the required effective isolation of HLW has to be provided by engineered barriers of which clay-embedded metal canisters are most important. The paper describes {{the performance of the}} near field rock of HLW packages according to two types of repositories: very long subhorizontal holes with large diameter (1. 9 m) bored or blasted at 400 - 600 m depth, and bored 4 km deep holes with clay/concrete seals in the upper 2 km parts and HLW packages separated by clay/concrete seals in the lower 2 km parts. The most important difference between the two concepts is the much higher groundwater transmissivity of the rock in the shallow repository. A common feature is the need for rock support by filling the space between waste <b>containers</b> and <b>rock</b> with clay mud after installing the containers in shallow repositories, and by keeping the holes in deep repositories filled with clay mud from the start of boring the holes and throughout the installation of clay/concrete seals. Focus is on the role of rock discontinuities on the hydraulic and mechanical performances of the repository host rock at construction and under seismic and tectonic impact.

40|$|This {{new series}} of works by Andrea Gregson is an {{assortment}} of objects constructed from found and acquired, often broken, man-made items as well as material from nature. The individual elements in these sculptures have been collected by Gregson over a protracted period and are linked together by the journey through her life. Reconfigured in this new body of work the many separate parts form a new cohesive whole. Using the found objects as well as casting them in different materials, Gregson reinvents them as sculptural assemblage. Within the display cabinet {{is a series of}} sculptures bringing together found items and components cast in bronze. The works are composed from parts of food and cosmetic <b>containers</b> and <b>rocks</b> found on walks along the Thames embankment as well as other locations. There is a distinct play between the moulded forms, where the original material has lost its specific character; the organic, raw state of the stone and rock constituents and the pieces that are remnants from modern-day life. On the wall opposite, concrete sculptures disrupt the wall as evolving shapes emerge from the surface. A transformation from visceral material to tangible form takes place, one that is reminiscent of the intermediary stages between liquid to solid states. Another series of sculptures are placed on the tables in Concrete Café, offering the invitation to be handled. Ornamental in scale, these plaster objects are oddities with a debatable purpose. The making of some of this new work was inspired by Gregson’s recent encounter at Camber Sands with WW 2 Bunkers that were cast in-situ on the beach. Over time the ground has shifted to reveal the softer organic form of the foundations now visibly in strong contrast with the brutal structures of the wood cast bunkers. A relation echoed throughout Gregsons new work...|$|R
40|$|In {{the project}} ''Corrosion Evaluation of Metallic Materials for Long-Lived HLW/Spent Fuel Disposal Containers,'' (November 2000 to October 2003) {{in-depth}} corrosion studies are performed on preselected <b>container</b> materials in <b>rock</b> salt, granite and clay environments. The materials investigated are carbon steel, stainless steels, Ni-base alloys (Hastelloy C- 4 and Hastelloy C- 22), the alloy Ti 99. 8 -Pd and Cu-base materials. The {{objectives of the}} studies are: to {{determine the influence of}} essential parameters (e. g., composition of the medium, temperature etc.) on corrosion, {{to gain a better understanding}} of corrosion mechanisms, and to provide more accurate data for modeling the corrosion of the containers over hundred of years.

Aedes aegypti, Cx. nebulosus, Cx. perfuscus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Er. chrysogster and Ae. vittatus were the only common species collected from all land covers. Aedes furcifer and Ae. taylori were collected in fresh fruit husks and tree holes. Species richness and dominance varied significantly in land covers and microhabitats. Positive associations were found mainly between Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus. A high proportion of potential enzootic vectors that are not anthropophilic were found in the larval mosquito fauna. Conclusions In southeastern Senegal, Ae. furcifer and Ae. taylori larvae showed a more limited distribution among both land cover and microhabitat types than the other common species. Uniquely among vector species, Ae. aegypti formosus larvae occurred at the highest frequency in villages. Finally, a high proportion of the potential non-anthropophilic vectors were represented in the larval mosquito fauna, suggesting the existence of unidentified sylvatic arbovirus cycles in southeastern Senegal. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study plant is to {{describe}} tests known as Engineered Barrier System Field Tests (EBSFT), which are to be conducted in the Exploratory Study Facility (ESF) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The EBSFT is designed to provide information on the interaction between waste packages (simulated by heated <b>containers),</b> the surrounding <b>rock</b> mass, and its vadose water. The Yucca Mountain site is being characterized to determine its suitability as a potential deep geological repository for high-level nuclear waste. Water is the main medium by which radioactive nuclides travel to the accessible environment. Therefore, the movement of water over the approximate 10, 000 [...] year lifetime required for radioactive nuclide decay must be understood. Development of a repository and emplacement of nuclear wastes impose stress loadings on the repository rock mass. The stress loadings include (1) thermal energy and irradiation from the waste packages, and (2) mechanical stress due to the mining of openings, and the transporting of waste canisters. The influence f the thermal stress may extend to all lithological units, including the saturated zone under the ground water table, in Yucca Mountain. In general, the {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the movement of water in the rock mass under the influence of the thermal loading of the waste packages. Specifically, the study will investigate heat flow mechanism, relationship between boiling and dry-out, and the rewetting of the dry-out region when the repository is cooled down...|$|R
