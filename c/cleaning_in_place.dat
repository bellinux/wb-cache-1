40|$|Fire risk {{in major}} forest types and {{concomitant}} vegetation complexes across all altitudinal belts has been analyzed. High fire risk in woodlands {{is determined by}} domination of light needle coniferous stands in their structure and specific climate with continuous spring-summer droughts. Thus, the risk of landscape wildfires is high. The most drastic situations occur in very dry years of climatic cycles during forest pyrogenic anomalies when fire spreads across the main landscapes in several nature areas. Current fire-frequency is incompatible with high biosphere status of nature complex of Lake Baikal {{as an object of}} the World nature heritage. Extensive forest exploitation is unacceptable as well. Fire-prevention measures in the area require modernization. According to the results of many years of comparative studies of fire risk in phytocenoses with different species composition and structure of tree layers, the techniques of making fire stopping barriers were developed. The scheme of dividing the managed forests into isolated cells separated by special obstacles and fire-resistant forest borders combined with commonly used fire barriers is suggested. Fire-resistant barriers should be formed on both sides of main roads, passing through the intensively exploited woodlands dominating with common pine Pinus sylvestris L., Siberian stone pine Pinus sibirica Du Tour, Siberian spruce Picea obovata Ledeb., and Siberian fir Abies sibirica Ledeb. tree species. Such barriers are intended to stop the fire front of crown fires. The barrier width is determined by the cell order.

40|$|Background: In Australia, {{little is}} known about the risk of {{acquiring}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from prior room occupants. The aims of the study are to understand the risk of MRSA acquisition from prior room occupants and to further extend the existing knowledge-base on the role of discharge <b>cleaning</b> <b>in</b> hospitals. Methods: A non-concurrent cohort study was undertaken in five wards at a 250 -bed general hospital in Tasmania, Australia. All admitted patients were screened for MRSA. Weekly screenings for all patients who remained in hospital were undertaken. New MRSA acquisitions were identified. The exposed group were patients whose immediate prior room occupant had MRSA, while the unexposed prior room occupant did not have MRSA. Results: 6228 patients were at risk of acquiring MRSA, with 237 new MRSA acquisitions equating to an acquisition rate of 3. 8 % for each at-risk patient admission. The unadjusted odds ratio for acquiring MRSA when the prior room occupant had MRSA was 2. 9 (95 % CI 2. 2 - 3. 9). Using logistic regression, exposure to a prior occupant harbouring MRSA remained a significant predictor of subsequent acquisition, after controlling for variables, OR 2. 7 (95 % CI 2. 0 - 3. 6). Conclusion: Admission to a room previously occupied by a person with MRSA increased the odds of acquisition for the subsequent patient, independent of other risk factors. It demonstrates the necessity of having effective discharge <b>cleaning</b> practices <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> We believe increased attention to discharge room <b>cleaning</b> <b>in</b> hospitals is required and the reconsideration of additional recommendations for discharge cleaning...|$|R
40|$|Membrane fouling is an {{inherent}} phenomenon in ultrafiltration (UF) membrane processes, making {{it necessary to}} periodically perform backwashes (BW) and chemical <b>cleanings</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> (CIP) to restore the initial permeability of the membrane. The objective {{of this study was}} (1) to explore systematically the effect of distinct BW-related variables (BW transmembrane pressure, duration, frequency and composition) on the reversibility of UF membrane fouling and on the permeate quality (in terms of total organic carbon, turbidity and UV absorbance) over successive filtration/BW cycles; and (2) to identify which organic fractions were most removed by the membrane and, of these, which were most detached after BW, alkaline and oxidant CIP and acid CIP episodes. For this purpose, a bench-scale outside-in hollow fibre module operated under dead-end filtration mode at constant transmembrane pressure and treating settled water from a drinking water treatment plant was employed. Dissolved organic carbon fractionation was performed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. Results showed that, in general, the more intensive the BW was (in terms of high transmembrane pressure, shortened frequency and prolonged duration) the more effective it was in removing fouling from the membrane. Concerning the composition of the water used for the BW, the addition of NaClO led to maximum fouling reversibility, closely followed by the combination of NaOH+NaClO, while citric acid and NaOH contributed little compared to water alone. However, results also showed that irreversible fouling was never completely avoided whatever the BW regime applied, leading to a gradual increase in the total resistance over time. Larger differences in the behaviour of the different organic fractions were observed. UF membrane preferentially retained the heaviest fraction of biopolymers (BP), while the intermediate fraction of humic substances (HS) was removed at a lower percentage and the lighter fractions seemed to entirely pass through the UF membrane. The successive application of BW and CIPs resulted in the detachment from the membrane of a significant percentage of the retained BP, whereas only a modest percentage of the retained HS.

In response to these issues, we have set out to develop an in-station cleaning robot {{as a way of}} assisting the task of cleaning. A background stimulus to this development project has been the incredible advancements in recent years made in robot technologies that are now fit for use in real-life situations. While there are various robot technologies such as those for control, drive, sensor and artificial intelligence, not all of them are just necessarily limited to robots. For instance, sensor technology is vital for robots in the task of recognizing the surrounding environments, but that same technology also is used on the latest automobiles to automatically activate brakes to avoid collisions. In this way, robot technologies are advancing hand in hand with various products, industries, and research to reach a level in which they can sufficiently be used to mimic a certain range of movements and to add some automatic or autonomous functions to existing devices. Nevertheless, unlike the humanoid robots in movies, the reality is that a multi-purpose robot that can handle all environments and all types of work does not exist. Consequently, we need to design the optimum robot for the locations and work we deal with at JR East. This report thus deals with the development of a robot to clean inside railway stations...|$|R
