These are areas of exploration that engage with the margins that surround the experience of doing creative writing, but which writers often prefer not to articulate.

This is especially opaque when it comes to the question of why writing has such emotional impact for readers (and writers) —and because feeling may or may not be consciously experienced when writing is done.

The two methods have similar <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations</b> but different architectures. SINTACS has been studied for evaluating the vulnerability of aquifers composed {{of any kind of}} geological structure. (Civita, 1997). On the other hand, EPIK is a procedure developed for geological setting existing in Switzerland. It has been implemented expressly to defend karst aquifers (Ofefp, 1998). Therefore, one could be called “general”, i. e. SINTACS, and the other “specialist”, i. e. EPIK. Because of their complex structure, karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable to pollution and therefore they need a special protection. The Maiella carbonate massif, situated in Central Italy, more exactly in the Abruzzi Apennines, covers a surface of 416 square km. It represents an important groundwater basin in Italy, with the typical and distinctive features of a karst aquifer. This research describes the various steps to carry out vulnerability maps by using a geographic information system. Lastly the results obtained by applying the two mentioned methods are compared, trying to identify and outline the more sensitive areas...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{definition}} of ideology in the pontificate of Gregory VII (1073 - 1085) and in the reform movement which bears his name. The indeterminacy of historiographical notions of ‘Gregorian ideology’ is problematic. As a concept theorised in political science, ideology harbours a variety of connotations and meanings such that its generic use leaves important theoretical questions unanswered. Yet, in seeking to apply a theoretical definition, it is quickly apparent that the diversity of <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations</b> grouped {{under the umbrella of}} ideology precludes any single, universally accepted definition of the term. Testing Gregorian reform for a concept of ideology therefore necessitates the prior definition of the concept itself. As a result, this thesis is as much an exercise in modelling a concept of ideology as seeking to address a historiographical ambiguity. The state of the question is this: can a definition of ideology be construed to theoretically prove or disprove a concept of ‘Gregorian ideology’? When coupled with the nature of Gregorian reform {{as one of the most}} complex aspects of Church history, defining ideology becomes an especially ambitious undertaking. The following analysis offers a discussion of how a theoretical concept can be applied to the sources...|$|R

40|$|Recession flow of {{aquifers}} from a hillslope can {{be described}} by the non-linear Boussinesq equation. Under strong assumptions and for specific <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations,</b> different authors derived analytical approximations or linearized versions to this partial differential equation. A comparative analysis between some analytical approximations of the Boussinesq equation and the numerical solution of the recession flow of an unconfined homogeneous aquifer (horizontal, inclined and concave aquifer floor) was carried out. The objective was to define the range where the analytical solutions approximate the numerical solution. The latter was considered in this study as the reference method, because it requires fewer assumptions. From the considered analytical approximations, exponential decay relationships {{were found to be}} mainly valid for fine domain materials when horizontal, mild slopes (less than 2 %) and concave aquifer floors were considered, but failed to reproduce coarse aquifer numerical model outflows, in contrast to the quadratic decay relationship, which better reproduce outflows in such domains. On the basis of the comparative analysis, it has been found that recession flows obtained with the considered analytical approximations yield similar values only for certain ranges of aquifer properties and geometries.

40|$|Neurons and neural populations do not {{function}} as islands onto themselves. Rather, {{they interact with}} other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations</b> of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e. g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means {{in terms of an}} underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the career construction theory (Savickas, 2005, 2013), adaptation is fostered by adapt-ability resources via the process of adapting.

These hypotheses were tested in a short-term multiwave study with a sample of incoming college undergraduates (N = 236). The resultant data were largely consistent with the study’s hypotheses. In structural equations analyses optimism was shown to be a direct predictor of the greater use of engagement coping, and better psychological adaptation to college transition. Further, empirical tests of mediation revealed that the relations of optimism with academic and psychological adaptation were mediated by engagement coping. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to contribute to}} the area of poverty studies by appraising the potentiality of traditional research methods and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) as proper instruments for analyzing poverty situations according to a relational perspective. The theoretical concepts of poverty have gradually developed towards the idea that it is a complex and multidimensional problem, which involves interrelated social and economic factors. Empirical research methods about the subject, however, do not appear to reflect such complexity. Under this point of view, one can say that the main methodologies usually supporting poverty studies - such as synthetic indices, social-indicator systems and regression analysis - are not satisfactory ways of treating the phenomenon relationally. Considering {{the state of the art}} of quantitative methodologies for social research, SEM is regarded as an innovative method that can provide helpful ways of approaching social phenomena relationally. SEM is seen as the most advanced technique in terms of its ability to articulate social variables, as it allows for a simultaneous estimation of the relationships among all factors associated with a phenomenon. This paper examines SEM's analytical features as a relational method by using a conceptual approach, in which the traditional methods are also discussed, in order to theoretically appraise their limitations and potentialities as relational methodologies. The findings show that, indeed, SEM is a more powerful instrument for carrying out a relational analysis of poverty than the traditional quantitative methodologies, since unlike those, SEM is able to empirically reflect the articulate complexity of recent <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{commentary}} describes {{my recent}} approach to writing compositions for the ensemble performance of computer music. Drawing on experimental music and improvisation, I contend that such music is best considered {{in terms of}} people’s situated and relational interplay. The compositional and performative question that permeates this thesis is ‘what can we do, in this time and space, with these tools available to us?’. As themes of equality and egalitarian access underpin this work throughout, I highlight my engagement with Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) ideology and community, reflecting on how this achieves my aims. I describe my writing of text score compositions, making {{use of the term}} bounded improvisation, whose purposeful requirements for indeterminate realisation extends most current computer-based performance practice. Though no single strand of this research is perhaps unusual by itself, such an assemblage as that outlined above (incorporating composition, computer coding and ensemble performance practice) is, when allied to an understanding of electronic and computer music praxis, currently an underdeveloped approach. Such an approach I have thus chosen to term free open computer music. I incorporate two further pre-existing <b>conceptual</b> <b>formulations</b> to present a framework for constructing, reflecting on, and developing my work in this field. Firstly flow or 'immersed experience' is useful to explicate difficult to capture aspects of instrumental engagement and ensemble performance. Secondly, this portfolio of scores aims to produce well-constructed situations, facilitating spaces of flow which contain within their environments the opportunity for an event to take place. I present the outcomes of my practice as place-forming tactics that catalyse something to do, but not what to do, in performative spaces such as those described above. Such intentions define my aims for composition. These theoretical concerns, together with an allied consideration of the underpinning themes highlighted above, is a useful framework for refection and evaluation of this work...|$|R
