25|$|The {{meristem}} can {{be defined}} as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain undifferentiated stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. Their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative meristem or the meristem of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> <b>determination</b> mechanisms. This means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell’s characteristics (gene WUSCHEL or WUS), and others will act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene CLAVATA or CLV). In this way both mechanisms give rise to a feedback loop, which along with other elements lend a great deal of robustness to the system. Along with the WUS gene the SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) gene also represses the differentiation of the meristematic dome. This gene acts by inhibiting the possible differentiation of the stem cells but still allows cell division in the daughter cells, which, had they been allowed to differentiate, would have given rise to distinct organs.|$|E

Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> <b>determination.</b> Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks {{are associated with the}} cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.|$|E

FGFs represent a large family of secreted molecules [22 genes in humans, 18 of which are true secreted FGF ligands (1, 2) ]. Upon binding to their cognate receptors (FGFRs), FGFs activate signal transduction pathways required for multiple developmental processes, including the specification of <b>cell</b> <b>fates,</b> <b>determination</b> of axial polarity, and promotion of cell survival (3, 4).

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila bristle lineage is an {{excellent}} system in which to study how <b>cell</b> cycle and <b>fate</b> <b>determination</b> are synchronized in invariant cell lineages. In this model, five different cells arise from a single precursor cell, pI, after four asymmetric cell divisions. Cell diversity is achieved by the asymmetric segregation of cell determinants, such as Numb and Neuralized (Neur), resulting in differential activation of the Notch (N) pathway. We show that down-regulation of Cdc 2, by over-expressing Tribbles, Dwee 1, and Dmyt 1 (three negative regulators of Cdc 2) or by using thermo-sensitive Cdc 2 mutant flies, delayed pI mitosis, and altered the polarity {{and the number of}} subsequent cell divisions. These modifications were associated with a mother–daughter <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> transformation as the pI cell acquired the identity of the secondary precursor cell, pIIb. This type of change in cell identity only occurred when the N signaling pathway was inactive since ectopic N signaling transformed pI to pIIa-progeny fate.

40|$|Fully-connected triads (FCTs), {{such as the}} Oct 4 -Sox 2 -Nanog triad, {{have been}} implicated as {{recurring}} transcriptional motifs embedded within the regulatory networks that specify and maintain cellular states. To explore the possible connections between FCT topologies and <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> <b>determinations,</b> we employed computational network screening to search all possible FCT topologies for multistability, a dynamic property that allows the rise of alternate regulatory states from the same transcriptional network. The search yielded a hierarchy of FCTs with various potentials for multistability, including several topologies capable of reaching eight distinct stable states. Our analyses suggested that complete auto-activation is an effective indicator for multistability, and, when gene expression noise was incorporated into the model, the networks were able to transit multiple states spontaneously. Different levels of stochasticity were found to either induce or disrupt random state transitioning with some transitions requiring layovers at one or more intermediate states. Using this framework we simulated a simplified model of induced pluripotency by including constitutive overexpression terms.

The expression of elements of the Notch signaling pathway {{have been found in}} the developing pancreas, suggesting that Notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. Evidence suggests Notch signaling regulates the progressive recruitment of endocrine cell types from a common precursor, acting through two possible mechanisms.

This process {{is an essential}} feature of the adaptive immune response to a pathogen {{and the development of}} long-lasting immunity. The ‘histone code’ hypothesis proposes that formation of stable epigenetic histone marks at a gene locus that activate or repress transcription is essential for <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> <b>determinations,</b> such as T helper 1 /T helper 2 <b>cell</b> <b>fate</b> decisions. Activation and silencing of the Ifng gene are achieved through the creation of stable epigenetic histone marks spanning a region of genomic DNA over 20 times greater than the gene itself. Key transcription factors that drive the T helper 1 lineage decision, signal transducer and activator 4 (STAT 4) and T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), play direct roles in the formation of activating histone marks at the Ifng locus. Conversely, STAT 6 and GATA binding protein 3, transcription factors essential for the T helper 2 cell lineage decision, establish repressive histone marks at the Ifng locus. Functional studies demonstrate that multiple genomic elements up to 50 kilobases from Ifng play critical roles in its proper transcriptional regulation. Studies of three-dimensional chromatin conformation indicate that these distal regulatory elements may loop towards Ifng to regulate its transcription. We speculate that these complex mechanisms have evolved to tightly control levels of interferon-γ production, given that too little or too much production would be very deleterious to the host...|$|R

40|$|During development, cells undergo {{dramatic}} changes in their morphology. By affecting contact geometry, these morphological changes could influence cellular communication. However, it has remained unclear whether and how signaling depends on contact geometry. This question is particularly relevant for Notch signaling, which coordinates neighboring <b>cell</b> <b>fates</b> through direct cell-cell signaling. Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This relationship extends across contact diameters ranging from micrometers to tens of micrometers.

The versatility and complexity of Wnt signaling has been further highlighted {{by the emergence of}} a novel family of Wnt receptors, the Ryk family. In mammals and flies, Ryk is a key chemorepulsive axon guidance receptor responsible for the establishment of important axon tracts during nervous system development. Although the function of Ryk is currently best understood with respect to this role, its widespread expression, both in developing tissues and in the adult, suggests that Ryk may regulate many essential biological processes. This hypothesis is supported by the multiple developmental phenotypes apparent in Ryk loss-of-function mice. These mice display a variety of embryonic abnormalities, including disruption of skeletal, craniofacial and cardiac development.
