5|$|By 2006, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas {{managed to}} defeat {{the forces of the}} Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo. The latter cartel {{concentrated}} its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started to expand into other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. He was reassigned to the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf Cartel.|$|E
5|$|The south–west Monsoon from June to September {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the south-west monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region (the region that deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of south-west monsoon heads toward north east India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the south-west monsoon due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north–east Monsoon. The north-east monsoon take place from November to early March when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin II {{ratified}} the Pactum upon {{his release from}} captivity in 1125, although he refused to recognize the Venetian communes as fully autonomous entities within the Kingdom; he asserted his feudal rights by asking for the service of three Venetian knights. The treaty {{seems to have been}} in force up to the fall of the kingdom in 1291, and the Venetian communes in Acre and Tyre were particularly powerful and influential in the 13th century after the kingdom lost Jerusalem and was reduced to a <b>coastal</b> <b>state.</b> They resisted Emperor Frederick II's attempts to claim the Kingdom, and virtually ignored the authority of the Lord of Tyre. Instead, they conducted their affairs as if they controlled their own independent lordship — which, essentially, they did, thanks to the terms of the Pactum.|$|E
25|$|Yet another circumstantial {{evidence}} is that Jagannath is sometimes identified with or substituted for Buddha, as the ninth avatar of Vishnu by Hindus, {{when it could}} have been substituted for any other avatar. Jagannath was worshipped in Puri by the Odias as a form of Buddha from a long time. Jayadeva, in Gita Govinda also has described Buddha as one among the Dasavatara. Indrabhuti, the ancient Buddhist king describes Jagannath as a Buddhist deity in Jnanasidhi. Further, as a Buddhist king, Indrabhuti worshipped Jagannath. This is not unique to the <b>coastal</b> <b>state</b> of Odisha, but possibly also influenced Buddhism in Nepal and Tibet. In Nepal, Buddha is also worshipped as Jagannath in Nepal. This {{circumstantial evidence}} has been questioned because the reverent mention of Jagannath in the Indrabhuti text may merely be a coincidental homonym, may indeed refer to the Buddha, because the same name may refer to two different persons or things.|$|E

40|$|The Arctic Sunrise {{arbitration}} {{highlighted the}} difficulties inherent in balancing the competing rights of <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> and flag States in the {{exclusive economic zone}} and over the continental shelf. In a comprehensive decision, the Tribunal canvassed the area of law and provided much needed guidance on the enforcement rights of <b>coastal</b> <b>States</b> within these maritime zones. However, this paper argues that the Tribunal’s recognition of enforcement rights places significant limitations on a <b>coastal</b> <b>State’s</b> ability to protect its sovereign rights in the exclusive economic zone and over the continental shelf. First, this paper addresses the Tribunal’s pragmatic interpretation {{of the doctrine of}} hot pursuit, confirming that such an interpretation is consistent with academic commentary and State practice. The second part of this paper looks more critically at the Tribunal’s decision, concluding that the Tribunal’s recognition enforcement rights over the non-living resources in the continental shelf may be too harsh on <b>coastal</b> <b>States...</b>|$|R
