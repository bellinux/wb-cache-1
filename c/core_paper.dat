40|$|The {{founding}} fathers of Complex Problem Solving (CPS) research utilized {{the advent of}} computer-technology to connect problem solving research to the affordances of everyday life. During the last decades, this tradition {{has led to a}} thriving field of CPS research with interesting implications for a number of applied settings. The goal of this thesis is (re-) connecting CPS research to a specific area of application: Organizational Psychology (OP). To this end, the first <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> of the thesis explores the relation of CPS {{to one of the most}} important psychological constructs in OP, namely intelligence, thereby complementing the nomological network of the construct (Chapter 2). The second <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> of the thesis is closer aligned with the practical side of utilizing a construct in OP and considers the valid and reliable assessment of CPS with the help of finite state automata (Chapter 3). The third <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> of the thesis builds on this foundation in terms of construct and assessment and explores the connections between CPS and OP in a discussion of researchers and practitioners from both fields (Chapter 4). In summary, the thesis aims at complementing the current state of insights within CPS research in light of an application in OP and the start of an exchange between both domains...|$|E

40|$|Citation indexes are {{important}} authority resources {{for measuring the}} contribution of scientists and scientific publications to literature. Many studies in information retrieval are based on research aiming to develop retrieval algorithms. These studies tend to receive citations from different fields because of the interdisciplinary nature of information retrieval. Therefore, {{it is important to}} analyze the so-called "citation classics" retrospectively to find out their impact on other fields. Yet, {{it is not easy to}} do this using citation indexes, especially for relatively old papers, as traditional citation analysis tends not to reveal the full impact of a work on other studies at its time and periods that follow. In order to see the big picture it is important to study the contribution of these studies on other disciplines as well. In this study the impact of Maron and Kuhns' citation classic on "probabilistic retrieval" published in 1960 has been visualized using pennant diagrams that were developed on the basis of relevance theory, information retrieval and bibliometrics. We hypothesized that "The interdisciplinary relations that are unobservable with traditional citation analysis can be revealed using the pennant diagrams method". In order to test the hypothesis works that cited Maron and Kuhns' study between the years of 1960 and 2015 have been downloaded with their references (a total of 4, 176 unique works) and graphics have been prepared by the macros written in MS Excel. Of 4, 176 works, 90 were selected using convenience sampling techniques to create static and interactive pennant diagrams for further analysis. Another important output of this study is the relevance rankings. As an alternative to the relevance rankings based on the similarity of references already used in citation indexes, relevance rankings have been created using the pennant diagrams that took into account not only items that cited the core vii (seed) paper but also citations to the items that cited the <b>core</b> <b>paper.</b> Relevance rankings based on the similarity of references and that of pennant diagrams have been compared. Findings support the hypothesis in that pennant diagrams provide information as to which papers that the <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> on probabilistic model influenced or got influenced from, directly or indirectly. Relevance ranking based on pennant diagrams revealed the impact of the <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> on information retrieval field as well as on other disciplines. Furthermore, it identified the relations between these somewhat disconnected fields, between authors, works, and journals that cannot be readily identified using traditional citation analysis. Relevance rankings using pennant diagrams seem to have been more successful than the relevance rankings based on references similarity. This study is the first such study in Turkey that uses pennant diagrams for relevance rankings. The data used in graphs and relevance rankings are available through citation indexes (the frequencies of total citations and co-citations). Thus, alternative relevance rankings based on pennant diagrams can be offered to users. Pennant diagrams can help researchers track the relevant literature more easily as well as identify how a core work influences other works in a specific field or in other fields...|$|E

Narrative derives from a long history of litererary tradition and is increasingly used as a research method. Narrative in essence is the stories of our lives and the stories of the lives of others. Narrative is open to interpretation. This interpretation develops through collaboration of researcher and respondent or story teller and listener. Narrative, explored through interpretive research allows access to the respondent reality via their socially constructed stories. As a term it is a many sided concept. This paper considers the distinct features of narrative, highlighting the potential for overlap within the terms of life history, life incidents, story telling, biography and autobiography. The paper concludes by outlining the possibilities available for collecting and presenting narrative data...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Disasters are {{happening}} in this world as a natural phenomenon or as anthropogenic activities. Organizations and agencies involved in Disaster Management {{find it necessary to}} recruit professionals having specific skills and knowledge, who can contribute to a more holistic understanding of the development, vulnerability and mitigation of disasters. These professionals should be involved in conceptual work, evaluation studies and in the prediction of disasters scientifically. Engineering Education is supposed to educate the budding Engineers, to solve the real and complex problems faced by the world, to have a successful career at their place of work and also in their life. A modified curriculum has to be formulated including Disaster Management as a <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> for engineering students rather than an Elective paper as in some Indian Universities. All Engineering fields are prone to some sort of hazard. Depending on the nature of this hazard, Disaster management component may be included in each and every subject so that the student will be able to understand the practical aspect of the subject better...|$|E
40|$|Methodological individualism underpins {{economic}} analysis. In {{his paper}} in this volume, however, Douglas Glen Whitman demonstrates that group selection can {{be reconciled with}} methodological individualism. This essay extends Whitman’s analysis in two ways. First, it summarizes and restates the necessary conditions for group selection {{to play a role}} in the evolution of human preferences and societies. Second, it discusses the role of group selection in Hayek’s thought, with a particular focus on the role of group selection in the evolution of legal rules and the rule of law. The viability of group selection is demonstrated to be an empirical question. Individuals exist as parts of groups – families, tribes, firms, clubs. Given this observable fact, it is plausible that under at least some evolutionary conditions, individual tastes and preferences might evolve so as to contain sympathy for other members of a larger group in which the individual exists. As Whitman observes in the <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> of this discussion, “MI (methodological individualism) dictates that individual choices lead to social outcomes; GS (group selection) is one force (among many) that determines what sort of individuals are present in the system. ...|$|E

(3) There is no discussion of analytical methods, limits of detection, or the significance of non-detects, which is critical in deriving estimates of exposure.

Citation Mining starts with a group of <b>core</b> <b>papers</b> whose impact is to be examined, retrieves the papers that cite these <b>core</b> <b>papers,</b> and then analyzes the bibliometrics characteristics of the citing papers as well as their linguistic and thematic characteristics. The Science Citation Index is used as the source database for the <b>core</b> of citing <b>papers,</b> since its citation-based structure enables the capability to perform citation studies easily. This paper presents illustrative examples in photovoltaics (applied research) and sandpile dynamics (basic research) to show the types of output products possible. Bibliometric profiling is performed over a number of the citing papers' record fields to offer different perspectives on the citing (user) community. Text mining is performed on the aggregate citing papers, to identify aggregate citing community themes, and to identify extra-discipline and applications themes. The photovoltaics applied research papers had of the order of hundreds of citations in aggregate. All of the citing papers ranged from applied research to applications, and their main themes were fully aligned with those of the aggregate cited papers. This seems to be the typical case with applied research. The sandpile dynamics basic research papers had hundreds of citations in aggregate. Most of the citing papers were also basic research whose main themes were aligned with those of the cited paper. This is typically the case with basic research. However, about twenty percent of the citing papers were research or development in other disciplines, or development within the same discipline.

40|$|The <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> {{focuses on}} {{persistence}} in shareholder returns. However, a CEO wishing to maximize shareholder value may place weight on performance measures other than CAR. We therefore investigate two further performance measures: the deal completion ratio {{and the average}} speed of completion. The deal completion ratio is motivated by Rau’s (2000) finding {{that it is a}} significant determinant of market share. A bidder’s concern with completion may result from managerial self-interest, but can also be fully consistent with value maximization: a CEO who has identified a value-adding deal will justifiably place weight on the probability of eventual completion. There are three stages to a transaction: the initial award of the mandate by the client to the bank, the announcement of the deal, and eventual completion. An announced deal may not be completed for reasons such as antitrust rulings; these deals are classified as “withdrawn”. Rau’s measure of completion ability is the number of completed deals as a percentage of announced deals. One alternative metric would be completed deals as a percentage of mandates awarded, as this would take into account banks ’ failure to bring mandates even to the announcement stage. However, such a measure cannot be used since we only observ...|$|E
40|$|Learning advisors provide {{academic}} literacy development {{support in}} a variety of configurations, ranging from one-on-one consultations through to large-scale lectures. Such lectures can be generic, stand-alone modules or embedded within a discipline-specific course. Pragmatic and institutional considerations suggest that a generic model of delivery often has an effective role to play; however, there are strong pedagogical arguments for adopting an embedded approach wherever possible. The practice of embedding literacy interventions within subject papers is time-consuming and often logistically challenging; therefore, in order to help learning advisors, their managers and academic staff in faculties to consider the issues, options and constraints in a systematic manner, this paper proposes a best-practice model drawing from over two decades of literature and the authors ’ practical experience over the same period in New Zealand and overseas. In order to elucidate the model, the paper critiques an embedded academic literacy skills programme facilitated by an interdisciplinary studies unit at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), New Zealand.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of new {{technologies}} on learning and teaching and draws on research work carried out over a ten-year period. The thesis looks at the facilitators and barriers to using digital technologies effectively and explores the challenges for educators as they respond to the changes {{brought about by the}}se digital technologies. It presents eight published works that have investigated {{the impact of}} digital technologies and collected data using a range of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The <b>core</b> <b>paper</b> provides a model by which the impact of digital technologies can be analysed and understood and the remaining papers populate that model. The model identifies a system of learning spaces that describe the ways that learners, teachers and managers respond to the challenges and opportunities that digital technologies bring to learning. The papers explore how the school space, the teaching space, the personal learning space and the living space have all been transformed by digital technologies. These papers highlight the ongoing tension within education brought about by the conflicting ambitions of managers to control learning {{while at the same time}} encouraging personalisation. The papers consider the nature of digital divides and also the potential hazards presented to young people by digital technologies. Finally, the papers explore the relationship between the use of digital technologies and academic achievement. The work presented here provides a coherent contribution to the field that offers new understandings of the impact of digital technologies on learning, and identifies key issues for further research...|$|E

40|$|Research on pedagogica 1 issues {{associated}} with the delivery and assessment of economics curriculum has increased noticeably since the early 1990 s. This has been driven partly by necessity, as declining numbers in economics majors have caused departments to evaluate their performance, partly by the interests of some economists in pedagogy and partly {{by an increase in}} teaching of economics to students who have opted for majors other than economics. This paper arises from the latter two causes and reports on an innovation that has been used since 2000 with classes containing both business economics and international business students at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), Auckland, New Zealand.

PicoBlaze is based on a RISC architecture of 8 bits. The design was originally named KCPSM which stands for "Constant (K) Coded Programmable State Machine " (formerly "Ken Chapman's PSM"). It is a well optimized processor designed by Xilinx, which occupies 2 % resources of Xilinx Spartan III FPGA. Original design uses the Xilinx primitives, which are replaced by standard generic logics like gates, flipflops, multiplexers etc [...] Authors have used KCPSM 3 (PicoBlaze 3) version of the processor. As a test case the generic design is implemented on Altera FPGA platform. Altera Development and Education (DE 2) board is used to verify the platform independent PicoBlaze design, which provides an ideal vehicle for learning about digital logic, computer organization, and FPGAs, Featuring an Altera Cyclone ® II FPGA, DE 2 board offers state-of-the-art technology suitable for wide range of design projects, as well as sophisticated digital system development. Altera offers NIOS II soft processor with SOPC builder software suite. This paper presents the comparison of PicoBlaze and Nios II processor on Altera platform for small applications. Authors have shown implementation of data transfer through UART using PicoBlaze and Nios II on Altera DE 2. Xilinx synthesis tool version 9. 1 and Altera quartus II version 7. 1 are used.
