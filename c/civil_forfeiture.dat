5|$|United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture</b> in admiralty law. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a three-judge panel that ordered that the shark fins be returned to their owners, reversing {{a decision by the}} Southern District of California. The government did not appeal the case further.|$|E
5|$|Tai Loong {{believed}} {{that the government had}} exceeded its statutory authority by confiscating the fins. It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, a federal district judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company and the agency then agreed that, in return for the former putting up a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the shark fins, although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal to the fine against it. NOAA then initiated a <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture</b> action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, American {{consumers}} {{were concerned}} about Section 206, which expanded the scope of <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures.</b> The government could confiscate an iPod, for example, that contained a single illegal music download, as the device {{can be said to}} be property which [...] "facilitates" [...] infringement.|$|R
50|$|The direct {{financial}} {{impact of the}} measure {{to state and local}} governments was indeterminate due to the inability to accurately predict the number of <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures</b> that may occur. If the frequency of <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures</b> increases, then the amount of money going to the state and local jurisdictions would increase correspondingly. Any assets forfeited under the measure were distributed as follows: to the satisfaction of any foreclosed liens, security interests and contracts in the order of their priority; to the state or any of its political subdivisions for actual and reasonable expenses; and to the state or any of its political subdivisions for drug treatment programs. The measure would increase the revenue to the state and its political subdivisions, but the extent of the increase was unknown.|$|R

25|$|In the United States {{there are}} many laws that allow the {{confiscation}} of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity. Because {{a significant amount of}} U.S. currency contains traces of cocaine and other illegal drugs, {{it is not uncommon for}} innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many people simply forfeit the money. In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of UNITED STATES of America v. U.S. CURRENCY, $30,060.00 (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created a situation where the reaction of a drug-sniffing dog would not create probable cause for <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture.</b>|$|E

In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the original asset seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture</b> complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari.|$|E

5000|$|Georgia: The marshal is a {{commissioned}} {{armed and}} uniformed {{law enforcement officer}} of the county state courts which have jurisdiction over civil matters and state ordinances. In the Atlanta metro counties, marshal's offices enforce evictions, foreclosures, subpoenas, <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures,</b> judgements, seizure, liens, repossession, and garnishment. With a few exceptions, elsewhere in Georgia, the sheriff's office is responsible for enforcement of these duties, with some sheriffs' offices having an assigned unit or personnel for these duties.|$|R
500|$|After the {{legislature}} adjourned on July 18, 1786 without substantively addressing these complaints, rural Massachusetts protestors organized direct action, and began protest marches that {{shut down the}} state's court system, which enforced tax and <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture</b> judgments and had become a focus of the discontent. [...] Bowdoin issued a proclamation in early September denouncing these actions, but took no overt steps to immediately organize a militia response (unlike governors in neighboring Connecticut and New Hampshire). [...] When the foreclosure court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's chagrin. [...] The closure of the Worcester court was followed by closings in Concord and Taunton, and when the militia marched into Great Barrington to force court open there, one of the Judges, William Whiting asked the militiamen to take sides. [...] 800 of the 1,000 men took the people's side of the road. [...] By October, one correspondent wrote, [...] "We {{are now in a}} state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War".|$|E

2500|$|In United States v. Bajakajian, Thomas {{joined with}} the court's more liberal bloc to write the {{majority}} opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, (a)(1), the passenger {{would have had to}} forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between <b>civil</b> <b>forfeiture</b> and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was [...] "grossly disproportional", and was a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.|$|E

40|$|All fifty {{states and}} the federal {{government}} have <b>civil</b> asset <b>forfeiture</b> laws that enable law enforcement agencies to seize property that they suspect has been involved in the commission of a crime. Although there are many benefits to the system, there are also many flaws. The entire structure of the <b>civil</b> asset <b>forfeiture</b> system, at both the federal and state levels, creates incentives for abuse by law enforcement. This Note advocates for a series of changes to the current forfeiture law in Massachusetts, including requiring a heightened burden of proof, providing counsel to indigent property owners, and reforming the incentive structure created by the interaction with federal forfeiture law. These statutory safeguards will help reduce the disproportionate impact that Massachusetts’s forfeiture law has on lower income parties and the general population overall...|$|R
50|$|There are {{additional}} legal implications {{related to the}} use of radio frequencies for command and control of FPV aircraft. Licensed amateur radio operators are expressly allowed to use amateur radio frequencies for telecommand of model aircraft. However, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits using amateur radio frequencies for commercial activity (generally any form of economic gain or for-profit activity). The FCC has not yet addressed the issue of creating designated command and control frequencies for commercial unmanned aircraft, and most civilian unmanned aircraft continue to use amateur radio frequencies, even when used for commercial purposes. Though it has not so far pursued any enforcement actions related to use of amateur radio frequencies for commercial unmanned aircraft, the FCC has the authority to levy <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures</b> and fines into {{the tens of thousands of}} dollars for violations of its regulations.|$|R

Since many states have laws restricting or limiting <b>civil</b> <b>forfeitures,</b> as well as requiring higher standards of proof before property can be taken, local police can sidestep these rules by treating the suspected criminal activity as a federal crime, and bringing in federal authorities. As a result, after the seizure, local and federal agencies divvy up the [...] "loot" [...] with 10% to 20% of it going to the federal agency and the remainder to the local police force. Accordingly, equitable sharing [...] "effectively subverts the will and intent of the state legislatures" [...] and has been criticized by prominent civil rights attorney and property rights advocate Scott Bullock as being a [...] "complete violation" [...] of the principle of federalism.|$|R
