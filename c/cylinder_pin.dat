5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of modern metallic cartridges, circa 1861-1873, certain models of older black powder cap and ball revolvers could be used with multiple replaceable cylinders functioning as [...] "speedloaders". It was however generally easier to simply buy a second revolver than to locate a cylinder alone, not to mention faster than swapping cylinders. [...] As the reloading process for a cap and ball revolver was lengthy and time-consuming, carrying already-loaded cylinders with percussion caps placed on cylinder nipples was a considerable improvement in reloading time, although this is primarily a [...] "trick" [...] used by modern shooters who are used to having numerous shots available in short time with little work. When [...] "spare cylinders" [...] were carried, this practice was primarily done on Remington revolvers, as their cylinders were easily removable and were held by a <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin,</b> unlike the early Colt revolvers which were held together by a wedge that went through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The unfluted {{cylinder}} was [...] "rebated", {{meaning that}} {{the rear of the}} cylinder was turned to a smaller diameter than the front. The barrel was rounded and smoothed into the frame, as was the Navy Model. The frame, hammer, and rammer lever were case-hardened, the remainder blued; grips were of one-piece walnut; and the trigger guard and front grip strap were of brass while the backstrap was blued."A distinguishing feature of the Model 1860 was that its frame had no top strap, or no component running above the cylinder. Instead, its strength came from the lower frame and the massive fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin.</b> This made the gun slimmer and lighter than its main competitor, the Remington Model 1858, but with a possible loss of strength. The fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> also meant that the barrel had to be removed to remove the cylinder, unlike the Model 1858, which only required removal of the cylinder retaining pin.|$|E

5000|$|The Pocket Model {{came with}} and without {{attached}} loading levers and with barrel lengths from 3-6 inches; those without loading levers were loaded either with some handy dowel or equivalent tool, or by removing the cylinder from the frame and using the fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> (or [...] "arbor") as a rammer). Those without loading levers are frequently called the [...] "Wells Fargo Model" [...] although Wells Fargo records show no [...]31 caliber revolvers ever purchased by that company.

Civilian demand for the original [...]31 caliber revolver remained substantial even after introduction of the larger-bored [...]36 caliber Pocket Navy and Police Models, even right up until metallic cartridge revolvers entered production in the early 1870s (notably by Smith & Wesson).|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the first}} {{cartridge}} revolver made by Allen and Wheelock, {{and one of the}} first cartridge revolvers from any manufacturer (competing with the Smith and Wesson model 1). It is a single-action seven-shot revolver in [...]22 Rimfire (black powder equivalent of the modern [...]22 Short). It features the side-hammer of the early percussion revolvers and a spur trigger. Empty cases were removed by removing the cylinder, and using the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> to push the case out of the cylinder. There are many variations typically organized into six models, though all share the size and critical design features. Most were made with a 3-inch barrel. The first through fourth models have engraved cylinders, with crossed rifles, a horse and rider, military articles, an Indian with bow and a sailing ship. Allen obtained a patent granted in 1858, and it is likely that production began in 1857. Production continued until 1863, when production of all cartridge revolvers was halted by the lawsuit described previously. Production resumed upon expiry of the Rollin White patent in 1869, though likely from parts manufactured in the earlier period. After Allen's death in 1871, production continued for some period under the new company name Forehand and Wadsworth.|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{describe}} a paracentric key is that the cylinders {{are not in a}} straight line, but can vary to the right or left, so that the key not only has to have the correct height of the <b>pin</b> for a <b>cylinder,</b> the <b>pin</b> is also extended to the left or right of the center of the key.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most widely}} known {{double-action}} percussion revolver is likely the First Model Adams of 1851. This was unique {{in having a}} double-action-only mechanism, a cylinder that could quickly be removed by pulling forward {{on the front of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> and slightly tapered cylinders designed to take either proprietary combustable cartridges with a conical bullet designed to fit the tapered cylinder or a round ball. No ramrod was provided. Another unique feature was a safety catch which held the hammer away from the percussion cap under it so it could be carried with all its 5 cylinders loaded unlike the Colt in which one of its 6 cylinders was left uncapped while carried because the hammer would rest on it which could result in a discharge if dropped. An improved version of this is the Beaumont-Adams of 1855 which has a hammer spur and a mechanism which allows single-or double-action operation. The cartridge idea had proved unpopular, so the cylinders were bored parallel for use with ball and powder and a ramrod installed on the left side of the barrel. The Beaumont-Adams differs from the Starr DA in that it is configured for a SA/DA mode. Some sources claim that Starr and Beaumont did not produce enough revolvers to be considered major players in the market. These sources claim that the first widely used DA revolver (sometimes called the first [...] "modern" [...] revolver) was the Colt 1889 [...]38 Government (.38 Long Colt) used by the Navy, and/or the improved version for the Navy and Army, the Colt 1892, because, despite wide adoption, the 1889 model was produced in relatively low numbers.|$|E
50|$|The center-hammer {{percussion}} models bear {{a striking}} resemblance to the larger lipfire revolvers. All were single action. Ethan Allen showed much evidence of being astute and frugal, and the design likely evolved as a way to share between a percussion series and the new lipfire weapons. Why would Allen make percussion arms at all when the more advanced cartridge revolvers were available? The oft-referenced patent lawsuit may have caused Allen to 'hedge his bets' in case he lost, and would have to cease production of cartridge revolvers (as happened in 1863). It may be that cartridge firearms were a new and uncertain technology. A conservative market, as epitomized by the US Army Ordnance Department, were buying the established technology percussion weapons by the thousand. Even Smith and Wesson failed to obtain a government contract during the war for their cartridge revolvers. In any event, the center-hammer percussion revolvers were likely seen as a replacement for the side-hammer and possibly bar-hammer revolvers in production. As with many Allen arms, the start date of manufacture is uncertain. With patent dates including 1857, 1858, 1860, and 1861, many have posed that this revolver was not made until after the settlement of the patent lawsuit in 1863. However, records indicate that the US Ordnance Department purchase about 200 from a Boston merchant in December 1861. Perhaps 1860 or early 1861 is accurate. Advertised and marketed to the military, the center-hammer was designed to be stronger and more rugged than the side-hammer revolver. In addition to the stronger frame, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> access was moved {{to the front of the}} cylinder. The center-hammer revolvers retained the innovative combination trigger guard/loading lever of the side-hammer models.|$|E
5000|$|The {{author has}} found the side-hammer models {{to be the most}} {{interesting}} of all of the Allen revolvers. Allen's design was clearly influenced by Colt's 1855 'Root' revolver, adopting the top strap above the cylinder for strength, rigidity and thus accuracy, and the side-hammer rather than the center hammer more usual on the Colt models 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1851. Another 'borrowed' feature was that the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin</b> unscrewed from the rear, which the author finds far superior to the various methods of removing to the fore of the pistol. Though influenced by this near contemporary, Allen attempted to build the 'better mousetrap' by incorporating several unique and patented design features. One change was to retain standard trigger used in the bar-hammer revolvers rather than Root's spur trigger. The most interesting new feature is the combination trigger guard / loading lever. Unlike Colts, Remingtons, and other percussion revolvers that aligned a lever to load the cylinders under the barrel, Allen designed his revolvers to incorporate the trigger guard for this function. A catch is tripped, and the trigger guard and attached arm swing down to push a rammer into the bottom cylinder, thus seating the ball fully into the chamber. This reduced the number of parts, and likely cost of manufacture. This patented, unique feature carried on into the later center-hammer percussion models. There were four distinct cylinders, varying in the machining. All models are single action. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard. Ivory or silver grips could be had for an additional cost. Though manufactured in much smaller numbers than the Colts, Remingtons, Starr and other revolvers of the War Between the States, Allen and Wheelock revolvers are clearly visible in many pictures of the era. The dates of manufacture are uncertain, possibly beginning as early as the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. This is supported by a patent granted to Allen in January 1857 covering the loading lever as described. As frugal as Allen was, it is unlikely that production would have ended prior to the consumption of all parts, even though the new center-hammer percussion were also being produced. It is unlikely that production survived the end of the Wheelock era (c 1864) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Cloverleaf Model {{was more}} {{produced}} by far, {{and had two}} different variants, depending on the barrel length: 1-1/2" [...] and 3". The 1-1/2" [...] barrel length variant had an ejector rod contained within the center <b>pin</b> of the <b>cylinder,</b> allowing to reload while keeping the cylinder in the gun. The 3" [...] barrel length variant of the Cloverleaf had the ejector in the same axis of the <b>cylinder</b> center <b>pin</b> and, thus, the cylinder needed {{to be removed from}} the frame when loading.|$|R
40|$|Some {{aluminium}} alloys {{are difficult to}} join using traditional fusion (melting and solidification) welding techniques. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding technique that can join two plates of material without melting the workpiece material. This proecess uses a rotating tool to create the joint {{and it can be}} applied to alumium alloys in particular. Macrostructure, microstructure and micro hardness of friction stir welded AA 2024 -T 3 joints were studied. The influence of tool pin profile on the microstructure and hardness of these joints was examined. Square, triflute and tapered <b>cylinder</b> <b>pins</b> were used and results from each weldment are reported. Vickers micro hardness tests and grain size measurements were taken from the transverse plane of welded samples. Distinct zones in the macrostructure were evident. The zones were identified by transitions in the microstructure and hardness of weld samples. The zones identified across the sample were the the unaffected parent metal, the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), the Thermo-Mechanicaly Affected Zone (TMAZ), and the Nugget Zone (NZ). Measured hardness values varied through each FSW zone. The hardness in each zone was below that of the parent material. The HAZ had the lowest hardness across the weld profile for each pin type tested. The cylindrical pin consistently produced tunnel and joint-line defects. Pin profiles with flat surface features and/or flutes produced consolidated joints with no defects...|$|R

50|$|The bar-hammer {{revolver}} is an interested type. It {{is uncertain}} when production began or ended. The 1845 patent on the bar-hammer {{is the same}} as on the pepperbox and some single shot pistol models. It is likely some number of years after 1845 before this type was produced. A patent for (oddly enough) Rollin White was issued in 1858 that pictured a modified Allen bar-hammer revolver. This would seem to indicate that production started no later than 1856-1857. However, it is possible that production started several years earlier. Production almost certainly ended {{before the end of the}} Wheelock era (c 1864). This is based on no more than the logic of simplifying production. In 1861, it is possible that Allen produced the bar-hammer, side-hammer, and center-hammer percussion revolvers as well as the rimfire and lipfire cartridge revolvers simultaneously! Because demand from the War Between the States was consuming just about any arm produced, it would have made sense to cease production of the less advanced models. The lineage of the pepperbox is clear in the cylinder design, grip design, standard-style trigger, and patented bar hammer double-action design. This may represent simple design evolution, as the double action pepperbox 'pocket pistols' were very popular in the market. Allen may have been counting on visual and functional design similarity to help sell these revolvers. The design may also be very thoughtful in regards to avoiding patent issues. By incorporating his unchallenged 1845 patent for the bar-hammer double-action mechanism, Allen may have wished to avoid any patent infringement problems from Colt for his own revolving mechanism IF the revolver was produced before the expiry of the Colt patent in 1857. Considering all of the evidence that Allen was a thoughtful and frugal businessman, it may simply demonstrate that using common parts was less expensive than designing new ones. Finish was blued, with wood grips as standard, though ivory could be had for an extra cost. The Allen bar-hammer is actually quite advanced in that pulling the trigger advances the cylinder, cocks the hammer and drops the hammer, firing the weapon. The cylinder can be removed for cleaning with the removal of <b>cylinder</b> <b>pin.</b> A separate rammer would be needed for loading. It is likely that the cylinder would be removed for loading, so reloading under duress is not practical. The author finds these revolvers aesthetically pleasing and very practical for a pocket pistol. This style was manufactured and sold in three different sizes.|$|E

This defect was located at the depth of pin penetration in the 2024 joints. It was found that the size of the defect could be reduced by altering operating parameters and weld path. Tests undertaken on the Al 2024 plates showed that that defect free welds can be produced by using pin profiles wh ich encourage greater plastic deformation...|$|E
