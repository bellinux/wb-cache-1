25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often now, {{because of the}} pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally ineffective, and skin contact <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction.</b> If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective {{in the long run}} than leaving the weed in place.|$|E

50|$|Contrast {{agents are}} {{classified}} into two groups: fat-soluble contrast agents and water-soluble contrast agents. Water-soluble contrast agents can fill the finer {{elements of the}} ductal system. Fat-soluble contrast agents are viscous and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions.</b> These <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> discomfort to the patients. Fat-soluble contrast agents do not fill finer elements of the duct.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} wood are {{strongly}} discouraged for piercing jewelry as they <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> or otherwise be irritating for the skin. Hardwood is preferable. Correctly treated, it doesn't swell, it's durable, stable, does not absorb {{a lot of}} moisture or body fluids, and the surface can be polished to be very smooth.|$|R
50|$|Certain food {{additives}} and flavorings <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> around {{and in the}} mouth, around the anus and vagina as food allergens pass out of the body, or cause a widespread rash on the skin. Allergens such as nickel, Balsam of Peru, parabens, sodium benzoate, or cinnamic aldehyde may worsen or cause skin rashes.|$|R
5000|$|Sesquiterpene lactones are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds; they are sesquiterpenoids (built from three isoprene units) and contain a lactone ring, hence the name.

40|$|This {{publication}} outlines how potatoes turn {{green and}} form a harmful substance which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> an <b>allergic</b> <b>reaction,</b> and how to avoid this development. Green potato tubers are easily identified by their surface coloration. This green coloration (2 ̆ 2 greening 2 ̆ 2 also called 2 ̆ 2 sun-burning 2 ̆ 2) can {{be as much as}} a half-inch deep in severe cases. French fries made from green potatoes will have a green end and potato chips will have a green edge. Associated with greening is the formation of a natural chemical that <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> and illness. This publication outlines how potatoes turn green and how to avoid such occurrences...|$|R
30|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} {{is an important}} requirement for orthodontic appliances. Nickel and chromium may be released from orthodontic wires and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> and cytotoxicity when patients use various mouthwashes to whiten their teeth. Our study aimed to assess the release of nickel and chromium ions from nickel titanium (NiTi) and stainless steel (SS) orthodontic wires following the use of four common mouthwashes available on the market.|$|R
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of foods <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>{{allergic}}</b> <b>reactions,</b> but 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by cow's milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Other food allergies, affecting less than 1 person per 10,000 population, may be considered [...] "rare". The use of hydrolysed milk baby formula versus standard milk baby formula {{does not appear to}} change the risk.|$|R
50|$|Tetraponera rufonigra, is {{a species}} of ant {{belonging}} to the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae. It is distributed across Asia, and Africa. Commonly called the Bi-coloured Arboreal ant, they are arboreal and build small nests which are excavated holes usually in dried parts of trees. They are active hunters and hunt small insects. They have a well developed sting and when stung <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in human beings.|$|R
5000|$|The stings of the Asian {{giant hornet}} (Vespa mandarinia) {{are among the}} most venomous known, and are thought to cause 30-50 human deaths {{annually}} in Japan. Between July and September 2013, hornet stings caused the death of 42 people in China. [...] Asian giant hornet's venom <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> and multiple organ failure leading to death, though dialysis can be used to remove the toxins from the bloodstream.|$|R
50|$|Cillit Bang Power Crystal (known {{outside the}} UK as Easy-Off Bang/Bam Power Cleaning Crystal) is a liquid for {{cleaning}} heavily stained surfaces. It contains {{not more than}} 5% of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, 15-30% of sodium carbonate, sodium percarbonate (the bleaching compound), and a perfume formula containing limonene. It is a skin irritant and <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in some people, so the company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure.|$|R
5000|$|However, both {{urography}} and CT urography use ionizing radiation, {{which involves}} risk to healthy tissues (potentially encouraging cancer or risking birth defects). Therefore, {{they are often}} now replaced by ultrasonography and more recently by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which use sound waves or magnetism instead. Also, the iodinated contrast medium used in contrast CT and contrast radiography <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> including severe ones, that can be fatal in up to 1 in 25000 individuals.|$|R
50|$|Blaptica dubia {{has become}} a popular feeder insect, {{particularly}} among tarantula, amphibian and reptile enthusiasts. Keeping or breeding the insect is made easier by their inability to jump or climb smooth surfaces, relatively slow movement, and rarity of flying. They are also quiet, unlike crickets, and tropical environmental requirements {{reduce the likelihood of}} establishment of escapees in colder, dryer climates. B. dubia <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> in humans, although they produce relatively little odor compared to many cockroaches.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions,</b> with {{numerous}} large surveys identifying {{it as being}} in the [...] "top five" [...] allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions.

50|$|Natural {{bristles}} {{are made}} from real hair as opposed to plastic. Many prefer to use natural bristles, since they could be less abrasive to the skin. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>reactions</b> because of the animal fur/hair. Natural bristles may be easier to control the product when blending out or even packing on a product. Natural bristles do have hair cuticles {{which is why it}} is easier for the brush to pick up more product and blending it out.|$|R
