40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine which brand {{attributes}} need to be emphasised/addressed by retailers in order to achieve a positive representation of the <b>corporate</b> brand <b>images</b> in an online setting. Using bookstores as the research context, the research’s main aim is to investigate the association between the functional brand evaluation (represented by brand attributes in this study) and emotional brand evaluation (represented by the <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image).</b> Specific research questions are: Are there any associations between the brand attributes and <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> of an online e-tailer?; What are the most important corporate brand attributes/drivers of online <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image?</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using the brand triangle framework developed by de Chernatony and Christodoulides, the current study investigates the associations between brand attributes and <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> of an online e-tailer. Findings – The findings show that factors such as ease of use, “personalisation”, security and customer care are significant in determining the <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> of the online e-tailer.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the extent to which the various {{elements}} of corporate brand identity as identified in the literature are perceived to contribute to <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation. In doing so, a theoretical perspective is adopted for this study that borrows from both marketing communication and corporate communication theories. Three data collection techniques – Q methodology, an online questionnaire and computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) – were used to determine to what extent these elements are perceived significant in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation among participants from 106 South African organisations across various business sectors. Four categories were identified to be perceived as significant for <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation, namely transformational leadership and management, positioning and differentiation strategy, brand equity and employee orientation and mentorship. To date, a comprehensive measuring instrument that theoretically includes all the corporate brand identity elements perceived to be significant in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation has not been developed. Based on the research findings, the study aims to propose a theoretical framework for establishing a measuring instrument that includes all the corporate brand identity elements deemed significant in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation as perceived by South African organisations. The objective of providing a theoretical framework for establishing a measuring instrument is to enable organisations to assess the role of their corporate brand identity in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation among their stakeholder groups. The theoretical framework includes the four identified categories perceived as significant in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation. It indicates which of the corporate brand identity elements included in the four categories are perceived to be more significant in <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation by South African organisations. In addition, it provides assumptions on how these corporate brand identity elements are perceived to work in synergy to enhance <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> formation based on the research results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss {{challenges}} and lessons learnt when conducting a classic grounded theory study in a marketing context. The paper focuses on two specific challenges that were met during a specific research process. The first challenge related to positioning the study, namely, specifying“what the study is a study of”. The second challenge concerned the choice between formal or substantive theory. Both challenges were accentuated as the emerged core category concerned a phenomenon that has caught less attention in marketing, that is, the temporal dimension in <b>corporate</b> <b>images.</b> By the temporal dimension in <b>corporate</b> <b>images</b> we mean that <b>corporate</b> <b>images</b> often have roots in earlier times through consumer memories. In other words, consumers are not tabula rasa, that is, blank sheets of paper on which communication messages can be printed. Rather, consumers have a pre-understanding of the company that works as an interpretation framework for company actions in the present. The lessons learnt from this research process can be summarized as “stay faithful to the data”, “write memos on issues you reflect upon although they might be in another substantial field” as they might become useful later, and, “look into thinking in other disciplines” as disciplines do not develop equally...|$|R

Our study is an empirical investigation of <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> and impact on one such stakeholder group made up of prospective employees. A large multinational, a technical and scientific research firm, a major recruiter of graduates from campuses of reputable universities across the nation was chosen as the subject. This paper develops and tests a path model of the antecedent factors affecting <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> and specific expectations that stakeholders may have of a corporate brand. Based on a thorough literature review, a <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> model that treated as antecedents the four constructs, awareness of organisation’s products, perceptions about culture, personality of the focal firm, and general expectations was proposed. Specific expectations that respondents may have about working with the firm was modeled to be influenced by the <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> of the firm surveyed and also by the mentioned four antecedent constructs. The model is fitted to empirical data obtained from a national sample of 368 respondents using LISREL 8. 5 methodology, and strong support was found for five, partial support for two of the nine hypotheses tested. Substantial evidence can be seen for the mediating role of <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> in shaping specific expectations that stakeholders have from the corporate brand.

30|$|The latest {{generation}} of scientific studies addresses <b>corporate</b> <b>images</b> {{of the future}} – intrinsic motives, drivers, forms, types, dimensions of future discourses, handling with risks and uncertainties that bring a company {{on the way to}} perceive the future [16, 45, 46]. The notions of this approach will be used in our paper twofold. First, since images of the future are understood as meaningful representations about potential course of events and developments [45] that organizations make to reduce uncertainty these images {{could be used as a}} reference source while reconstructing company’s intents. Second, insofar as mergers and acquisitions can be considered as mindful and deliberate acts targeted to extend company’s future handling options, they represent the vision of at least one involved company about the development in a given field thus unveiling possible synergy of the deal. In this sense each M&A deal shows a distinct intention to move towards a goal that often remains undisclosed to the public. Therefore, M&As can be interpreted as a type of <b>corporate</b> <b>images</b> of the future.|$|R

By using a survey with an experimental design, where <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> is manipulated through a PR-article, the results indicate that a company can influence the loyalty a customer feels toward their brand by trying to influence the <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image.</b> The results also support the idea that <b>corporate</b> brand <b>image</b> does have its own effect on customer loyalty and is not merely indirectly influencing it through customer satisfaction.
