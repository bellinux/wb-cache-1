50|$|The {{variation}} of wave propagation direction {{can be achieved}} by either cutting three samples at 0°, 45° and 90° from the cores or by using one <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> with transducers attached at these three angles. Since most shales are very friable and fissured, {{it is often difficult to}} cut shale <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Its edges break off easily. Thus the cutting sample method can only be used for hard, competent rocks. The cutting position of samples can be explained by the following diagram.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> often binds {{inside the}} hole saw, and often must be pried out after each hole is cut. Sometimes the prying is quite difficult.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>plugs</b> {{can often}} {{be a source of}} leaks due to {{corrosion}} caused by cooling system water. Although modern antifreeze chemicals do not evaporate and may be considered [...] "permanent", anti-corrosion additives gradually deplete and must be replenished. Failure to do this periodic maintenance accelerates corrosion of engine parts, and the thin metal <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> are often the first components to start leaking.|$|R
30|$|Core {{analysis}} {{was done with}} 1.5 inch diameter cleaned and dried reservoir <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b> The porosities and absolute permeabilities of the <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> from depths of (2900 – 3100) meters were {{in the range of}} 17.62 – 18.62 % and 2 – 3 md, respectively, whereas for the shallower depth (2500 – 2700  m) <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> the respective values of porosities and absolute permeabilities were in the range of 24.64 – 25.15 % and 25 – 30 md respectively. An inverse correlation was observed between porosity–permeability and depth for the porous media under study. The most obvious reason for this inverse relationship was due to the combined effects of compaction and cementation (Nelson and Bird 2005).|$|R
30|$|Generally, all <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were water-wet after {{cleaning}} with toluene and methanol {{and then}} the surface had been changed to mild oil-wet during saturation with oil. In the aging process, all oil-saturated <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were immersed in crude oil for 14  days at 80  °C. In this step, the core slab photograph analysis showed oil-wet behavior for selected samples. An example of contact angle measurement and photograph analysis {{is presented in the}} results section of this paper.|$|R
50|$|Permeability is {{measured}} in the laboratory by encasing a <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known viscosity is injected into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either full diameter core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6 inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using Darcy's law.|$|E
5000|$|In {{petroleum}} engineering, a Klinkenberg correction is {{a procedure}} for calibration of permeability {{data obtained from}} a minipermeameter device. A more accurate correction factor can be obtained using Knudsen correction. When using nitrogen gas for <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> measurements, the Klinkenberg correction is usually necessary due to the so-called Klinkenberg gas slippage effect. This takes place when the pore space approaches the mean free path of the gas ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{combined}} proportionality {{and unity}} factor [...] has typically average value of 0.8E6 /1.0135 from measuring many naturally occurring <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> samples, ranging from high to low clay content, {{but it may}} reach a value of 3.2E6 /1.0135 for clean sand. The denominator is included explicitly {{to remind us that}} permeability is defined using atm as pressure unit while reservoir engineering calculations and reservoir simulations typically use bar as pressure unit.|$|E

30|$|Sandstone <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> {{were used}} for {{flooding}} experiments. In all the experiments, the core samples were approximately 11  cm long and had diameters of 3.8  cm.|$|R
50|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to form the {{internal}} cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) is cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages. Holes are designed into the casting to support internal sand forms, and to facilitate {{the removal of the}} sand after the casting has cooled. <b>Core</b> <b>plugs</b> are usually thin metal cups press fitted into the casting holes, but may be made of rubber or other materials. In some high-performance engines the <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> are large diameter cast metal threaded pipe plugs.|$|R
50|$|Difficulty or ease of <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> {{replacement}} {{depends upon}} physical accessibility {{in a crowded}} engine compartment. In many cases the plug area {{will be difficult to}} reach, and using a mallet to perform maintenance or replacement will be nearly impossible without special facilities for partial or complete removal of the engine. Specialized copper or rubber replacement plugs are available which can be expanded by using a wrench when access is a problem, though engine removal may still be required in some cases.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> will twist apart mid-cut, {{creating}} a condition where the core inside the hole saw spins on the yet-uncut {{portion of the}} core still in the workpiece. This tends to stop the cutting action of the saw, and if the workpiece is wood or plastic, the friction will start to singe it, {{creating a}} burning smell and heating up the hole saw. The twisted-off core must then be pried {{out of the hole}} saw before the cutting can continue.|$|E
50|$|The {{method is}} {{easy to use and}} {{requires}} no complex equipment. During the RIC experiments, core samples saturated with selected reservoir fluid are subjected to imbibition from a second reservoir fluid. RIC wettability measurements are compared with modified - Amott test and USBM measurements using <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> pairs from different heights of a thick carbonate reservoir. Results show good coherence. Ghedan and Canbaz proved and patented the RIC method as an alternate method to Amott and USBM methods and that it efficiently characterizes Reservoir Wettability.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that rocks {{containing}} water-reactive clays may swell when contacting with fresh water. In a conventional formation, this swelling may cause wellbore stability problem or damage formation by reducing its permeability. However, the effect of water salinity on shale rocks may be different. This issue is investigated in this paper. Shale rocks were immersed in water of different salinities. Shale rocks used were Mancos, Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford. Different concentrations of NaCl and KCl salt solutions from 0 % to 30 % by weight were added in the water. It was observed that Mancos <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were crushed into loose grains (fragmented) at low salinity solutions up to 15 %. Barnett <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> showed consecutive cracks along bedding planes at low salinities. Minor cracks were seen on Marcellus, while no visual cracks were found in Eagle Ford <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> at low salinities. When the shale plugs were saturated with oil, 2 %- 15 % oil was recovered by water spontaneous imbibition, depending on water salinity and rock mineralogy. Similar observations were made when shale <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were applied to an overburden pressure. The results from this paper help us to understand the drive mechanisms in shale oil and shale gas reservoirs. It also stimulates us to explore new ways to improve oil and gas recovery in shale reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} work investigates Low Reservoir Quality Chalk (LRQC) reservoir properties using outcrop samples from six zones. The thesis {{is part of}} Joint Chalk Research Programme, Phase 7 (JCR 7), a large interdisciplinary consortium that focus on chalk research. The work have two main parts: Part A measures porosity, permeability and study flow, oil storage- and oil recovery potential for LRQC; Part B evaluates {{the use of a}} new method to measure relative permeability and capillary pressure using spontaneous imbibition with controlled boundary conditions. Porosity and permeability are two important properties that define the quality of a reservoir. Porosity was measured, with gas or brine, for 24 <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> and ranges between φ= 14. 2 - 26. 0 %. Absolute permeability, measured with constant rate injection of brine, gas or oil, ranges between K= 0. 002 - 0. 820 mD. Permeability varied with injected fluid, and gas porosity and permeability were on average higher than measured with brine. Local heterogeneities within <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> identified with CT imaging significantly influenced the measured reservoir properties. Oil recovery potential and multiphase flow properties were measured on 12 LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b> The initial water saturation, established using constant differential pressure during oil injection in cores initially 100 % water saturated, varied between S_iw= 32. 9 - 38. 1 %. Oil recovery during forced or spontaneous imbibition was on average 36. 5 % OOIP. Relative permeability and capillary pressure for five LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were determined experimentally based on a methodology using spontaneous imbibition. A special boundary condition and theory proposed by (Haugen et al., 2014) was applied {{for the first time to}} LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> to estimate relative permeability and capillary pressure. Relative permeability to water ranged between k_r,w= 0. 055 - 0. 366, whereas capillary pressure ranged between P_c,f = 8. 4 - 47. 3 kPa...|$|R

50|$|The Australian's {{troubles}} left Moss well in front, {{and when}} Gurney's BRM blew a <b>core</b> <b>plug,</b> Moss' teammate Bonnier took second, ahead of Ireland, Graham Hill and Texan Jim Hall, driving his first Grand Prix. Just before {{halfway through the}} 75-lap race, Graham Hill retired with a broken gearbox, and Bonnier began to drop back when a broken valve spring caused a misfire. Brabham had been charging up through the field since his pit stops, however, and eventually finished a battling fourth, behind teammate McLaren. Phil Hill ran fifth in the unfamiliar Cooper until a spin dropped him behind Bonnier, who got his ailing BRM home for two points.|$|E
5000|$|The term Freeze plug is slang, {{the name}} of the press in block plugs is {{actually}} <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> It is mistakenly thought that the purpose of these plugs is to be pushed out and save the block from cracking if the engine has water in it and it happens to freeze. This in nothing more than an urban legend or wives tale. The purpose of the plugs is to fill the holes that were made during the casting process. so the foundry could remove the core sand from the coolant passages. Saving the block from cracking in case of a freeze was never the manufacturer's intent for these plugs ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{technique}} {{used to estimate}} the anisotropy parameter is directly measure them from the core which is extracted through a special hollow drill bit during drill process. Since coring a sample will generate large extra cost, only limited number of core samples can be obtained for each well. Thus the anisotropy parameter obtained through core measurement technique only represent the anisotropy property of rock near the borehole at just several specific depth, rending this technique often provides little help on the field seismic survey application. The measurements on each shale plug require at least one week.From {{the context of this}} article, wave propagation in a vertically transverse medium can be described with five elastic constants, and ratios among these parameters define the rock anisotropy [...] This anisotropy parameter can be obtained in the laboratory by measuring the velocity travel speed with transducer ultrasonic systems at variable saturation and pressure conditions. Usually, three directions of wave propagation on core samples are the minimum requirement to estimate the five elastic coefficients of the stiffness tensor. Each direction in <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> measurement yields three velocities (one P and two S).|$|E
30|$|Five core {{flooding}} {{experiments were}} conducted at different injected nanoparticle concentrations (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 5000  ppm) {{to investigate the}} effect of silica nanoparticle on oil recovery from sandstone <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Compressional and Shear wave {{velocities}} (Vp & Vs) {{have been}} measured on dry and brine saturated <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> of GS- 15 and 23 structures of KG Basin under ambient {{as well as}} insitu confining pressure conditions. The data generated demonstrate simple linear relationships between Vp and Vs. For dry <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> the Vp-Vs curve passes through zero and it indicates a nearly constant Compressional to Shear wave velocity ratio. However, for brine saturated <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> the relationship between Vp and Vs {{is found to be}} as follows: For GS – 15 Vp (m/sec) = 1. 54 Vs + 782 For GS – 23 Vp (m/sec) = 1. 20 Vs + 1251 Both the Compressional and Shear wave velocities correlate linearly with porosity. The relationships of Compressional and Shear wave velocities with porosity show that the velocities decrease with increase in porosity. Based upon these relationships, the matrix velocities Vp & Vs arrived at are 5866 m/sec & 3227 m/sec and 5685 m/sec & 3751 m/sec for GS- 15 and 23 structures respectively...|$|R
2500|$|Antifreeze was {{developed}} to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid. In some engines freeze plugs (engine block expansion plugs) are placed {{in areas of the}} engine block where coolant flows {{in order to protect the}} engine from freeze damage [...] if the ambient temperature drops below the freezing point of the antifreeze/water mixture. These should not be confused with <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> whose purpose is to allow removal of sand used in the casting process of engine blocks (<b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> will be pushed out if the coolant freezes, though, assuming that they adjoin the coolant passages, which is not always the case).|$|R
5000|$|With weak {{computing}} power, {{the reservoir}} models were correspondingly coarse, but upscaling of the static parameters were fairly simple and partly {{compensated for the}} coarseness. The question of upscaling relative permeability curves from the rock curves derived at <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> scale (which is often denoted the micro scale) to the coarse grids cells of the reservoir models (which is often called the macro scale) is much more difficult, and it became an important research field that is still ongoing. But the progress in upscaling was slow, {{and it was not}} until 1990-2000 that directional dependency of relative permerability and need for tensor representation was clearly demonstrated, even though at least one capable method was developed already in 1975. One such upscaling case is a slanted reservoir where the water (and gas) will segregate vertically relative to the oil in addition to the horizontal motion. The vertical size of a grid cell is also usually much smaller than the horizontal size of a grid cell, creating small and large flux areas respectively. All this requires different relative permeability curves for the x and z directions. Geological heterogeneities in the reservoirs like laminas or crossbedded permeability structures in the rock, also cause directional relative permeabilities. This tells us that relative permeability should, in the most general case, be represented by a tensor. The flow equations then becomes ...|$|E
30|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} test acceptably simulates {{the production}} from fractured reservoirs in the tertiary oil recovery stage. In {{this type of}} experiment, the fluid in the fracture (brine around the core) penetrates into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and drives the trapped oil out of the core. The fluid displacement in the Spontaneous imbibition phenomena is governed by both capillary and gravity forces. However, the small height of <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and also the significance of capillary pressure {{in the case of}} tight rocks might lead to the capillary force as dominant mechanism, whereas the gravity force becomes negligible. Wettability alteration of pore surfaces towards water-wetness by imbibing fluid {{would be one of the}} main mechanisms that lead to the oil production from <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> during imbibition test. As above mentioned, the low-salinity water injection has been proposed to reach this purpose (Tang and Morrow 1997 a; Shehata and Nasr El-Din 2015).|$|E

40|$|Studying the {{permeability}} in {{a particular}} formation will be our address in this paper, through collection {{of a set of}} data in relates to the past real core analyses by the oil operators and correlating them to our lab works on the samples of the same formation from Pilaspi formation (M. EOCENE - U. EOCENE) outcrop on Haibat Sultan Mountain near Taq Taq oil Field. Lab works were done in Koya University using most of reservoir lab equipments for getting and determining the most important properties like porosity and permeability on plug samples of that formation. The key study in this paper is oil well TT- 02 in Taq Taq oil field. In this paper we will try to nominate and recognize the more active porosity type through measuring air and liquid permeability in our reservoir lab and show the effects of increasing flowing pressure on the permeability using saturated and dry <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Water and air were used as flowing fluids and two methods were used to measure the permeability; steady-state method, measures the permeability of a saturated <b>Core</b> <b>plug</b> under constant flow rate conditions and air permeability with (N 2) for dry <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Figure  13 {{also shows}} that the {{imbibition}} time required to obtain the ultimate oil recovery was shorter for the high-permeability <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> compared with the low-permeability ones.
