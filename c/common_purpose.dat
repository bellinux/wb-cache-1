5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the <b>common</b> <b>purpose</b> of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E

25|$|The man {{who led the}} Union fleet at Mobile Bay was Rear Admiral David G. Farragut, {{no longer}} Flag Officer Farragut. The U.S. Navy had {{undergone}} an organizational change {{in the second year}} of the war, one feature of which was the creation of the rank of Rear Admiral. The new rank implied that the ships of the navy would be employed as members of a fleet, not simply as collections of vessels with a <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rebels were}} disorganized {{and without a}} <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b> Some Han Chinese rebelled against the Qing state during the rebellion, and rebel bands fought each other. The main Hui rebel leader, Ma Hualong, was even granted a {{military}} rank and title during the rebellion by the Qing dynasty. It was only later when Zuo Zongtang launched his campaign to pacify the region, did he decide which rebels who surrendered {{were going to be}} executed, or spared.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July {{the judge}} {{rejected}} Singh's attempt to have Rajasingham disqualified {{on grounds that}} he had received confidential information from Barlow in the nine months before the trial when he acted for both of the accused. The trial concluded 24 July and both men were found guilty. The trial judge deferred pronouncing sentence for a week to enable lawyers {{of the two men}} to prepare submissions to him which might be used in an appeal to the supreme Court of Malaysia, and to hear submissions on behalf of Barlow that he should be allowed to return to Australia immediately for an operation on his leg. The prosecutors surmised that as they had arrived, stayed, and were leaving together, they had a <b>common</b> <b>purpose</b> of trafficking drugs.|$|E
25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b> The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E
500|$|A {{political}} international is an organisation {{of political}} parties or activists {{with the aim of}} co-ordinating their activity for a <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b> There had been a long tradition of socialists organising on an international basis, and Karl Marx had led the International Workingmen's Association, which later became known as the [...] "first international".|$|E

The lead {{character}} initially {{went to an}} unknown and inexperienced young actor, but the part was re-cast with Hordern in the role. Hordern described King John as being [...] "a difficult play {{in the sense that}} it has no <b>common</b> <b>purpose</b> or apparent theme". Simultaneously to this, he was commuting back to Pinewood Studios where he was filming Forbidden Cargo. The hectic schedule brought on a bout of exhaustion for which he received medical advice to reduce his workload.|$|E
500|$|During {{a seventh}} {{interview}} the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had {{made during the}} attack. During the eighth interview, {{he said he had}} armed himself that night with a broom handle, and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him: [...] "I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman, a broom handle." [...] He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1646, Dorgon {{also ordered}} {{that the civil}} {{examinations}} for selecting government officials be reestablished. From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming. In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, {{most of whom were}} northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could be made to work together for a <b>common</b> <b>purpose.</b> The 1649 examination inquired about [...] "how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division." [...] Under the Shunzhi Emperor's reign, the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty ("to win more Chinese support"), until 1660 when lower quotas were established.|$|E

500|$|After {{the inaugural}} ceremony, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President George W.

Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition, President Obama signed his first presidential orders in the President's Room at the Capitol, and then signed the guest book for the luncheon. The first order signed by Obama was a proclamation declaring his Inauguration Day a [...] "National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation", in which he called [...] "upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the <b>common</b> <b>purpose</b> of remaking this Nation for our new century". Next, Obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his Cabinet and several sub‑Cabinet officials to the U.S.Congress for its approval. The Obamas and Bidens then attended an inaugural luncheon at the U.S.Capitol before traveling from there to the presidential reviewing stand at the White House to watch the parade.|$|E
500|$|The project became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} surrounding its size and location, which grew to envelop the proposed York City War Memorial. Following the railway company's lead, the City War Memorial Committee also appointed Lutyens, and endorsed his plan for a Stone of Remembrance elevated on a large plinth in the moat by Lendal Bridge, [...] from the proposed site of the NER's memorial. The controversy revolved partly around {{the relationship between the}} two memorials—Lutyens felt that the two designs would complement one another, but the city had given Lutyens a budget of £2,000, a tenth of that allocated to him by the NER, and some members of the local community were concerned that the railway company's memorial would be much larger and would overshadow the city's. Another concern, raised by a city councillor, was that visitors walking into the city centre from the railway station would see the NER's memorial first. Lutyens responded that he felt the two memorials would show a <b>common</b> <b>purpose,</b> and thus that their proximity was not an issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis for}} prosecutions {{was said to}} be the {{doctrine}} of [...] "common purpose."

2500|$|The {{court held}} that [...] "he jury was never asked to confront the {{question}} whether the shared <b>common</b> <b>purpose</b> was not only to shoot, but to be shot at."

The court considered that [...] "simple participation in the affray with foresight, but without a joint enterprise to commit the affray wsufficient to sustain the conviction".
