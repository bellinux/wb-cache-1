Almost simultaneously, Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe, Chief Constable of Kent, to consider the wireless needs of all forces.

The council did not set the rate to go with the budget but instead passed a motion declaring that it could not set a rate. Later in March the council passed a second resolution which explained that it would not set a rate until learning the outcome of Greenwich borough council's application for judicial review which was due to be heard on 12 April.|$|E

500|$|Getty's {{government}} {{was faced with}} a combination of a general economic malaise and falling oil prices. [...] The slowdown in the energy sector contributed to a decrease in <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> which reduced demand for labour in the construction industry by 50% between 1980 and 1985. Many workers left the province, which suppressed real estate prices and hurt financial institutions; two Albertan banks, the Canadian Commercial Bank and the Northlands Bank, failed in September 1985.

500|$|Stelmach's {{approach}} to this deteriorating fiscal situation, part of a global recession, was to invest heavily in infrastructure {{in an effort to}} stimulate the economy and take advantage of low construction costs. [...] He went as far as to advocate borrowing for capital construction, a departure from the Klein government's notoriously anti-debt approach. [...] However, his government was also one of only two in Canada (the other being Saskatchewan's) to cut overall spending in the 2009–2010 budget. This approach drew the ire of Liberal leader David Swann, who supported increased government spending for economic stimulus purposes, but drew support from some economists and was defended by Evans on the basis that <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> was at twice the per capital level of the Canadian average.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} post-War period {{once again}} reform {{on the agenda}} with, in particular, {{the passing of the}} Education Act 1944. The effect was dramatic: state support, through bursaries and central grants, was hugely increased; the proportion of state school entrants increased considerably; {{for the first time in}} over a hundred years, there was considerable competition over places. Stallybrass, made Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1947, was sceptical about state education. It was not the quality of the students, but rather the means of state control that worried him. Annual grants from government were made to the University, not colleges, and might yet replace endowments as Brasenose's primary source of income, making it dependent on University support and increasing [...] "federation" [...] of colleges in a University superstructure. Stallybrass worried over this loss of college autonomy, although it was matched with a doubled grant from the government and huge sums set aside for <b>capital</b> <b>spending.</b> The right of Brasenose to choose its own students might be under threat, he thought; as it happened, the Labour government decided against corporate admission and threats to Stallybrass' power mostly resided within Brasenose.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} Commercial Real Estate to provide strong current income returns {{has long been}} one of its {{benefits}} of inclusion into a long-term portfolio. Capital Expenditures can significantly hamper this income return of commercial properties and mislead the investors into making misguided decisions. However, there {{has long been an}} informational vacuum about capital expenditure and the current available literature can best be described as non-existent. This thesis focuses entirely on capital expenditure to understand the future implications of <b>Capital</b> Expenditure <b>Spending,</b> and to understand the co-relation between different property characteristics and capital expenditure. The thesis uses contingency tables to understand the behavior of commercial properties over a span of nine years. The goal was to understand if <b>capital</b> expenditure <b>spends</b> have an impact on future spends. If an investor invests high (low) capital expenditure in the present do they keep spending high (low) all throughout their hold periods or their spending changes over time. Secondly, regression analyses is used to better understand the relationship between different property characteristics and capital expenditures and this exercise helps build an intuition about <b>capital</b> expenditure <b>spends.</b> The contingency tables and regression analyses revealed distinguishing trends about capital expenditure and helped understand its behavior. It was revealed that investors currently <b>spending</b> high on <b>capital</b> expenditures are not necessarily successful in saving <b>capital</b> expenditure <b>spends</b> in the future. The regression analyses defined a positive correlation for capital expenditure with respect to age, sq. ft, NOI and market value and it defined a negative co-relation with respect to cap rate and location considering the property was located in the top six markets in the country. by Mehul Chavada.
