40|$|Background and Purpose. Fatigue {{and memory}} {{impairment}} are common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) and both may interact with cognition. This {{can contribute to}} making a <b>complaint</b> misrepresentative of the objective disorder. We sought to determine whether fatigue <b>complaint</b> in MS reflects memory impairment and investigated whether patients’ subjective fatigue is associated with memory <b>complaint.</b> Methods. Fifty MS patients complaining of fatigue underwent subjective assessment of fatigue and memory <b>complaint</b> measured using self-assessment scales. Cognitive functions were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests, including a test of verbal episodic memory, the selective reminding test (SRT). Correlations were studied between subjective fatigue, memory <b>complaint,</b> and performance in verbal episodic memory. Results. Depression score, psychotropic and/or antiepileptic drug use, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and MS form were confounding factors. After adjusting for these confounding factors, neither fatigue <b>complaint</b> nor memory <b>complaint</b> was correlated with SRT performance. Subjective fatigue {{was significantly associated with}} memory <b>complaint.</b> Conclusion. Although <b>complaint</b> of fatigue in MS was correlated with memory <b>complaint,</b> subjective fatigue was not the expression of memory impairment...|$|R

Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 23 (5), 653 - 660 Purpose ? The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate public online consumer <b>complaint</b> responses from three different perspectives: the complainer, the company and third party consumers. Consumer <b>complaint</b> behaviour and management has been studied in various streams of literature, yet the subsequent processes triggered by a company <b>complaint</b> response have not been studied so far. In particular, this paper seeks to divert from examining <b>complaint</b> participants in isolation by recognising interrelated communication effects of <b>complaint</b> dialogue and public media. Design/methodology/approach ? Looking at credibility perceptions as a theoretical construct for measuring the utility of a <b>complaint</b> as well as attitude-orientation as an evaluative moderator, the paper highlights the ambiguity of meaning transfer in an online <b>complaint</b> forum. Findings ? It is hypothesised that credibility and congruence in attitude orientation positively enhance <b>complaint</b> utility {{perceptions and}} strongly bias <b>complaint</b> dialogue evaluations. Originality/value ?
