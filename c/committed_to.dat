But how does making a commitment affects the commitments of others? We provide an {{answer to this question}} for the case of acknowledgments. Commitment semantics poses a dilemma for acknowledgments: either the semantics is strong, entailing that agent i’s <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> j entails other agents <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> i’s <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> j. This makes acknowledgments vacuous. Or further acknowledgments are required to produce commitments about others’ commitments, but then grounding seems never achievable in finite time. Building on Venant & Asher (2015) we provide a model of these strong and weak semantics where we show how the two are linked via a semantics for inductive, synchronous acknowledgments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which traders may secretly take fair bets in complete markets in order to temporarily manipulate their reputation and attract more funds. It then solves for contracts that mitigate this friction. Such contracts must ensure that {{the present value of}} the trader’s future payoffs is not too convex in her reputation. If the trader can <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> a long-term contract, she can achieve this by <b>committing</b> <b>to</b> leave a fraction of her future excess returns to investors if she turns out to be highly skilled. If the trader cannot <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> such behavior, then investors optimally <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> overcompensate the trader if she turns out to be unskilled. In both cases, the net excess returns earned by competitive, uninformed investors exhibit persistence...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} recent {{literature}} on price discrimination. The {{focus is on}} three aspects of pricing decisions: the information about customers available to firms; the instruments firms can use {{in the design of}} their tariffs; and the ability of firms <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> their pricing plans. Developments in marketing technology mean that firms often have access to more information about individual customers than was previously the case. The use of this information might be restricted by public policy towards customer privacy. Where it is not restricted, firms may be unable <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> how they use the information. With monopoly supply, an increased ability to engage in price discrimination will boost profit unless the firm cannot <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> its pricing policy. Likewise, an enhanced ability <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> prices will benefit a monopolist. With competition, the effects of price discrimination on profit, consumer surplus and overall welfare depend on the kinds of information and/or tariff instruments available to firms. The ability <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> prices may damage industry profit. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{person may}} display either {{relative}} weakness or relative strength {{in terms of}} both exploration and commitments. When assigned categories, four possible permutations result: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, identity moratorium, and identity achievement. Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in <b>committing</b> even <b>to</b> those unchosen roles that he or she occupies. Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past, but seems willing <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> some relevant values, goals, or roles in the future. Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness, ready to make choices but unable <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> them. Finally, achievement is when a person makes identity choices and <b>commits</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|R

When firms cannot even <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> paying at least their advertised wage, equilibrium exhibits job auctions with wage dispersion which generally are not constrained efficient. directed search, wage posting, job auctions, commitment...|$|R
