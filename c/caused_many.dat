Motorists crossing the Pennsylvania mountains during the 1930s {{were limited to}} hilly, winding roads such as the Lincoln Highway (US30) or the William Penn Highway (US22), which had grades exceeding nine percent.

Signed as a replacement for David Burrows, Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5–1 defeat to Coventry City. Initial difficulties adapting to the Premier League <b>caused</b> <b>many</b> fans to question his displays on the pitch and he returned to Norway on loan to Rosenborg in 1994.|$|E

Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards.|$|E

5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which <b>caused</b> <b>many</b> {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|Residents in both Massachusetts and Connecticut {{were also}} without power {{for up to}} one week, which <b>caused</b> <b>many</b> food {{products}} to spoil {{due to lack of}} refrigeration. The states brought in workers from other states, although the delay in restoring the widespread outages <b>caused</b> <b>many</b> schools to remain closed. In Connecticut, one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines. About 477,000 Connecticut Light & Power customers in the state lost power, a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during Hurricane Irene in 2011. Later in 2011, a nor'easter in October left over 830,000people statewide without power, also breaking the record set by Gloria. In New Hampshire, most power outages were quickly restored, and all were restored within six days. In Maine, all power outages were restored in 11days.|$|E

5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had {{little chance of}} winning the election.

Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter <b>caused</b> <b>many</b> postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
