On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction {{of the price of}} the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium to $56million and the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project to $91million.|$|E
