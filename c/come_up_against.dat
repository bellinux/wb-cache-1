5|$|No. 6 Commando led {{the brigade}} from the beach. Moving through a swamp that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos began to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the German defences {{that had not}} been {{destroyed}} by the naval bombardment. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers earlier in the day, they assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—as well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases {{linked to the}} paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), and Doggett <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the horrible {{consequences}} of the Syndicate’s pact with the aliens, as Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley)—now reprogrammed as a Supersoldier—attempts to erase all evidence of the tests—including Scully's soon-to-be-born baby. Upon hearing information from Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), the men reluctantly call upon him as well as Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to help them.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{subsequently}} {{were able}} to reduce and then secure the Japanese strong hold around Sattelberg against determined resistance following a hard slog through dense jungle, working {{in concert with the}} Matilda tanks. Elsewhere, further actions were planned, with the 7th Division preparing to advance through the Markham and Ramu Valleys as part of the inland advance towards Shaggy Ridge and then the north coast, in order to cut off the Japanese withdrawal route from the Huon Peninsula. This drive would ultimately be unsuccessful in preventing the bulk of the Japanese forces on the Huon Peninsula from escaping. At the same time, once Sattelberg was secured, a simultaneous drive was undertaken to clear the Wareo plateau, which provided good observation towards Scarlet Beach as well as serving as a junction for Japanese lines of communication south. Once Wareo was secure, the Allies advanced along the coast towards Sio, while US forces landed at Saidor to follow up the withdrawing Japanese. Nevertheless, the US and Australian forces would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the same forces throughout the remainder of the war around Madang and Aitape–Wewak.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter. In total, {{over the course of}} the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and {{estimated}} that another 1,000 had probably been wounded. Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a force of at least 2,400 troops. The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo. Four wounded Japanese were also taken prisoner of war. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues. Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.|$|E
5|$|This season focuses {{primarily}} on the show's main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon, his failing health and his personal troubles. John Wood, who portrays Croydon, is the only actor to appear in every episode of Blue Heelers and is, indisputably, the pillar of the show. The final episode of the thirteenth season aired as a 2-hour, movie-length tribute starting with an introduction from John Wood, and concluding with a compilation of Blue Heelers moments from over its 13-season run. For this thirteenth season, Blue Heelers was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night timeslot to the lower rating Saturday-night timeslot, which saw it <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> The Bill, a British police drama which has become quite popular in Australia. Ratings for this season, partially due to the series' move to its lower-rating timeslot, were relatively low; ratings were around the 1.2 million viewer mark, increasing to 1.5 million for the finale. Blue Heelers failed to even {{make it into the}} top 20 programmes at any time during its thirteenth season.|$|E
25|$|The AI {{also makes}} use of {{technological}} developments to design ships of its own. At higher difficulty levels these ships are tailored to the opposition, so players sending fleets of laser-armed ships may find them repulsed by shielded defenders, while those preferring to employ mass drivers will find that they <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> heavily armored opposition instead.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{having a}} {{national}} television contract, the AFL often found itself {{trying to gain}} a foothold, only to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.|$|E
25|$|In one {{of those}} crucial games that they would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Espanyol, Valencia were {{trailing}} 1–0 half-time and a man down after the dismissal of Amedeo Carboni, but after two goals from Rubén Baraja, Valencia achieved a 2–1 victory. Furthermore, Real Madrid's defeat in San Sebastián to Real Sociedad left Valencia with a three-point lead {{at the top of}} the table.|$|E

25|$|Once Arab women {{scientists}} and engineers graduate, they may <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> barriers to finding gainful employment. These include a misalignment between university programmes and labour market demand – a phenomenon which also affects men –, a lack of awareness about what a career in their chosen field entails, family bias against working in mixed-gender environments {{and a lack of}} female role models.|$|E
25|$|Dolci {{became aware}} of the stranglehold of the Mafia upon the poor in Sicily. He did not attack the Mafia at first but he did <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> them at once {{challenging}} their monopoly of water supply with the project of the Iato River dam. Initially, his actions resulted in threats by the Mafia and disapproval of the authorities; later he became too well known in Italy and abroad to be dealt with without too much adverse publicity.|$|E
25|$|Gorton {{proved to}} be a {{surprisingly}} poor media performer and public speaker, and was portrayed by the media as a foolish and incompetent administrator. He was unlucky to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a new and formidable Labor Opposition Leader in Gough Whitlam. Also, he was subjected to media speculation about his drinking habits and his involvements with women. He generated great resentment within his party, and his opponents became increasingly critical of his reliance on an inner circle of advisers – most notably his private secretary Ainsley Gotto.|$|E

25|$|Somewhat unexpectedly, the 3d Division had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> unusually strong Chinese positions. On March 23 General Soule's {{forces had}} {{occupied}} the Uijongbu area with little difficulty. First {{to enter the}} town was Task Force Hawkins, built around {{the bulk of the}} 64th Tank Battalion and two platoons of tanks from each of the 15th and 65th Infantry Regiments. Reaching Uijongbu about 09:00 and finding it undefended, the task force reconnoitered north several miles on Route 33 before returning to the division position. Mines disabled two tanks, but otherwise the task force made no contact.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{captain was}} run out when on 35, {{with his team}} {{amassing}} 322 mainly thanks to 158 from Hayden. In a match spread out over two days, Australia comfortably defeated the home side by 103 runs. In their next match, Australia <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> lowly Bangladesh in another rain interrupted affair. This time the match was shortened to 22 overs a side. In the end Australia won by 10 wickets with Ponting not getting a chance to bat. In their next match against England, again in Antigua, Ponting scored a half-century, guiding Australia to a seven-wicket victory.|$|E
25|$|Moores second {{series in}} charge saw him <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> India. For the Tests, Moores called up Chris Tremlett {{and handed him}} his debut in the First Test. England came close to winning the match but fell one wicket short of a convincing victory, with India hanging on to post 282/9 {{on the final day}} after England took a big lead in to the second innings {{following}} a hundred from Kevin Pietersen. Had {{it not been for the}} rain delaying play on day five, England would have almost certainly won the match. This was seen as further improvements being heralded under the regime of Moores.|$|E

25|$|In the aftermath, US forces {{estimated}} {{that they had}} <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a Japanese force of around company strength. The Japanese positions were very extensive and well organized, with numerous machine gun positions and many dugouts that were deep with good overhead cover. Although a careful count of Japanese dead was not taken, at least 40 Japanese bodies were recovered. Six Japanese machine guns were captured. The Marine forces lost 20 killed, including five officers, and 39 wounded. Although not provided for {{in the first phase}} of the battle when Company E advanced up the trail, artillery preparation was later recognized as of prime importance against the Japanese system of defenses, with their well dug-in, concealed, and covered foxholes, equipped with a high percentage of automatic weapons, in turn covered by equally invisible riflemen in trees and spider-hole. Without strong fire support, severe losses would have been sustained by the attacking Marines.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Suffering badly from malaria {{and other}} {{tropical}} diseases, {{the men were}} mainly used to provide work parties instead of undertaking the training that they would require for the fighting that would come. In June, the 53rd was attached to Maroubra Force and the following month it was split up, with two companies—'B' and 'C'—being sent to the area around Kokoda to reinforce the 39th Battalion, while {{the remainder of the}} battalion remained around Port Moresby in preparation to move up the Kokoda Track. That month the battalion received eight officer reinforcements from experienced 2nd AIF units. On 10 August, the 53rd Battalion was ordered to relieve the 39th, which was at the time positioned around Uberi. The two detached companies moved into position and upon their arrival they finally received a number of Bren guns and had a small amount of training with them, but it was not enough to bring them up to the standard required for combat against the battle-hardened Japanese soldiers that they were about to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>against.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1833, Marsden <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> Fuller Pilch in a single-wicket {{competition}} for the Championship of England. Although Pilch {{had little interest in}} such abbreviated forms of the game, he won comfortably. Marsden died in Sheffield in 1843.|$|R
