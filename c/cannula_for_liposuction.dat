30|$|Of note, {{predicting}} the cardiac output {{required to maintain}} tissue perfusion potentially during CPB is challenging. Usually, the flow on CPB {{is based on the}} cardiac index of 2.0 – 2.5  L/min/m 2 using BSA computed by various formulas and nomograms. However, none of the formulas is validated for patients with achondroplasia. In addition, the size of various <b>cannulas</b> <b>for</b> conducting CPB remains unclear. To date, four case reports have described the size of the cannula in adult patients with achondroplasia [6 – 9]. Scafuri et al. used a pediatric <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> aortic valve replacement with root enlargement in a 56 -year-old woman with achondroplasia; however, they encountered no problem during CPB [6]. Other studies have reported using adult <b>cannulas</b> <b>for</b> the repair of type A aortic dissection [7], aortic valve replacement [8], and pulmonary endarterectomy [9]. Despite no consensus on this matter, an adult cannulation can often be performed successfully and should be considered given that these studies reportedly mentioned increasing their CPB flow to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. In our case, we adjusted the flow rate by monitoring the perfusion parameters such as lactate, SvO 2, or cerebral rSO 2. Overall, our patient responded well to CPB.|$|R

40|$|Definition : Tumescent liposuction is a {{technique}} {{for the removal of}} subcutaneous fat under a special form of local anesthesia called tumescent anesthesia. Physician&#x 2032;s qualifications : The physician performing liposuction should have completed postgraduate training in dermatology or a surgical specialty and should have had adequate training in dermatosurgery at a center that provides training in cutaneous surgery. In addition, the physician should obtain specific liposuction training or experience at the surgical table ("hands on") under the supervision of an appropriately trained and experienced liposuction surgeon. In addition to the surgical technique, training should include instruction in fluid and electrolyte balance, potential complications of liposuction, tumescent and other forms of anesthesia as well as emergency resuscitation and care. Facility : Liposuction can be performed safely in an outpatient day care surgical facility, or a hospital operating room. The day care theater should be equipped with facilities for monitoring and handling emergencies. A plan for handling emergencies should be in place with which all nursing staff should be familiar. A physician trained in emergency medical care and acute cardiac emergencies should be available in the premises. It is recommended but not mandatory, that an anesthetist be asked to stand by. Indications: <b>Liposuction</b> is recommended <b>for</b> all localized deposits of fat. Novices should restrict themselves to the abdomen, thighs, buttocks and male breasts. Arms, the medial side of the thigh and the female breast need more experience and are recommended <b>for</b> experienced surgeons. <b>Liposuction</b> may be performed for non-cosmetic indications such as hyperhidrosis of axillae after adequate experience has been acquired, but is not recommended for the treatment of obesity. Preoperative evaluation : Detailed history is to be taken with respect to any previous disease, drug intake and prior surgical procedures. Liposuction is contraindicated in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, severe coagulation disorders including thrombophilia, and during pregnancy. Physical evaluation should be detailed and should include assessment of general physical health to determine the fitness of the patient for surgery, as well as the examination of specific sites that need <b>liposuction</b> to check <b>for</b> potential problems. Preoperative Informed consent : The patient should sign a detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and should mention whether more procedures are needed for proper results. The patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, computer presentations, and personal discussions. Preoperative laboratory studies to be performed include Hb&#x 0025;, blood counts including platelet counts, bleeding and clotting time (or prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time) and blood chemistry profile; ECG is advisable. Liver function tests, and pregnancy test for women of childbearing age are performed as mandated by the individual patient&#x 2032;s requirements. Ultrasound examination is recommended in cases of gynecomastia. Preoperative medication : Preoperative antibiotics and non-sedative analgesics such as paracetamol are recommended. The choice of antibiotic and analgesic agents depends on the individual physician&#x 2032;s preference and the prevailing local conditions. Type of anesthetic employed : Lidocaine is the preferred local anesthetic; its recommended dose is 35 - 45 mg/kg and doses should not exceed 55 mg/kg wt. The recommended concentration of epinephrine in tumescent solutions is 0. 25 - 1. 5 mg/L. The total dosage of epinephrine should be minimized and should not exceed 50 &#x 00 B 5;g/kg. Surgical technique/procedure It is always advisable not to combine liposuction with other procedures to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage of lignocaine. However, such combinations may be attempted if the total required dose of lignocaine does not exceed the maximum dose indicated above. The recommended <b>cannula</b> size <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> is not to be larger than 3. 5 mm in diameter. The recommended volume of fat removed is in proportion to the fat content and/or size and/or weight of the patient being treated. It is recommended that the volume of fat removed not exceed 5000 mL in a single operative session. Large volume liposuctions or mega-liposuctions are not recommended. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring : Baseline vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate, are recorded pre- and postoperatively. Pulse oximeter monitoring is essential in all cases. Postoperative care: Postoperative antibiotics should be selected by the physician and taken for five days. Postoperative antiinflammatory drugs such as Cox 2 Inhibiters may be given for 5 - 7 days; specialized compression garments, binders, and tape help to reduce bruising, hematomas, seromas, and pain. Generally, compression is recommended for two weeks although this is variable according {{to the needs of the}} individual patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} liposuction {{can be traced}} to an adverse event by Dujarrier in 1921 when he used a uterine curette to remove fat from the knees of a {{ballerina}} ending in an amputation secondary to damage of the femoral artery. The history of liposuction since then has been one of avoiding complications and optimising outcome. After this adverse event, liposuction was abandoned until the 1960 ′s when Schrudde revived the practice using small stab incisions and sharp curettage with the secondary suction to aspirate the freed tissue. This technique was associated with a high incidence of complications especially seroma and skin necrosis. Illouz then replaced the curette with a blunt cannula connected to vacuum pump thus avoiding the complications of a sharp curette. Despite the presence of various techniques <b>for</b> <b>liposuction,</b> suction assisted liposuction (SAL) is still the standard technique of liposuction. This article aims to discuss literature regarding the various aspects of liposuction (SAL) and to highlight the salient points in the literature and in the senior author′s experience in order to avoid unfavourable outcomes in liposuction. A literature review on avoiding complication is in liposuction including some of the seminal papers on liposuction. Liposuction is generally a safe procedure with reproducible outcome. Just like any surgical procedure it should be treated with the utmost care. Illouz published 10 commandments <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> in 1989 and we review these commandments to demonstrate how liposuction has evolved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transanal {{endoscopic}} microsurgery is a {{safe and}} efficacious surgical approach for local excision of benign adenomas and early-stage rectal cancer. However, utilization of the technique has been limited due to the unavailability of high-priced specialized instrumentation at many institutions and the technically demanding training required. To avoid these obstacles, we have explored an alternative approach called Transanal Endoscopic Video-Assisted excision, which combines the merits of singleport access and local transanal excision. Methods: A disposable single-incision port is inserted into the anal canal for transanal access. The port contains 3 <b>cannulae</b> <b>for</b> introducing instrumentation into the rectal lumen, and a supplementary <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> carbon dioxide insufflation. Pneumorectum results in rectal distention and optimizes the visual field during the procedure. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation is utilized for visualization and transanal excision of rectal pathologies. Conclusions: Transanal endoscopic video-assisted excision is an innovative approach to local excision of benign and malignant rectal lesions. The approach averts several of the pitfalls commonly experienced with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Continued investigation and development of this novel modality will be important in establishing its role in minimally invasive surgery...|$|R

Safety and aesthetic issues define MegaLiposuction {{to be in}} Volume in litres of more than 10 % of Body weight in Kgs. 870 cases of liposuction were performed between September 2000 and August 2008. In (65 %) cases, the total volume of aspirate was greater then 5 liters. (Range: 5 to 25 liters). In 24 % cases, the large volume liposuction was combined with a limited or a total block lipectomy. Regional anaesthesia with conscious sedation was preferred except where <b>liposuction</b> was <b>for</b> above the subcostal region (the Upper Trunk, Lateral Chest, Back, Gynaecomastia, Breast, Arms and Face) or when the patient so desired. Tumescent infiltration with Lactated ringer, adrenalin, triamcinalone and hyalase was made in all cases. This approach has clinically shown less tissue edema in the post operative period than when the conventional physiological saline was being used in place of Ringer Lactate. The amount injected varied from 1, 000 ml to 12, 500 ml depending on the size, site and area. Local anesthetic was included only to the terminal portion of the tumescent mixture while infiltrating the sub-costal regions, or when above costal region was combined with below costal region being anaesthetized with Spinal Anaesthesia. The aspirate was restricted to the unstained white / yellow fat {{and the amount of}} fat aspirated did not have any bearing to the amount of solution infiltrated. There was no major complication. Blood transfusion was given only on one occasion when the patient had been on aspirin and had also received Low Molecular weight Heparin intra-operative.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Inhalation of {{nitric oxide}} with oxygen {{could be a}} {{promising}} treatment in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. However, the current methods of delivery of NO are cumbersome and unsuitable for long term use. The present study was undertaken to investigate the safety and efficacy of a mixture of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen administered via a nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours in patients with oxygen dependent COPD.  METHODS—Twenty five parts per million (ppm) of NO was administered by inhalation combined with supplemental oxygen at a flow rate of 2 l/min via a nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours to 11 ambulatory men with stable, oxygen dependent COPD. Room air with supplemental oxygen at 2 l/min was administered in an identical manner for another 24 hours as control therapy in a randomised, double blind, crossover fashion to all patients. Pulmonary function tests, exercise tolerance, dyspnoea grade, and lung volumes were measured at baseline, 24, and 48 hours. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), arterial blood gas tensions, and minute ventilation were measured at baseline, after 30 minutes and 24 hours of breathing NO and oxygen. Venous admixture ratio (Qs/Qt) and dead space ratio (Vd/Vt) were also calculated. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and NO in the inhaled and ambient air were monitored continuously. Differences in pulmonary function, arterial blood gas tensions, pulmonary haemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and dyspnoea between oxygen and NO breathing periods were analysed for significance using paired t tests.  RESULTS—A significant (p< 0. 05) fall was observed in PVR (183. 1 (116. 05) and 137. 2 (108. 4) dynes. s. cm- 3 before and after breathing NO for 24 hours, respectively) with NO administration without significant changes in symptoms, pulmonary function, arterial oxygen tension, or exercise tolerance.  CONCLUSIONS—NO at a concentration of 25 ppm blended with oxygen can be safely administered by nasal <b>cannula</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours without significant adverse effects and lowers PVR in stable patients with COPD receiving long term oxygen therapy. ...|$|R
