40|$|Background: The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R) is a 24 -item self-report {{instrument}} {{that was developed}} to aid providers in predicting aberrant medication-related behaviors among chronic pain patients. Although the SOAPP-R has garnered widespread use, certain patients may be dissuaded from taking it because of its length. Administrative barriers associated with lengthy questionnaires further limit its utility. Objective: To investigate {{the extent to which}} two techniques for computer-based administration (<b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment)</b> reduce the average test length of the SOAPP-R without unduly affecting sensitivity and specificity. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Pain management centers. Subjects: Four hundred and twenty-eight chronic non-cancer pain patients. Methods: Subjects had taken the full-length SOAPP-R and been classified by the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index (ADBI) as having engaged or not engaged in aberrant medication-related behavior. <b>Curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment</b> were applied to the data in post-hoc simulation. Sensitivity and specificity with respect to the ADBI, as well as average test length, were computed for the full-length test, <b>curtailment,</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment.</b> Results: The full-length SOAPP-R exhibited a sensitivity of 0. 745 and a specificity of 0. 671 for predicting the ADBI. Curtailment reduced the average test length by 26 % while exhibiting the same sensitivity and specificity as the full-length test. Stochastic curtailment reduced the average test length by as much as 65 % while always exhibiting sensitivity and specificity for the ADBI within 0. 035 of those of the full-length test. Conclusions: <b>Curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment</b> have potential to improve the SOAPP-R's efficiency in computer-based administrations...|$|R

30|$|In {{the second}} iteration, {{a new set}} of {{candidate}} solutions is derived from the best round- 1 solution κ _ 1 =κ̃_ 1 ^ 2. The best candidate, κ _ 2 = κ̃^ 3 _ 2, eliminates the risk from a complete failure to trip generators at Bus 22 in response to a fault in transformer 7 or a double circuit failure at lines 25 and 26. This is achieved through a combination of generation <b>curtailments</b> <b>and</b> extra SPS capacity; it opts for committing SPS capacity at Bus 21 (g_ 4) to diversify the SPS response. The other two candidates shown heavily rely on an increase in generation <b>curtailments</b> <b>and</b> protection costs in order to minimize the risk exposure—yet not enough gain is achieved to compensate these extra costs.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{sustainable}} consumption buying <b>and</b> <b>curtailment</b> behavior in emerging markets is limited, yet this knowledge {{is vital to}} the future of these economies. The newer conceptualization of pro-environmental self-identity (PESI), as environmentally-friendly dynamic-self, can significantly inform comprehension of these behaviors, and strengthen them. Utilizing intra-personal influences and situational cueing, this paper appraises the influence of PESI on the sustainable buying <b>and</b> <b>curtailment</b> behaviors of consumers in China and Poland. Surveying these consumers, PESI was confirmed as a significant influence on their buying <b>and</b> <b>curtailment</b> behaviors. Contextual <b>and</b> behavioral distinctions also emerged, highlighting a buying emphasis in China <b>and</b> <b>curtailment</b> orientation in Poland. Notably, PESI was found to be multi-activated by situational cueing, moral responsibility, assessment, social desirability, tinted by consumer effectiveness and knowledge. Important implications arise for eco-innovation <b>and</b> buying <b>and</b> <b>curtailment</b> policy-making in emerging markets. PESI consumers have a potential active stakeholder role in this innovation and policy development...|$|R

In this thesis, a German energy scenario for 2025 with large shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources, in particular wind and photovoltaic, is analyzed regarding the influence of historical meteorological input data on system reliability. Using the loss of load expectation approach (LOLE) for a German energy scenario {{an assessment of the}} influence of various meteorological years on system reliability is carried out. The results indicate a significant impact of the used meteorological year on the LOLE. Furthermore the interdependency of <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> load balancing on system reliability is investigated. Therefore a LOLE for a German energy scenario for 2025 considering <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> flexibility options is calculated using the energy system model REMix.

Therefore, efficient replacement between hydropower and thermal power needs to be motivated constantly, and the total cost of power generation would be reduced.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} customized computer-based testing procedures to reduce the mean test length of the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist for DSM- 5 (PCL- 5). Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted using responses from 942 adults who had completed the full-length (20 -item) PCL- 5 {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Sandy. The abilities of 2 testing procedures, <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment,</b> to lessen the instrument's mean test length while maintaining the same result as the full-length PCL- 5 ("positive" or "negative") were evaluated in a post hoc simulation. <b>Curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment</b> track a respondent's answers as she takes the instrument and stop the test if future items are unable or unlikely to change the result. The performance of each procedure was recorded under 2 scoring methods: a total-score-based method and a cluster-based method. Each procedure's sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with the full-length PCL- 5 were computed. Results: Curtailment reduced the mean test length by 40 % under the total-score-based method, and by more than 70 % under the cluster-based method, while exhibiting 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with the full-length PCL- 5. Stochastic curtailment reduced the mean test length by up to 88 % under the total-score-based method, and up to 84 % under the cluster-based method, while always exhibiting at least 92 % sensitivity and 99. 8 % overall agreement, as well as 100 % specificity, for the full-length PCL- 5. Conclusions: <b>Curtailment</b> <b>and</b> stochastic <b>curtailment</b> have potential to enhance the efficiency of the PCL- 5 when this assessment is administered by computer.

However, if unexpected fast variation of DG outputs and loads happen, day-ahead optimal schedules may fail to retain voltage profiles of all buses.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} of using wind energy <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> capacity overinstallation to increase the profit of wind turbine (WT) installations in a local grid, accounting for {{the correlation between the}} local wind power production and system electricity price. It is demonstrated that the market value of a local wind power production in Denmark would be overestimated by 11 % if the average electricity price is used without considering the price-wind correlation. A first-order relation is developed to quantify the correlation between the electricity price and local-wind power production to evaluate the market value and the expected revenue of the wind power. Furthermore, in the analyzed cases of a local WT installation, compared to the case with no curtailment, the profits are increased by up to 46 % through 29 % of energy <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> 113 % of capacity overinstallation, when the slope of the price-wind relation is 100 (sic) /MWh.

30|$|Similar to Case 1, as more {{reinforcements}} {{were made}} through the steps, the expected operation {{cost of the}} microgrid decreases because of less electricity <b>and</b> heat demand <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> {{reduction in the number}} of vulnerable components in the electricity and natural gas networks. The expected operation cost microgrid at step 4 is significantly decreased (i.e. 25.58 %) compared to that in step 3 and the resiliency index is increased from 0.0056 at step 3 to 0.0250 at step 4.|$|R
40|$|For solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) and wind resources, the capacity factor {{is an important}} parameter describing {{the quality of the}} resource. As the share of variable renewable resources (such as PV and wind) on the electric system is increasing, so does <b>curtailment</b> (<b>and</b> the fraction of time when it cannot be avoided). At high levels of renewable generation, curtailments effectively change the practical measure of resource quality from capacity factor to the incremental capacity factor. The latter accounts only for generation during hours of no <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> is directly connected with the marginal capital cost of renewable generators for a given level of renewable generation during the year. The Western U. S. wind generation is analyzed hourly for a system with 75 % of annual generation from wind, and it is found that the value for the system of resources with equal capacity factors can vary by a factor of 2, which highlights the importance of using the incremental capacity factor instead. The effect is expected to be more pronounced in smaller geographic areas (or when transmission limitations imposed) and less pronounced at lower levels of renewable energy in the system with less curtailment...|$|R

Incorporating interruptible loads in day-ahead markets could maximize their potential in providing ancillary services because it enables them to plan their operations, and for them to offer reliable <b>curtailment</b> capacities <b>and</b> competitive bids. This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization to schedule a set of interruptible loads over a 16 -hour period. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total payments to the interruptible loads and the frequency of interruptions, and to satisfy the required hourly <b>curtailments</b> <b>and</b> operational constraints imposed by the interruptible loads. The constraints in this multi-objective optimization problem were handled using four constraint-handling methods: using static and adaptive penalty functions, tracking only feasible solutions, and using repair algorithms.

However, it is feasible that we can conduct optimized load dispatching of CHP units when the wind power is strong, integrating additional wind power into the grid. The potential of this method over a longer time period is a topic to be investigated in the future.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{investigate}} the potential of Reactive Power Control (RPC) in distribution grids with a high PV-share. The overall objective is to maximize the utilization of installed PV sources. Different RPC approaches are examined in combination with distributed storage, grid expansions <b>and</b> <b>curtailment.</b> Simulations are carried out on ref-erence distribution grids, representing remote, rural and urban networks. Various shares of PV-penetration with different PV-distributions are simulated on a representative irradiance profile. Batteries are optimally dispatched {{on the basis of}} load and solar irradiance forecasts using a Model Predictive Control method. The hierarchical control schemes selects the optimal RPC and storage signal. The simulation results show, that <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> storages can represent a viable alternative to grid expansions, when the PV-penetration is moderate. The potential of Reactive Power Control is dependent on the PV-distribution and the network. Index Terms—Batteries, Power distribution, Reactive power, Solar power integratio...|$|R

Given that wind power is playing an increasing role in the UK, this paper develops a CEED model for a combined conventional and wind power system under the UK energy policies. The proposed model aims to determine the optimal operation strategy for the given system with the consideration of wind power <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> reservation and also the environmental aspect, especially the carbon price of greenhouse gases (GHG) and emission limits of decarbonisation scenarios. From two case studies, increasing the carbon price at a low emission limit leads {{to an increase in}} the total cost, but the rate of the increase is mitigated on decreasing the emission limits. Moreover, dispatch is dominated by the carbon price at high emission allowance levels and by the emission allowance at low emission allowances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dispatch}} of power networks under mixed pool/bilateral trading. The major questions that are examined are the following: (1) To what degree does the relative level of pool versus bilateral trading influence performance in terms of individual power levels, costs, prices, and revenues? (2) What is the comparative performance of mixed trading with firm and nonfirm bilateral contracts under various curtailment strategies? (3) Is the revenue derived from the pool and bilateral trading consistent with the corresponding unbundled costs? The above questions are sequentially addressed in separate parts of this three-part paper. The eventual goal of these results is to help generator and load-serving entities choose appropriate relative levels of pool versus bilateral trades while considering risk, economic performance, and physical constraints. In Part II, two types of bilateral contracts, firm and nonfirm, are introduced together with their respective <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> noncurtailment bids. The optimal power-flow problem from Part I is now modified to accommodate this new type of operation. Technical and economical performance measures defined in Part I, namely, generation revenues from bilateral and pool sales, pool demand payments, plus generation and load expenditures to cover transmission loss and congestion management attributed to bilateral exchanges are also used here together with revenues from contract <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> expenditures due to noncurtailment bidding. Simulation results illustrate the effects of firm and nonfirm contracts and their bidding strategies on the relative levels of pool/bilateral trading, {{as well as on}} economic performance of market participants...|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of active {{distribution}} network planning is to consume more renewable energy so as to reduce the carbon emission. But some renewable energy, especially wind power, has a strong anti-peak regulation characteristic. It is necessary to integrate ESS and demand response to the distribution system because peak load shifting will {{reduce the amount of}} wind power <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> increase the installed DG capacity in the distribution system at the same time. Moreover, current models mostly focus on static (e.g. snapshot) or pseudo-dynamic simulation [11], therefore there is not enough detailed simulation process on successive time windows. Consequently, time-varying model will be more significant in ADS planning in the future.|$|R

30|$|There {{are some}} {{research}} studies on optimum placement of both wind generators and ESS [59, 60]. However wind generators {{may not be}} located optimally as it highly depends on the maximum undisturbed wind flow and low cost area. For these reasons, wind power cannot be distributed in the power system network. Therefore, there is a probability of having high power congestion due to power transmission limitations. The wind power curtailment occurs frequently in those areas with high wind power penetration. Probable ways to alter the power flow to avoid unexpected congestion of power include change in system topology, use of flexible AC transmission systems, redispatch of generation, renewable energy source (RES) <b>curtailment</b> <b>and</b> use of ESS.|$|R
