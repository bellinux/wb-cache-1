Native bees <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E

25|$|Shame {{can be a}} {{contributor}} to those with problems of low self-esteem. Feelings of shame usually occur because of {{a situation where the}} social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance.

This increase in shame <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> with self-compassion.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that pedophilia can be cured. Instead, most therapies focus on helping the pedophile refrain from acting on their desires. Some therapies do attempt to cure pedophilia, but there are no studies showing that they result in a long-term change in sexual preference. Michael Seto suggests that attempts to cure pedophilia in adulthood are unlikely to succeed because its development is influenced by prenatal factors. Fred Berlin, founder of the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic, believes that pedophilia may be no easier to alter than homosexuality or heterosexuality, but that pedophiles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to control their behavior, and future research could develop a method of prevention.|$|E

In the ship, she discovers Galiana, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, she encountered the Inhibitors, who have unleashed an agent into her ships which has taken control of it and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well.

Each planet's location is labeled with a colored marker which disappears once that planet's puzzle is solved. [...] The player encounters characters who <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> if a puzzle is solved. Each planet besides Earth has its own puzzle. The monster's ability to swing around objects is used {{in some of the}} game's puzzles. One puzzle involves swinging on the crystals which surround the core of a hollow planet called Gravida, without swinging on the same crystal twice or breaking the chain. Solving each planet's puzzle produces a flash of light, after which monochrome planets change to color, subdued pastel colors brighten, and the planet's unique soundtrack becomes permanent.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} {{the book as}} both convincing and not. The New Yorker wrote that skeptical readers would find the book convincing. Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) thought the book would lead readers to ask why [...] "the principles of progressive education" [...] were not more accepted in England. Reisman (The Phi Delta Kappan) wrote that even the sections dedicated to the origins of neuroses were [...] "still noteworthy, challenging, and provocative". He wrote that the book's impact is in its [...] "realistic demonstration of how children <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to become happy people" [...] without guilt, hate, and fear. On the other hand, the Saturday Review doubted children wanted or benefitted from lack of adult authority. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) thought that the book, while stimulating, left questions as to its actual contribution past an [...] "experiment in applied psychoanalysis", with [...] "clinical procedure ... alternatively inspired, naive, and hair-raising". He called Neill [...] "an excellent devil's advocate for educators" [...] but unhelpful in resolving the ailments of mass education.|$|E

These people also engage in self-monitoring or self-evaluation. Self-evaluation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> along if feedback is given {{when a person is}} working on their goals because it can align how a person feels about how they are doing to achieve a goal and what they are actually doing to achieve their goals.
