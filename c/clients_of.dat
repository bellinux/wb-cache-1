5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' <b>clients,</b> <b>of</b> which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining <b>clients</b> <b>of</b> the families of their former masters.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{society in}} the Middle Ages is the social {{organisation}} {{of what is now}} Scotland between the departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth century and the establishment of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Social structure is obscure {{in the early part of}} the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship groups probably provided the primary system of organisation and society was probably divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become <b>clients</b> <b>of</b> their owners.|$|E

5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former <b>clients</b> <b>of</b> Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients in three states – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also narrowed the case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} is obscure {{in the early}} part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship probably provided the primary unit of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become <b>clients</b> <b>of</b> their owners. By the thirteenth century there are have sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{psychotherapy}} researchers are studying in-session events that signify therapeutic change, process or progress. Similarly, a number of psychotherapy theorists have suggested that <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling is related to therapeutic change, process and progress. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to: (a) examine the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling, (b) identify what particular levels <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling are related to given categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events, and (c) examine the effects that type of therapy may have in the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling. Judges assessed the occurrence <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events and the level <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling in 982 statements in 10 sessions of client-centered, rational-emotive and experiential therapies. The findings indicated that: (a) there is an overall positive significant relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling; (b) given categories <b>of</b> <b>client</b> change events are significantly related to particular levels <b>of</b> <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling; and (c) type of therapy is a significant variable in the relationship between client change events and <b>client</b> strength <b>of</b> feeling. These findings have implications for psychotherapeutic practice and also for clinical theory, with especial relevance for the role and meaning of level of strength <b>of</b> feeling, in-session <b>client</b> change, and a practitioner relevant matrix of conducting sessions of therapy {{on the basis of the}} research variables. Possible directions for further research were outlined...|$|R
