5|$|The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a <b>cast</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> {{living in the}} fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story {{primarily}} concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Age {{presents}} a similar traditional role-playing video game formula that its first half pioneered. Players guide a <b>cast</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, {{interact with other}} characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and {{take part in a}} building, predefined narrative. While many actions the player takes are compulsory and central to the story, The Lost Age allows the player to complete many objectives in the order of their choice, visiting previous locations to advance story elements and complete gameplay objectives are given a stronger emphasis than in the previous game.|$|E

5|$|The regular puppet cast of Captain Scarlet was {{the largest}} of all the Anderson Supermarionation series. While earlier {{productions}} had emphasised the benefits of futuristic technology, for Captain Scarlet {{it was decided to}} develop and deepen the <b>cast</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Further to the enhanced realism of the puppet design, voice roles for Captain Scarlet were, as opposed to Thunderbirds and other predecessors, also intended to be less caricatured. Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn note that, between Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, a proliferation of English-accented voices altered the sound of the Supermarionation production and its impression on the viewer.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy IV, {{the player}} {{controls}} a large <b>cast</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and completes quests {{to advance the}} story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game {{was the first in}} the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Rare {{invested}} in Silicon Graphics computers, which {{they used to}} prototype full computer-generated imagery rendering. Excited about this work, Nintendo purchased a quarter stake in Rare, which eventually expanded to 49%, and offered their <b>cast</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> to the company. The Stampers chose Donkey Kong, and their resulting Donkey Kong Country (1994) was immensely successful: the second-best-selling game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Rare's success continued with the Killer Instinct fighting game series {{and a series of}} games for Nintendo's Nintendo 64 console in the mid- to late-1990s, including Banjo-Kazooie, Blast Corps, Diddy Kong Racing, and GoldenEye 007. The latter became the definitive first-person shooter of the era for home consoles.|$|E
