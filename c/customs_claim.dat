50|$|Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and <b>Customs,</b> <b>claimed</b> {{that the}} {{detection}} of this vessel illustrates the effectiveness of response in detection of ships breaching Australian borders, alleging it was detected in a remote stretch of Australian waters and photographed by a Customs airplane, which returned to base with the photos whilst a vessel was immediately dispatched. This was challenged by Senator Joseph William Ludwig, claiming that the extraordinary feat {{was the fact that}} it was not intercepted earlier, when one considers how far south it had entered into the gulf. The area in which it was found is notorious for illegal Indonesian fishing vessels and for people or drug smuggling operations. Senator Ludwig alleged that Australian <b>Customs</b> had <b>claimed</b> this was a region they had specifically been targeting, and then asked how they can hope to intercept illegal fishing boats when a massive tanker was missed for such a potentially long period of time.|$|R

A 19th century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots.

Octavian divorced Julia's mother {{the day of her}} birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter. Octavian, in accordance with Roman <b>custom,</b> <b>claimed</b> complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother Livia when she was old enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned.

5000|$|The cargo {{was then}} seized again by Customs, who had {{obtained}} a magistrates' court {{order for the}} cargo to be impounded. On appeal at Middlesbrough Crown Court, the judge held that magistrates were wrong, and ordered the goods to be returned, saying both that the [...] "offshore off-licence" [...] was not unlawful and that HMRC's seizure of the cargo was wrongheaded and unconscionable. Customs appealed to the divisional court for an appellate review. On behalf of the venture, barrister Jeremy White relied on the Factortame case, arguing that HMRC's import regulations were arbitrary, restrictive and void for conflicting with the higher authority of EU law; but the divisional court, reminiscent of the majority in Liversidge v Anderson, rejected this claim and ordered the case to be reheard in Middlesbrough. At this second Crown Court hearing, a new judge took a rather different view, holding that Customs had been entitled to seize the cargo. <b>Customs</b> <b>claimed</b> that a duty-free allowance could be claimed only if one had been abroad.|$|R

40|$|Few {{subjects}} {{connected with}} Irish land {{have been the}} cause of more discussion than the Tenant-right Custom of Ulster. For many years before 1870 a controversy was carried on {{with respect to the}} attributes of the custom, and whether it possessed sufficiently definite characteristics to warrant its statutory sanction. As everybody knows, Parliament, by the Land Act of 1870, ended the controversy by legalising the custom, and any discussion that has since taken place has mainly been concerned with the interpretation of the governing statutes. The Land Act of 1881 gave the rights of " free sale" and " fixity of tenure 2 ̆ 7, which the Ulster Custom, to a certain extent secured, to the agricultural tenants of all Ireland, and added the right to a " fair rent" which the <b>Custom</b> <b>claimed,</b> but had hitherto no satisfactory method of enforcing. It would be a mistake, however, to think that the existing Irish Land Code has obviated the necessity for preserving the Ulster Custom. Accordingly, to understand it aright and to give a proper interpretation to the statutes affecting it, we must make ourselves acquainted with its history and its attributes...|$|R

Even though these advertisements {{may not seem}} the most important sources in revealing social relationship during the interwar period in Lithuania, their originality and sincerity reveal human relationship very well. Dating and marriage advertisements {{may seem to be}} a recent phenomenon; however, Eduard Fuchs in his book History of <b>Customs</b> <b>claims</b> that advertisements of this kind can be found since the middle of the 17 th century, while in the 19 th century such advertisements appeared in all European-culture countries. In Lithuania, first dating and marriage advertisements appeared only after regaining independence in 1918 (single advertisements in Lithuanian press can be found only in the press of Lithuanians in Riga). However, as this research has revealed, both in independent Lithuania and among the world Lithuanians, dating and marriage advertisements were a popular way of getting acquainted and create a family between two World Wars. This article focuses on the information behind the advertisements: in addition to social relationship, priority values and personal qualities are analysed, the attitude of Lithuanians towards marriage, and the attitude of the society towards the search of a partner using the press...|$|R
