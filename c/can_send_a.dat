5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

25|$|Other main {{controversy}} {{issues of}} Malaysian National Service include the selection system {{where the government}} computer database system picks up the trainees randomly without even knowing about their social status. Some cases include poor teenagers who need to work for their living and young mothers with newborn babies who were selected for the program, which are considered as inhumane. However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a compass}} in Greenland {{involves}} accounting {{for a very}} extreme magnetic declination. Failure to calculate correctly <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> hunter in the wrong direction, leading to complete loss of bearings. Getting lost in bad weather can waste precious time, forcing the hunter to overnight in very wet, cold, and unpleasant conditions. Hypothermia can further complicate matters and decrease the hunter's ability to think clearly, causing them to lose their bearings even more. A fight for survival may then ensue. Deaths are relatively rare, but they do happen.|$|E
25|$|With advancements in technology, Smartphones {{can serve}} as {{prospective}} memory aids. Electronic calendars are of great use in time-based prospective memory tasks and recently they {{have been shown to}} also cue event-based tasks. The iPhone, as well as phones using the Android operating system, can track the user's location using the phone's Global Positioning System (GPS) and send reminders based on the current location. For example, when a parent is near their children's school, the phone <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> reminder for them to pick up their children after school.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} photos tends to {{outweigh}} their quality {{when it comes}} to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} recording, Gabriel became [...] "obsessed" [...] {{with the}} album's track listing and created an audio {{cassette}} of all the song's beginnings and ends in order to hear how the sounds blended together. His original intention was to have [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] {{at the end of}} the record, but because of its prominent bass line, it had to be placed earlier in the listing on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed {{at the end of the}} album. So was completed in February 1986 and cost £200,000 to make. It was over-dubbed at Power Station Studios in New York, despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer-telephone set up, reasoning, [...] "that's a lot of information to send via phone. Isn't it amazing though? You <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite". It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid-February 1986 at London's Townhouse Studios.|$|E

You <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> man to brush them off every day, rather than having to access everyone's buildings individually, and you can make sure that they are running at their absolute peak. It's much better than putting them on every building in the city." ...|$|E
2500|$|Italian police, military, {{and fire}} brigade {{vehicles}} surrounded {{the plane and}} the Italian news agency ANSA reported that police detained both hijackers. Brindisi Police Chief, Salvatore De Paolis, told Reuters [...] "they will request political asylum". In an interview with reporters, a fire rescue official said [...] "The two hijackers {{want to speak to}} journalists so they <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> message to the Pope and explain why they did this." [...] Amoto reported that the hijacker wanted to deliver a message for Pope Benedict XVI, but stated {{he did not have a}} written letter.|$|E
2500|$|Often these {{comparisons}} carried {{hints of}} humor, competitiveness, or both. The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, for example, termed Gage [...] "the patient whose cerebral organism had been comparatively so little disturbed by its abrupt and intrusive visitor"; and a Kentucky doctor, reporting a patient's survival of a gunshot through the nose, bragged, [...] "If you Yankees <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> tamping bar through a fellow's brain and not kill him, I guess {{there are not}} many can shoot a bullet between a man's mouth and his brains, stopping just short of the medulla oblongata, and not touch either." ...|$|E

2500|$|Communication {{methods have}} {{entered a new}} realm, {{involving}} new technologies. Whether a transmission is between people, or between people and machines, the process is similar in that information is sent by one party and received by another, which <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> response. This {{is a type of}} feedback. People, animals, and plants all have the ability to take certain actions in response to their environments; in the same way, machines have feedback systems in order for their performances to be altered or evaluated in accordance with results. In the context of human/machine society, Wiener offers a definition of the message as [...] "a sequence of events in time which, though in itself has a certain contingency, strives to hold back nature's tendency toward disorder by adjusting its parts to various purposive ends" [...] (p.27).|$|E
2500|$|If it is {{necessary}} to pick up the cables, the power feed equipment <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> 4 to 5 hertz sine wave through the high-voltage output, which can be detected on the seabed. Line terminating equipment (LTE) is installed at Longyearbyen and Harstad. The system is capable of handling the entire length without regeneration of the signal. It employs clear-channel transmission, which is protocol-independent, with the transmissions using the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy protocols. The LTE is fed both an STM-1 at 155 Mbit/s and an STM-64 at 10 Gbit/s, resulting in a STM-64 and OC-192 protocol for transmission. [...] The system is monitored using the Tycho Element Manager System, which are installed in Longyearbyen, Harstad and at Telenor's Network Operations Center in Fornebu. The system can be extended to 2,500 Gbit/s on each cable, by employing all pairs and adding additional wavelengths.|$|E
