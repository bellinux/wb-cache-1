He was given lavish gifts by the king, but was mistrusted by other royal advisers and satirized in the Hawaiian press.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the civil}} service reforms {{of the late nineteenth}} century, all Custom House {{employees}} were political appointees. The President appointed the four principal officers: Collector of Customs, Naval Officer, Surveyor of <b>Customs,</b> and <b>Appraiser</b> of <b>Customs.</b> The Customs House patronage was the subject of great debate during the Rutherford B. Hayes administration, as Hayes attempted to establish a merit-based system of appointments, while Senator Roscoe Conkling wished to retain the spoils system, under which he controlled the patronage there. One Collector of Customs, Chester A. Arthur (1871-1878), later became President of the United States. Arthur was said to have made several times more income as a collector than he did as a lawyer, about $50,000 a year in his first three years in office.|$|R
50|$|Pre-shipment {{inspection}} (PSI) {{agencies are}} companies that carry out physical {{inspection of the}} cargo and certify {{the value of the}} consignment after verification of the declared price against the ruling international price. Then the Customs authorities calculate the leviable of amount of duties and taxes on the basis of that certified value. This essentially has shifted the critical task of tax assessment to the PSI companies from the <b>Customs</b> inspectors and <b>appraisers</b> who were supposed to ascertain the assessable value of a consignment in accordance with the GATT valuation code.|$|R

5000|$|In 1926-27, Bird in Space was {{the subject}} of a court battle over its {{taxation}} by U.S. Customs. In October 1926, Bird in Space, along with 19 other Brâncuși sculptures, arrived in New York harbor aboard the steamship Paris. While works of art are not subject to custom duties, the customs officials refused to believe that the tall, thin piece of polished bronze was art and so imposed the tariff for manufactured metal objects, 40% of the sale price or about $230 (over $3130 in 2016 U.S. dollars). Marcel Duchamp (who accompanied the sculptures from Europe), American photographer Edward Steichen (who was to take possession of Bird in Space after exhibition), and Brâncuși himself were indignant; the sculptures were set to appear at the Brummer Gallery in New York City and then the Arts Club in Chicago. Under pressure from the press and artists, U.S. customs agreed to rethink their classification of the items, releasing the sculptures on bond (under [...] "Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies") until a decision could be reached. However, <b>customs</b> <b>appraiser</b> F. J. H. Kracke eventually confirmed the initial classification of items and said that they were subject to duty. Kracke told the New York Evening Post that [...] "several men, high in the art world were asked to express their opinions for the Government.... One of them told us, 'If that's art, hereafter I'm a bricklayer.' Another said, 'Dots and dashes are as artistic as Brâncuși's work.' In general, it was their opinion that Brâncuși left too much to the imagination." [...] The next month, Steichen filed an appeal to the U.S. Customs' decision.|$|E
