5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark {{on affirmative action}} for minority students in university and <b>college</b> <b>admissions.</b> The case (decided in 1978) upheld affirmative action in the admission of minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for <b>college</b> <b>admissions</b> from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable.

25|$|In these {{affirmative action}} cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or {{has said it}} employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action {{policies}} challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in Grutter, and a Harvard <b>College</b> <b>admissions</b> policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent to Grutter—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one. On the other side, {{it is argued that}} the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta {{tests for}} {{soldiers}} in World War I, mental testing became {{popular in the}} US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize <b>college</b> <b>admissions.</b> The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis.

In the United States, {{tens of thousands of}} men and women were sterilized.

Nonetheless, {{there are still}} many ways in which the national college entrance system can be improved. This article initially analysed and synthesized the issues associated with the Korean <b>college</b> <b>admission</b> system that successive regimes had to tackle, the relevant policy alternatives, and the ensuing consequences of the policy alternatives instituted by different regimes. Based on the analysis, the persistent key issues embedded in major screening factors in the <b>college</b> <b>admission</b> system were determined. Through this analytical lens, this study intends to delineate some possible future directions for the improvement of the <b>college</b> <b>admission</b> system. In conclusion, the government would be well advised to make a continuous effort to complement and stabilize the existing system, regardless of changes in the regime. In addition, the historical analyses of the Korean <b>college</b> <b>admission</b> system will contribute to providing education policy makers in other countries with insights and vicarious experience for the reform of their college entrance systems. <br /...|$|R
