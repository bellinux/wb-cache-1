40|$|The ActiGraph {{accelerometer}} {{is commonly}} used to measure physical activity in children. Count <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> are needed when using accelerometer data to determine the time a person spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. For the GT 3 X accelerometer no <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for young children have been published yet. The aim {{of the current study}} was thus to develop and validate count <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for young children. Thirty-two children aged 5 to 9 years performed four locomotor and four play activities. Activity classification into the light-, moderate- or vigorous-intensity category was based on energy expenditure measurements with indirect calorimetry. Vertical axis as well as vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were determined through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with the data of two thirds of the study group and validated with the data of the remaining third. The vertical axis <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 133 counts per 5 sec for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 193 counts for vigorous activity (VPA) corresponding to a metabolic threshold of 5 MET and 233 for VPA corresponding to 6 MET. The vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 246 counts per 5 sec for MVPA, 316 counts for VPA - 5 MET and 381 counts for VPA - 6 MET. When validated, the current <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> generally showed high recognition rates for each category, high sensitivity and specificity values and moderate agreement in terms of the Kappa statistic. These results were similar for vertical axis and vector magnitude <b>cut-off</b> <b>points.</b> The current <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> adequately reflect MVPA and VPA in young children. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on vector magnitude counts did not appear to reflect the intensity categories better than <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on vertical axis counts alone...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Waist {{circumference}} (WC) <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> {{specific to}} sub-Saharan Caucasians {{do not exist}} with which to identify metabolic syndrome. Neck circumference (NC), as an additional measure, was previously {{found to be a}} worthy identifier of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim was to determine NC and WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to our Caucasian cohort, to confirm baseline <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> and {{to determine whether or not}} WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to this cohort differed from the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) WC guidelines. Design, subjects and setting: A target population study, nested in a prospective cohort, was assessed and included 90 and 96 Caucasian men and women aged 24 - 65 years from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Municipality District, North West province. Outcomes measures: Anthropometric and fasting biological markers for metabolic syndrome, e. g. systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein, were obtained. Results: <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were determined with the use of a receiver operating characteristic. With the use of cohortspecific WC cut-offs, metabolic syndrome prevalence did not change. WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 96 cm for men and 88 cm for women. NC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> were 42 cm and 35 cm, for men and women, respectively. Conclusion: WC <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> specific to these Caucasians differed to those from the JIS guidelines, but corresponded with the baseline findings of the prospective cohort. From a clinical perspective, we cautiously suggest the application of NC, rather than WC, as an anthropometric measure of metabolic syndrome in women as it was a stronger predictor of metabolic syndrome and is not influenced by menopausal status per se.

40|$|In the literature, {{a variety}} of anthropometric {{indicators}} for abdominal obesity have been suggested. The criteria for their selection vary, {{and they have been}} justified mainly on the basis of being correlated with other risk factors, with morbidity and mortality, or to be predictors of the amount of visceral fat. Many of the studies, however, suffer from methodological limitations: they are based on a small number of subjects, often derived from cross-sectional data, based on indirect measurement of risk, or the indicators are complicated to interpret biologically or difficult to use in a public health context. The literature lacks a systematic evaluation of the proposed indicators taking into account possible differences between genders, age categories and ethnic groups and different diseases and mortality. Similar considerations relate to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on the indicators of abdominal obesity. The suggested <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for waist-hip ratio have been based on rather arbitrary criteria, and the studies where <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for waist circumference have been suggested have methodological shortcomings as well, such as being based on cross-sectional data and arbitrary <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for other variables. It is also a reason for concern that so far all suggested <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for abdominal obesity have been based on results obtained in Caucasian populations. Moreover, they are based on assessment of risk and their appropriateness in the use of intervention has not been evaluated. Therefore, no consensus about the appropriateness of the different <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> has been reached. We conclude that there is an apparent lack of consistency in the field and therefore a more scientifically and theoretically solid basis for the selection and use of anthropometric indicators of abdominal obesity and <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> based on them should be a high priority in this research field in the near future...|$|R

Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the <b>cut-off</b> <b>point</b> for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years' work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal wages; expenses {{for most of their}} books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours of homework each evening. The major problem with the system is that there were too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted and financed by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. Curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities.

REceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used. Results: Areas under the ROC curve were in the range of 0. 59 - 0. 77 for BMI and 0. 59 - 0. 78 for WC among men and 0. 66 - 0. 72 and 0. 64 - 0. 72 among women, respectively. Optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for BMI were 24. 7 - 26. 1 kg/m(2) among men (24. 5 - 26. 1 kg/m(2) stunted; 24. 8 - 26. 3 kg/m(2) non-stunted) and 26. 5 - 27. 6 kg/m(2) among women (26. 3 - 27. 8 kg/m(2) studned; 26. 6 - 27. 9 kg/m(2) non-stunted). Optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for WC were 87. 3 - 91. 1 cm among men (85. 3 - 89. 4 cm stunted; 88. 5 - 93. 3 cm non-stunted) and 91. 3 - 95. 3 cm among women (90. 9 - 94. 4 cm stunted; 91. 8 - 95. 6 cm non-stunted). Conclusion: Optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for BMI were slightly higher among women than men than no meaningful differences by stature. Optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>points</b> for WC were several centimetres lower for stunted comapred with non-stunted men, and both were substantially lower than the current recommendations among Western populations. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>points</b> derived from Western populations may not be appropriate for developing countries with a high prevalence of stunting.
