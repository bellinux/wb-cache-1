40|$|The {{derepression}} of the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium {{was examined}} under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> of isoleucine, valine, or leucine (the three amino acids needed for multivalent repression of these enzymes). A procedure was used {{that allowed the}} measurement of enzyme-forming potential that accumulated during the starvation period, but could not be expressed unless the missing amino acid was supplied. The threonine deaminase (the product of the ilvA gene) -forming potential that accumulated under such conditions {{was found to be}} unstable and decayed with a half-life of about 2. 5 min (at 37 C). Evidence was obtained that indicates the threonine deaminase-forming potential that accumulates under conditions of isoleucine starvation {{is in the form of}} initiated (rifampin-resistant), but uncompleted (actinomycin D-sensitive), messenger ribonucleic acid chains. Furthermore, it appears that a large portion of the threonine deaminase- and dehydrase (the product of the ilvD gene) -forming potential, under such conditions, is in the form of initiated polypeptide chains. Based on these results and results obtained with SuA− strains, a model is presented that explains how the second gene (D) in the ilvADE operon can be partially transcribed and translated under conditions in which there are no completed messenger ribonucleic acids for the gene (A) transcribed before it...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the contribution of otolithic and somesthetic inputs {{in the perception of}} body orientation when pitching at very slow velocities. In Experiment 1, the subjects' task was to indicate their subjective postural vertical, in two different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> body <b>restriction,</b> starting from different angles of body tilt. In the "strapped" condition, subjects were attached onto a platform by means of large straps. In the "body cast" condition, subjects were completely immobilized in a depressurized system, which attenuates gravity-based somesthetic cues. Results showed that the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> body <b>restriction</b> and the initial tilt largely influenced the subjective postural vertical. In Experiment 2, subjects were displaced from a vertical position and had to detect the direction of body tilts. Results showed that the threshold for the perception of body tilt was higher when subjects were immobilized in the body cast and when they were tilted backward. Experiment 3 replicated the same protocol from a supine starting position. Compared to results of Experiment 2, the threshold for the perception of body tilt decreased significantly. Overall, these data suggested that gravity-based somesthetic cues are more informative than otolithic cues for the perception of a quasi-static body orientation...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{individual}} genes {{have been identified}} as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms. The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment, in particular, on the organism's diet. Caloric restriction reproducibly results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms, likely via nutrient sensing pathways and decreased metabolic rate. The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear (see for some discussion); however, the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> caloric <b>restriction.</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} few decades, one of the {{intriguing}} questions in monetary economy has been the effectiveness and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in influencing the real sector of the economy. In this dissertation, we studied monetary policy procedure, focusing {{on the influence of}} bank credit and monetary variables on real economic activity in Korea. ^ Especially, we hypothesize that the disequilibrium bank credit market (due to excess demand) induced by credit rationing is the main source of influences on inflation in Korea. We examined the influences of monetary and credit variables on inflation and real output and the direction of causality for those financial variables. ^ The methodologies used for the empirical research were the regression approach and Granger causality tests. The data used were quarterly Korean data for the period 1973 : 1 through 1990 : 4. ^ My results indicate that not only monetary variables but also credit variables, especially current values of narrow credit, have a significant effect in explaining inflation and output changes under the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> restricted supply of bank credit. These empirical results support our hypothesis that bank credit will affect inflation and output under credit rationing and also support Bernanke 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) claim that the money and credit move together to affect output growth. ^ Under the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> in the supply of bank credit, quantity credit rationing (due to excess demand for loans) proved to be more important than the price rationing mechanism in Korea 2 ̆ 7 s case. ...|$|R

40|$|Efficacy of {{antidepressant}} {{drugs is}} often limited. One of the limiting factors may be diet. This {{study shows that}} the effect of escitalopram in the forced swimming test is diminished in rats by food restriction that decreased body weight by 8 %.

Increased 5 -HT transporter function under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> dietary <b>restriction</b> might contribute to the decreased effect of escitalopram.

40|$|Metabolic {{reprogramming}} {{in cancer}} cells {{is controlled by}} the activation of multiple oncogenic signalling pathways in order to promote macromolecule biosynthesis during rapid proliferation. Cancer cells also need to adapt their metabolism to survive and multiply under the metabolically compromised conditions provided by the tumour microenvironment. The tumour suppressor p 53 interacts with the metabolic network at multiple nodes, mostly to reduce anabolic metabolism and promote preservation of cellular energy under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>restriction.</b> Inactivation <b>of</b> this tumour suppressor by deletion or mutation is a frequent event in human cancer. While loss of p 53 function lifts an important barrier to cancer development by deleting cell cycle and apoptosis checkpoints, it also removes a crucial regulatory mechanism and can render cancer cells highly sensitive to metabolic perturbation.

40|$|Classic {{galactosemia}} is {{a potentially}} lethal disorder {{that results from}} profound impairment of galactose- 1 -phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT). Despite decades of research, the underlying pathophysiology of classic galactosemia remains unclear, in part owing {{to the lack of}} an appropriate animal model. Here, we report the establishment of a Drosophila melanogaster model of classic galactosemia; this is the first whole-animal genetic model to mimic aspects of the patient phenotype. Analogous to humans, GALT-deficient D. melanogaster survive under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> galactose <b>restriction,</b> but accumulate elevated levels of galactose- 1 -phosphate and succumb during larval development following galactose exposure. As in patients, the potentially lethal damage is reversible if dietary galactose restriction is initiated early in life. GALT-deficient Drosophila also exhibit locomotor complications despite dietary galactose restriction, and both the acute and long-term complications can be rescued by transgenic expression of human GALT. Using this new Drosophila model, we have begun to dissect the timing, extent and mechanism(s) of galactose sensitivity in the absence of GALT activity...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin, {{a natural}} ligand {{for the growth}} hormone (GH) -secretagogue receptor, is {{primarily}} produced in the stomach. Administration of ghrelin stimulates food intake and GH secretion in both animals and humans. Ghrelin is the only circulating hormone known to stimulate appetite in humans.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that genomic instability increases during aging. Replication pausing (and stalling) at difficult-to-replicate chromosomal sites may induce genomic instability. Interestingly, in aging yeast cells, we observed reduced replication pausing at various natural replication pause sites (RPSs) in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and non-rDNA locations (e. g., silent replication origins and tRNA genes). The reduced pausing occurs {{independent of the}} DNA helicase Rrm 3 p, which facilitates replication past these non-histone protein-complex-bound RPSs, and is independent of the deacetylase Sir 2 p. <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> caloric <b>restriction</b> (CR), which extend life span, also cause reduced replication pausing at the 5 S rDNA and at tRNA genes. In aged and CR cells, the RPSs are less occupied by their specific non-histone protein complexes (e. g., the preinitiation complex TFIIIC), likely because members of these complexes have primarily cytosolic localization. These conditions may lead to reduced replication pausing and may lower replication stress at these sites during aging...|$|R

The controls exhibited significant errors of SPV judgement whereas the experts were very precise. These results suggest that 1) somatosensory cues are more informative than otolithic cues for the perception of body orientation, and 2) the efficiency of otolithic and/or interoceptive inputs can be improved through a specific training to compensate for the lack of somatosensory cues...|$|R
