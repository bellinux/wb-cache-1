At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
500|$|Takei's {{appearance}} as Ricardio gained critical favor. Charlie Anders of io9 named Takei's {{appearance in the}} episode {{as one of his}} [...] "greatest moments", noting, [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> missed that Takei did the voice for this sleazy science-talking heart on Adventure Time, our new favorite show?" [...] Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio {{one of the highlights of}} the season. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava, in a review for [...] "Lady & Peebles", wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? <b>Could</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

60|$|What noble deeds were we not {{ripe for}} {{in the days when}} we loved? What noble lives <b>could</b> <b>we</b> not <b>have</b> lived for her sake? Our love was a {{religion}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died for. It was no mere human creature like ourselves that we adored. It was a queen that we paid homage to, a goddess that we worshiped.|$|R
2500|$|Harlow {{also wanted}} to test how {{isolation}} would affect parenting skills, but the isolates were unable to mate. Artificial insemination had not then been developed; instead, Harlow devised {{what he called a}} [...] "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. He found that, just as they were incapable of having sexual relations, they were also unable to parent their offspring, either abusing or neglecting them. [...] "Not even in our most devious dreams <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> designed a surrogate as evil as these real monkey mothers were", he wrote. Having no social experience themselves, they were incapable of appropriate social interaction. One mother held her baby's face to the floor and chewed off his feet and fingers. Another crushed her baby's head. Most of them simply ignored their offspring.|$|E

Since we don't care for society, it would have made absolutely no difference to our present position. But Tryst, who does not even want to defy the law--what happens to him?

5000|$|All along, I {{demanded of}} Army High Command the {{authority}} to strike down the enemy when he was wobbling. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> finished the enemy last summer. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> destroyed him completely.

5000|$|... {{there was}} a time in the 1950s when <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> won a war against Russia.

One time in the 1950s we flew all of the reconnaissance aircraft that SAC possessed over Vladivostok at high noon ... <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> launched bombing attacks, planned and executed just as well, at that time.

[...] Matt started impatiently. [...] "Oh, I don't mean that it could be shown that he was of unsound mind when he used the company's funds and tampered with their books, though I have my own opinion about that. But I feel sure that he's of unsound mind at present: and I believe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> show it so clearly in court that the prosecution would find it impossible to convict. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> him sent to the insane asylum, {{and that would be a}} creditable exit from the affair in the public eye; it would have a retroactive effect that would popularly acquit him of the charges against him." ...|$|R
