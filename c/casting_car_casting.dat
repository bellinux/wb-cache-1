50|$|The Black Moon {{was based}} on the 1980 Wingho Concordia II {{designed}} by Bernard Beaujardins and Clyde Kwok, made by Wingho Auto Classique in Montreal. Only one of these had been built, so in the movie, a copy of the <b>car</b> <b>cast</b> from a mold was used for stunts, as well as a third replica of the interior only.|$|R

5000|$|Outside of {{the film}} festival circuit, Luxury Car remains little seen. For those audiences that have seen the film, the {{reaction}} has been muted praise. The Hollywood Reporters Dwayne Byrge, for example, after seeing the film at Cannes praised Luxury <b>Cars</b> <b>cast,</b> in particular Wu Youcai as the father and Chinese pop star Tian Yuan {{in the role of}} the daughter, but overall found the film [...] "predictable and narratively uninspired." ...|$|R

50|$|From 1997 to 1999, no CART {{teams and}} drivers {{competed in the}} Indy 500. This allowed many American drivers to {{participate}} in an event that they might otherwise have been unable to afford, but the bitterness of the turbulent political situation, along with the absence of many of the top CART drivers, big-name sponsors, and faster CART-spec <b>cars</b> <b>cast</b> a shadow over the race. It was certainly arguable that to the average fan, the replacement of at least fairly well known foreign drivers by almost-unknown American ones was not perceived as a real gain. Because of this, the Indianapolis 500 began to see significant declines in attendance and television ratings.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1990s, Jouef {{also made}} die <b>cast</b> <b>cars</b> in 1:18, 1:24, and 1:43 scales {{under the name}} JouefEvolution. The car models were most often made in China, though train {{production}} continued in France. The 1:43 scale series was called 'Legende' and cars included a 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera, Ferrari 330 P4 Prototype racer, a Ferrari NART 412P Prototype racer, 250 Ferraris, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta in Le Mans and Tour de France liveries, a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO, a Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione, a Ford GT, a 1965 Mustang, a 1994 Ford Mustang, an MGB ragtop, a Triumph TR3 and a 1978 Volkswagen Beetle.|$|R
5000|$|Schuco went {{bankrupt}} in 1976. An English company Dunbee-Combex-Marx (DCM) acquired Schuco (or {{large parts of}} it), but it too {{went bankrupt}} in 1980. Eventually, rival German toymaker Gama Toys, acquired the rights to Schuco in the mid 1980s, and, for a time, new Gama Toys were 1:43 scale Schucos put directly into Gama boxes - with no name change {{on the base of}} the vehicle. Whether these were newly <b>cast</b> <b>cars</b> with no change in lettering, or leftover stock is uncertain. In the U.S. during the 1980s, Schuco toys were marketed by the Lilliput Motor Company of Yerington, Nevada, with the Lilliput name appearing prominently on the colorful Schuco-style boxes (Johnson 1998, p. 210) ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{issues were}} prepared, and sample die <b>cast</b> <b>cars</b> were made. A {{promotion}} {{to the public}} was made at Comic Con, {{and it was a}} huge success with the fans. However, for unknown reasons, The Adventures of Johnny Lightning was shelved before Toys R Us, Target, and other retailers were to receive the line from Hong Kong. It is speculated that Playing Mantis did not want to share a small percentage of rights in the new comic book character of Johnny Lightning with comic book creator and writer William Winckler, and this is why the project was shelved. There are public records showing that the comic book creator William Winckler also sued Playing Mantis {{in a court of law}} in South Bend, Indiana, as a result of this abrupt cancellation, and received a financial settlement.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Tony George {{specified}} new {{technical rules}} for less expensive cars and [...] "production-based" [...] engines that outlawed the USAC/CART-spec cars {{that had been}} the mainstay of the race since the late 1970s. For the next few years almost all of the CART teams and drivers did not compete in the race. While this situation allowed many American drivers to participate in an event they might otherwise have been unable to afford, the turbulent political situation and the absence of many top IndyCar drivers, big-name sponsors and faster CART-spec <b>cars</b> <b>cast</b> something of a shadow over the race. It was certainly arguable that to the average fan, the replacement of at least fairly well known foreign drivers by almost-unknown American ones was not perceived as a gain.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Lowe and his Playing Mantis company {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Johnny Lightning trademark and started producing reproductions of the original cars in 1994. About the same time that Hot Wheels introduced a [...] "Vintage" [...] line of cars that were reproductions of original 1960s designs. Sales were moderately successful. Interest soon faded as most collectors were not that passionate about the cars even when they were new. They also revived the [...] "Sizzlers" [...] name with electric cars similar to the original Mattel cars. Currently, they sell a line of 1/64 scale adult die <b>cast</b> <b>cars</b> with more detail. Jeff Koch, formerly of Hot Rod Magazine, briefly acted as brand manager for Johnny Lightning, bringing his unique real automotive expertise to the line from 2001 through 2004.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1991 CEO Dino Coppola {{left the}} company with some {{employees}} to found the CDC-Collector Armour Ltd., a company specializing {{in the production of}} die <b>cast</b> <b>cars,</b> armored vehicles, and aircraft, that would be in business until 2001. In 1993, ESCI - ERTL SpA was finally liquidated. Some of the molds moved to Central America, and others ended up in areas that have become conflict zones, and therefore difficult to recover for future reissues.Ertl moved some molds to the United States to be used by AMT. Ertl decided to release the best products under the AMT logo, leaving the logo ESCI as products of lower quality and intended for larger distribution. Production moved to Tijuana in Mexico, and later in China and was characterized by the use of very soft plastic that degraded assembly of AMT and ESCI kit reissues.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, Tom Lowe at Playing Mantis {{commissioned}} Hollywood {{writer and}} producer, William Winckler, and comic book artist Charles Barnett III in New York, {{who had worked}} with Marvel Comics, to produce a comic book toy line called [...] "The Adventures of Johnny Lightning". Previously, William Winckler had written and optioned a pilot for a live-action kids TV series to compete with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers called [...] "Johnny Lightning", with Tom Lowe's approval, but the series was not made. However, the comic book and toy line were developed and produced.Like Speed Racer, the comic book stories involved young race driver Johnny Lightning, who drove a 1968 Charger, called [...] "Lightning One". Playing Mantis was to package self-contained comic books with die-cast cars featured in the stories. Each comic book was to be packaged in a blister pack with one die <b>cast</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Intensification of die <b>casting</b> of <b>car</b> silumins wheels {{with use}} of the water mist instead of {{compressed}} air dies cooling in low pressure casting process were presented in the paper. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations of casting process parameters were carried out on the industrial workstation of <b>casting</b> <b>car</b> wheels under the low pressure and also with Magma computer simulating system. Findings: The temperature {{and the range of}} its variation were presented in characteristic points of the casting and the cooled die with use the compressed air and with the water mist. A scheme of the device for generating the water mist cooling the die and also the pictures of simulation of wheels casting process for researched cooling methods was given. Research limitations/implications: The manufacturing technologies with the permanent mould. Practical implications: Using the water mist to cooling of dies in die casting and low pressure casting process to intensify of cooling the die and {{to reduce the amount of}} casting spoilage. Originality/value: Using the water mist to cooling increases intensity of cooling of the die and the cast. It makes shorter the cycle of casting process as well as reduces the porosity of casts and increases mechanical properties: Rp 0, 2, Rm, A 5 and HB...|$|R

5000|$|The film {{features}} John Huston as Jake Hannaford, {{an aging}} Hollywood director modeled on Ernest Hemingway. The film opens with narration over {{the wreckage of}} Hannaford's crashed <b>car,</b> <b>casting</b> doubt {{as to whether the}} crash which killed him on his 70th birthday was really an accident. The narrator sets the tone for the film by telling us [...] "This film was put together from many sources—from all that footage shot by the TV and documentary film-makers—and also the students, critics and young directors who happened to bring sixteen and eight millimeter cameras to his birthday party …" [...] Just before his death, Hannaford was trying to revive his flagging career by making a [...] "hip, with-it" [...] film in the style of Antonioni, laden with gratuitous sex scenes and violence, with mixed results. At the time of Hannaford's party, this film (The Other Side of the Wind) has been left unfinished after its star stormed off the set, for reasons not immediately apparent to the audience. The film includes extensive excerpts of this film-within-a-film, as well as excerpts of a documentary on Hannaford's life.|$|R
