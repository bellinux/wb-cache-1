40|$|Economists {{have not}} been {{altogether}} successful {{in their efforts to}} forecast “core ” inflation—an inflation measure that typically excludes volatile food and energy prices. One possible explanation is that the models used to make these forecasts fail to distinguish the forces influencing price changes in core services from those affecting price changes in core goods. While <b>core</b> services <b>inflation</b> depends on long-run inflation expectations and the degree of slack in the labor market, <b>core</b> goods <b>inflation</b> depends on short-run inflation expectations and import prices. By using a composite model that combines these different sets of explanatory variables, the authors of this study are able to improve upon the inflation forecasts produced by a standard model.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of Mexican inflation by using a wavelet multiresolution analysis on 16 indexes of the Mexican Consumer Price Index. This enables us to estimate the long-term trend, seasonality, and local shocks of the inflation series, even when the series are non-stationary. The energy distribution between the high frequency, seasonal, and trend components, {{as well as its}} evolution through time, are compared. In particular, headline and <b>core</b> <b>inflations</b> show a more stable behavior in all the scales since 2001. Also, an increase in the proportion of variance explained by short-term variations is detected in the inflation series. In relative terms, the short run is becoming as important for headline inflation as the medium and long run, and more important for non-core inflation. These results are in line with previous studies documenting the reduction in the Mexican inflation persistence. Inflation dynamics, wavelets, multiresolution analysis, energy decomposition. ...|$|R

In a May 2011 speech to the Money Marketeers Club in New York City, Bullard said that, “Many of the old arguments in favor of a focus on <b>core</b> <b>inflation</b> have become rotten over the years. It is time to drop the emphasis on <b>core</b> <b>inflation</b> as a meaningful way to interpret the inflation process in the U.S.” And in a May 2011 column in the Southeast Missourian, Bullard wrote that, “The emphasis on <b>core</b> <b>inflation</b> may give the impression that the FOMC {{does not take into account}} some important price changes when making decisions about monetary policy. This is damaging Fed credibility in Main Street America.” Further, although two different price indexes are popular for measuring overall inflation (the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures index), in 2013 Bullard suggested adopting a standard measure that is consistently used to estimate and adjust for inflation that consumers face.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{inflation}} {{persistence in}} Angola is crucial because National Bank of Angola has approved in 2012 a new monetary policy operational framework which upgrades and expands {{the set of}} instruments to achieve its monetary goals. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to measure the degree of persistence of the headline, food, energy, underlying and 10 % trimmed <b>core</b> <b>inflations</b> for Angola and to identify its implications for decision-making. Using both a traditional univariate method and non-parametric approach, our results suggest the presence of a statistically significant level of persistence in five inflation indicators for Angola. Moreover, the degree of persistence is similar both across the five inflation indicators and also across the sample period. Finally, our results also confirm that extracting the most volatile components of the headline inflation indicator does not generate a new inflation indicator that is less volatile and more persistent than the original. These results have important implications for the design, the implementations and the effectiveness of the monetary policy, specialty when under an inflation targeting regime. First, since shocks tend to temporarily deviate inflation from its trend value a permanent policy stance is required. Secondly, a low degree of persistence means that monetary policy aiming price stability can only be implemented in a favorable setting with a permanent policy stance. Moreover, a low degree of persistence means that inflation can be stabilized in a short period time following a shock. Finally results are also relevant for prediction and modeling purposes.

We find that the permanent component of core CPI is more volatile than core CPI, or that the permanent and transitory components are highly correlated. We find that the excluded food and energy components have important permanent components, and that core CPI has an important transitory component.

It turns out that, according to usual statistical criteria, the combination of several indicators -in particular those derived from surveys- provides better results than dynamic factor models, even after pre-selection of the variables included in the panel. However, factors included in VAR models exhibit more stable forecasting performance over time. Results for HICP excluding unprocessed food and energy are very encouraging.

40|$|This paper revisits {{a number}} of data-rich {{prediction}} methods that are widely used in macroeconomic forecasting, such as factor models and Bayesian shrinkage regression, and compares these methods with a lesser known alternative: partial least squares regression. In this method, linear, orthogonal combinations {{of a large number}} of predictor variables are constructed such that the linear combinations maximize the covariance between the target variable and each of the common components constructed from the predictor variables. We provide a theorem that shows that when the data comply with a factor structure, principal components and partial least squares regressions provide asymptotically similar results. We also argue that forecast combinations can be interpreted as a restricted form of partial least squares regression. Monte Carlo experiments confirm our theoretical results that partial least squares regression performs at least as well as principal components regression and rivals Bayesian regression when the data have a factor structure. These experiments also indicate that when there is no factor structure in the data, partial least square regression outperforms both principal components and Bayesian regressions. Finally, we apply partial least squares, principal components, and Bayesian regressions on a large panel of monthly U. S. macroeconomic and financial data to forecast CPI <b>inflation,</b> <b>core</b> CPI <b>inflation,</b> industrial production, unemployment, and the federal funds rate across different subperiods.

If the planet is within 0. 05 AU of the star, the dissipation of the stellar tidal disturbance within the planet provides a significant energy source. With sufficiently strong interaction, the planet may inflate in size as it adjusts to a thermal equilibrium. We determine the planetary size, moment of inertia, and the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy as functions of the tidal dissipation rate {{with or without the}} presence of a <b>core.</b> The <b>inflation</b> of its envelope intensifies the star-planet tidal interaction and accelerates the pace of the planet's spin synchronization and orbital circularization. We apply our results to three systems with short period planets.

Despite the secular perturbation by outer planets, the dissipation within the closest planet around Ups And does not lead to any significant size change today unless the planet has a relatively small Q value. But inflation due to tidal heating may have been important in the past when this planet evolved into its present dynamical state.

5000|$|Since {{there are}} many {{possible}} measures of the price level, {{there are many}} possible measures of price inflation. Most frequently, the term [...] "inflation" [...] refers to a rise in a broad price index representing the overall price level {{for goods and services}} in the economy. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) and the GDP deflator are some examples of broad price indices. However, [...] "inflation" [...] may also be used to describe a rising price level within a narrower set of assets, goods or services within the economy, such as commodities (including food, fuel, metals), tangible assets (such as real estate), financial assets (such as stocks, bonds), services (such as entertainment and health care), or labor. Although the values of capital assets are often casually said to [...] "inflate," [...] this {{should not be confused with}} inflation as a defined term; a more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation. The Reuters-CRB Index (CCI), the Producer Price Index, and Employment Cost Index (ECI) are examples of narrow price indices used to measure price inflation in particular sectors of the economy. <b>Core</b> <b>inflation</b> is a measure of inflation for a subset of consumer prices that excludes food and energy prices, which rise and fall more than other prices in the short term.

In contrast, this correlation is largely absent for the five countries that maintained explicit inflation objectives over this period, indicating that these central banks have been reasonably successful in delinking expectations from realized inflation.
