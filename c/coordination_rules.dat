When queried about the commercial, Jeb Bush protested that “He didn’t know brother was doing that” and was “righteous in making sure there’s no coordination.” Given the nature of their relationship, some have found it difficult to believe that Jeb Bush had no role or influence in recruiting his brother to make the ad, and thus, contravened campaign finance <b>coordination</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

Such systems give opportunities to the local relational database management system to exchange data with other nodes in a p 2 p environment. The databases systems in p 2 p are completely autonomous, heterogeneous and independent, each maintaining its own data. We would like to use these databases to answer complex queries that go beyond the keyword searches. To accomplish this, we use database coordination as managing semantic interdependencies among databases at runtime. We define database coordination in four basic notions: Interest Group, Acquaintances, Correspondence Rules and <b>Coordination</b> <b>Rules.</b> The work below is concentrated on implementation issues of the <b>coordination</b> <b>rules.</b> The <b>coordination</b> <b>rules</b> specify under what conditions, when and where to propagate queries in a decentralized environment.

Therefore, to increase the reusability of the applications and to increase the comprehensibility of SoS’s, suitable mechanisms are required to modularize the <b>coordination</b> <b>rules</b> and interfaces from the constituent applications.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the domain}} of {{software}} engineering, the use of software components is now a well established approach. However, it raises problems about the dynamic adaptation of these components to particular users demands. Indeed, these components have been developed {{with the intent to}} have a wide range of use, and so they implement functionalities which perhaps do not match precisely enough the demands of specific users. Therefore, we address the adaptation of the coordination between components by means of so-called Moderators. A Moderator is itself a coordination component managing interactions that are described and formalized using Petri nets. More precisely, we study the dynamic adaptation of the <b>coordination</b> <b>rules</b> by means of specific transformations of the Petri nets used to describe a Moderator. Safety properties must be enforced to maintain a consistent cooperation among participants with respect to the requested evolutions of the <b>coordination</b> <b>rules.</b> In particular, an adaptation of the Moderator can be considered safe if it cannot be detected by the participants. We present a computable criterion which enables to check such a satefy property automatically.

Although prior research emphasized that people use the equality rule out of efficiency concerns (as it helps to obtain the public good in the most efficient manner among group members), it may also reflect a true preference for fairness. More precisely, research examining emotional and retributive reactions {{as a result of}} a violation of the equality rule by a fellow group member showed that equality indeed is related to people's personal values and what they consider to be fair. The present paper suggests that a violation of the equality rule results in emotional reactions, and these emotional experiences encourage further retributive actions.

Rule-based scripts that assist and guide the modeller in model authoring are needed to enhance the level of usage of BIM. The authors developed a framework for incorporation of rule-driven domain knowledge into BIM authoring tools. With the objective of customizing the modelling process using a set of rules, the approach {{presented in this paper}} combines rules of modular coordination in prefabricated building with BIM. Modular coordination, a dimensional coordination system for sizing and placing building elements within a three-dimensional (3 D) reference system, is translated into rules that are incorporated into the BIM authoring tool through object-level and process-level interventions.
