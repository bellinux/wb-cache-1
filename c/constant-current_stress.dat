40|$|A {{new model}} that relates the {{degradation}} and breakdown phenomena of SiO 2 films has been presented. The {{crux of the}} model is that the trap generation rate {{is proportional to the}} energy lost by the electrons by interaction with the SiO 2 lattice. In this framework, the experimental evolution of the applied voltage in <b>constant-current</b> <b>stress</b> experiments and the quasi-linear relationship between log (time-to-breakdown) and log (current density) have been predicted...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{electrical}} characteristics and reliability studies on tunnel oxides fabricated by "wet N_ 2 O" oxidation of silicon in an ambient of water vapor and N_ 2 O at a furnace temperature of 800 ^oC. Tunnel oxides {{that have an}} equivalent oxide thickness of 67 Å are subjected to a <b>constant-current</b> <b>stress</b> (CCS) amount of - 100 mA/cm^ 2 using a MOS capacitor to obtain information on stress-induced leakage current (SILC), interface, and bulk trap generation. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the superior performance features of the present tunnel oxides with reduced SILC, lower trap generation, minimum change in gate voltage, and higher charge-tobreakdown during CCS studies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile studies of the tunnel oxide interfaces {{have shown that the}} improved performance characteristics and reliability {{can be attributed to the}} incorporation of about 8. 5...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} interfacial dielectric layers (IDLs) on the electrical properties of top-gate In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) thin film transistors (TFTs) fabricated at low temperatures below 200 °C, using a target composition of In:Ga:Zn = 2 : 1 : 2 (atomic ratio). Using four types of TFT structures combined with such dielectric materials as Si 3 N 4 and Al 2 O 3, the electrical properties are analyzed. After post-annealing at 200 °C for 1 hour in an O 2 ambient, the sub-threshold swing is improved in all TFT types, which indicates a reduction of the interfacial trap sites. During negative-bias stress tests on TFTs with a Si 3 N 4 IDL, the degradation sources {{are closely related to}} unstable bond states, such as Si-based broken bonds and hydrogen-based bonds. From <b>constant-current</b> <b>stress</b> tests of Id = 3 µA, an IGZO-TFT with heat-treated Si 3 N 4 IDL shows a good stability performance, which is attributed to the compensation effect of the original charge-injection and electron-trapping behavior...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{methodology}} for {{the characterization of}} Cu diffusion barriers, based on <b>constant-current</b> temperature <b>stresses.</b> For quite some time now, the Triangular Voltage Sweep (TVS) method has been under consideration for the qualification of Cu diffusion barriers. Cu-gate Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) planar capacitors are typical test vehicles, where the barrier layer under investigation is interposed between the Cu electrode and the capacitor insulator (e. g. oxide). The TVS method consists of I-V measurements under a linear voltage ramp, performed after Bias Temperature Stress (BTS) (1). For barrier evaluations, the MIS capacitor is first stressed at high temperature (e. g. 200 ºC) with a positive gate-to-silicon bias voltage, {{in order to promote}} drift o...|$|R
40|$|Lee, Yi-Mu. Breakdown and {{reliability}} of CMOS devices with stacked oxide/nitride and oxynitride gate dielectrics prepared by RPECVD. (Under the direction of Professor Gerald Lucovsky) Remote-plasma-enhanced CVD (RPECVD) silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride alloys have been proposed to be the attractive alternatives to replace conventional oxides as the CMOS logic and memory technology node is scaled beyond 100 nm. This dissertation {{is focused on the}} degradation and breakdown of RPECVD stacked oxide/nitride (O/N) and oxynitride gate dielectrics under <b>constant-current</b> <b>stress</b> (CCS) and constant-voltage stress (CVS). By monitoring the time-to-breakdown of the dielectrics, the device reliability can be determined and further used to evaluate the dielectric quality and the scaling limits of the dielectric thickness. It is found that the breakdown behavior of the gate oxide and RPECVD gate dielectrics is influenced by the degree of boron penetration, which in turn leads to increases in the gate leakage current. During electrical stresses, positive charges and hole trapping are generated at the Si/SiO 2 interface and also in the dielectric layer...|$|E
40|$|Damage in thin (10 nm) oxide {{layers of}} metal-oxide-semiconductor {{varactor}} cells caused by exposures with ions, electrons, and X-rays has been electrically characterized by <b>constant-current</b> <b>stress</b> time-dependent dielectric breakdown and capacitance-voltage measurements. The time-dependent dielectric breakdown investigations show measurable damage if the ions (H+; 74 keV) {{are allowed to}} penetrate the resist (300 nm PMMA) and the poly-Si layer (250 nm) to reach the oxide. This {{is not the case}} if the ions (H 2 +; 74 keV) are stopped inside the poly-Si layer by use of a thicker (450 nm) resist. Also for electrons and X-rays the exposure with lithographic doses did not change the time-dependent dielectric breakdown curves. The capacitance-voltage measurements demonstrate that electrons and X-rays which do penetrate the gate oxide cause a flatband voltage shift of nearly 400 mV. This shift could not be observed if the H 2 + ions were stopped in the poly-Si buffer layer. Ions seem to create no sec ondary effects like X-ray generation which reach beyond the penetration depth. The measurements were performed in the unannealed state to detect all possible damage effects including those which can be removed by annealing...|$|E
