5|$|Havana Moon is {{a concert}} film by the Rolling Stones, {{directed}} by Paul Dugdale. Havana Moon was filmed on 25 March 2016 in Havana, Cuba. The {{film is a}} recording of a free outdoor concert put on by the band at the Ciudad Deportiva de la Habana sports complex, which was attended by an estimated 500,000 concert-goers. The concert {{marked the first time}} a rock band had performed in Cuba to such a large <b>crowd.</b> <b>On</b> 11 November 2016 the film was released in multiple formats.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 2009, in a {{game against}} the Sacramento Kings, a bat descended onto the court at the AT Center, causing a {{stoppage}} of play. As the bat flew past, Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand. He then carried the creature off the court, earning the applause of the <b>crowd.</b> <b>On</b> 9 April 2010, the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three-year, $39 million contract extension through the 2012–13 season.|$|E

5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E
5|$|Queen Elizabeth II, {{escorted by}} Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, rededicated the {{restored}} memorial on 9 April 2007 {{in a ceremony}} commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. Other senior Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and senior French representatives, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin among them, attended the event, along with thousands of Canadian students, veterans of the Second World War and of more recent conflicts, and descendants of those who fought at Vimy. The crowd attending the rededication ceremony was the largest <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> the site since the 1936 dedication.|$|E
5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E

5|$|In England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener {{went for}} the hook shot. The ball flew in the air {{straight}} towards fine leg, where Hassett dropped {{the ball on the}} third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21. The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously gesturing to indicate that he was ready for the next catch, much to the amusement of the <b>crowd.</b> <b>On</b> 80, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316. Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|In November Cochet only {{competed in}} the Toussaint tournament, held at the Tennis Club de Paris, {{alongside}} Colette Rosambert with whom he lost to Jean Borotra and his more skilled female partner Helen Wills Moody. The year 1932 {{marked the first time}} Cochet slipped {{off the top of the}} charts after switching places with Vines. In June 1933 Cochet, seeded first, relinquished his French Championships title to Australian Jack Crawford, who overwhelmed him in the final in three straight sets, becoming the first non-French player to possess it. In July the French team lost the Davis Cup for the first time since 1927. In front of their home <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> the clay courts of Roland Garros, but without Lacoste and Borotra, the French team lost 3–2 to Great Britain. Cochet was defeated by Fred Perry and won against Bunny Austin, both in five sets. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships first-seeded Vines conquered Cochet, who was seeded third, in straight sets in the semifinal. It was the third time in a row that Vines beat Cochet. These events marked the end of the Four Musketeers era.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1884, Anfield was {{originally}} owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner {{who was a}} friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> match days. Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5–0. During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890–91 season.|$|E

5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic <b>crowd</b> <b>on</b> the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki, just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki, the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.|$|E
