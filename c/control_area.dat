5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution <b>Control</b> <b>Area</b> under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In many older stations, the fare <b>control</b> <b>area</b> is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new K-means {{clustering}} based {{approach for}} identification of voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> is developed. Voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> {{are important for}} efficient reactive power management in power systems operating under deregulated environment. Although, voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> are formed using conventional hierarchical clustering based method, but the present paper investigate the capability of K-means clustering {{for the purpose of}} forming voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> The proposed method is tested and compared for IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 30 bus systems. The results show that this K-means based method is competing with conventional hierarchical approach Keywords—Voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas,</b> reactive power management, K-means clustering algorithm I...|$|R

Just two species were sampled in the <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> Landfills enhance the incidence of exotic species.

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new <b>control</b> <b>area</b> would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for formation of voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> (VCAs) based on sensitivity of reactive power generations with respect to reactive power demands, together with bus voltage variations under contingencies. The load buses in geographically compact region showing similar sensitivity of reactive power demand to  reactive generations have been clubbed together to form voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> The voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> so formed have been modified based on voltage variations under contingencies at different loadings. Case studies have been performed on IEEE 14 -bus system. The VCAs formed by proposed method have been compared with VCAs formed by few existing approaches. The superiority of proposed approach of voltage <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> formation over few existing approaches has been established on the test system considered. </p...|$|R

5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare <b>control</b> <b>area</b> is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's opening, Downtown Flushing {{evolved into}} a major {{commercial}} and transit center, as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating {{to and from the}} station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World's Fair. Due to the high level of passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare <b>control</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} called Broadway–Eastern Parkway, {{named for its}} original exit on the extreme west end of the platforms. This entrance is now closed, though the street stairs and station house are still present. A second fare <b>control</b> <b>area</b> at Conway Street {{in the middle of}} the platforms was also closed, and was removed in the 2000s. The ironwork for the old Fulton El trackways can be seen under this portion of the complex from the platforms. Two staircases from each platform lead to the upper mezzanine of the complex. The mezzanine is above the platforms and connects to the Canarsie Line and to the exit at street level via two long escalators. At street level, there is a transfer to the underground IND Fulton Street Line and the fare <b>control</b> <b>area.</b> The upper mezzanine extends one-third of the length of the platforms and is made of concrete. Windows were once present, but are now cemented over.|$|E
