50|$|The Court of Criminal Appeal {{found that}} a {{miscarriage}} of justice had occurred, and {{that there had been}} a serious breakdown in communications between the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor,</b> the Garda Síochána (police) and prosecuting counsel.|$|E
50|$|He is son of Isidore Smart, {{a former}} <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor</b> of Trinidad and Tobago from 1965 to 1976. He {{attended}} {{the secondary school}} of Fatima College in Port of Spain from January 1958 to June 1964. Smart graduated from the University of Toronto with a BA in Economics. He is brother of Wayne Smart, a cricketer who played for the Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team.|$|E
50|$|Four months later, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, {{decided to}} seek a retrial in the case. In mid-November he {{released}} to the media a detailed six-page report dated 1 October, addressed to the attorney general, Michael McDowell, SC, which gave {{an account of the}} mistakes, failures and omissions in the offices of the DPP and <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor</b> and in the conduct of the case, which resulted in a witness for the prosecution being called against the wishes of the DPP. A DPP had never previously explained himself in a specific case in the office's 25-year history.|$|E
5000|$|Liz Allen quoted Fine Gael's justice spokesman, Jim Higgins, as {{stating that}} the {{establishment}} of this link between the case originally taken by Ms Phelan and the Wall case merited a judicial inquiry [...] "to investigate the role of Gardaí and the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office." [...] Higgins continued: [...] "There now {{has to be a}} full inquiry into the roles of all of the agencies involved, the role of the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office, the DPP's Office and the Gardaí must be investigated further. We must question the ability of these people to conduct their jobs when such gross incompetence occurred in the Wall case with regard to the inadvertent calling of Ms Phelan as a witness." ...|$|R
50|$|On 21 November 1999, Liz Allen, crime {{correspondent}} for the Sunday Independent wrote that the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office which dealt with the Nora Wall, case also dealt with a previous case involving a sexual assault allegation by Patricia Phelan, {{the woman who was}} later mistakenly called as a witness against Nora Wall.|$|R
50|$|The Sunday Independent {{obtained}} documentation dated May 1997, {{which shows}} that the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office wrote to the solicitor for the Kilkenny businessman in the case taken on behalf of Ms Phelan, providing a list of witnesses who had made statements which the state intended to use in its case. This list included the name of Nora Wall.|$|R
5000|$|The Plaintiff (Miss Kathleen Byrne) {{was walking}} on a {{sidewalk}} outside her home in Co. Wicklow on September 18th, 1965, when it subsided causing her an injury; a cable-laying team from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs {{had been working on}} the sidewalk. [...] Byrne sued the People of Ireland and the Attorney General for negligence, breach of statutory duty and nuisance {{as a result of the}} actions of the State's servants. After an intervention by the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor,</b> [...] "Ireland" [...] was substituted for the [...] "People of Ireland" [...] in the action. The case originally went to the High Court (Ireland) in 1968, which dismissed the Plaintiff's case with Murnaghan J. holding that Article 5 of the Constitution, where the sovereignty of the State is asserted, precludes actions where the State would be a defendant.|$|E
50|$|She {{qualified}} as a Solicitor in 1987, and was educated at University College Cork and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.·She was Chief Prosecution Solicitor (and previously Deputy) in the Office of the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions from 2007 until 2012. She joined the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor’s</b> Office in 1995, {{which is a}} constituent element of the Office of the Attorney General of Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|When {{details of}} the DPP's report on the blunders in the Nora Wall case were {{released}} by the Attorney General's office on 17 November 1999, there were no references to the documentation linking the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office to both cases. The report failed {{to explain why the}} DPP did not want Ms Phelan called as a witness. The DPP's statement said only that she was mistakenly called because prosecuting counsel [...] "failed to recall" [...] an earlier direction not to call her.|$|R
50|$|In the Patricia Phelan case in 1997 (in {{which she}} accused the Kilkenny businessman), Mr Justice McCracken {{carried out a}} High Court {{judicial}} review and decided that {{there should not be}} a trial. The state asked for time to consider whether it would appeal this decision, but three weeks later, the then DPP, Eamon Barnes, ordered the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office to return to court to say it did not wish to proceed any further with the case it was taking on behalf of Patricia Phelan and another woman.|$|R
50|$|On 12 November 1998, after O'Flaherty's intervention, Sheedy's {{sentence}} was reviewed before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, and not Judge Matthews, {{as would be}} the correct procedure. After the brief hearing Mr. Justice Kelly remitted {{what was left of}} Sheedy's sentence. Neither the gardaí nor the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) were told of the review or the fact that Sheedy was released. The only representation by the state was the appearance of a clerk in the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> office who saw a listing for the matter and brought the file to court but did not know for what purpose.|$|R
5000|$|A December 1997 written {{answer to}} a Dáil {{question}} showed over 1,000 cases settled across many units of the Defence Forces. The government adopted a strategy of contesting every claim until a 1997 Supreme Court decision. After this, the Law Society of Ireland facilitated negotiations between the <b>Chief</b> <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor's</b> Office and the Department of Defence on the one hand, and the main solicitors' firms representing claimants on the other, {{which led to a}} suspension of court proceedings while a Department of Health expert group developed a standardised metric for assessing hearing loss. This group's 1998 [...] "Green Book" [...] report informed the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998. Subsequently, the Supreme Court advised the government to assign standardised rates of compensation for the various levels of hearing loss. It also awarded compensation based on predicted future loss of hearing additional to normal age-related hearing loss; opponents criticised this as impossible to quantify. In December 1999, the Supreme Court accepted the government's formula of IR£750 per degree of deafness attained at age 60. This was the basis for the Early Settlement Scheme used for most claims. The average claim payout fell from €30,000 before the adoption of the guidelines to €10,700 in 2002, €8,900 in 2003, and €5,700 in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|In {{states in}} the United <b>States,</b> a <b>Solicitor</b> General is usually the top appellate {{advocate}} {{on behalf of the}} State, its executives and officials, and its legislature (sometimes referred to as <b>State</b> <b>Solicitor,</b> or Appellate <b>Chief,</b> depending upon the particular state).
