40|$|Becoming {{aware of}} errors {{that one has}} {{committed}} might be crucial for strategic behavioral and neuronal adjustments to avoid similar errors in the future. This review addresses <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> perception ("error awareness") in healthy subjects {{as well as the}} relationship between error awareness and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We first discuss the main findings on error awareness in healthy subjects. A brain region, that appears consistently involved in error awareness processes, is the insula, which also provides a link to the clinical conditions reviewed here. Then we focus on a neurological condition whose core element is an impaired awareness for neurological consequences of a disease: anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). The insular cortex has been implicated in both error awareness and AHP, with anterior insular regions being involved in <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> processing and more posterior areas being related to AHP. In addition to cytoarchitectonic and connectivity data, this reflects a functional and structural gradient within the insula from anterior to posterior. Furthermore, studies dealing with error awareness and lack of insight in a number of psychiatric diseases are reported. Especially in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) the performance monitoring system seems impaired, thus <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> perception might be altered...|$|E
40|$|To detect {{erroneous}} action outcomes {{is necessary}} for flexible adjustments and therefore a prerequisite of adaptive, goal-directed behavior. While performance monitoring has been studied intensively over two decades and {{a vast amount of}} knowledge on its functional neuroanatomy has been gathered, much less is known about <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> perception, often referred to as error awareness. Here, we review and discuss the conditions under which error awareness occurs, its neural correlates and underlying functional neuroanatomy. We focus specifically on the anterior insula, which {{has been shown to be}} (a) reliably activated during performance monitoring and (b) modulated by error awareness. Anterior insular activity appears to be closely related to autonomic responses associated with consciously perceived errors, although the causality and directions of these relationships still needs to be unraveled. We discuss the role of the anterior insula in generating versus perceiving autonomic responses and as a key player in balancing effortful task-related and restingstate activity. We suggest that errors elicit reactions highly reminiscent of an orienting response and may thus induce the autonomic arousal needed to recruit the required mental and physical resources. We discuss the role of norepinephrine activity in eliciting sufficiently strong central and autonomic nervous responses enabling the necessary adaptation as well as <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> perception...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and correct errors is {{critical}} to adaptive control of behaviour and represents a discrete neuropsychological function. A {{number of studies have}} highlighted that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with abnormalities in behavioural and neural responsiveness to performance errors. One limitation of previous work has been a failure {{to determine the extent to}} which these differences are attributable to failures of <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> awareness, a process that is dependent on the integrity of the frontal lobes. Recent advances in electrophysiological research make it possible to distinguish unconscious and conscious aspects of error processing. This study constitutes an extensive electrophysiological investigation of error awareness and error processing in ADHD. A Go/No-Go response inhibition task specifically designed to assess error awareness was administered to a group of adults diagnosed with ADHD and a group of matched control participants. The ADHD group made significantly more errors than the control group but was less likely to consciously detect these errors. An analysis of event-related potentials elicited by errors indicated that an early performance monitoring component (early positivity) was significantly attenuated in the ADHD group as was a later component that specifically reflects <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> processing (Pe). Dipole source modelling suggested that abnormal Pe amplitudes were attributable to decreased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Decreased electrodermal activity in the ADHD group also suggested amotivational insensitivity to performance errors. Our data provide evidence that neuropsychological deficits associated with ADHD can be exacerbated by error processing abnormalities. Error awareness may represent an important cognitive and physiological phenotype for ADHD...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the developmental trajectory of error monitoring. For this purpose, children (age 7 - 8), young adolescents (age 13 - 14) and adults (age 23 - 24) performed a Go/No-Go task and were compared on overt reaction time (RT) performance and on event-related potentials (ERPs), thought to reflect error detection (error-related negativity: ERN) and <b>conscious</b> evaluation (<b>error</b> positivity: Pe) of the error. RT on correct trials, variability of responding and percentage of errors decreased with age. The latencies of incorrect responses, compared to correct responses, were shorter in children and adolescents than in adults, indicative of developmental changes in impulsive response style. Groups did not differ in the ability to adjust response strategies after making an error (post-error slowing). The ERN amplitude increased with age, the Pe amplitude did not change with age. Possible explanations for the developmental changes in ERN are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Systematic judgements are {{decision}} processes whose {{procedures are}} accessed consciously by the individual; {{the same types}} of information used in heuristic judgements are also used in systematic judgements. In this process, all memory-relevant information is retrieved from memory and assessed deliberately to determine whether a memory is likely to have come from a specific source. Systematic judgements occur less frequently in source judgements because they are slow and require a lot of <b>conscious</b> effort. <b>Errors</b> occur due to a misassignment of the weight of certain aspects of memories: assigning high importance to visual information would mean that having poor details of this aspect would be cause for an assumption that the event did not happen or was imagined. Errors will occur if an individual's subjective logic leads them to perceive an event as unlikely to occur or belong to a specific source, even if the truth is otherwise. Simple memory decay can be a source for errors in both judgements, keeping an individual from accessing relevant memory information, leading to source-monitoring errors.|$|R
40|$|Research {{examining}} the neural mechanisms associated with error awareness has consistently identified dorsal anterior cingulate activity (ACC) as necessary but not predictive of <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> detection. Two recent studies (Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010; Wessel et al. 2011) {{have found a}} contrary pattern of greater dorsal ACC activity (in {{the form of the}} error-related negativity) during detected errors, but suggested that the greater activity may instead reflect task influences (e. g., response conflict, error probability) and or individual variability (e. g., statistical power). We re-analyzed fMRI BOLD data from 56 healthy participants who had previously been administered the Error Awareness Task, a motor Go/No-go response inhibition task in which subjects make errors of commission of which they are aware (Aware errors), or unaware (Unaware errors). Consistent with previous data, the activity in a number of cortical regions was predictive of error awareness, including bilateral inferior parietal and insula cortices, however in contrast to previous studies, including our own smaller sample studies using the same task, error-related dorsal ACC activity was significantly greater during aware errors when compared to unaware errors. While the significantly faster RT for aware errors (compared to unaware) was consistent with the hypothesis of higher response conflict increasing ACC activity, we could find no relationship between dorsal ACC activity and the error RT difference. The data suggests that individual variability in error awareness is associated with error-related dorsal ACC activity, and therefore this region may be important to <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> detection, but it remains unclear what task and individual factors influence error awareness...|$|E
40|$|When {{researchers}} began {{addressing the}} electrophysiology of <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> awareness {{more than a}} decade ago, the role of the error-related negativity (ERN), alongside the subsequently occurring error positivity (Pe), was an obvious locus of attention given {{the fact that they are}} taken as indices of cortical error processing. In contrast to the clear-cut findings that link the amplitude of the Pe to error awareness, the association between the ERN amplitude and error awareness is vastly unclear, with a range of studies reporting significant differences in the ERN amplitude with respect to error awareness, while others observing no modulation of the ERN amplitude. One problem in the studies obtaining null findings is the fact that conclusions are drawn based on small sample sizes, increasing the probability of type II error, especially given the fact that the ERN elicited using various error awareness paradigms tends to be small. The aim of the present study was to therefore address the issue of type II error in order to draw more certain conclusions about the modulation of the ERN amplitude by <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> awareness. Forty participants performed a manual response inhibition task optimised to examine error awareness. While the early and late Pe amplitudes showed the expected sensitivity to error awareness, the ERN results depicted a more complex picture. The ERN amplitude for unaware errors appeared more negative than that of aware errors, both numerically and on the grand average ERP. The unexpected findings were explained in terms of (a) latency issues in the present data, (b) characteristics of the manual response inhibition task used and the possibility that it elicits variation in neurocognitive processing, and (c), in relation to possible contamination by the contingent negative variation (CNV), an ERP component elicited during response preparation.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of emotion on response inhibition and error monitoring using event-related potentials. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to briefly presented threatening and neutral visual stimuli. Negative, arousing pictures improved behavioral performance by decreasing the stop-signal reaction time and increasing the inhibitory rate, but had no enhancing effect on inhibitory processing at the electrophysiological level (N 2 -P 3 complex). The perceptual processing of threatening stop-signals resulted in a larger and earlier N 1 component. The Pe component, associated with conscious evaluation or affective processing of an error, was stronger in negative than in neutral trials. The stronger Pe correlated with superior task performance in the emotional condition. Prioritized perceptual processing of the stop-signal was associated with better <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> monitoring. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} threatening, arousing stimuli improve behavioral inhibitory performance and error monitoring due to the enhancement of perceptual processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect an error in one 2 ̆ 7 s own {{performance}} and then to improve ongoing performance based on this error processing is critical for effective behaviour. In our event-related fMRI experiment, we show that explicit awareness of a response inhibition commission error and subsequent post-error behaviour were associated with bilateral prefrontal and parietal brain activation. Activity in the anterior cingulate region, typically associated with error detection, was equivalent for both errors subjects were aware of and those they {{were not aware of}} making. While anterior cingulate activation has repeatedly been associated with error-related processing, these results suggest that, in isolation, it is not sufficient for <b>conscious</b> awareness of <b>errors</b> or post-error adaptation of response strategies. Instead, it appears, irrespective of awareness, to detect information about stimuli/responses that requires interpretation in other brain regions for strategic implementation of post-error adjustments of behaviour.

40|$|The medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (MFC) is {{critical}} for our ability to learn from previous mistakes. Here we provide evidence that neurophysiological oscillatory long-range synchrony is a mechanism of post-error adaptation that occurs even without conscious awareness of the error. During a visually signaled Go/No-Go task in which half of the No-Go cues were masked and thus not consciously perceived, response errors enhanced tonic (i. e., over 1 – 2 [*]s) oscillatory synchrony between MFC and occipital cortex (OCC) leading up to and during the subsequent trial. Spectral Granger causality analyses demonstrated that MFC → OCC directional synchrony was enhanced during trials following both <b>conscious</b> and unconscious <b>errors,</b> whereas transient stimulus-induced occipital → MFC directional synchrony was independent of errors in the previous trial. Further, the strength of pre-trial MFC-occipital synchrony predicted individual differences in task performance. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} synchronous neurophysiological oscillations are a plausible mechanism of MFC-driven cognitive control that is independent of conscious awareness...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Subjective {{concerns}} of cognitive decline (SCD) often manifest in older adults who exhibit objectively normal cognitive functioning.

In the current study, we aimed to determine whether individual variability in <b>conscious</b> awareness of <b>errors</b> in daily life might mediate this subjective-objective relationship. METHODS: 67 cognitively-normal older adults underwent cognitive, SCD and mood tests, and an error awareness task. RESULTS: Poorer error awareness was not found to mediate a relationship between SCD and objective performance. Furthermore, non-clinical levels of depressive symptomatology were a primary driving factor of SCD and error awareness, and significantly mediated a relationship between the two.

Our study does suggest, however, that underlying depressive symptoms influence both poorer error awareness and greater SCD severity. Error awareness is thus not recommended as a proxy for SCD, as reduced levels of error awareness do not seem to be reflected by greater SCD. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life, error {{monitoring and}} processing {{are important for}} improving ongoing performance {{in response to a}} changing environment. However, detecting an error is not always a conscious process. The temporal activation patterns of brain areas related to cognitive control in the absence of conscious awareness of an error remain unknown. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain were used to explore the neural bases of unconscious error detection when subjects solved a Chinese anagram task. Our ERP data showed that the unconscious error detection (UED) response elicited a more negative ERP component (N 2) than did no error (NE) and detect error (DE) responses in the 300 - 400 -ms time window, and the DE elicited a greater late positive component (LPC) than did the UED and NE in the 900 - 1200 -ms time window after the onset of the anagram stimuli.

40|$|The error negativity (Ne/ERN) {{and error}} {{positivity}} (Pe) are 2 {{components of the}} event-related brain potential (ERP) {{that are associated with}} action monitoring and error detection. To investigate the relation between error processing and conscious self-monitoring of behavior, the present experiment examined whether an Ne and Pe are observed after response errors of which Ss are unaware. Ss were 12 female college students (aged 18 - 23 yrs). Ne and Pe measures, behavioral accuracy, and trial-to-trial subjective accuracy judgments were obtained from Ss performing an antisaccade task. Consistent with previous research, subjectively unperceived saccade errors were almost always immediately corrected, and were associated with faster correction times and smaller saccade sizes than perceived errors. Importantly, irrespective of whether the participant was aware of the error or not, erroneous saccades were followed by a sizable Ne. In contrast, the Pe was much more pronounced for perceived than for unperceived errors. These and other results are consistent with the view that the Ne and Pe reflect the activity of 2 separate error monitoring processes, reflected by the Pe, is associated with <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> recognition and remedial action.

40|$|Error-processing {{research}} has demonstrated that the brain uses a specialized neural network to detect errors during task performance but the brain regions necessary for conscious awareness of an error are poorly understood. In the present study we show that two well-known error-related event-related potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) have a differential relationship with awareness during performance of a manual response inhibition task optimized to examine error awareness. While the ERN was unaffected by the participants’ conscious experience of errors, the Pe was only seen when participants were aware of committing an error. Source localization of these components indicated that the ERN was generated by a caudal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while the Pe was associated with contributions from a more anterior ACC region and the posterior cingulate–precuneus. Tonic EEG measures of cortical arousal were correlated with individual rates of error awareness and showed a specific relationship with the amplitude of the Pe. The latter finding is consistent with evidence that the Pe represents a P 3 -like facilitation of information processing modulated by subcortical arousal systems. Our data suggest that the ACC might participate in both preconscious and <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> detection and that cortical arousal provides a necessary setting condition for error awareness. These findings may be particularly important in the context of clinical studies in which a proper understanding of self-monitoring deficits requires an explicit measurement of error awareness...|$|E

40|$|Nine Parkinson's disease (PD), seven olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) {{patients}} and two age-matched control groups learned a linear arm movement-scaling task over 2 days, requiring movements proportional in length to visually presented target-bars. Scaling was acquired through knowledge of results (KR concerning {{the direction and}} magnitude of errors) following every second acquisition trial. Initial acquisition of both groups was significantly worse than their respective controls (poorer movement scaling), but rapidly improved to nearly identical levels. Retention for the PD group's movement scaling {{was as good as}} controls initially, but markedly poorer after 24 h. The OPCA group did not show this deficit. Both patient groups extrapolated accurately to longer, previously unpracticed target distances (no KR provided), suggesting an unimpaired capacity to generate and use an internal representation of the movement scaling. They also rapidly learned a new scaling relationship when the gain was changed. Overall, the learning of this movement-scaling task was not adversely affected in OPCA, and the impairment was restricted primarily to longer-term retention in PD.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} self-monitoring {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with event-related potentials looking at both the error-related negativity (ERN) and error-related positivity (Pe). The ERN is related to early error/conflict detection, and the Pe {{has been associated with}} <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> evaluation or attention allocation. In addition, post-error slowing in reaction times (RTs) was measured. Children with ASD and age- and IQ- matched controls were administered an easy and a hard version of an auditory decision task. Results showed that the ERN was smaller in children with ASD but localized in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in both groups. In addition we found a negativity on correct trials (CRN) that did not differ between the groups. Furthermore, a reduced Pe and a lack of post-error slowing in RTs were found in children with ASD. The reduced ERN in children with ASD, in the presence of an intact CRN, might suggest a specific insensitivity to detect situations in which the chance of making errors is enhanced. This might in turn lead to reduced error awareness/attention allocation to the erroneous event (reduced Pe) and eventually in a failure in change of strategy to deal with a situation, as becomes evident from the lack of post-error slowing in the ASD group. This relates well to the perseverative behaviour that is seen in children with ASD. We discuss these results in terms of a general deficit in self-monitoring, underlying social disturbance in ASD and the involvement of the ACC...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to shed light on the {{respective}} contributions of three important action monitoring brain regions (i. e. cingulate cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex) during the conscious detection of response errors. To this end, fourteen healthy adults performed a speeded Go/Nogo task comprising Nogo trials of varying levels of difficulty, designed to elicit aware and unaware errors. Error awareness was indicated by participants with a second key press after the target key press. Meanwhile, electromyogram (EMG) from the response hand was recorded in addition to high-density scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). In the EMG-locked grand averages, aware errors clearly elicited an error-related negativity (ERN) reflecting error detection, and a later error positivity (Pe) reflecting <b>conscious</b> <b>error</b> awareness. However, no Pe was recorded after unaware errors or hits. These results are in line with previous studies suggesting that error awareness is associated with generation of the Pe. Source localisation results confirmed that the posterior cingulate motor area was the main generator of the ERN. However, inverse solution results also point to the involvement of the left posterior insula during the time interval of the Pe, and hence error awareness. Moreover, consecutive to this insular activity, the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was activated in response to aware and unaware errors but not in response to hits, consistent with the implication of this area in the evaluation of the value of an error. These results reveal a precise sequence of activations in these three non-overlapping brain regions following error commission, enabling a progressive differentiation betwee...|$|E
40|$|In {{what follows}} I begin by {{considering}} the paradox of <b>conscious</b> <b>error,</b> examining its role {{in a number of}} Tennyson’s early poems. I then look at Tennyson’s three major re-envisionings of “The Lady of Shalott,” which demonstrate his continuing fascination with this paradox as an essential element of artistic creation. The first rewriting occurred when Tennyson significantly revised “The Lady of Shalott” for republication in 1842. The revisions blur the distinctions between Shalott and Camelot and so reinforce the sense that the Lady remains an artist when she submits to the curse and quits her tower. The next two rewritings of the story both come in the 1859 volume, Idylls of the King. This, the earliest version of Tennyson’s great work, contains four episodes, the middle two of which, “Vivien” and “Elaine,” both revisit the story of the Lady of Shalott; in the completed Idylls, the same two poems, now retitled “Merlin and Vivien” and “Lancelot and Elaine,” remain together {{at the center of the}} poem. “Merlin and Vivien” picks up the image of the “bold seër … seeing all his own mischance” from “The Lady of Shalott” and makes him the principal figure of the story. In doing so, the idyll draws out the central action of the earlier poem, the conscious bringing on of the curse, to almost unbearable length. What in “The Lady of Shalott” might seem a momentary impulse is shown in “Merlin and Vivien” in extreme slow motion as a disastrously deliberate submission. “Lancelot and Elaine,” meanwhile, elaborates and expands the basic plot of “The Lady of Shalott,” as Tennyson noted himself. xvii This retelling of the story reinforces once again the lesson of deteriora sequor: the central characters clearly see the distress they are causing themselves, yet they carry on. In conclusion I look at one last “rewriting” [...] an unpublished poem in which Tennyson closely echoes the conclusion of “The Lady of Shalott” [...] in order to recall that not all poetic consciousness is consciousness of error. Far more often Tennyson was able to recognize that he had found the words he wanted...|$|E

30|$|DBQ (The Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire) is a self-report {{questionnaire}} {{developed by}} Reason, Manstead, Stradling, Baxter, and Campbell in the United Kingdom in 1990 {{as a measure}} of aberrant driving behaviours [1]. The original version comprises 50 items referring to drivers’ aberrations. Respondents are asked to rate on a six-point scale (1 [*]=[*]never; 2 [*]=[*]hardly ever; 3 [*]=[*]occasionally; 4 [*]=[*]quite often; 5 [*]=[*]frequently; 6 [*]=[*]nearly all the time) how often they experience specific types of aberrant driving behaviours. While the concept of aberrant behaviour implied in the DBQ scales has been used in the Czech setting, Reason’s original 50 -item questionnaire has not been translated into Czech and localized yet. The questionnaire primarily reflects the difference between two main types of aberrant driving behaviour: “errors” and “violations”). The main distinction between these two types involves the degree of planned action, or <b>conscious</b> decision. While <b>errors</b> are characterised by unplanned behaviour, the violation of traffic rules is an intentional aberration. Reason later added a “slips and lapses” scale characterised by attention and memory failures. Reason’s taxonomy is applicable to Keskinen’s Gadget model [2], where errors would pertain to the first two domains of the model (vehicle manoeuvring and mastering traffic situations), while violations would be associated with the other two domains (the goals and context of driving and goals for life and skills for living).

If the number of judges who can be confidently relied upon be in reality so small, it ought to follow that partial notice only, or neglect, perhaps long continued, or attention wholly inadequate to their merits--must have been the fate of most works in the higher departments of poetry; and that, on the other hand, numerous productions have blazed into popularity, and have passed away, leaving scarcely a trace behind them; it will be further found, that when Authors shall have at length raised themselves into general admiration and maintained their ground, errors and prejudices have prevailed concerning their genius and their works, which the few who are <b>conscious</b> of those <b>errors</b> and prejudices would deplore; if they were not recompensed by perceiving that there are select Spirits for whom it is ordained that their fame shall be in the world an existence like that of Virtue, which owes its being to the struggles it makes, and its vigour to the enemies whom it provokes;--a vivacious quality, ever doomed to meet with opposition, and still triumphing over it; and, from the nature of its dominion, incapable of being brought to the sad conclusion of Alexander, when he wept that there were no more worlds for him to conquer.|$|R
40|$|Before I {{begin the}} Requirements {{elicitation}} {{for the development}} of this App, it is important to formulate a plan on how I will elicit the necessary requirements. This will give me an understanding of the elicitation scope activity. It will assist me with selecting the correct elicitation techniques and help identify other resources that may be needed during the requirements elicitation. The requirements elicited will be for the Application that is to be developed. It is an Application that as a basic requirement will allow the users to record, store and retrieve personal health information. The Medella App is being developed primarily for the Business Owner but the reasoning behind its creation is for the benefit of other stakeholders i. e. the public currently there is no App that will allow general user store and retrieve all their personal health information. The App will display visual diagrams of related health issues to allow users to record and view information. The aim of the App to is give users control over their own personal health information. This will empower the user with the aim of encouraging user to be more health <b>conscious</b> and prevent <b>errors</b> occurring when interacting with medical professionals. Users will have the ability to view the history of Appointments or consultations they have attended. It will allow records to be created recording what has occurred during the Appointment/consultation and any actions that are required going forward. This will allow the user to review this information as they seem fit. If for instance a user attends an Appointment with one Doctor but for any reason has to visit another Doctor that they will have the record of {{what has happened in the}} user’s pervious visit. This will assist both the health professional and the user to ensure that the correct issues are addressed and assist in minimizing errors...|$|R
6000|$|It was not {{now to be}} {{hoped that}} the genius of Burns would ever reach maturity, or {{accomplish}} ought worthy of itself. His spirit was jarred in its melody; not the soft breath of natural feeling, but the rude hand of Fate, was now sweeping over the strings. And yet what harmony was in him, what music even in his discords! How the wild tones had a charm for the simplest and the wisest; and all men felt and knew that here also {{was one of the}} Gifted! [...] "If he entered an inn at midnight, after all the inmates were in bed, the news of his arrival circulated from the cellar to the garret; and ere ten minutes had elapsed, the landlord and all his guests were assembled!" [...] Some brief, pure moments of poetic life were yet appointed him, in the composition of his Songs. We can understand how he grasped at this employment; and how, too, he spurned at all other reward for it but what the labor itself brought him. For the soul of Burns, though scathed and marred, was yet living in its full moral strength, though sharply <b>conscious</b> of its <b>errors</b> and abasement: and here, in his destitution and degradation, was one act of seeming nobleness and self-devotedness left even for him to perform. He felt, too, that with all the [...] "thoughtless follies" [...] that had [...] "laid him low," [...] the world was unjust and cruel to him; and he silently appealed to another and calmer time. Not as a hired soldier, but as a patriot, would he strive for the glory of his country; so he cast from him the poor sixpence a-day, and served zealously as a volunteer. Let us not grudge him this last luxury of his existence; let him not have appealed to us in vain! The money was not necessary to him; he struggled through without it; long since, these guineas would have been gone, and now the high-mindedness of refusing them will plead for him in all hearts for ever.|$|R
40|$|Peripheral venous {{catheter}} is used {{to access}} the venous system. It {{is one of the}} most commonly used invasive procedures in health care facilities. This procedure falls within the competence and daily tasks of nurses. Therefore this type of nursing care is susceptible to risk of proceeding routinely which might result in <b>conscious</b> or unconscious <b>errors.</b> Peripheral venous catheter needs to be introduced into the patient's vein in the following cases: planned parenteral nutrition, infusion or transfusion therapy, application of intravascular medication or contrast media, rehydration, blood sampling (which can be performed immediately after introducing the peripheral venous catheter and before administrating medication) and also during an emergency care for critically ill (such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Nurses should be as knowledgeable as possible about this issue so that the peripheral venous catheter can be introduced well and fulfil its purpose. It is important to ensure that nurses obtain all the necessary information about their patients before inserting the catheter and that they are able to properly inform the patients about the procedure and to communicate with them. Next, nurses should be familiar with the correct procedure for inserting catheters, they should be informed about possible contraindications and know how to choose the correct type of catheter as well as where to place it. Furthermore, nurses should care for this vascular access correctly and provide the patient with enough information about taking care of the catheter after the procedure. Finally, nurses should be aware of their own potential errors and also of possible complications. Therefore they should employ aseptic technique so that they can eliminate nosocomial infections. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and an empirical part. The theoretical part focuses on the history of peripheral venous catheters and their types, indications and contraindications, necessary equipment, nursing care, complications, etc. The empirical part consists of a research. The aim of the thesis was to map the use of peripheral venous catheters in hospitals as well as to identify factors that may lead to problems among the patients with peripheral venous catheters. Four research questions were assigned to these aims. 1. What is the procedure prior to inserting a peripheral venous catheter? 2. What are the standards of caring for patients with an inserted peripheral venous catheter? 3. In which steps of caring for peripheral venous catheters do the nurses lack knowledge? What equipment do the nurses prepare in order to insert a peripheral venous catheter? The Bachelor's thesis was conducted using a qualitative research survey. The methods of collecting data included semi-structured interviews and participant observations. The research was carried out only in one hospital ward and it was anonymous. First, the data were collected by means of a semi-structured interview. The nurses were asked 14 questions (see Appendix 8). During this interview, several more subquestions were added. The results of the interviews were then grouped into several categories for the sake of clarity. The second method of collecting data was participant observation. The observed facts were recorded into an observation sheet (see Appendix 9). The same nurses who were interviewed were also observed. This Bachelor's thesis has been written in order to provide a basic overview of the peripheral venous catheters. It could be used as an information source for more experienced as well as novice nurses. The practical output of this Bachelor's thesis is a nursing care standard concerning peripheral venous catheters. This standard was missing in the hospital ward and could help the nurses to take care of these vascular accesses, to proceed correctly and eliminate possible errors (see Appendix 10) ...|$|R
