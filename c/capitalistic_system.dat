60|$|Now, this {{conception}} of Socialism as being ultimately {{a moral and}} intellectual synthesis of mankind from which fresh growth may come, sets a fresh test of value upon all {{the activities of the}} Socialist--and opens up altogether new departments for research. Let us face the peculiar difficulty of the Socialist position. We propose to destroy the competitive <b>capitalistic</b> <b>system</b> that owns and sustains our present newspapers, gives and leaves money to universities, endows fresh pulpits, publishes, advertises, and buys books; we have to ask, as reasonable creatures, what new media we propose to give in the place of these accidental and unsatisfactory methods of distributing and exchanging thought. It would almost seem as though current Socialism breathes public opinion as the Middle Ages breathed air, without realizing that it existed, that it might be vitiated or withheld. And so we are beyond the range of prepared and digested Socialist proposals here altogether. It is still open to the Anti-Socialist to allege that Socialism may incidentally destroy itself by choking the channels of its own thinking, and the Socialist has still to reply in vague general terms.|$|E
60|$|SOCIALISM, like {{everything}} else that is vital, is rather a tendency than a strictly definable body of doctrine. A definition of Socialism is sure either to include some views which many would regard as not Socialistic, or to exclude others which claim to be included. But I think we shall come nearest to the essence of Socialism by defining it as the advocacy of communal ownership of land and capital. Communal ownership may mean ownership by a democratic State, but cannot be held to include ownership by any State which is not democratic. Communal ownership may also be understood, as Anarchist Communism understands it, {{in the sense of}} ownership by the free association {{of the men and women}} in a community without those compulsory powers which are necessary to constitute a State. Some Socialists expect communal ownership to arrive suddenly and completely by a catastrophic revolution, while others expect it to come gradually, first in one industry, then in another. Some insist upon the necessity of completeness in the acquisition of land and capital by the public, while others would be content to see lingering islands of private ownership, provided they were not too extensive or powerful. What all forms have in common is democracy and the abolition, virtual or complete, of the present <b>capitalistic</b> <b>system.</b> The distinction between Socialists, Anarchists and Syndicalists turns largely upon the kind of democracy which they desire. Orthodox Socialists are content with parliamentary democracy in the sphere of government, holding that the evils apparent in this form of constitution at present would disappear with the disappearance of capitalism. Anarchists and Syndicalists, on the other hand, object to the whole parliamentary machinery, and aim at a different method of regulating the political affairs of the community. But all alike are democratic in the sense that they aim at abolishing every kind of privilege and every kind of artificial inequality: all alike are champions of the wage- earner in existing society. All three also have much in common in their economic doctrine. All three regard capital and the wages system as a means of exploiting the laborer in the interests of the possessing classes, and hold that communal ownership, in one form or another, is the only means of bringing freedom to the producers. But within the framework of this common doctrine there are many divergences, and even among those who are strictly to be called Socialists, there is a very considerable diversity of schools.|$|E
60|$|A third {{influence}} that may also contribute very materially to {{the reconstruction of}} the American tradition is the Socialist movement. It is true that so far American Socialism has very largely taken an Anarchistic form, has been, in fact, little more than a revolutionary movement of the wages-earning class against the property owner. It has already been pointed out that it derives not from contemporary English Socialism but from the Marxist social democracy of the continent of Europe, and has not even so much of the constructive spirit as has been developed by the English Socialists of the Fabian and Labour Party group or by the newer German evolutionary Socialists. Nevertheless, whenever Socialism is intelligently met by discussion or whenever it draws near to practicable realisation, it becomes, by virtue of its inherent implications, a constructive force, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose that it will not be intelligently met on the whole and in the long run in America. The alternative to a developing Socialism among the labouring masses in America is that revolutionary Anarchism from which it is slowly but definitely marking itself off. In America we have to remember that we are dealing with a huge population of people who are for the most part, and more and more evidently destined under the present system of free industrial competition, to be either very small traders, small farmers on the verge of debt, or wages-earners for all their lives. They are going to lead limited lives and worried lives--and they know it. Nearly everyone can read and discuss now, the process of concentrating property and the steady fixation of conditions that were once fluid and adventurous goes on in the daylight visibly to everyone. And it has to be borne in mind also that these people are so far under the sway of the American tradition that each thinks himself as good as any man and as much entitled to the fullness of life. Whatever social tradition their fathers had, whatever ideas of a place to be filled humbly and seriously and duties to be done, have been left behind in Europe. No Church dominates the scenery of this new land, and offers in authoritative and convincing tones consolations hereafter for lives obscurely but faithfully lived. Whatever else happens in this national future, upon one point the patriotic American may feel assured, and that is of an immense general discontent in the working class and of a powerful movement in search of a general betterment. The practical forms and effects of that movement will depend almost entirely upon the average standard of life among the workers and their general education. Sweated and ill-organised foreigners, such as one finds in New Jersey living under conditions of great misery, will be fierce, impatient and altogether dangerous. They will be acutely exasperated by every picture of plutocratic luxury in their newspaper, they will readily resort to destructive violence. The western miner, the western agriculturist, worried beyond endurance between the money-lender and railway combinations will be almost equally prone to savage methods of expression. The Appeal to Reason, for example, to which I have made earlier reference in this chapter, is furious to wreck the present <b>capitalistic</b> <b>system,</b> but it is far too angry and impatient for that satisfaction to produce any clear suggestion of what shall replace it.|$|E

5000|$|Carbon rift is {{a theory}} {{attributing}} the input and output of carbon into the environment to human <b>capitalistic</b> <b>systems.</b> This is a derivative of Karl Marx's concept of metabolic rift. In practical terms, increased commodity production demands that greater levels of carbon dioxide (or CO2) be emitted into the biosphere via fossil fuel consumption. Carbon rift theory states that this ultimately disrupts the natural carbon cycle and that this [...] "rift" [...] has adverse effects on nearly every aspect of life. Many of the specifics regarding how this metabolic carbon rift interacts with capitalism are proposed by Brett Clark and Richard York in a 2005 article titled [...] "Carbon Metabolism: Global capitalism, climate change, and the biospheric rift" [...] in the journal Theory and Society. Researchers such as Jean P. Sapinski of the University of Oregon claim that, despite increased interest in closing the carbon rift, it is projected {{that as long as}} capitalism continues, there is little hope of reducing the rift.|$|R

40|$|Charles Dickens’s {{critique}} of the defects of the British judiciary system in Bleak House (1852 - 53) derives from his own experiences as a law clerk trying to own copyright for his earlier works. According to Althusser, the state creates secure and protected lives for the individuals and warrantees their consent, using what he calls ideological state apparatuses. For him, {{the power of the}} state is maintained more subtly in <b>capitalistic</b> <b>systems.</b> Bleak House not only explicates how ideological state apparatuses devour and in fact falsify the rights of the individuals within the framework of the suit called Jarndyce and Jarndyce but also fictionalises many examples about the interpellation of the individuals by these social institutions in the Victorian Age. These apparatuses in fact interpellate individuals as fixed subjects, which means that they form the individual’s very reality and therefore appear as true or obvious. Two-narratored structure of the novel lays bare the ideological conflict though, thus it becomes evident that Dickens delibaretely blends in harmony the ideological inscriptions suggested by the first and the third person narrators of the work. The artfulness of Dickens is a means to display how ideologies change and shape people’s perceptions of reality. Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the suit which last...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{theoretical}} model to compare two different policymakers both facing tax evasion. Policymakers differs {{in that they}} aim to maximize either the fiscal revenues (T) as in a social-democracy as, e. g., Sweden, or the GDP as in a capitalistic country as, e. g., the USA. Both Bureaus can manoeuvre the tax rate and the share of tax receipts spent to fight the tax evasion rather than to increase the public capital. Our model merges the indications of two distinct, and sometimes conflicting, approaches {{to the analysis of}} tax evasion in that reconciling them. We also find that the feedbacks between the private and public sector are linked to some Laffer-type relationships usually unexplored by the existing literature. As compared to <b>capitalistic</b> <b>systems,</b> then, our results show that social-democracies end up imposing higher tax rates and, possibly, more pervasive regulations. Consequently, they are likely to suffer from larger tax-evasion-to-GDP ratios. This notwithstanding, social-democracies spend relatively more to contrast tax dodgers. On the other hand, T-maximizing governments have better institutional settings and greater employment rates. Whichever the preferred target, however, no policymaker is able to erase totally the tax evasion, which may explain why this latter is so pervasive and persistent even among the richest countries...|$|R

40|$|Economic and {{productive}} utilization {{of natural resources}} are central to fundamental Industrial Engineering science, whereas capitalistic corporate strategy is aimed at growth of shareholders capital investments made into <b>capitalistic</b> <b>systems</b> of organizations and industries. In this thesis it is established that Industrial Engineering principles are applicable, as a strategic tool, in the economic {{and productive}} utilization of corporate resources such as organizations within unrelated industries aimed at achieving the capitalistic corporate goal. In this expanded field of Industrial Engineering termed Strategic Industrial Engineering, scientific engineering knowledge is therefore applied to <b>capitalistic</b> <b>systems</b> with the strategic aim of accumulating capital for the corporate shareholders. The proposition of this thesis, termed A Strategic Industrial Engineering Philosophy, is primarily justified by applying the philosophical principle of sufficient reasoning. Secondary to this, scientific frameworks are proposed that support this expanded philosophy of Industrial Engineering by demonstrating {{the achievement of the}} capitalistic corporate goal. This is achieved through the following: [...] Setting return on equity (ROE) as the scientific measure of capital accumulation; [...] proposing a Strategic Industrial Engineering Process, aimed at achieving the capitalistic corporate goal, for further research. This process is based on the following: [...] - the relationship between the fundamental strategy and engineering processes; and [...] - fundamental corporate performance-regulating principles. [...] demonstrating the validity of these performance-regulating principles through explorative statistical analyses. The proposed Strategic Industrial Engineering Process, to be fully defined through further research, is illustrated in Figure 1. See figure 1 in 00 front Fundamental corporate strategies are proposed based on applying the Strategic Industrial Engineering Process as a strategic tool. These corporate strategies are based on the following, as indicated in Figure 2. [...] Organisational competitiveness [...] industry competitiveness; and [...] cost of equity. See figure 2 in 00 front In figure 3 it is illustrated that the following performance-regulating principles influence the accumulation of capital (ROE) for the benefit of capitalistic corporate shareholders. [...] The competitiveness of its individual organizations; [...] The individual organisations’ accumulation of capital relative to the cost of equity; [...] The competitiveness of the industry structures that the corporation is exposed to; and [...] Strategic fit benefits that improve the corporate performance too more than the average performance of its individual organizations. See figure 3 in 00 front A corporation’s accumulation of capital is influence by the positions of its individual organizations on the industry ROE life cycle. The proposed industry ROE life cycle is illustrated in Figure 4. See figure 4 in 00 front Lastly, the foremost intent with this thesis is to establish and demonstrate a specific way of thinking about the role of Industrial Engineering in corporate strategy.
