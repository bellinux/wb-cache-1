This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and <b>cowberry</b> (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the weather}} and the poverty of the soil, the plateau is mostly heath and bare dirt with only a few common juniper shrubs and some moor birches. The {{principal}} vascular plants one encounters are snowbed willow, Alpine bearberry, Alpine hawkweed, crowberry, <b>cowberry,</b> blue whortleberry and alpine azalea. But that which renders the vegetation of the Fulufjället plateau particularly unique in Sweden is its richness in lichens, with in particular the vast carpets of reindeer lichen and of fönsterlav, not affected there by the pasture of domestic reindeer, unlike most of the Swedish mountains. It is also in these inaccessible areas that one finds Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce [...] old, {{making it one of the}} oldest trees in the world.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the diversification of silvicultural strategies is a cost-efficient tool to ensure multifunctionality in production forests. This study compared the effects of continuous cover forestry and conventional rotation forestry on ecosystem services and biodiversity in boreal forests in Finland. We simulated over 25, 000 commercial forest stands for 100 years under continuous cover and rotation forest management. Forests without management were used as a reference. We compared the effects of silvicultural practices over space and time on ecosystem services, biodiversity indicators and multifunctionality. Our results revealed that continuous cover forestry was better than rotation forest management in terms of timber net present value, carbon sequestration, bilberry production, scenic beauty and the number of large trees. It provided higher habitat availability for indicator species dependent on deciduous trees and mature forest structure. Rotation forest management was better than continuous cover forestry in terms of harvested tree biomass, <b>cowberries,</b> mushrooms, and species dependent on high tree volume. In general, multifunctionality was higher in continuous cover forests than in rotation forests. Therefore, continuous cover forests may have a greater potential to produce simultaneously multiple benefits from forests. However, unmanaged forests often provided the highest levels of services and biodiversity making their role indispensable in delivering forest related ecosystem services and, especially, in the maintenance of biodiversity. Continuous cover forestry does not itself guarantee the maintenance of all ecosystem services and biodiversity in commercial forests but it can be an important part of a successful progression towards more sustainable forestry...|$|R

40|$|The {{boreal forest}} {{is prone to}} natural disturbances, {{especially}} fire. Despite this, the disturbance caused by forest management is shown to have a severe effect on the system’s biodiversity. Besides threatening rare species especially sensitive to clearfelling, forestry in Sweden and Finland is reported to negatively affect also common and functionally important plant species. A strategy that is proposed to halt these negative effects is the implementation of retention forestry. This measure is based on retaining dead and living structures during clearfelling and is meant to increase the heterogeneity of both managed stands and landscapes. Retained structures such as standing trees and forest patches are hypothesized to affect the restructuring process of the stand both by acting as lifeboats for and by promoting recolonization of forest species. In this thesis I {{examine the effects of}} retained forest patches on the dynamics of boreal forest ground vegetation in Sweden and Finland. As study systems I use an experimental set-up in East Finland as well as a normally managed landscape in Central Sweden containing both harvested stands and mature forest stands of different age. I show that retaining patches constituting as much as 17 % of the stand area does not affect vegetation dynamics over a whole stand. However, if the aim of the retention patches is that they should function as lifeboats that can secure that species survive in situ over the clearcut phase, also patches as small as 0. 1 ha can be effective. Such patches favour functionally important species like the dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus and the moss Hylocomium splendens. To effectively lifeboat more sensitive species however, the canopy openness and patch size is important. I. e. the red-listed orchid Goodyera repens does generally not survive in 0. 1 ha patches, probably due to poor microclimatic conditions. I also show that G. repens is, probably as a consequence of dispersal limitation, strongly associated with forest older than 120 years. The normal rotation time in Swedish forestry of about 100 years is thus problematic for this species. Finally I show that retention forestry in combination with prescribed burning can promote the production of bilberries (V. myrtillus) and <b>cowberries</b> (V. vitis-idaea). My results demonstrate that the application of retention forestry promotes both biodiversity and provisioning of non-timber products. However, in order to be effective, both level and type of retention need to match the specific goal of the measure...|$|R

50|$|But his {{interest}} in fungi was still strong. Living now {{on the outskirts of}} St. Petersburg along with his family Voronin often made excursions to nearby forests. During one of these excursions he noticed red spots on the upper side of some leaves of <b>cowberry.</b> After investigating thousands of plants with similar spots on their leaves, Voronin was able to describe a new species - Exobasidium vaccinii. On the basis of this fungus, a new family and order of fungi was established. Investigation of Exobasidium on the <b>cowberry</b> was carried on in the classic manner: developmental phases of the species were studied in detail, different sensitivities of flowers and leaves to the fungus was established and correlation between the age of plant and its receptivity was revealed.
