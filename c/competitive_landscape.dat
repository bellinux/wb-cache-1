Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.|$|E

The need to complicate management learning due to increased complication in <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes,</b> is analyzed. Four possibilities of addressing organizational topics in a complicated way are contrasted: the vertical, horizontal, hypertextual, and dialectical approaches. The promises of the dialectical approach are particularly stressed as a more demanding and potentially enriching path {{for the creation of}} knowledge about organizations. The test of the four approaches in a group of undergraduate students provides some preliminary data for analyzing the strenghts and weaknesses of our proposal. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} decade, both private organisations {{as well as}} public {{institutions}} have increased their combined efforts to foster the transfer of knowledge, in order {{to respond to the}} rapid change in their <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes</b> and the worldwide speed of innovation. Especially, the great significance of innovation is regarded as the catalyst for an extended orientation towards University-Industry-Relationships. Taken into consideration the global tendency towards a decrease in public research funding, the commercialisation of scientific research {{is one of the most}} critical challenges for innovative research and development. For the purpose of establishing efficient collaborations between industrial and entrepreneurial partners, researchers are required to incorporate the service dimension of their scientific work more strongly. S2B Marketing thereby helps to successfully commercialise research and strengthens the linkage between research organisations and industry.|$|R

In this pioneer research, we first find an important new pattern of globally interfirm connections: the inward {{private equity investment}} likes to promote Chinese firms’ outward venture, or an inward-outward linkage. Under this inward-outward linkage, after received investment from private equity, Chinese emerging MNEs are likely to restructure board, rebuild the top management team, reconfiguring resource, reframe the industry structure and alter competitive dynamics, thus, modify their strategies in outward ventures, such as accelerating the internationalization speed, locating more outward ventures in developed economies, and engaging complex entry modes, especially cross-border M 2 ̆ 6 As.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{emergence}} of cloud technology, its prevalence and accessibility to {{all types of}} organizations and its potential to predominantly shift <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes</b> by providing a new platform for creating and delivering business value, empirical research on the business value of cloud computing, and in particular how service providers create value for their customers, is quite limited.

This paper aims to address this research gap by exploring how cloud technologies are used to create business value and identifying factors that may impact the realization of business value. Drawing on four case studies that considers the perspective of both service provider and customer, this study takes a more comprehensive perspective of the business model concept in examining business value than {{has been done to}} date in the cloud domain, thus contributing to the limited literature surrounding the area...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop greater {{understanding}} about how organizations can continuously adapt as their <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes</b> continuously transform. Theories of organizational change emphasize episodic changes or slow transformation, but many organizations now face continued turbulence as their technologies, markets, and competitors shift unpredictably. I investigate the relationship between continual product innovation and repeated episodes of downsizing, two primary approaches for adapting to turbulent conditions that are often employed simultaneously, since an organization must introduce streams of new products to stay current with evolving markets, while at the same time must cut costs to respond to intense competition. However, downsizing and product innovation may be negatively correlated, which would create a significant tension in managing organizational adaptation. This research seeks to develop better theory for managing continual organizational adaptation by exploring how these potentially conflicting means for adaptation interact. Through product innovation, organizations can continuously adapt to turbulent conditions by strengthening their position with product enhancements, and exploitin...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{cultural}} industries {{is littered with}} successful incumbents who, fail-ing to see or respond to dramatic shifts in their <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes,</b> were re-placed by newcomers. In essence, cultural industries showcase how one dominant logic-the means and practices for achieving desired goals (Bacharach, Bamberger, & Sonnenstuhl, 1996; Prahalad & Bettis, 1986) -is replaced by an-other dominant logic. For example, early technology firms, which dominated the film industry from 1895 to 1911, dismissed the importance of films containing sto-ries and stars, only {{to be replaced by}} content firms that focused on stories and stars and attracted larger audiences (Jones, 2001). In publishing, firms shifted from a craft to business logic (Thornton, 2002), replacing CEOs and executives in doing so (Thornton & Ocasio, 1999). In the music industry, country music was ignored as a viable genre until new consumer tracking of products made explicit to deci-sion makers its popularity with consumers (Anand & Peterson, 2 (00).

We will focus on skills that enable individuals or subteams to take the initiative within a team context. We can start by distinguishing two advantages that teamwork provides over an individual acting alone: (1) The first advantage is based on bringing together complementary inputs, and derives from the coordination of multiple hands, eyes, heads, etc. to accomplish a complex task. Increased effectiveness comes from sharing of both physical and cognitive workload and through specialization of knowledge and skills.

40|$|It is well {{acknowledged}} that a non-negligible {{number of new}} business ventures, of any industry and country, are short-lived and don’t generate satisfactory economic performances and neither significant growth. In this chapter we claim that the adoption of an integrated perspective could shed {{new light on the}} deep causes of this phenomenon. In particular, the central idea {{of this study is that}} the performance gap of innovative new ventures mostly refers to the inappropriateness of their business models. To support our claim we analyze the business model evolution of three innovative new ventures. Our analysis reveals that in all the three cases the initial business models have been significantly changed over time to adapt to new contingent factors and to assure a better match with the market demand and the entrepreneurial objectives. Contrary to the well rooted idea that the market potential of innovative start-ups is reflected in its initial business model, as described in the business plan, our findings emphasize the role of the founding entrepreneur (or entrepreneurial team) in assuring – through the business model configuration - a continuous adaptation and fine-tuning of the new venture within uncertain <b>competitive</b> <b>landscapes...</b>|$|R
