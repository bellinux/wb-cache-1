When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing <b>costs,</b> <b>as</b> {{it was not}} directly competing on sales price.

We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper {{does not want to}} purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared for performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise <b>costs.</b> <b>As</b> was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{more than twenty}} steamships {{were a part of}} the fleet, {{including}} the 1112 ton Merimbula and the 693 ton Eden. Many of these vessels were purpose-built for the company's needs, and were constructed at shipyards both within Australia and abroad. The company's eventual demise came {{as a result of a}} number of factors, including increased competition from road and rail, the cost of replacing ships after World War II, waterfront disputes and rising <b>costs.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, after almost 100 years in operation, the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from the stock exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy.

The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E

5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation <b>costs</b> <b>as</b> products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{cumulative}} 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn.

The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware <b>costs</b> <b>as</b> the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational <b>costs</b> <b>as</b> it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E

5|$|With a short {{timeframe}} {{to complete}} The Wrath of Khans special effects sequences, effects supervisor Jim Veilleux, Meyer, Jennings, Sallin and Minor worked {{to transform the}} written ideas for the script into concrete storyboards and visuals. The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film's effects from spiraling {{out of control and}} driving up <b>costs,</b> <b>as</b> had occurred with The Motion Picture. Each special and optical effect, and the duration of the sequences, was listed. By the end of six weeks, the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) produced many of the effects, and created the new models; the Reliant was the first non-Constitution-class Federation starship seen in the series. Originally, the Reliant {{was supposed to be a}} Constitution-class starship identical to the Enterprise, but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between the two ships. As the script called for the Reliant and Enterprise to inflict significant damage on each other, ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models. Rather than move the models on a bluescreen during shooting, the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement. Damage to the Enterprise was cosmetic, and simulated with pieces of aluminum that were colored or peeled off. Phaser damage was created using stop motion. The script called for large-scale damage to the Reliant, so larger versions of the ship's model were created to be blown up.|$|E
