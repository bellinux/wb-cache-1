Not {{the least}} {{alarming}} {{of the proceedings}} of Mr. Fox and his friends in this session, especially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings with regard to France and its principles, is their eagerness at this season, under pretence of Parliamentary reforms, (a project which had been for some time rather dormant,) to discredit and disgrace the House of Commons. For this purpose these gentlemen had {{found a way to}} insult the House by several atrocious libels in the form of petitions. In particular they brought up a libel, or rather a <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> of libellous matter, from the club called the Friends of the People. It is, indeed, at once the most audacious and the most insidious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{purified}} rabbit bone stromelysin was investigated on proteoglycan aggregates from pig laryngeal cartilage. The enzyme caused a rapid fall in viscosity of proteoglycan aggregate solution (6 mg/ml), and {{the products of}} a partial digest (60 % loss of relative viscosity) and a <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> (95 % loss of relative viscosity) were characterized. Analysis by gel chromatography on Sepharose 2 B under associative conditions showed that 95 % of the glycosaminoglycans in the <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> were in small-sized fragments, whereas most of the hyaluronan-binding G 1 domain and link protein remained intact and bound to hyaluronan. In contrast, there was extensive digestion of the G 2 domain which resulted in 76 % loss in its detection by immunoassay. Analysis of the partial digest also showed considerable loss (40 %) of detection of the G 2 domain, but the glycosaminoglycan-rich fragments were much larger than in the <b>complete</b> <b>digest.</b> There was also much less cleavage to create small fragments containing the G 1 domain. This was evident on SDS/PAGE analysis where a 58 kDa G 1 domain fragment was abundant in the <b>complete</b> <b>digest,</b> but was only present in small amounts in the partial digest. There was also only very limited conversion of link protein from a 44 kDa form to a 40 kDa form. The digestion of proteoglycan aggregate (6 mg/ml) by stromelysin was unaffected {{by the addition of}} a high concentration of extra chondroitin sulphate chains (14 mg/ml), and the digestion of proteoglycan monomer showed that the G 1 domain was resistant to stromelysin digestion even when not bound to hyaluronan and link protein. The results show that stromelysin degrades the proteoglycan protein core with major cleavages close to, but not within, the G 1 domain, and extensive cleavage in other regions. Experiments with purified collagenase, a metalloproteinase structurally related to stromelysin, showed that it too cleaved proteoglycan at several sites within the glycosaminoglycan-rich region of the core protein. Metalloproteinase attack on proteoglycan thus not only occurs with stromelysin but also with collagenase...|$|E

40|$|Contigs {{have been}} assembled, and over 2800 clones {{selected}} for sequencing for human chromosomes 9, 10 and 13. Using the FPC (FingerPrinted Contig) software, the contigs are assembled with markers and <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> fingerprints, and the contigs are ordered and localised by a global framework. Publicly available resources have been used, such as, the 1998 International Gene Map for the framework and the GSC Human BAC fingerprint database {{for the majority}} of the fingerprints. Additional markers and fingerprints are generated in-house to supplement this data. To support the scale up of building maps, FPC V 4. 7 has been extended to use markers with the fingerprints for assembly of contigs, new clones and markers can be automatically added to existing contigs, and poorly assembled contigs are marked accordingly. To test the automatic assembly, a simulated <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> of 110 Mb of concatenated human sequence was used to create datasets with varying coverage, length of clones, and types of error. When no error was introduced and a tolerance of 7 was used in assembly, the largest contig with no false positive overlaps has 9534 clones with 37 out-of-order clones, that is, the starting coordinates of adjacent clones are in the wrong order.

40|$|AbstractA {{mixture of}} {{peptides}} from a <b>complete</b> tryptic <b>digest</b> of ubiquitin has been analyzed by ion mobility/time-of-flight mass spectrometry techniques. All {{components of the}} mixture were electrosprayed and ions were separated in the gas phase based on differences in their mobilities through helium before being dispersed into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for mass-to-charge analysis. The data show that ions separate into families primarily according to differences in their charge states and, to a lesser extent, differences in conformation. This approach reduces spectral congestion typically associated with electrosprayed mixtures and provides charge assignments for mass-to-charge ratio data. Gas-phase separations of ions appear to provide a new physical basis for characterizing components of biological mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Restriction mapping is {{the process}} of {{determining}} the approximate positions of restriction sites along a target DNA molecule. Multiple <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> (MCD) mapping is a protocol for constructing such maps in support of DNA sequencing. In the MCD mapping protocol, a clone library is generated which covers the region of interest with high redundancy. Each clone in the library is then completely digested multiple times, each time with a different restriction enzyme, and the lengths of the resulting fragments are measured via gel electrophoresis. This thesis describes an algorithmic method for constructing restriction maps from MCD data. The process is broken into two major steps. The first, clone ordering, is responsible for determining the order of the clone endpoints while simultaneously identifying bad data. The second, fragment identi [...] ...|$|E

The resulting restriction map has many potential applications in DNA sequencing and genetics. In this work, we present a heuristic for fragment identification, one {{step in the process}} of constructing a MCD map. We assume that we are given information about one or more complete digestions of a clone library covering the area to be mapped. From this data, we identify groups of restriction fragments on different clones that correspond to the same region of the target DNA. Maintaining certain constraints on the groups allows us to form a system of simple linear inequalities whose solution yields the desired map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic on real data provided by the Genome Center at the University of Washington...|$|E

40|$|Many {{computational}} {{problems in}} DNA mapping and sequencing involve determining the relative positions of DNA fragments {{derived from a}} target genome region. In the past, many such problems were approached by modeling the fragments as intervals on the real number line and computing the pairwise overlap relation among some or all pairs of intervals. The relative positions of the intervals could then be determined by an error-tolerant interval realization algorithm. In this paper, we present a new model for the problem in which the fragments are once again intervals, but instead of pairwise overlap we compute two alternate relations which we call the inclusion and span relations. We show that in the ideal case in which both relations are known exactly, they lead to an efficient algorithm for interval realization. We also demonstrate how our methods apply to a subproblem in multiple <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> mapping, allowing us to order the endpoints of clones accurately even {{in the presence of}} false [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{genetics}} now {{allows a}} molecular study of genomic regions previously analysed by genetic and embryological techniques. To simplify such an analysis, we {{have established a}} number of libraries of mouse DNA in Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC) vectors, constructed either by partial digestion with EcoRI, or by complete digestion with enzymes which cut rarely in the mammalian genome. In this paper we report the construction of <b>complete</b> <b>digest</b> libraries prepared from mouse genomic DNA using the rare cutter enzymes NotI and BssHII, and the detection of gene loci from the H- 2 complex, the t-complex, and other loci from the mouse genome. Due to their large insert size, YAC clones simplify the cloning of extended regions of the mouse genome surrounding known developmental mutations and should, after introduction into the germ line, offer a high probability of correct expression of the genes contained within the cloned region. We hope that this will allow the use of YAC clones to scan regions of interest such as the t-complex for specific genes by testing DNA introduced into transgenic mice for the ability to complement mutations localised to this region...|$|E
