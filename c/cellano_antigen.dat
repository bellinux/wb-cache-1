Blood groups represent antigens found {{on the surface of}} red blood cells. Kell blood group system consists of 31 antigens. Kell antigen (K) is present in 0. 2 % of the population (the rare blood group). <b>Cellano</b> <b>antigen</b> is present in more than 99 % (the high-frequency antigen). These antigens have a distinct ability to cause an immune response in the people after blood transfusion or pregnancy who, otherwise, did not have them before. Case Report. This paper presents a blood donor with a rare blood group, who was found to have an irregular antibody against red blood cells by indirect antiglobulin test. Further testing determined the specificity of antibody to be anti-Cellano. The detected antibody was found in high titers (1024) with erythrocyte phenotype Kell-Cellano+. The blood donor was found to have a rare blood group KellKell. This donor was excluded from further blood donation. It is difficult to find compatible blood for a person who has developed an antibody to the high-frequency antigen. The donorâ€™s family members were tested and <b>Cellano</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected in her husband and child. A potential blood donor was not found among the family members. There was only one blood donor in the Register of blood donors who was compatible in the ABO and Kell blood group system. Conclusion. For the successful management of blood transfusion it is necessary to establish a unified national register of donors of rare blood groups and cooperate with the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol with the database that registers donors of rare blood groups from around the world...|$|E

U. and Dib antigen site {{numbers and}} ultrastructural {{distribution}} {{patterns on the}} human erythrocyte membrane were determined using quantitative immunoferritin microscopy. For homozygous antigen-positive red cells. {{the average number of}} determinants per red cell was about 1 4, 000 for Jk, 1 7, 000 for Fy and Fyb, 1 9, 000 for Dib, and 23, 000 for the U antigen. assuming that the equilibrium binding observed represented 80 % saturation of the accessible antigen sites. The site numbers for this group of antigens were less than that for the Rh antigens. but considerably more than the Kell and <b>Cellano</b> <b>antigens.</b> The technique used was capable of demonstrating a twofold difference in antigen density between heterozygous and homozygous Fy (a +) red cells. More than 85 % of the Fy and Fyb antigen sites were lost following pretreatment of the red cells with papain. consistent with the serologic lability of the Fy antigens following proteolysis. The ferritin distribution observed following conjugate staining of antibody-sensitized ghost membranes was similar for all five antigens studied and showed a random, clustered ferritin pattern. Although the quantitative estimates are valid, the remarkable similarity in antigen distribution pattern for this diverse group of antigens, as well as other considerations. suggest that the findings with ghost membranes probably do not reflect faithfully the antigen arrangement on the intact red cell membrane.
