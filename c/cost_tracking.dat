40|$|The assets under {{management}} in the financial product Exchange Traded Funds has been steadily rising the past years. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to identify if Exchange Traded Funds are a suitable asset class for private investors and how this asset class {{can be applied to}} special investment strategies. Particular emphasis is placed on criteria of private investors to choose their capital investment and an analysis of ETFs in terms of performance, <b>cost,</b> <b>tracking</b> error and risk. A survey on 356 German custodians revealed the most important criteria for capital investment as capital security, comprehensibility and profitability. The 84 analyzed ETFs showed differences in terms of performance, <b>cost,</b> <b>tracking</b> error and risk depending on the geographic region of the index the ETFs track. ETFs tracking indices of industrialized nations perform more steadily, are less volatile, cost less and track their indices more precisely than ETFs tracking developing or emerging countries’ markets. Due to the fact that ETFs are diversified in itself and established as special funds, they are secure investment products. They are easily understandable and can have a steady return. Those results indicate that ETFs are a suitable asset class for private investors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Increasing {{energetic}} {{efficiency of}} {{solar power plants}} implies high technological and scientific efforts every year. A significant efficiency increase of these systems can be also obtained by optimal exposure of the panels to the sunlight, by using automatic solar trackers.

In the current paper we propose a low <b>cost</b> <b>tracking</b> procedure, based on amplitude comparison method and a special signal microdetector, made with MEMS technology. The procedure permits simple rotations of the panel based on complete tracking, by azimuth and elevation. The possible regulation angle is in the range of 30 - 150 °...|$|E
