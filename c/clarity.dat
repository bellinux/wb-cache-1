5|$|Contemporary reviewers {{considered}} Fifty Years to be {{the best}} available biography of Neill. They largely praised its <b>clarity</b> and biographical detail and insight, but found the book's philosophical sections comparatively weak and the author biased, as a former teacher from the school.|$|E
5|$|One {{progresses}} towards flourishing and <b>clarity</b> through ascetic practices (ἄσκησις) {{which help}} one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – {{that have no}} value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice {{of living in a}} tub and walking barefoot in winter.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} began {{shortly after}} the release of Singles in August 2000 and took place in Los Angeles, California. The sales from Singles and the proceeds from Jimmy Eat World's European tour helped fund the album's recording sessions. Bleed American was produced by Mark Trombino. Trombino had already produced two of the band's previous studio albums: Static Prevails (1996) and <b>Clarity</b> (1999), and also produced Blink-182's breakthrough album, Dude Ranch (1997). The money budgeted for the record was insufficient. Trombino offered to work for free during the recording sessions, confident he would be reimbursed by the album's predicted commercial success. Some of the songs included in Bleed American had already been written and recorded during the <b>Clarity</b> sessions, but the band felt they were recorded too late to include them in that album.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} <b>clarity</b> of Nelson's {{intellectual}} contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted {{additional information about}} what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, completeness, and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure {{in the history of}} American education.|$|E
5|$|The Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC), {{founded by}} Marshall Rosenberg, has trademarked the terms NVC, Nonviolent Communication and Compassionate Communication, among other terms, for <b>clarity</b> and {{branding}} purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{route map}} shows the {{navigation}} in deep blue, (or green for the drained section), to {{distinguish it from}} the river, shown in light blue. Deep blue is normally used to represent navigable waterways, but is used here for <b>clarity.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the USDA, {{pesticides}} may {{be contributing}} to CCD. A 2013 peer-reviewed literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm bees and safer alternatives are urgently needed. At the same time, other sources suggest the evidence is not conclusive, and that <b>clarity</b> regarding the facts is hampered by {{the role played by}} various issue advocates and lobby groups.|$|E
5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of <b>clarity</b> concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, {{it is clear that the}} Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible questions that is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and <b>clarity.</b> Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater <b>clarity</b> as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E
5|$|Breaking Benjamin {{began working}} on a fourth album, titled Dear Agony, in 2009. It was the first album Burnley wrote while {{completely}} sober. In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and phosphenes following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain sober. Burnley acknowledged an improved <b>clarity</b> and coherence within Dear Agony due to his sobriety. The album cover features Burnley's brain scan, representing the recurrent themes on Dear Agony related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary critics gave {{mixed reviews}} of the DVD. Some were {{disappointed}} with the low quality {{and the lack of}} <b>clarity</b> of the videos, while others praised the collection for being a reminder of Madonna as the visual artist. Celebration: The Video Collection debuted {{at the top of the}} Billboard Top Music Videos and the top of the DVD charts in Australia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies across United States.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885– 1 November 1972) was an {{expatriate}} American {{poet and}} critic, {{as well as}} a major figure in the early modernist movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing <b>clarity,</b> precision and economy of language. His works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917–1969).|$|E
5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater <b>clarity.</b> When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{works have}} been widely {{acclaimed}} for their <b>clarity</b> of draughtsmanship and meticulous, well-researched plots. They have {{been the source of}} a wide range of adaptations, in theatre, radio, television, cinema, and computer gaming. He remains a strong influence on the comic book medium, particularly in Europe. Widely celebrated in Belgium, a Hergé Museum was established in Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In August 2000, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} the compilation album Singles through the independent label Big Wheel Recreation, which included B-sides and unreleased {{songs from the}} band up to that point. Later that year, they returned to Europe on tour, where <b>Clarity</b> was enjoying some success, especially in Germany. After this tour, they launched a new split, this time with Jebediah.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{diamonds}} {{are valued}} mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of <b>clarity</b> and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20tonnes annually) are unsuitable {{for use as}} gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as bort). synthetic diamonds, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3billion carats (600tonnes) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Monster began {{manufacturing}} and marketing USB and ethernet cables {{as well as}} power strips and power management products in 2009. It's been producing its own line of headphones since 2012 and also manufactures celebrity-branded headphones. Monster sells speakers under the <b>Clarity</b> and Katana brands and mobile accessories like an iPod dock and a line-up of Tron-branded products.|$|E
5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} <b>clarity.</b> When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of <b>clarity</b> about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, the BBC began to release {{existing}} audio of serials with missing episodes, with linking narration provided by former series actors such as Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Colin Baker, Peter Purves, and Frazer Hines. By December 2005, the soundtracks {{for all of the}} missing episodes had been released, albeit with copyright-uncleared music replacements where necessary (e.g., a Beatles song in Evil of the Daleks), slightly rejigged sequences for reasons of <b>clarity,</b> and with overdubbed narration.|$|E
5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and <b>clarity</b> in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and <b>clarity,</b> personal meaning, and each team member feeling like they have an impact.|$|E
5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's car had been let through two of them {{as he left the}} area. Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able to pass through the closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before <b>clarity</b> of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their <b>clarity</b> and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} {{is considered}} the first on Meiklejohn. Reviewers noted the <b>clarity</b> of Nelson's intellectual contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted additional information about what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, completeness, and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure {{in the history of}} American education.|$|E
5|$|The {{camera on}} the , also known as an iSight camera, can take 8-megapixel photos (3,264 by 2,448pixels) and record 1080p videos at up to 30frames per second with {{upgraded}} quality (30% better <b>clarity,</b> 26% better white balance, color accuracy) due to an additional lens, IR filter, a wider f/2.4 aperture, and Image signal processor (built-in A5).|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{prior to this}} time is largely {{the history of the}} ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people emerge with greater <b>clarity.</b> An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} that weekend's games {{improved}} the <b>clarity</b> of the ACC Championship Game picture, but did not decide it. Maryland improved their ACC record to 4–2and took the uncontested lead of the Atlantic Division. Florida State lost to Boston College that same day, which meant four teams were still able to secure the division title: Boston College, Florida State, Maryland, and Wake Forest.|$|E
5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, <b>clarity</b> and {{precision}} and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot's 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in D. H. Lawrence's animal and flower pieces. The rejection of conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E
5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and <b>clarity</b> into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of <b>clarity</b> and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and <b>clarity</b> {{of the units}} and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great <b>clarity,</b> incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate <b>clarity</b> of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
