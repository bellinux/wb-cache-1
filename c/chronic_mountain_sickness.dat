2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{approximately}} 140 million people who live at elevations above [...] have adapted to the lower oxygen levels. These adaptations are especially pronounced in people living in the Andes and the Himalayas. Compared with acclimatized newcomers, native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower hemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to <b>chronic</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> (CMS). These adaptations may reflect the longer history of high altitude habitation in these regions.|$|E
40|$|This article summarises {{the medical}} {{problems}} of travel to altitudes above 3000  m. These {{are caused by}} <b>chronic</b> hypoxia. Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> (AMS), a self limiting common illness is almost part of normal acclimatisation—a transient condition lasting for several days. However, in < 2 % of people staying above 4000  m, serious illnesses related to hypoxia develop – high altitude pulmonary oedema and cerebral oedema. These are potentially fatal but can be largely avoided by gradual ascent. Short vacations, pressure from travel companies and peer groups often encourage ascent to 4000  m more rapidly than is prudent. Sensible guidelines for ascent are outlined, clinical features, management and treatment of these conditions...|$|R

40|$|Acetazolamide is {{a useful}} {{prophylactic}} for acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> causing marked reduction in headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, etc. Improvements correlate with increased arterial oxygen concentrations, reduction in proteinuria and peripheral oedema and other objective measures of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> Evidence that Acetazolamide is beneficial for pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema is scanty because of the lower frequency of these severe forms of <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> Dexamethasone, used prophylactically, also reduces the symptoms of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> partly due to its euphoric effect. Use of Acetazolamide {{as a treatment for}} established acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> has been investigated. Large doses of Acetazolamide increase arterial oxygen levels over a few hours and this leads to a reduction of symptoms but data is limited and faster acting carbonic anhydrides inhibitors such as Methazolamide may be preferable in an emergency situation. There is no comparison of the effectiveness of Acetazolamide with other drugs used for treating acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> such as steroids and calcium channel blocking drugs. Also, there is no data on drug combinations which could have additive effects and thereby be more beneficial than individual drugs...|$|R

40|$|Background. Symptoms of <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> {{are due to}} hypoxia of the brain. The {{pathogenesis}} is complex, but acid–base disturbances certainly play a role. When arterial oxygen levels drop, hyperventilation is induced, {{resulting in}} a respiratory alkalosis. However, this alkalosis inhibits the hyperventilation necessary for maintaining oxygen pres-sure. We present {{a case of a}} patient with symptoms of <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> at relatively low altitudes, who appeared to have Conn’s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). Case. A 61 -year-old male with hypokalaemic hypertension presented with symptoms of <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> at relatively low altitudes. Hyperaldosteronism was suspected and lab-oratory results showed a non-suppressible aldosterone con-centration and a mild metabolic alkalosis. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. Treatment of aldosterone blockade by eplerone normalized blood pressure and the symptoms of <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> at low altitudes disappeared completely. Discussion. We suggest that in our patient with hyperaldos-teronism, the pre-existing metabolic alkalosis inhibited the central respiratory centre after relatively mild hyperventi-lation. Therefore, <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> in our patient could occur at a relatively low altitude...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of symptoms and signs of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> of the Swiss Alps. DESIGN [...] A study using an interview and clinical examination in a representative population of mountaineers. Positive symptoms and signs were assigned scores to quantify the severity of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> SETTING [...] Four huts in the Swiss Alps at 2850 m, 3050 m, 3650 m, and 4559 m. SUBJECTS [...] 466 Climbers, mostly recreational: 47 at 2850 m, 128 at 3050 m, 82 at 3650, and 209 at 4559 m. RESULTS [...] In all, 117 of the subjects were entirely free of symptoms and clinical signs of acute mountain sickness; 191 had one or two symptoms and signs; and 158 had more than two. Those with more than two symptoms and signs were defined as suffering from acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> At 4559 m 11 climbers presented with high altitude pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema, or both. Men and women were equally affected. The prevalence of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> correlated with altitude: it was 9 % at 2850 m, 13 % at 3050 m, 34 % at 3650 m, and 53 % at 4559 m. The most frequent symptoms and signs were insomnia, headache, peripheral oedema, and scanty pulmonary rales. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales were associated with other symptoms and signs and therefore characteristic of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> is not an uncommon disease at moderately high altitude [...] that is, above 2800 m. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales indicate severe acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness,</b> and subjects who suffer these should immediately descend to lower altitudes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> is a {{frequent}} and debilitating complication of high-altitude exposure, {{but there is little}} information on the prevalence and time course of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> in children and adolescents after rapid ascent by mechanical transportation to 3500 m, an altitude at which major tourist destinations are located throughout the world. METHODS: We performed serial assessments of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> (Lake Louise scores) in 48 healthy nonacclimatized children and adolescents (mean +/- SD age: 13. 7 +/- 0. 3 years; 20 girls and 28 boys), with no previous high-altitude experience, 6, 18, and 42 hours after arrival at the Jungfraujoch high-altitude research station (3450 m), which was reached through a 2. 5 -hour train ascent. RESULTS: We found that the overall prevalence of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> during the first 3 days at high altitude was 37. 5 %. Rates were similar for the 2 genders and decreased progressively during the stay (25 % at 6 hours, 21 % at 18 hours, and 8 % at 42 hours). None of the subjects needed to be evacuated to lower altitude. Five subjects needed symptomatic treatment and responded well. CONCLUSION: After rapid ascent to high altitude, the prevalence of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> in children and adolescents was relatively low; the clinical manifestations were benign and resolved rapidly. These findings suggest that, for the majority of healthy nonacclimatized children and adolescents, travel to 3500 m is safe and pharmacologic prophylaxis for acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> is not needed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of three different daily doses of acetazolamide {{in the prevention of}} acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> and to determine the lowest effective dose. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase along with a hand search of selected bibliographies. No language restrictions were applied. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials assessing the use of acetazolamide at 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg daily versus placebo in adults as a drug intervention for the prophylaxis of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> Included studies were required to state the administered dose of acetazolamide and to randomise participants before ascent to either acetazolamide or placebo. Two reviewers independently carried out the selection process. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers extracted data concerning study methods, pharmacological intervention with acetazolamide, method of assessment of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness,</b> and event rates in both control and intervention groups, which were verified and analysed by the review team collaboratively. DATA SYNTHESIS: 11 studies (with 12 interventions arms) were included in the review. Acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg were all effective in preventing acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> above 3000 m, with a combined odds ratio of 0. 36 (95 % confidence interval 0. 28 to 0. 46). At a dose of 250 mg daily the number needed to treat for acetazolamide to prevent acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> was 6 (95 % confidence interval 5 to 11). Heterogeneity ranged from I(2) = 0 % (500 mg subgroup) to I(2) = 44 % (750 mg subgroup). CONCLUSIONS: Acetazolamide in doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all more effective than placebo for preventing acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> Acetazolamide 250 mg daily is the lowest effective dose to prevent acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> for which evidence is available...|$|R

Compared to controls, subjects with acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> had lower nocturnal oxygen saturation (mean+/-SD 59 +/- 13 % versus 73 +/- 6 %), higher minute ventilation (7. 94 +/- 2. 35 versus 6. 06 +/- 1. 34 L x min(- 1)), and greater mean inspiratory flow, a measure of respiratory centre drive (0. 29 +/- 0. 09 versus 0. 22 +/- 0. 05 L x s(- 1)). Periodic respiration was prevalent but not significantly different among the two groups (apnoea/hypopnea index 60. 1 +/- 34. 6 versus 47. 1 +/- 42. 6 events per h).

40|$|Abstract Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> is the commonest acute high {{altitude}} illness occurring at {{high altitude}}. Its prevalence {{is dependent on}} the ascent rate, altitude achieved, physical effort required to reach the target altitude and pharmacological intervention undertaken by the tourists visiting high altitude areas.

40|$|Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> {{is common}} among not acclimatized persons {{ascending}} to high altitude; the underlying mechanism is unknown, {{but may be}} related to cerebral edema. Nine healthy male students were studied before and after 6 -h exposure to isobaric hypoxia. Subjects inhaled room air enriched with N 2 to obtain arterial O 2 saturation values of 75 to 80 %. Acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> was assessed with the environmental symptom questionnaire, and cerebral edema with 3 T magnetic resonance imaging in 18 regions of interest in the cerebral white matter. The main outcome measures were development of intra- and extracellular cerebral white matter edema assessed by visual inspection and quantitative analysis of apparent diffusion coefficients derived from diffusion-weighted imaging, and B 0 signal intensities derived from T 2 -weighted imaging. Seven of nine subjects developed acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness.</b> Mean apparent diffusion coefficient increased 2. 12 % (baseline, 0. 80 plusminus 0. 09; 6 h hypoxia, 0. 81 plusminus 0. 09; P= 0. 034), and mean B 0 signal intensity increased 4. 56 % (baseline, 432. 1 plusminus 98. 2; 6 h hypoxia, 450. 7 plusminus 102. 5; P< 0. 001). Visual inspection of magnetic resonance images failed to reveal cerebral edema. Cerebral acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> scores showed a negative correlation with relative changes of apparent diffusion coefficients (r=- 0. 83, P= 0. 006); there was no correlation with relative changes of B 0 signal intensities. In conclusion, isobaric hypoxia is associated with mild extracellular (vasogenic) cerebral edema irrespective of the presence of acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> in most subjects, and severe acute <b>mountain</b> <b>sickness</b> with additional mild intracellular (cytotoxic) cerebral edema...|$|R
