In this project, inspired by thephenomenon of {{the large number of}} cancellations in the ticket reservation system ofTaiwan Railway Administration (TRA) (according to Chen (2006), 57 % of internetand voice reservations are cancelled),we decide to figure out how big this behaviorwill impact TRA's operation and revenues using a mixture method of real data andsimulation models. Further, we will apply revenue management approaches to reducecancellation impacts and improve customers' satisfication. This project is scheduled to be finished in two years. During the first year, westart with the modeling of booking arrivals and the choosing behaviors of customersafter being rejected by the reservation system based on the data from TRA. Then wewill build a simulation model to calculate how much revenue is lost and how manycustomers are affected due to the high percentage of cancellation. During the second year, we plan to consider three strategies that are originatedfrom revenue management: <b>cancellation</b> <b>charges,</b> flexible booking limits and adjustedoverbooking mechanism. These strategies need to dynamically interact with the ticketreservation system to see their effects, so we will integrate them into our simulationmodel. Through this project, we hope to improve the efficiency of the ticketreservation system. 近來，有關盈收管理(revenue management) 的技術已不斷精進並且實際地運用到運輸服務產業，特別是在航空業。本計畫團隊有感於陳淑珮君(2006) 所指出有 57 %透過線上及語音訂票的台鐵旅客會在事後取消他們的訂票，所以決定深入去瞭解這麼大量的車票取消行為將會對台鐵的營運以及盈收產生何種程度的影響。我們預計運用台鐵訂票系統中的實際訂票資訊，結合具有動態模擬能力的電腦模擬模式來進行本計畫。此外，在建立了動態模擬模型後，我們也將運用營收管理技術中的幾項策略，來檢視其在降低取消行為衝擊以及改善顧客滿意度方面的效果。本計畫預定以兩的時間進行。在第ㄧ中，我們將首先利用台鐵的實際資料來模擬預訂車票顧客之到達模式，以及建立顧客訂不到票時的選擇行為模式。之後再建構電腦模擬模型來評估計算現有的預售票取消行為會導致多少盈收的損失，以及多少的顧客會受到影響而改搭其他班次甚至改搭別種交通工具。在第二中，我們準備參酌三種源於盈收管理技術的策略來改善前述影響及損失。這三類策略分別為:取消行為的收費、彈性的區段配票限制以及調整型的超額售票方式。由於這些策略都需要與售票系統做即時、動態的互動，所以也將結合前一階段建立的模擬模型來加以評估其效果。我們希望藉由本計畫的成果，能改善鐵路車票預售系統的效能...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{reference}} voltage generator {{is an important}} circuitry block in pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The function of the reference generator is to provide accurate {{reference voltage}}s to the ADC which are compared to the unknown input signal in order to convert analog data into digital. To maintain sufficient accuracy, the reference voltage generator often consumes {{a substantial amount of}} area and power in relation to other circuits on the integrated circuit. This project focuses on reducing the power and area required by reference voltage generators used for pipelined ADCs while maintaining the required accuracy. To minimize error in the ADC output, traditional reference voltage generator designs used for pipelined ADCs strive to keep variations in the reference voltages much less than a least-significant bit (LSB). This is accomplished using two different design methods. The first method is to use large bypass capacitors on the reference voltage outputs to minimize the glitches seen in the reference voltages when the residue stage capacitors connect to these outputs. The second method is to design the reference voltage output buffers to have a very low output resistance to prevent errors due to the average current drawn from the buffer. Both of these methods require a large amount of silicon area, and the second also requires a substantial amount of power to achieve the low output resistances required. This project proposes a design for the reference voltage generator that can save substantial area and power compared to the previously described traditional design. Rather than minimizing variations in the reference voltages, the proposed design described in this report allows the reference voltages to vary much more as long as they quickly return to their correct values. Analysis shows that this method requires far less area and power than traditional reference voltage generator designs. A second design technique also examined here employs signal-dependent <b>charge</b> <b>cancellation.</b> Through the use of replica residue stages, the charge injected by the residue stages into the reference voltage generator outputs can be made signal independent, thereby eliminating this source of error in the ADC output codes. In combination with the first design improvement, this signal-dependent <b>charge</b> <b>cancellation</b> allows the requirements on the reference voltage generators to be further relaxed, thereby saving even more area and power. This project presents an accurate 8 -bit, 1. 5 -bit/stage pipelined ADC Matlab computer model that has been derived from a pipelined ADC Matlab model previously developed by Professor Perry Heedley. This new model was used to verify the proposed reference voltage generator design, as well as the signal-dependent <b>charge</b> <b>cancellation</b> technique. Analysis of the new reference voltage generator design and the signal-dependent <b>charge</b> <b>cancellation</b> technique was also performed through Spice simulations of a previously designed 8 -bit, 1. 5 -bit/stage pipelined ADC previously designed by a team of graduate students at CSU, Sacramento. The end result was a design for accurate reference voltage generators for pipelined ADCs that have greatly reduced area and power when compared to conventional designs.

Such filters can have applications as pre-select bandpass filters capable of rejecting in-band interfering signals. I...|$|R

40|$|We study RR <b>charge</b> <b>cancellation</b> {{consistency}} {{conditions in}} string compactifications with open string sectors, by introducing D-brane probes in the configuration. We show that uncancelled charges manifest as chiral gauge anomalies in the world-volume of suitable probes. RR tadpole cancellation {{can therefore be}} described as the consistency of the effective compactified theory not just in the vacuum, but also in all topological sectors (presence of D-brane probes). The result explains why tadpole cancellation is usually much stronger than anomaly cancellation of the compactified theory (in the vacuum sector). We use the probe criterion to construct consistent six-dimensional orientifolds of curved K 3 spaces, where usual CFT techniques to compute tadpoles are not valid. As a last application, we consider compactifications where standard RR charge cancels but full K-theory charge does not.

30|$|Thermopower {{waves are}} a {{recently}} developed energy conversion concept utilizing dynamic temperature and chemical potential gradients to harvest electrical energy while the combustion wave propagates along the hybrid layers of nanomaterials and chemical fuels. The intrinsic {{properties of the}} core nanomaterials and chemical fuels in the hybrid composites can broadly affect the energy generation, {{as well as the}} combustion process, of thermopower waves. So far, most research has focused on the application of new core nanomaterials to enhance energy generation. In this study, we demonstrate that the alignment of core nanomaterials can significantly influence a number of aspects of the thermopower waves, while the nanomaterials involved are identical carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Diversely structured, large-area CNT/fuel composites of one-dimensional aligned CNT arrays (1 D CNT arrays), randomly oriented CNT films (2 D CNT films), and randomly aggregated bulk CNT clusters (3 D CNT clusters) were fabricated to evaluate the energy generation, as well as the propagation of the thermal wave, from thermopower waves. The more the core nanostructures were aligned, the less inversion of temperature gradients and the less cross-propagation of multiple thermopower waves occurred. These characteristics of the aligned structures prevented the <b>cancellation</b> of <b>charge</b> carrier movements among the core nanomaterials and produced the relative enhancement of the energy generation and the specific power with a single-polarity voltage signal. Understanding this effect of structure on energy generation from thermopower waves can help in the design of optimized hybrid composites of nanomaterials and fuels, especially designs based on the internal alignment of the materials. More generally, we believe that this work provides clues to the process of chemical to thermal to electrical energy conversion inside/outside hybrid nanostructured materials.|$|R
