5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the icy <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> Europa. The presence of the minerals {{may have been the}} result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with this}} perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit {{suggests}} the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> mostly anorthosite. The Moon rock {{samples of the}} flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron rich than that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the highlands of the Far Side, {{which may have}} formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few {{tens of millions of}} years after their formation.|$|E

5|$|What {{obfuscated}} me {{was not the}} Italian but the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> dead English, {{the sediment}} present in my own available vocabulary... You can't go round this sort of thing. It takes six or eight years to get educated in one's art, and another ten {{to get rid of}} that education.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{most other}} d-block groups, the {{abundance}} in Earth's <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant. Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only {{be present in the}} laboratories where it was produced.|$|E

50|$|Barytocalcite BaCa(CO3)2: Barytocalcite {{occurs as}} masses of buff {{coloured}} granular crystalline material, with <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> small euhedral to anhedral crystals in cavities.|$|R
50|$|Rapidcreekite is {{transparent}} and white to colorless. The mineral occurs as isolated clusters or pervasive <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> radiating sprays of acicular crystals up to 3 mm in length.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|Texas is {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The {{continental}} crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The Portland Basin {{is being}} pulled slowly apart between faults in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) {{on the west}} side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near Gresham further east. About 3million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin, {{stretched}} <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, cinders, and debris from these Boring Lava Field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.|$|E

60|$|The {{room was}} drab and dreary. The oil-cloth was worn {{into a hole}} near the door. Boots and shoes of various sizes were {{scattered}} over the floor, while the sofa was littered with children's clothing. In the black stove the ash lay dead; on the range were chips of wood, and newspapers, and rubbish <b>of</b> papers, and <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> bread, and <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> bread-and-jam. As Siegmund walked across the floor, he crushed two sweets underfoot. He had to grope under sofa and dresser to find his slippers; {{and he was in}} evening dress.|$|R
5000|$|US, Otto Mountain: At Otto Mountain, Baker, San Bernardino County, California, mottramite is {{generally}} seen as <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> botryoidal green to olive-green spheres {{in association with}} white vanadinite needles.|$|R
5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{enrolled}} at Harvard College {{as a second}} year student (sophomore) in August 1811, {{at the age of}} 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject. Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

50|$|The yellow encrusting sponge is beige-yellow {{and grows}} in <b>crusts</b> <b>of</b> up to 1 cm thick. It has small but {{distinct}} oscula {{which may be}} slightly raised {{from the surface of}} the sponge.|$|R
5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|The second {{campaign}} {{reveals that}} Kerrigan was not {{killed by the}} Zerg, but rather is captured and infested {{in an effort to}} incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg's cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the <b>crust</b> <b>of</b> the planet.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the migratory}} theory, ductal {{carcinoma}} in situ cells migrate into the lactiferous sinuses and the nipple skin. Cancer cells disrupt the normal epithelial barrier and extracellular fluid accumulates {{on the surface of}} the skin, resulting in the <b>crusting</b> <b>of</b> the areola skin.|$|R
