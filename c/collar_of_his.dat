25|$|On 1 December 1948 at 6:30am, {{the police}} were {{contacted}} after {{the body of a}} man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. He was lying back with his head resting against the seawall, with his legs extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette was on the right <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven Kensitas cigarettes, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.|$|E
500|$|He was {{questioned}} {{several times over}} the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as [...] "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell {{for the next two weeks}} and questioned on a number of occasions. Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators pulled on the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be electrocuted and executed. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} {{featured}} {{a game show}} element, Help the Aged, it was very similar in structure to Harry Hill. In the show, Hill wore a pale yellow, custard coloured shirt, with a giant <b>collar,</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> usual white <b>collar.</b>|$|R
6000|$|About a dozen persons, deemed {{worthy of}} confidence, were present, already; {{and just as}} the bride and bridegroom were about to take their places, Don Ferdinand hastily entered, {{carrying}} in his hand some papers which he had been obliged to cease examining, in order to comply with the wishes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> royal consort. The king was a dignified prince; and when it suited him, no sovereign enacted his part more gracefully or in better taste. Motioning the archbishop to pause, he directed Luis to kneel.

50|$|In {{the early}} years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{business}} career, big families came {{in the fall of}} the year to buy all their needs for the winter months, such as woolen underwear, a blue or black suit, and some stiff shirt <b>collars.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> good customers were people from the Brown settlement, between Morrisonville and Farmersville.|$|R
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt while Biedron {{sat in the back}} of a squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Shigenori Soejima made Yu {{with the}} idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him [...] "look cool." [...] The <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted [...] "the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little something to make him stand out {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] He made a [...] "baby face" [...] sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's [...] "special something" [...] and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist.|$|E
60|$|As {{for that}} lazy naughty boy at Chur, I doubt whether HE will like novels {{when he is}} thirty years of age. He is taking too great a glut of them now. He is eating jelly until he will be sick. He will know most plots {{by the time he}} is twenty, so that HE will never be {{surprised}} when the Stranger {{turns out to be the}} rightful earl,--when the old waterman, throwing off his beggarly gabardine, shows his stars and the <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> various orders, and clasping Antonia to his bosom, proves himself to be the prince, her long-lost father. He will recognize the novelist's same characters, though they appear in red-heeled pumps and ailes-de-pigeon, or the garb of the nineteenth century. He will get weary of sweets, as boys of private schools grow (or used to grow, for I have done growing some little time myself, and the practice may have ended too)--as private school-boys used to grow tired of the pudding before their mutton at dinner.|$|R

After a few more words addressed to Sab Than he turned to the other figure, from which the officers now removed the enshrouding silks, disclosing to my now comprehending view Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.|$|R
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E

5000|$|Because the CSM {{represents}} all of {{the enlisted}} soldiers in the command, CSMs assigned to units above brigade do not wear the <b>collar</b> insignia <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her career specialty (e.g., infantry, quartermaster, intelligence, inter alia), but instead wears the CSM (formerly [...] "branch immaterial") collar insignia. The insignia is a gold-color rendering of the coat of arms of the United States; like the branch of service insignia of all U.S. Army enlisted soldiers, it is placed upon a gold-colored metal disk, one inch in diameter.|$|R

So we took a cab, he gave the driver some directions, and we started. By and by we stopped before a large house and got out. I never had seen this man with a collar on. He now stepped under a lamp and got a venerable paper <b>collar</b> out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat pocket, along with a hoary cravat, and put them on. He ascended the stoop, and entered.

5000|$|Delle Colombe {{was born}} in Florence {{in the second half}} of the 16th century. A date of January 20, 1565 has been suggested, but the source for this is unknown.

He became a member of the Accademia Fiorentina when Francesco Nori was its consul and was also a member of the Consiglio dei Dugento, the {{advisory}} body to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was said to be tall and very thin with a long white beard, a little bald head and sunken eyes. He wore a fleece jacket and a large <b>collar.</b> Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearance and his lonely and melancholy character he was nicknamed 'the Superintendent of Limbo' by the satirical poet Francesco Ruspoli. [...] One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers, Raffaello delle Colombe (1557-1627), was the Dominican Prior of Santa Maria Novella, who denounced Galileo from his pulpit.|$|R
60|$|The Reisenburg {{army was}} the best {{appointed}} in Europe. Never were men seen with breasts more plumply padded, mustachios better trained, or such spotless gaiters.

The affair was {{to be of the}} most refined nature, and the whole was to be concluded by a mock battle, in which the spectators were to be treated by a display of the most exquisite evolutions and complicated movements which human beings ever yet invented to destroy others or to escape destruction.
