40|$|India's {{energy demand}} is {{increasing}} rapidly with the intensive growth of economy. The electricity demand in India exceeded the availability, {{both in terms}} of base load energy and peak availability. The efficient use of energy source and its conversion and utilizations are the viable alternatives available to the utilities or industry. There are essentially two approaches to electrical energy management. First at the supply / utility end (Supply Side Management or SSM) and the other at the consumer end (Demand Side Management or DSM). This work is based on Supply Side Management (SSM) protocol and consists of design, fabrication and testing of a control device that will be able to automatically regulate the power flow to an individual consumer's premise. This control device can monitor the overuse of electricity (above the connected load or contracted demand) by the individual consumers. The present project work specially emphasizes on <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> of every consumer and tries to reduce the use beyond the <b>contract</b> <b>demand.</b> This control unit design includes both software and hardware work and designed for 0. 5 kW <b>contract</b> <b>demand.</b> The device is tested in laboratory and reveals its potential use in the field...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{contracts}} {{have been}} often advocated {{as an effective}} remedy against market power in the electricity industry, but when <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> by risk-averse retailers facing increasing competition is considered, an inefficient level of bilateral agreements will emerge in equilibrium. We argue that contracts markets alone are not well suited to prevent the insurgence of anticompetitive practices {{and have to be}} complemented by active behavioural prescriptions or/and interventions. Among the pro-competitive regulation practices, we study the contractual obligation measures. Building on Green (2003 a), we examine whether and under what conditions such measures would retrieve marginal cost pricing in the spot market, under alternative regulatory scenarios. We discuss in particular the trade-off between the pro-competitive and the crowding-out effects of the contractual obligation and drive several policy implications...|$|E

A farmer has pre-qualified a pool of potential clients, characterized by specific product mixes, prices, supply contract durations and farm workers requirements to prepare and deliver the order. The farmer is allowed to purchase products from surrounding farms to meet the contracts specifications, if the farm production is not sufficient. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model to maximize the profit of farm sales with production and workforce capacities.

40|$|Electricity {{generators}} in most deregulated markets simultaneously {{operate in}} both financial (contract) and physical (spot) markets. Decisions {{in each of}} these markets are not mutually exclusive, {{and in the case of}} imperfectly competitive scenarios generating companies can use their market power to influence spot and contract prices. A model of oligopolistic market equilibrium is presented where the relationship between physical and financial markets is based on the impact spot prices and the variance of spot prices have on <b>contract</b> <b>demand.</b> Risk averse consumers are assumed to maximise a mean-variance utility in purchasing contracts, while risk neutral generators face uncertain input costs and compete with Cournot conjectures in the physical market. Results are presented that show incentives exist for generators to amplify cost variations/uncertainties in their quantity bids, in order to extract higher contract prices out of consumers. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which spot and contract market exchange co-exist. A contract consists of a delivery requirement between an upstream and a downstream party. Contract formation determines {{to a certain extent}} the probability distribution of the spot market price. This contract formation externality entails the removal of high reservation price buyers and various sellers from the spot market. The first effect decreases the expected spot market price when the number of contracts is small, whereas the {{decrease in the number of}} sellers and additional residual <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> increase the expected spot market price beyond a certain number of contracts.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{electronic}} marketplaces, we consider a single-product make-tostock manufacturing system that uses two alternative selling channels: long-term contracts and a spot market of electronic orders. At time 0, the risk-averse manufacturer selects the long-term contract price, {{at which point}} buyers choose {{one of the two}} channels. The resulting long-term <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> is a deterministic fluid, while the spot-market price is modeled as a geometric regulated Brownian motion that is correlated with the spot-market demand process. The manufacturer accepts or rejects each electronic order, and long-term contracts and accepted electronic orders are backordered if necessary. The manufacturer’s control problem is to select the optimal long-term contract price as well as the optimal production (i. e., busy/idle) and electronic-order admission policies to maximize revenue minus inventory holding and backorder costs. Under heavy traffic conditions, the problem is approximated by a diffusion control problem, and analytical approximations are used to derive a policy that is simple, and reasonably accurate and robust. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{electricity}} retail market in Japan was partially opened to competition in 2000, many government entities {{have sought to}} solicit competing bids for {{the electricity}} supply to their office buildings or facilities, encouraging competition between the incumbents and new entrants. However, in many cases, only the incumbent utility bids for the contract and the competitive effects are limited. This paper presents a statistical analysis of bidders' participation in competitive procurement. We employ several count data regression models to explain the number of bidders other than the local electric utility. Our {{results suggest that the}} number of bidders would decrease in response to an increase in the load factor, perhaps because the new entrants are less competitive in serving customers with high load factors as they do not operate low-cost base-load power plants such as nuclear power plants; It would increase along with the voltage level and <b>contract</b> <b>demand.</b> The results also indicate that new entrants are more likely to participate in the bidding process in large city areas.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to priorly estimate the maximum demand (MD) during the running slots. The forecasting of MD will help us to save the extra bill charged. The MD is calculated by two methods basically : graphically and mathematically. It will help us to control the total demand, and reduce the effective cost. With help of forecasting MD, we can even perform load shedding if our MD will be exceeding the <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> (CD). Load shedding is performed as per the load requirement. After load shedding, the MD can be brought under control and hence we can avoid the extra charges which are to be paid under the conditions if our MD exceeds the CD. This scheme is being implemented in various industries. For forecasting the MD we have to consider various zones as: load flow analysis, relay safe operating area (SOA), ratings of the equipments installed, etc. The estimation of MD and load shedding (LS) can be also done through automated process such as programming in PLC’s. The automated system is very much required in the industrial zones. This saves the valuable time, as well as the labor work required. The PLC and SCADA software helps a lot in automation technique. To calculate the MD the ratings of each and every equipment installed in the premises is considered. The estimation of MD and LS program will avoid the industries from paying the huge penalties for the electricity companies. This leads to the bright future scope of this concept in the rapid industrialization sector, energy sectors...|$|E
40|$|The nation's power grid, {{specifically}} the New York region, faces burgeoning energy demand and suffers from congested corridors and aging equipment that cost New York consumers millions of dollars. Compounding {{the problem is}} high-density buildup in urban areas that limits available space to expand grid capacity. Coincidently, these urban areas are precisely where additional power is required. DER in this study refers to {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) technology, which simultaneously generates heat and electricity at or near the point where the energy will be consumed. There are multiple CHP options available that, combined with a portfolio of other building energy efficiency (EE) strategies, can help achieve a more efficient supply-demand balance than what the grid can currently provide. As an alternative to expanding grid capacity, CHP and EE strategies can be deployed in a flexible manner at virtually any point on the grid to relieve load. What's more, utilities and customers can install them in a variety of potentially profitable applications that are more environmentally friendly. Under the auspices of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory representing the Office of Electricity of the U. S. Department of Energy, Gas Technology Institute (GTI) conducted this study in cooperation with Consolidated Edison to help broaden the market penetration of EE and DER. This study provides realistic load models and identifies the impacts that EE and DER can have on the electrical distribution grid; specifically within the current economic and regulatory environment of a high load growth area of New York City called Hudson Yards in Midtown Manhattan. These models can be used to guide new policies that improve market penetration of appropriate CHP and EE technologies in new buildings. The following load modeling scenarios were investigated: (1) Baseline: All buildings are built per the Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State (No CHP applied and no EE above the code); (2) Current Policy: This is a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario that incorporates some EE and DER based on market potential in the current economic and regulatory environment; (3) Modified Rate 14 RA: This economic strategy is meant to decrease CHP payback by removing the <b>contract</b> <b>demand</b> from, and adding the delivery charge to the Con Edison Standby Rate PSC 2, SC 14 -RA; (4) Carbon Trade at $ 20 /metric tonne (mt) : This policy establishes a robust carbon trading system in NY that would allow building owners to see the carbon reduction resulting from CHP and EE...|$|E
