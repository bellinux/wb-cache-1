5|$|In 1984, Australia's Network Ten {{produced}} a television mini-series titled Bodyline, dramatising {{the events of}} the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham Warner, and Frank Thring as Jardine's mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, received several threatening and obscene phone <b>calls</b> <b>after</b> the series aired. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism.|$|E

25|$|Residents were {{subjected}} to a mix of mandatory and voluntary evacuations, depending on the projected path of a fire.

While this alert system was mostly effective, many residents in Rancho Bernardo received the <b>calls</b> <b>after</b> they had been driven from their homes.
