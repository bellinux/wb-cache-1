This approach is particularly relevant to guide conservation planning for species that show vulnerability to road networks in human-dominated landscapes. In this study, we measured the functional connectivity of the landscape in southern Portugal and examined how it {{may be related to}} <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> road mortality risk. We addressed three questions: (1) How different levels of landscape connectivity influence <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> occurrence in montado patches? (2) Is there any relation between montado patches connectivity and <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> road mortality risk? (3) If so, which road-related features might be responsible for the species' high road mortality? We developed a series of connectivity models using CS scenarios with different resistance values given to each vegetation cover type to reflect different resistance to species movement. Our models showed that the likelihood of occurrence of <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> decreased with distance to source areas, meaning continuous montado. Open areas and riparian areas within open area matrices entailed increased costs. We found higher <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> mortality on roads in well-connected areas. Road sinuosity was an important factor influencing the mortality in those areas. This result challenges the way that connectivity and its relation to mortality has been generally regarded.

To test if the same behavior is adopted by the <b>stone</b> <b>marten,</b> we used a combined data set of capture and radio-tracking data at three scales of analysis (1 -m, 25 -m, and 452 -m radius plots). We used compositional analysis to test if there were sex-specific differences in foraging and resting habitat use of <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> and if these patterns were affected by the presence of other mesocarnivores.

40|$|Reliable {{identification}} of species occurring {{in a given}} area is a basis of effective wildlife management and conservation. However, discrimination of species is often difficult, especially if two morphologically similar, rare and elusive species occur sympatrically. This {{is the case with}} pine marten Martes martes and <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> Martes foina, two closely related mustelids that have overlapping ranges throughout central Europe. Here we describe a genetic method that allows for distinguishing non-invasively collected samples (faeces or remotely plucked hair) derived from pine <b>martens</b> or <b>stone</b> <b>martens.</b> On the basis of the analysis of tissue samples of 31 pine <b>martens</b> and 26 <b>stone</b> <b>martens,</b> we found that the microsatellite locus Ma 18 - developed in another study for American marten Martes americana - differs substantially in allele lengths between pine <b>martens</b> and <b>stone</b> <b>martens,</b> thereby allowing a genetic distinction of these species. We propose combining the use of the locus Ma 18 with the second one described in the literature as having the same properties. The simultaneous application of these two markers allows for unequivocal species identification. To test the practical use of this method, we analysed 365 faecal samples collected {{in the vicinity of the}} town RogÃ³w (51 Â° 48 â�²N, 19 Â° 53 â�²E) in central Poland, where pine <b>martens</b> and <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> occur sympatrically. We successfully identified 78 scats of <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> and 155 of pine martens. We found that the faeces of both martens occurred inside forest complexes of the study area.

40|$|The {{structure}} of mesopredators' communities {{is complex and}} results from a multidimensional web of interactions such as top-down and bottom-up regulation or intraguild interactions. However, these interactions may change geographically along species' distribution ranges. The pine marten (Martes martes) and <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes foina) are 2 similar-sized mustelids with overlapping ecological traits and a wide distribution overlap. The absence of <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> from potentially adequate areas has been advocated as resulting from competitive exclusion by pine martens. Particularly, the preference of both species for mammalian rodents could be the main driver of such competitive stress. However, their elusive behavior and morphological similarity of their scats often precluded the evaluation of their ecological traits in areas of co-occurrence. Using camera trapping and diet analysis on genetically identified scats, we evaluated the interactions between pine and <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> in the southwestern limit of their range along 3 ecological niche dimensions: spatial, trophic, and temporal, under a hypothesis of competitive dominance of pine martens. We found no spatial segregation, and that coexistence was facilitated by seasonally adjusted shifts along the trophic and temporal axes. While both species often co-occurred, during the season of low food resources, pine martens exploited the less profitable feeding resource. Moreover, they not only displayed an activity pattern that limited their access to rodents, but also reduced the probabilities of direct encounters with <b>stone</b> <b>martens.</b> We suggest that the dominance position has changed {{in favor of the}} <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> in our study area, probably as a result of habitat quality and range edge effects. These findings support the relative instability of interspecific interactions among similar-sized species, which should be evaluated using multidimensional and site-specific approaches.

40|$|Background: Understanding the {{ecological}} consequences of roads and developing ways to mitigate their negative effects {{has become an}} important goal for many conservation biologists. Most mitigation measures are based on road mortality and barrier effects data. However, studying fine-scale individual spatial responses in roaded landscapes may help develop more cohesive road planning strategies for wildlife conservation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated how individuals respond in their spatial behavior toward a highway and its traffic intensity by radio-tracking two common species particularly vulnerable to road mortality (barn owl Tyto alba and <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> Martes foina). We addressed the following questions: 1) how highways affected home-range location and size {{in the immediate vicinity}} of these structures, 2) which road-related features influenced habitat selection, 3) what was the role of different road-related features on movement properties, and 4) which characteristics were associated with crossing events and road-kills. The main findings were: 1) if there was available habitat, barn owls and <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> may not avoid highways and may even include highways within their home-ranges; 2) both species avoided using areas near the highway when traffic was high, but tended to move toward the highway when streams were in close proximity and where verges offered suitable habitat; and 3) barn owls tended to cross above-grade highway sections while <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> tended to avoid crossing at leveled highway sections. Conclusions: Mortality may be the main road-mediated mechanism that affects barn owl and <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> populations. Fine-scale movements strongly indicated that a decrease in road mortality risk can be realized by reducing sources of attraction, and by increasing road permeability through measures that promote safe crossings.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} {{is generally considered}} to be the greatest threat worldwide to the survival of species. Habitat fragmentation is a process generally regarded as comprising three major components: reduction in total area, increase in isolation, and reduction in average size of patches of remnant natural vegetation. Today’s land use practices and road network’s expansion strongly promote habitat fragmentation reducing the habitat availability and its connectivity, which is assumed to strongly influence species occurrence and population survival in fragmented landscapes. Although several studies demonstrated the negative impact of habitat fragmentation, few focused in carnivore species, and particularly in Mediterranean environments. Carnivores’ position {{in the top of the}} food webs and their vulnerability to different human activities make this group especially significant in conservation and management actions. Our goal in this study was to assess the influence of human-related variables on the carnivore’s probability of occurrence, according to habitat patch size and isolation, and road network characteristics. <b>Stone</b> <b>marten</b> Martes foina was selected as the model species to investigate the response to cork oak woodland fragmentation, considering that forest dependent species would show a stronger response. Marten species are known to be sensitive to forest fragmentation, although there is some evidence that their response is mainly determined by the level of forest fragmentation and the matrix quality, due to their preference for structurally complex forests to avoid competition and increase den availability. We compared the <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> response to scent stations located in four large and continuous forest patches (mean 36000 ha, 19 sampling sites) and in 25 smaller and isolated forest patches (mean 2. 67 ha, one sampling site). For each sampling site a variable number of scent stations was used (average= 11, min= 7, max= 17) depending on the patch size. Using the software PRESENCE we developed models that best fit <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> probability of presence. This method parallels a closed-population mark–recapture model with an additional parameter (Phi) that represents the probability of species presence. Also, it enables the introduction of covariate information using a logistic model for Phi. Nine human and road related variables were used to develop models that best fit <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> probability of occurrence in the smaller and isolated patches. The best models were selected using the Aikaike Information Criteria. Each variable importance was assessed by summing the AIC model weights (w) in which it was included. A data set of eighty <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> road-kill locations and of eighty points randomly distributed along the sampled roads was used to evaluate if there were significant differences (one factor ANOVA), regarding the models’ most important variables on the road casualties locations. Results suggest that the probability of presence of <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> in larger and continuous patches was 90 %, while for the smaller and isolated patches it decreases to 60 %. Nine significant models were retained. Models evidenced that the probability of presence of <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> in isolated patches is related to cork oak density (+) (w= 0. 73), distance to nearest patch (-) (w= 0. 67), distance to nearest large patch (-) (w= 0. 56), distance to roads with medium/higher traffic volume (+) (w= 0. 37), and distance to riparian galleries (-) (w= 0. 12). Moreover, we detected that road kills were also significantly related to higher forest area surrounding the road (F= 7. 37, d. f. = 1, P< 0. 01) and also to the proximity of nearest forest patch (F= 8. 80, d. f. = 1, P< 0. 01). According to these findings, <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> seems to be negatively affected by habitat fragmentation being essential to promote good land management practices to guarantee a minimum area availability and well connected habitat patches through the establishment of suitable corridors for species movements. Furthermore, in road stretches close to cork oak patches, mitigation measures as wildlife passages ought to be considered in order to diminish the mortality rates. One should be aware that other forest dependent carnivores as genets Genetta genetta and wild cats Felis silvestris, the later of higher conservation concern and with decreasing density in the Iberian Peninsula, may respond stronger to habitat fragmentation than <b>stone</b> <b>marten.</b> This means that smaller and isolated habitat patches may become unoccupied, leading to species disappearance, being therefore highlighted the need to incorporate these findings in conservation action plans...|$|R

This study assessed population structure and inferred the influence of landscape features on genetic connectivity of two common but ecologically distinct carnivore species: the <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes foina) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). A comprehensive set of samples collected throughout mainland Portugal was analysed. Microsatellite markers isolated in the domestic dog were used for the red fox and a new panel isolated in this study was used for the <b>stone</b> <b>marten.</b> To assess genetic structure, a combination of Bayesian clustering, progressive partitioning and multivariate analyses was used. A reciprocal causal modelling framework (using partial Mantel tests) and multiple regressions on distance matrices were employed to evaluate the relationship between genetic versus geographic, barrier and landscape resistance distances. The results revealed a marked genetic structure in the <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> and, in contrast, a weak one in the red fox, and supported a detailed methodological approach that seemed reliable to distinguish potential subpopulations versus weak or incipient genetic patterns. A pattern of isolation-by-distance was detected in both species, as well as the importance of the rivers Tejo and Sado in shaping genetic connectivity in the <b>stone</b> <b>marten.</b> Conversely, no marked influence of land cover was identified for either of the studied species. The importance of the results from this thesis for the conservation management of the study species and other mesocarnivores in the Iberian Peninsula is discussed.
