40|$|Language {{teaching}} researchers {{highlight the}} role of critical reflection, interaction and decision-making {{in the process of}} ‘autonomisation’ where learners experience autonomy in order to become more autonomous (Little, 2003). Distance educators have long been concerned to develop learners’ <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> and control their own learning in a context where course materials have to anticipate a wide variety of potential learning needs and cater for students working in isolation. More recently, interaction has taken an increasingly significant role in distance education, aided by technological developments. This paper examines the experience of the Open University (UK) Department of Languages in responding to the challenges of ‘autonomisation’ in distance education courses for adult learners of French, German and Spanish, and considers the issues which still need to be addressed by course writers and researchers...|$|E

These procedures deny the students the knowledge of theoretical principles involved in the techniques used in their professional works. In this work we evaluate the idea of implementing small biochemistry modules in technical education in order to assist the formation of professionals with better <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions.</b> For such, a good theoretical knowledge is {{the base of the}} practical procedures to give the students enough security and independence to manipulate the techniques in their works.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze whether and which {{political}} institutions {{are important for}} famine prevention and for keeping the levels of inequality low. While famines are sudden crises hitting a country, inequality is a structural problem. As a consequence, the institutions needed might be very different. The econometric exercises realized {{on a group of}} emerging and developing countries confirm the validity of Amartya Sen’s “democracy prevents famine” argument, while democracy is not a significant determinant of income inequality. These results are in line with previous ones, suggesting an unclear role of democratic institutions in facing other structural problems, such as hunger and poverty. Moreover, two main institutional indicators, computed by the World Bank, “control of corruption” and “government effectiveness” are negatively correlated with famine mortality, suggesting that the policy environment, the level of bureaucracy, governmental <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> and implement them in a short period are relevant factors for reducing famine mortality. In contrast, political stability explains better income inequality in our sample of countries. Social peace and cohesion are deterrent for inequality, but the direction of the relationship should be investigated further.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{assess the}} current {{evidence}} based medicine (EBM) knowledge, attitude {{and perceptions of}} physicians at Dubai Primary Health Care Sector (PHCS). Further to evaluate barrier and facilitator factors toward implementing the EBM practice. MethodologyA cross-sectional study, at Dubai PHCS, UAE between June and August 2010. The survey was composed of two phases. The first phase was a self administrated questionnaire employed for data collection and the second phase was qualitative method, {{which was in the}} form of individual interviews. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analysis. ResultsIn total 48 participants responded to the survey questionnaire and 13 responded to individual interviews. The response rate was 70. 0 %. Mean age was 42. 18 (SD 10. 46). The majority were females (64. 6 %). The physicians who attended EBM courses reported 70. 30 % using EBM and showed statistical significance (p= 0. 002) from those who did not attend the EBM courses. 65. 0 % believe that 50 – 75 % of the patients are capable of participating in clinical decision while 71. 8 % disagreed that the concept of EBM is not applicable to their culture. In addition they showed significance (p= 0. 03) between physician beliefs with regard <b>to</b> patient <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decision.</b> About 67. 0 % of the family physicians were knowledgeable and followed systematic review as the strongest evidence. They had no access to the EBM resources (37. 0 %) and had no time to practice the EBM (38. 0 %). Nearly 40. 0 % interviewees reported lack of encouragement to attend EBM courses. EBM activities (22. 0 %) and active audit (18. 0 %) were top rated facilitating factors. ConclusionsEBM is not fully utilized by indefinite physicians in the Dubai PHC sector. Factors associated with non-utilization of EBM in the PHCS are lack of encouragement to attend EBM courses, senior physicians resist adoption of EBM, lack of time and insufficient dissemination process for implementing the clinical guideline...|$|R

Nearly {{one out of}} the {{six states}} in the world is {{regarded}} with low internal capacity by the Failed State Index 2012. However, having a priori assumption on states’ internal <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> and implement them within their own states, scholarly attention has been given to the factors that shape states’ behaviors towards international regimes, mainly discussing under what conditions states will comply with them. Thus, the literature on international regimes neglected to study the effectiveness of international regimes in the states with low internal capacity. This dissertation deals with the research question of how the presence of states with low internal capacity creates implications for the effectiveness of iv international regimes and how regimes’ institutions can operate in such states to increase regime effectiveness. I examine this research question through quantitative and qualitative analyses and with a specific reference to the 4 Rs activities of the international refugee regime in three refugee producing countries, namely Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan. I argue that international refugee regime was not effective in these countries and I propose six tentative principles to UNHCR and its implementing partners to increase the effectiveness of international refugee regime in refugee producing countries with low internal capacity: providing civilian security, overcoming socio-cultural and religious conservatism, increasing government capacity and willingness to cooperate with international community, building trust among local people towards international community and increasing their support for regime activities.

Este assunto Ã {{relevante}} pela reflexÃo que proporciona sobre as possibilidades de inserÃÃo e manutenÃÃo desses trabalhadores no mercado de trabalho, promovendo um ambiente propÃcio ao desenvolvimento de suas habilidades pessoais e profissionais. A pesquisa tem como objetivo analisar a QVT de PcD a partir da relaÃÃo dos estudos de QVT e de fatores de capacidade profissional numa instituiÃÃo de ensino superior. O estudo se propÃe a identificar fatores de QVT, tendo como referÃncia o modelo teÃrico de Walton; identificar fatores de capacidade profissional tendo como referÃncia o modelo IMBA â IntegraÃÃo de pessoas com deficiÃncia no mercado de trabalho; relacionar e analisar os estudos de QVT com os fatores de capacidade profissional do modelo IMBA. A abordagem metodolÃgica adotada foi a qualitativa, atravÃs do instrumento de entrevista. A anÃlise dos dados foi feita atravÃs da tÃcnica de anÃlise de conteÃdo. Os resultados referem um determinado grau de ausÃncia de QVT, na percepÃÃo grupo pesquisado. Os fatores remuneraÃÃo e condiÃÃes de trabalho foram destacados como os mais valorizados. O desenvolvimento profissional, o crescimento profissional, a estabilidade na instituiÃÃo e o equilÃbrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal foram fatores indicados com valorizaÃÃo mediana; a integraÃÃo social na instituiÃÃo, os direitos na instituiÃÃo e a importÃncia da empresa na comunidade foram apresentados como os fatores que menos interferem na manutenÃÃo da QVT. Com relaÃÃo aos fatores de capacidade profissional do modelo IMBA, o grupo apresentou compatibilidade parcial entre capacidade profissional e demandas do trabalho. Dos vinte e quatro fatores, apenas quatro tiveram correspondÃncia entre demandas do trabalho e capacidade profissional, a saber: atenÃÃo no ambiente de trabalho; ser Ãgil no trabalho; capacidade pessoal nas decisÃes do trabalho e capacidade de comunicaÃÃo com os clientes. Os instrumentos utilizados nesta pesquisa foram eficazes para a obtenÃÃo dos objetivos estabelecidos e contribuÃram para a compreensÃo da temÃtica, podendo ser Ãteis para aplicaÃÃo em outras pesquisas e prÃticas na Ãrea da Psicologia Organizacional. The research {{theme is}} the Quality of Working Life â QWL for People with Disabilities â PCD. This issue is relevant for consideration of possible insertion {{and maintenance of}} these workers in the labor market, promoting an environment conducive {{to the development of}} personal and professional skills. The research aims to analyze the QWT of PCD based upon the relationship between QWL studies and professional factors in a higher education institution. The study aims to identify factors QWT, with reference to the theoretical model of Walton; identify factors of professional reference to the IMBA model, relate and analyze studies with QWL factors IMBA professional model. The adopted methodological approach was qualitative, through interview. Data analysis was performed using the technique of content analysis by Bardin. The results refer to a certain degree in the lack of QWL in the researched group. The factors remuneration and working conditions were highlighted as the most relevant. Professional development, professional growth and stability in the institution and the balance between work and personal life factors were pointed with a median level of importance; social integration in the institution, the institution tights and the meaning of the enterprise in local community were presented as the factors that less interfere in the maintenance QWL. Concerning the factors of the professional capacity in the model IMBA, the group presented partial compatibility between professional and work demands. Among the twenty-four factors, only four of them correspond to work demands and professional abilities, namely attention in the workplace, agility at work; personal <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>decisions</b> at work and communication skills with customers.

40|$|Stronger {{manifestation of}} climate change impact on global water cycle, water resources, and aquatic {{ecosystems}} has given a strong impetus {{to the development of}} adaptation measures in water management. The present report gives an insight to potential and planned water related measures tackling climate change causes and consequences, which have been included in the Member States River Basin Management Plans, published in various reports and scientific literature mostly within the last decade. The database of about 450 measures analysed in this report and given in a separate Annex as an Excel spreadsheet, constitutes {{the most important part of}} this deliverable. In the context of this report, measures are defined as practical steps or actions <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> (i) reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases, (ii) to decrease the vulnerability of water resources and aquatic ecosystems to climate change, or (iii) enhance the knowledge base on climate-water relationships and increase the societal <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> right <b>decisions</b> on this matter. By strategic approach, the measures belong either to planned adaptation, which specifically focuses on climate change and variability, and autonomous adaptation, which goals are not specifically climate related, but have an added value in improving resilience to climate change. Separate chapters are dedicated to each of the five specific adaptation strategies addressed in the REFRESH Project. The present report is of relevance to the 7 th EU Framework Programme, Theme 6 (Environment including Climate Change) project REFRESH (Adaptive strategies to Mitigate the Impacts of Climate Change on European Freshwater Ecosystems, Contract No. : 244121), to JRC Thematic Area 3 (Sustainable management of natural resources) foci on CC, to the European Clearing House mechanism on CC, and to the EC Blueprint on Water.

30|$|The {{legitimacy}} problem due to {{the lack}} of a European demo is another important obstacle to a democratic federal institutionalization as a final outcome of the European integration process. Scharpf (2003) analytically categorizes the democratic legitimacy as input legitimacy (government by the people) and output legitimacy (government for the people), and a feedback loop is highly possible between these categories (Easton, 1957) which particularly increases the importance of the approval of people for a democratic polity. In this regard, the European integration process took place as an elitist project; the process was not governed by the people, and ‘permissive consensus’ of the European nations was used as a tool to substitute the missing input legitimacy in the integration process. To some extent, the permissive consensus of the European nations might provide legitimacy for the European integration. For example, “the objectives of European integration were uncontroversial in the post-Second World War period, when integration secured peace through common command over goods necessary for war” (Christiansen et al., 2004 : p. 13). However, “compliance is plausible to obtain Pareto improvements where some are made better off without making anyone else worse off” (ibid.). At this point, ‘permissive consensus’ was also used to achieve the output legitimacy of the integration thanks to the Pareto optimality of the economic integration. However, the deepening of the EU (the ambition to create a political community) impairs the Pareto optimality and triggers the rise of dissensus between the European elites and the European nations (Dierckxsens, 2009, p. 200). For example, the recent financial crisis dispelled the myth that the supranational institutionalization of the EU might be achieved through establishing more independent administrative structures like the European Central Bank (the ECB) which have a <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Pareto-optimum <b>decisions</b> relying on ‘permissive consensus’, because the European nations like the Greeks, Italian, and Spanish strongly expressed their disapproval of the ECB’s decisions (Piattoni, 2014 : p. 84). In this sense, even some of the prominent scholars, leaning on supranationalism, needed to accept that ‘permissive consensus’ among the European people no longer exists, and the national preferences have become more important in the European integration process (e.g., see: Fligstein et al., 2012; Hooghe and Marks, 2001; Risse, 2014).|$|R
40|$|The Group of Seven (G 7) Finance Ministers forum and now Group of Eight (G 8) Summit {{was created}} as a high <b>capacity</b> {{institution}} <b>to</b> deliberate, <b>take</b> <b>decisions,</b> deliver them, and develop global governance {{in response to the}} cascading financial and other crisis starting in the 1970 ’s. It was also created to diffuse globally its core principles of “open democracy, individual liberty and social advancement. ” The changes brought by globalization, notably a succession of financial crises since 1994 and the terrorist shocks since September 11, 2001, have catalyzed the development since 1999 of a broader, more collectively capable Group of Twenty (G 20) to help provide global governance in finance and related fields. The G 20 ’s expanded number and range of systemically important countries as members increases the capacity, representativeness and resulting legitimacy of this new centre of collective leadership. But with non-democratic China and Saudi Arabia as members, and stability, growth and equity as core principles, to what extent can the G 20 help globally diffuse the democratic norms its G 8 members share? An analysis of the G 20 ’s performance since its 1999 start suggests that the G 20 has done much to adopt and diffuse democratic norms. The vulnerability and shocks bred by globalization shared by both members substantially helps explains this trend, as does the deepening institutionalization of the G 20 as a balanced, autonomous, valued forum led by experienced hosts during the more shock free years since 2001. The strong G 20 performance in democracy diffusion as well as in its deliberative, decisional and development of global governance functions sustains the case for elevating the G 20 to a leaders level L 20, for doing this deliberately rather than waiting for a new galvanizing shock, and for using the well performing G 20 itself, rather than existing G 8 or UN Summits as the institutional nest to give the L 20 its birth...|$|R
