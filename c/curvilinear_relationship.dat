The multivariable fractional polynomial (MFP) technique is a good tool for exploratory research when theoretical knowledge is non-specific and thus, very useful in phenomena discovery.

The technique’s major benefit is the uncovering of non-traditional shapes that cannot be modeled by logarithmic or quadratic functions.

The observed effects are not real: They only reflect stereotypes and ingroup favoritism, are due to secular psychological effects, are inconsistent, and confound (e. g., by ignoring <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationships)</b> those low in religiosity with nonbelievers. In this commentary, a distinction is first made between the already known limitations on the extent, context, {{and quality of the}} religion–prosociality link and the novel, more radical argument of Galen denying the validity and the plausibility of such a link. Second, careful examination of relevant studies shows that religious prosociality is not reduced to social desirability in self-reports, is confirmed through ratings by peers who are blind with regard to the religious status of the target, and is expressed through real prosocial behavior in controlled experiments and life decisions with long-term effects. This behavior cannot be reduced to ingroup favoritism. Finally, Galen’s opposition between religious versus “secular” psychological effects is criticized as psychologically problematic, and his insistence for examination of <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationships</b> is relativized on the basis of research confirming the linear relationship.

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{conceptual}} and empirical evidence {{that supports the}} existence of possible <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationships</b> between job characteristics and health outcomes, risk assessments usually rely on linear estimation approaches. However, this approach may not be conducive to good risk management practice. Where curvilinear effects exist, {{it is possible for}} there to be too much of a beneficial work characteristic, or too little of one that is harmful. If that is the case then there will be an optimum level for health and well-being. This study explores a new risk estimation technique that can accommodate multivariate <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationships.</b> The partial derivatives technique can provide stronger predictive utility, incorporate synergistic effects of predictors, and is supported by conceptual work and empirical evidence. To illustrate these ideas, a risk assessment was conducted on a sample of 354 police officers in Greece. Multivariate polynomial regression analyses indicated that a number of job characteristics salient to participants’ experiences were related to outcomes curvilinearly. A risk index (Ri) was derived from a range of values that represent the slopes of all possible lines tangential to the curve that describes the relationship between predictor and outcome. This technique may help to refine and extend current models of risk assessment for work-related health and stimulate new interest in research into risk assessment methodology...|$|R
50|$|In recent studies, up to 50% {{of species}} have been said to go extinct in the next 50 years. This may be {{possible}} due to an example of coextinction being the loss of tropical butterfly species from Singapore attributing {{to the loss of}} their specific larval host plants. To see how possible future cases of coextinction would play out, researchers have made models to show probabilistic relationships between affiliate and host extinctions across co-evolved inter-specific systems. The subjects are pollinating Ficus Wasps and Ficus, primate parasites, (Pneumocystis Fungi, Nematode, and Lice) and their hosts, parasitic mites and lice and their avian hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their host ants. For all but the most host-specific affiliate groups (e.g., primate Pneumocystis fungi and primates), affiliate extinction levels may be modest at low levels of host extinction but can be expected to rise quickly as host extinctions increase to levels predicted in the near future. This <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationship</b> between host and affiliate extinction levels may also explain, in part, why so few coextinction events have been documented to date (Koh et al 2004).|$|E
5000|$|The {{strength}} of the fear elicited by the message {{is also an important}} determinant of the subject's intentions to change the target behavior. Fear strength is distinct from threat severity in that, as mentioned before, fear strength is related to the emotion of fear, whereas threat severity is considered to be an entirely cognitive process. Some early research found that higher levels of fear produced defensive reactions, compelling the researchers to caution that low or moderate levels were the most effective. [...] With rare exception, {{strength of}} the fear elicited has been consistently found to be positively correlated with behavior change. This positive linear correlation is ubiquitous in fear appeal research and has laid to rest the <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationship</b> implied by some of the earliest research. Strength of fear {{has been found to be}} positively correlated, as expected, with arousal. [...] Early research has found that low fear appeal strength was the most persuasive. Strength of fear alone is not enough to motivate change in behavior as strong fear with no recommended action, or a recommended action that is not easily performed, may result in the exact opposite effect. According to Sternthal and Craig, fear strength affects attitude change more than it does intentions. They argue that although persuasion increases when fear rises from low to moderate levels, when rising from moderate to high levels, it actually decreases.|$|E

50|$|Undertaken up to {{the present}} day {{provides}} only modest support to the proposal, that workforce diversity per se brings business benefits with it. Therefore, this idea remains open to debate and further research. In short, whether diversity pays off or not depends on environmental factors, internal or external to the firm. Dwyer, Richard & Chadwyck (2003) found that the effects of gender diversity at the management level are conditional on the firm's strategic orientation, the organizational culture and the multivariate interaction among these variables. Schäffner, Gebert, Schöler, & Kirch (2006) found that if the firm’s culture incorporates the normative assumption or belief that diversity is an opportunity, then age diversity becomes a predictor of team innovativeness, but not otherwise. Kearney & Gebert (2006) found that diversity in age, nationality, and functional background, {{have a positive effect on}} team innovativeness in a high transformational leadership context, but no effect in a low one. A <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationship</b> between diversity and performance was identified by Richard, Barnett, Dwyer, & Chadwick (2004). Kochan, Bezrukova, Ely, Jackson, Joshi, Jehn et al. (2003), found few positive or negative direct effects of diversity on performance. In the cases that came under their scrutiny, a number of different aspects of the organizational context or group processes moderated the diversity-performance relationship. Failing to manage diversity properly or developing diversity per se leads to only mixed results (Bell & Berry, 2007; Klein & Harrison, 2007). Overall research suggests that diversity needs to be properly managed if any business benefits are to be reaped. If properly managed, diversity likely will hold its business promises. This does not preclude that diversity at all levels of society should be a goal 'per se'. Beyond business benefits, research should pay more attention to societal benefits attached to the promotion of more inclusive and diverse workforces.|$|E
5000|$|In general, interruptions and {{perceptions}} of dominance follows a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationship</b> (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005; Youngquist, 2009). Also, when asked to think of typical behaviors of powerful individuals, Carney, Hall, and LeBeau (2005) found that those that were thought to hold more power were also perceived to have more successful interruptions as well as fewer disfluencies. As promised earlier, gender differences exist within interruptions too. Youngquist (2009) chose {{to look at how}} dominance as indicated by intrusive interruptions is perceived differently depending on the gender composition of dyads. This was done by asking 378 individuals to listen to one of 4 recordings with 3 subsections, each subsection contained 2 interruptions. The recording was paused after each subsection and assessments were made about dominance. In addition, the conversations varied by gender composition, male/male, female/male, etc. with the same actor making a total of six interruptions within one recording. His findings show that overall, female interrupters in the same sex dyad are perceived as most dominant while male interrupters in a cross sex dyad are perceived as least dominant. This is in contrast to Dunbar and Burgoon's (2005) finding that men overall are perceived as the most dominant with increased interruptions. Youngquist (2009) additionally finds that females in the same sex groups, who interrupt, are perceived as more dominant than males in the same sex group. Though an interrupter in the same sex group was seen more dominant than the male in the cross sex group, it was only for the first two interruptions. Also, for the first section of the survey (with two interruptions, in the same conversation) but not the second or third sections {{it was found that the}} female interrupter, compared to a male interrupter, was seen as more dominant in a cross sex dyad. [...] Vocal control, loudness, and pitch also have been found to be associated with dominance. Dunbar and Burgoon (2005) had partners and third party observers rate dominance after participating or observing an interaction. Couples were initially separated and asked to write a list of items they would like to spend a hypothetical gift of money on. The couple was then reunited and then asked to jointly decide the top things their money would be spent on. Participants rated their partners' dominance after the interaction while third party observers rated their perceptions during the interaction. They found that observers rated males and females more dominant when they expressed higher vocal control (.76, [...]70) respectively and only male partners perceived their partner to be more dominant when she had greater vocal control (.23). In an additional experiment, Tusling (2000) used 760 participants and divided them into three groups. Group one watched and listened to a video across various influence goals, while group two was given a transcript of the messages and group three watched the video without sounds. Each group gauged dominance levels using a Likert scale from 1-5. He found that amplitude, a measure of loudness, and amplitude variation, an indicator of change dictated perceptions of dominance. It was also found that frequency, a measure of pitch, and frequency variations were reliable predictors of dominance. Verbosity, speech rate, and message length were all found to be reliable predictors of dominance. The increased amount of words used in an interaction or verbosity was linked to more dominant perceptions by observers for males (.53) and for females (.46) by observers, though only females perceived their partner as more dominant with increased verbosity (.21) (Dunbar and Burgoon, 2005). Tussling and Dillard (2009) found that slower speech rates were found to predict increased dominance perceptions. Shorter messages were also found to predict dominance.|$|E

This article utilizes non-parametric statistical methodology to explore curvilinear relations between work engagement and its main predictors: job demands, job control and social support. Firstly, the study examines what additional information non-linear modeling can reveal regarding the relationship between work engagement and the three predictors in question. Secondly, the article compares the explanatory power of non-linear and linear modeling with regard to work engagement. The generalized additive model (GAM), that makes possible non-linear modeling, is compared with the widely used simply linear generalized linear model (GML) procedure. Based on the survey data (N = 7, 867) collected in eight European countries in 2007, the article presents the following main results. GAM clearly fitted the data better than GLM. All investigated job characteristics had <b>curvilinear</b> <b>relationships</b> with work engagement, although job demands and job control relationships were almost linear.

40|$|The {{relative}} income hypothesis interprets statistical {{associations between}} income inequality and average health status at the population level, {{as evidence that}} income inequality has a deleterious psychosocial effect on individual health. An alternative explanation is that these, population-level associations, are statistical artefacts of <b>curvilinear,</b> individual-level <b>relationships</b> between income and health. Indeed, provided the cost-benefit ratio of health-enhancing goods and services vary, the law of diminishing returns should produce <b>curvilinear,</b> asymptotic <b>relationships</b> between income and health at the individual level, which create ('artefactual') associations between income inequality and health at the population level. However, proponents of the relative income hypothesis have argued that these relationships {{are unlikely to be}} responsible for the associations observed between income inequality and average health status amongst high-income populations. In these populations, the individual-level relationships between income and health would be nearer their asymptotes, where a shallower slope should ensure that income inequality has little (if any) 'artefactual' effect on average health status. Yet this argument was based on analyses of population-level data which underestimated the slope and curvilinearity of underlying, individual-level relationships between income and health. It is therefore likely that (at least some part of) the population-level associations between income inequality and average health status (amongst low-, middle- and high-income populations) are 'artefacts' of <b>curvilinear,</b> individual-level <b>relationships</b> between income and health. Nevertheless, {{it is also possible that}} income inequality is somehow (partly or wholly) responsible for the curvilinear nature of individual-level relationships between income and health.
