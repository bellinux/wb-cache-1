50|$|John Joseph (Jo Jo) McCann (Carlyle) {{has been}} a {{habitual}} criminal since childhood, when he pilfered <b>cash</b> <b>boxes</b> for his dad. He's {{been in and out}} of prison ever since. He lives in a high rise council flat with his mother and sister. It is set in and around the North Sighthill housing estate. Looking After JoJo traces the career of a petty thief turned drug dealer in 1980's Edinburgh. The title character is a pleasant if misguided young man surviving in a bleak housing estate and aspiring to the trappings of a successful criminal. Unfortunately for him, and for most of the other characters in the mini-series, it is a time of heroin addiction and AIDS. We watch JoJo become ensnared in the drugs scene and his deterioration is both painful to watch and very moving. Robert Carlyle's performance is extraordinarily complex and textured. He is ably supported by Jenny McCrindle, Ewan Stewart and Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd. This isn't the fast-moving MTV drug scene of Trainspotting but a more character-oriented, leisurely look at the human cost of drug addiction.|$|E

50|$|At {{the height}} of its popularity, richly {{decorated}} japanned ware was {{to be seen in}} every middle-class home, but from the mid-19th century, this began to change. By the 1880s, the japanning and tin-plate industries were in decline. This was due partly to changes in fashion and taste and partly due to the development of electroplating. In response, makers of japanned ware began to focus on more utilitarian items, including japanned <b>cash</b> <b>boxes.</b> Many turned to other trades, including enamelling, electroplating and the manufacture of copper and brass coal scuttles, fire screens and kettles. By the 1920s, the West Midlands' decorative japanned ware industry had largely died out. Many firms began to supply japanned metal to the newly established bicycle and motor vehicle industries, and some even made their own bicycles. The most successful of these was John Marston, whose japanning factory began making bicycles in 1887. The bicycle manufacturing part of the business quickly became more successful than the production of decorative japanned ware. Marston's wife thought the gilt on the black japanned bicycles looked like sunbeams and the bicycles were branded Sunbeam and their factory was named Sunbeamland.|$|E

40|$|Ein beschleunigter Meeresspiegelanstieg macht den Kuestenschutz angesichts leerer oeffentlicher Kassen zunehmend von einer Unbedingtheit (Kuestenschutz um jeden Preis) zu einem Entscheidungsproblem. Um eine effiziente Allokation der knappen Mittel zu gewaehrleisten, sind die vordringlichsten Kuestenschutzinvestitionen mit Hilfe von Kosten-Nutzen-Analysen zu ermitteln. Dabei entspricht der Nutzen einer Kuestenschutzmassnahme dem im Versagensfall (''wenn die Flut kommt'') vermiedenen Schaden. Unter sonst gleichen Bedingungen sind Ausbaumassnahmen dort vorzuziehen, wo das Schadenspotential im Hinterland am groessten ist. Der von der Abteilung Wirtschaftsgeographie des Geographischen Instituts an der Universitaet Hannover bearbeitete Teil des Projektes ''Risiko einer Kuestenregion bei Klimaaenderung: Oekonomische Bewertung und raeumliche Modellierung des Schadenspotentials in der Unterweserregion Bremerhaven -Butjadingen - Land Wursten'' soll die hinter dem Deich liegenden ''geschuetzten Werte'' erfassen, monetaer bewerten und raeumlich modellieren. Mit Schadensfunktionen belegt, ergeben die so ermittelten geschuetzten Werte das Schadenspotential, mit dem im Falle einer Ueberflutung zu rechnen waere. Die Ergebnisse dieses Projektes fliessen in das Forschungsvorhaben ''Risiko einer Kuestenregion bei Klimaaenderung'' ein, das das Franzius-Institut fuer Wasserbau und Kuesteningenieurwesen in Zusammenarbeit mit der Abteilung Wirtschaftsgeographie durchfuehrt. (orig.) An {{accelerated}} {{increase of}} the sea-level causes the coastal protection to change from an absolute necessity (coastal protection at any price) to a decision problem due to empty public <b>cash</b> <b>boxes.</b> In order to guarantee an efficient distribution of the scarce financial means the most urgent coastal protection investments must be assessed {{by means of a}} cost-benefit analysis. The benefit of a coastal protection measure corresponds to the avoided damage in case of failure (''if the flood comes''). Taking into account equal conditions extension measures must be carried out where the damage potential to the hinterland is the highest. The part of the project ''Risks of a coastal region in case of climate changes: Economic evaluation and spatial modelling of the damage potential in the Lower Weser region Bremerhaven - Butjadingen - Land Wursten'' worked on by the Department of Economic Geography of the Geographic Institute of the University Hanover, is supposed to assess the ''protected values'' located behind the dike, evaluate the monetary value and develop a spatial model. The obtained protected values, which are related with damage functions, indicate the damage potential {{that would have to be}} expected in case of flooding. The results of this project are incorporated in the research project ''Risks of a coastal region in case of climate changes'' that is carried out by the Franzius Institute for water construction and coastal engineering in cooperation with the Department of Economic Geography.

5000|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>Box</b> was one {{of several}} {{magazines}} that published record charts in the United States.

Originally, no indication of which version was the biggest seller was given, but from October 25, 1952, a star was placed next to the names of the most important artists. <b>Cash</b> <b>Box</b> also printed shorter jukebox charts which included specific artist data beginning in the spring of 1950. Separate charts were presented for juke box popularity, record sales, and radio airplay, similar to Billboards methodology prior to August 1958, when Billboard debuted its [...] "Hot 100," [...] which attempted to combine all measures of popularity into one all-encompassing chart.
