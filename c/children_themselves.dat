Studies on sexually abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest <b>children</b> <b>themselves.</b> Such experiences may lead to a pattern of behavior where the man regularly justifies being violent, denies doing wrong, and has false and unhealthy notions about sexuality.|$|E

The students, however, convinced the police that the officers’ <b>children</b> <b>themselves</b> would benefit from the protests {{and were able to}} march to the City Hall and ended their protest at Mahamuni Buddha Temple, a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicles {{cover the}} entire history of the world of Narnia, {{describing}} the process by which it was created, offering snapshots of life in Narnia as its history unfolds, and how it is ultimately destroyed. As is often the case in a children's series, <b>children</b> <b>themselves,</b> usually from our world, play a prominent role in all of these events. The history of Narnia is generally divided into the following periods: creation and the period shortly afterwards, the rule of the White Witch, the Golden Age, the invasion and rule of the Telmarines, their subsequent defeat by Caspian X, the rule of King Caspian and his descendants, and the destruction of Narnia. Like many stories, the narrative is not necessarily always presented in chronological order.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1663 Dryden married Lady Elizabeth Howard (died 1714). The {{marriage}} was at St. Swithin's, London, and {{the consent of}} the parents is noted on the licence, though Lady Elizabeth was then about twenty-five. She was the object of some scandals, well or ill founded; it was said that Dryden had been bullied into the marriage by her brothers. A small estate in Wiltshire was settled upon them by her father. The lady's intellect and temper were apparently not good; her husband was treated as an inferior by those of her social status. Both Dryden and his wife were warmly attached to their children. They had three sons: Charles (1666–1704), John (1668–1701), and Erasmus Henry (1669–1710). Lady Elizabeth Dryden survived her husband, but went insane soon after his death. Though some have historically claimed to be from the lineage of John Dryden, his three children had no <b>children</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Children {{also face}} dangers online such as {{cyberbullying}} and approaches by sexual predators, who sometimes pose as <b>children</b> <b>themselves.</b> Children may also encounter material {{which they may}} find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable Internet filtering, and/or supervise their children's online activities, {{in an attempt to}} protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} and DVD set titled , author Laurence Rees {{indicates}} that although Gröning had requested to leave Auschwitz after he witnessed the killing, his objection was only {{on the basis of}} its practical implementation, and not on the general militaristic principle of the mass extermination of enemies. Gröning said that he thought at the time that it was justified due to all the Nazi propaganda he had been subjected to, in that Germany's enemies were being destroyed, which to him made the tools of their destruction (such as gas chambers) of no particular significance. Because of this, he says his feelings about seeing people and knowing that they had hours to live before being gassed were [...] "very ambiguous". He explains that children were murdered because, while the <b>children</b> <b>themselves</b> were not the enemy, the danger was the blood within them, in that they could grow up to become dangerous Jews. Rees points to Gröning's ultra-nationalist upbringing as indication of how he was able to justify the extermination of helpless children. Gröning says that the horrors in the gas chambers did eventually dawn on him when he heard the screams.|$|E
500|$|Coonley {{persuaded the}} {{director}} of the Riverside program, Lucia Burton Morse, and her assistant, Charlotte Krum, to help launch a new school. Morse and Krum had attended Elizabeth Harrison's Kindergarten College, which [...] "championed the concept of kindergarten teaching in America {{and was one of the}} first teacher's colleges in the country to offer a four-year program culminating in the bachelor of education degree". There they had studied the educational theories of John Dewey and others, who stood opposed to the more traditional pedagogical practices of the day, which saw education as the business of transmitting long-standing bodies of information to new generations and inculcating moral training based on rules and standards of conduct. Their new progressive views of education emphasized an individualized approach to education and an integrated curriculum where children learned from experience and social interaction. According to Dewey, [...] "it is a cardinal precept of the newer school of education that the beginning of instruction shall be made with the experience learners already have; that this experience and the capacities that have been developed during its course provide the starting point for all further learning." [...] These ideas laid the foundations of what would become the [...] "progressive movement" [...] in education. Coonley, Morse, and Krum brought these ideas with them to the new school, which Coonley described as [...] "a Children's Community. Its purpose was not so much to teach what others had thought or grown-ups had done, but for the <b>children</b> <b>themselves</b> to do something." ...|$|E

Once this internal contradiction is resolved by the <b>child</b> <b>themselves,</b> by taking into account multiple aspects of the problem, they decenter and move up onto the concrete operational stage.|$|R

2500|$|Proponents of childfreedom posit that {{choosing}} not to {{have children}} is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. Choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the <b>children</b> <b>themselves</b> and society at large. As philosopher David Benatar explains, {{at the heart of}} the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one's legacy/genes), rather than the potential person's interests. [...] At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent.|$|E
