40|$|Abstract Background Chiari-like {{malformation}} (CM) and syringomyelia is {{a neurological}} disease complex with high prevalence in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS). The natural progression {{of this disease}} with time has not been described. The objectives {{of this study were}} to i) determine if syringomyelia progresses with time ii) determine if features of craniocrebral morphology previously associated with CM are progressive (including caudal cranial fossa volume, caudal cranial fossa parenchymal volume, ventricular dimensions, height of the foramen magnum and degree of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>herniation).</b> A retrospective morphometric analysis was undertaken in 12 CKCS with CM for which repeat magnetic resonance images were available without surgical intervention. Results The maximal syrinx width, height of the foramen magnum, length of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>herniation</b> and caudal cranial fossa volume increased over time. Ventricular and caudal fossa parenchymal volumes were not significantly different between scans. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} that syringomyelia progresses with time. Increased caudal cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from adult CKCS. We hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and variable natural clinical progression of CM and syringomyelia in CKCS. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess {{changes in the}} {{posterior}} cranial fossa (PCF) {{to shed light on}} the mechanism of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>herniation</b> in children with Costello syndrome (CS) and posterior fossa crowding. We performed a morphovolumetric PCF analysis on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in seven children with CS (mean age 31 [*]±[*] 16 months) comparing the MRI scans with those of seven age-matched healthy subjects. PCF volume (PCFV), PCF brain volume (PCFBV) and cerebellar volume (CeV) were assessed on axial T 2 -weighted MRI. Morphometric parameters (diameters of the foramen magnum, tentorial angle, basiocciput, supraocciput, basisphenoid and exocciput lengths) were measured on sagittal T 1 -weighted MRI. The volume of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces was calculated as PCFV minus PCFBV. Five out of seven CS children showed tonsillar herniation in the upper cervical canal; no child had hydrocephalus but three out of seven children showed ventriculomegaly. In addition, the PCFV/PCFBV ratio, PCFV, CSF spaces volume, basiocciput, basisphenoid and exocciput lengths and latero-lateral and antero-posterior diameters of the foramen magnum were significantly reduced, whereas no significant changes were found in supraocciput length, PCFBV, CeV or hindbrain volume. The volumetric reduction of the PCF due to bony posterior fossa hypoplasia is a predisposing factor for developing cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum in children with CS. The altered anatomy of the foramen magnum and upward expansion of the PCF secondary to an increased tentorial slope serves to explain the possible mechanism of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>herniation</b> in patients with CS...|$|E

50|$|Concussion {{temporarily}} {{changes the}} brain's function.It {{is believed that}} the brain is left in a vulnerable state after concussion and that a second blow is linked to SIS. The actual mechanism behind the catastrophic brain swelling is controversial. A second injury during this time is thought to unleash a series of metabolic events within the brain.Changes indicative of SIS may begin occurring in the injured brain within 15 seconds of the second concussion. Pathophysiological changes in SIS can include a loss of autoregulation of the brain's blood vessels, which causes them to become congested. The vessels dilate, greatly increasing their diameter and leading to a large increase in cerebral blood flow. Progressive cerebral edema may also occur. The increase of blood and brain volume within the skull causes a rapid and severe increase in intracranial pressure, which can in turn cause uncal and <b>cerebellar</b> brain <b>herniation,</b> a disastrous and potentially fatal condition in which the brain is squeezed past structures within the skull.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{present a}} case of brachial plexus {{avulsion}} and reconstructive surgery with cerebrospinal fluid leak between the cervical subarachnoid space and the pleural cavity responsible for tonsillar herniation and syringomyelia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 17 -year-old man presented with headaches when he was positioned upright, simultaneously with a persistent right pleural effusion for about 4 months after reconstructive surgery for a right brachial plexus avulsion. In addition, the headaches had worsened considerably after two aspirations of the pleural effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated signs of chronic intracranial hypotension and tonsillar herniation with a presyrinx cavity from vertebral level C 1 to C 7. None of those abnormalities were seen on the MRI scan obtained {{a few days after}} the initial trauma 7 months previously. Plexus brachial MRI confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid leak between the avulsed root of C 8 and the pulmonary apex. INTERVENTION: The leak was treated by surgical closure of the dural tear of the C 8 root. Postoperatively, the patient's headaches immediately resolved, and MRI 4 months later showed resolution of <b>cerebellar</b> tonsil <b>herniation</b> and regression of the syrinx.

A 3 -year-old girl with a 1 -day history of right-sided heart failure died unexpectedly soon after cardiac catheterization. At autopsy examination an adherent thrombus around the ventriculoatrial catheter tip, pulmonary infarction, and embolic pulmonary arterial hypertensive changes were found. In the second case, a 21 -year-old man died suddenly after a brief episode of dyspnea. He had a 1 -year history of "asthma" before death. Autopsy examination confirmed pulmonary infarction and embolic pulmonary arterial hypertensive changes. There was no histological evidence of asthma. Deaths in both cases were due to pulmonary infarction stemming from thromboemboli derived from ventriculoatrial catheterization. Both patients had evidence of long-standing clinically unsuspected vascular disease, which {{may have contributed to}} death. Cardiac catheterization may also have precipitated death in the first patient.
