5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the <b>concession</b> that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year <b>concession</b> on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's <b>concession</b> by granting Braathens SAFE a <b>concession,</b> {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's <b>concession</b> could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. <b>Concession</b> was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The <b>concession</b> was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E
5|$|The <b>concession</b> {{provided}} to Abir {{lay in the}} north of the country and was one of nine commercial <b>concession</b> areas established by Leopold in the Congo Free State. The <b>concession</b> was bounded to the north by the Congo River and the Société Anversoise <b>concession,</b> to the east by the Lomami River and the Lomami Company <b>concession</b> and to the west by the Lulonga Company <b>concession</b> which straddled the Lulonga River, into which the Maringa and Lopori flowed. To the south lay the Crown Domain (Domaine de la Couronne), the private property of Leopold, which comprised the best land in the Free State and was the richest in rubber.|$|E
5|$|The red rubber system {{emerged with}} the {{creation}} of the <b>concession</b> regime in 1891 and lasted until 1906 when the <b>concession</b> system was restricted. At its height, it was heavily localised in the Équateur, Bandundu and Kasai regions.|$|E
50|$|An {{empirical}} {{study of}} 34 <b>concessions</b> in nine Latin American countries during the 1990s, including 10 water <b>concessions</b> in 5 countries (3 in Argentina, 1 in Bolivia, 1 in Brazil, 3 in Chile and 2 in Colombia), has estimated {{the profitability of}} <b>concessions</b> compared {{to the cost of}} capital of private companies. According to the study, contrary to public perception, the financial returns of private infrastructure <b>concessions</b> have been modest. The average annual return on capital employed was 7 percent. For a number of <b>concessions</b> the returns have been below the cost of capital. On average telecommunications and energy <b>concessions</b> have fared much better than water <b>concessions.</b> Seven out of 10 water <b>concessions</b> had negative rates of return and two <b>concessions</b> had returns that were lower than the cost of capital of the private companies.|$|R

50|$|The biggest {{criticism}} of land <b>concessions</b> for economic purposes {{is the lack}} of transparency. Often, distribution of the land <b>concessions</b> {{and the use of the}} land is unknown outside of the government and those granted land <b>concessions.</b> Often land <b>concessions</b> have been cleared but not cultivated. This raises questions to whether the land <b>concessions</b> were for productive development or land grabbing.|$|R
5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the <b>concession</b> to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the <b>concession</b> was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for <b>concession</b> to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} a <b>concession</b> on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This would allow the airline to connect the route to the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The {{proposal}} would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the <b>concession</b> for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the <b>concession</b> application, stating that Norway was bound to grant the <b>concession</b> to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E

40|$|Third-party {{conflict}} management, particularly {{legal dispute}} resolution (arbitration and adjudica-tion) and mediation, can help improve {{the willingness of}} disputants to make asymmetric <b>concessions</b> by ameliorating commitment problems and providing political cover. In both regards, and espe-cially pertaining to commitment problems, mediation has substantial limitations when compared to legal dispute resolution. We develop these arguments and test the observable implications on the Issue Correlates of War data. To get traction on the mechanisms at work, we distinguish between challenger <b>concessions</b> and defender <b>concessions,</b> positing that challenger <b>concessions</b> face the pri-mary hurdle of political cover while defender <b>concessions</b> face the primary hurdle of commitment problems. We find that legal dispute resolution strongly increases the propensity for <b>concessions</b> by both challengers and targets, even major asymmetric <b>concessions.</b> Mediation, on the other hand, only helps increase minor challenger <b>concessions.</b> Also consistent with expectations, mediation best enables asymmetric challenger <b>concessions</b> in the highly salient cases that need the most political cover, and legal dispute resolution best enables asymmetric <b>concessions</b> when {{there has been a}} history of failed conflict management attempts that perpetuate mistrust. ...|$|R

5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} <b>concession</b> {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became {{possible}} because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year <b>concession,</b> but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The <b>concession</b> allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the <b>concession</b> companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The <b>concession</b> companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its <b>concession</b> system in the French Congo.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study addresses {{the question of}} whether violence leads to governments making <b>concessions.</b> There were four hypotheses proposed that support the research on this question. The first proposed that there was no correlation between levels of violence and <b>concessions.</b> The second proposed that <b>concessions</b> increase as violence increases. The third proposed that <b>concessions</b> decrease as violence decreases. The final hypothesis proposed {{that there would be no}} <b>concessions</b> until a certain level of violence was reached, which was designated as a tipping point. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) served as the sample case study of this analysis. The findings indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between levels of violence and the Colombian government making <b>concessions</b> to the FARC. Regardless of the amount of violence that the FARC perpetuates each year, the Colombian government does not make <b>concessions.</b> Further analysis suggests that there may be a relationship between presidential parties, elections cycles, and governments making <b>concessions.</b> Captain, United States Arm...|$|R

On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted <b>concession</b> to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted <b>concession</b> to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the <b>concession</b> a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991.

This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the <b>concession</b> to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a <b>concession</b> to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London.

The authors will, by the methods of comparison and analysis, show that, unlike other laws governing <b>concessions,</b> the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act has never been aligned with the general law, which causes problems in practice and in its implementation. The frequent dilemmas regarding the question refer to the choice of norms to implement. The dilemma is whether the general act is applicable in procedures of granting <b>concessions</b> on maritime domain. The authors show in this paper that the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act is not aligned with the <b>Concessions</b> Act and point to the problems in practice due to obvious misalignment of these laws. The authors suggest solutions to the noticed problems.
