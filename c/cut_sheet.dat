50|$|A power shear is {{electrically}} or pneumatically powered {{hand tool}} designed to blank {{large pieces of}} sheet metal. They are designed to cut straight lines and relatively large radius curves. They are advantageous over a bandsaw because {{there is not a}} size limit. Large versions can <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> metal up to 12 gauge.|$|E
50|$|Riso Kagaku Corporation also {{manufactures}} the world's fastest {{full color}} <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> inkjet printers (as of January 2011). The ComColor inkjet printer {{family is the}} third generation of production inkjet printers following the HC5500 and HC5000 product lines. ComColor printers print at speeds up to 150 pages per minute while consuming less than 1/2 the electricity of traditional toner-based (electrophotographic) printers and copiers.|$|E
50|$|The first flapwheels {{were made}} from <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> of abrasive, stacked into a multi-layered flat disk. These gained the {{advantage}} of long life from their materials, but their geometry was still flat and so they tended to produce surface flats if not carefully handled.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a 500-sheet ream of 20# 8.5 by 11 in {{copy paper}} may be {{specified}} [...] "10 M". 1000 <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> (or two reams) will weigh 10 lb, {{half of the}} four reams of cut paper resulting from the 20# basis ream of 17 by 22 in paper.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{every book}} {{was made by}} hand. Scribes had to {{carefully}} <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. Writing the script was likely the most tedious task and took many long hours. For instance, it took scribes fifteen months to copy a Bible.|$|R
5000|$|There is some dispute {{whether the}} IBM 3800 {{was the first}} commercially {{available}} laser printer or whether this distinction should be held by the Xerox 9700. [...] The IBM 3800 first shipped in 1976 while the Xerox 9700 shipped in 1977. [...] Another {{distinction between the two}} products is that the Xerox 9700 was a <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> laser printer while the IBM 3800 used continuous forms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{person who}} is {{generally}} credited with being the first available light"candid" [...] photographer is Dr. Erich Salomon who photographed the social elite inBerlin, Germany and politicians and diplomats during the late 1920s and early1930s with a 1 3/4 x 2 1/4 glass plate or <b>cut,</b> <b>sheet,</b> film camera called theErmanox, fitted with an f/1.8 Ernostar lens. The Ermanox was introduced by theErnemann-Werke (Works) of Dresden, Germany, in 1924.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} uses of chemical etching to mill commercial parts was in 1927, when the Swedish company Aktiebolaget Separator patented a method of producing edge filters by chemically milling the gaps in the filters. Later, around the 1940s, it became widely used to machine thin samples of very hard metal; photo-etching from both sides was used to <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, foil, and shim stock to create shims, recording heat frets, and other components.|$|E

50|$|Concrete {{reinforcing}} {{is one of}} {{the many}} items requiring specialized shop drawings for the fabrication of the material. Concrete reinforcing is custom-fabricated from 60-foot-long reinforcing bars.The reinforcing bars are cut to length and bent to specific configurations. The shop drawing and the accompanying “cut sheet” lists the quantity, sizes, lengths, and shapes of the reinforcing bar. This information is provided for review by the structural engineer to ensure that sufficient reinforcing is being supplied; fabrication of the bar by the supplier’s shop; an inventory list for the contractor, upon delivery the typical project has thousands of pieces of reinforcing steel that need to be organized for storage and installation; and placement by the ironworker. The Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) has developed standard symbols, graphics, and formats for shop drawings and <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> that generally are used by reinforcing steel fabricators. Each fabricator, has particular style for shop drawings and <b>cut</b> <b>sheets,</b> depending on the draftspeople and Computer-aided design systems. Examples of software used are Advance Concrete, AutoCAD, MicroStation, ProConcrete and Tekla Structures.|$|R
25|$|A {{worker who}} <b>cuts</b> <b>sheet</b> metal in a plant loses his arm {{so that his}} spouse can use the million-yen payout to open her own club. Spending his days idly, he {{purchases}} a tank of piranhas. One day, after spotting her outside a hotel with another man and getting criticized by her, he submerges her wrist in the tank and she is bitten. She leaves him and he returns to work at another sheet metal plant.|$|R
50|$|HP {{began making}} inkjet {{printers}} with the HP Thinkjet (models HP 2225A and HP 2225B) in 1984. In 1988, HP introduced the first DeskJet. It included a built-in <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> feeder, 2 ppm, and 300 dpi. This {{was followed by}} the DeskJet Plus in 1989. It offered a landscape printing ability. The DeskJet 500 was introduced in 1990, offering a faster printing speed of 3 ppm. Meanwhile, HP introduced the DeskWriter for the Macintosh in 1989, based on the DeskJet 500.|$|E
5000|$|The 6D {{model is}} usually {{delivered}} to the owner when a construction project is finished. The [...] "As-Built" [...] BIM model is populated with relevant building component information such as product data and details, maintenance/operation manuals, <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> specifications, photos, warranty data, web links to product online sources, manufacturer information and contacts, etc. This database is made accessible to the users/owners through a customized proprietary web-based environment. This is intended to aid facilities managers in the operation and maintenance of the facility.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma cutting {{grew out}} of plasma welding in the 1960s, and emerged as a very {{productive}} way to <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and plate in the 1980s. It had the advantages over traditional [...] "metal against metal" [...] cutting of producing no metal chips, giving accurate cuts, and producing a cleaner edge than oxy-fuel cutting. Early plasma cutters were large, somewhat slow and expensive and, therefore, tended to be dedicated to repeating cutting patterns in a [...] "mass production" [...] mode.|$|E
50|$|The third type of finish {{is called}} a plater finish, and whereas the first two types of finish are {{accomplished}} by the calender stack itself, a plater finish is obtained by placing <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper between zinc or copper plates that are stacked together, then put under pressure and heating. A special finish such as a linen finish would be achieved by placing a piece of linen between the plate and the sheet of paper, or else an embossed steel roll might be used.|$|R
50|$|Continuous form paper {{began to}} {{disappear}} from the consumer market in the 1990s as desktop publishing, and WYSIWYG document generation became more popular and widespread. Consumers {{were willing to pay}} more to get a laser printer or inkjet printer that could produce near-typeset-quality documents. These printers accept standard size <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> (letter, legal or A4) of paper and do not require continuous form paper. Continuous form paper continues to be used in specialty commercial and industrial markets and, as of 2017, is still available from large retailers of office supplies such as OfficeMax and Staples.|$|R
5000|$|Paper {{weight is}} {{sometimes}} stated using the [...] "#" [...] symbol. For example, [...] "20#" [...] means [...] "20 pounds per basis ream of 500 sheets". When {{the density of}} a ream of paper is given in pounds, it is often accompanied by its [...] "M weight". The M weight is the weight (in pounds) of 1000 <b>cut</b> <b>sheets.</b> Paper suppliers will often charge by M weight, since it is always consistent within a specific paper size, and because it allows a simple weight calculation for shipping charges.|$|R
50|$|In photography, a {{dark slide}} is a wooden or metal plate {{that covers the}} {{sensitized}} emulsion side of a photographic plate. In use, a pair of plates joined back to back were used with both plates covered with a dark slide. When used, the dark slide is removed {{for the period of}} the exposure and then replaced. Modern dark slides are used in conjunction with a film holder, that either holds in place pieces of <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> film or, if modified, some piece of light sensitive material such as glass.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} {{thermoforming}} process categories. Sheet thickness less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually {{delivered to the}} thermoforming machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded thermoforming applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> thermoforming applications are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is {{a small but growing}} medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.|$|E
5000|$|Early <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> {{microforms}} and microfilms (to the 1930s) {{were printed}} on nitrate film, which poses high risks to their holding institutions, as nitrate film is explosive and flammable. From the late 1930s to the 1980s, microfilms were usually printed on a cellulose acetate base, which {{is prone to}} tears, vinegar syndrome, and redox blemishes. Vinegar syndrome {{is the result of}} chemical decay and produces [...] "buckling and shrinking, embrittlement, and bubbling". [...] Redox blemishes are yellow, orange or red spots 15-150 micrometres in diameter created by oxidative attacks on the film, and are largely due to poor storage conditions.|$|E
40|$|The two-dimension {{guillotine}} cut {{is actually}} {{one of the most interesting}} problems in modern industries like metallurgic, textile, wooden [...] . in which it's needed to <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> in pieces with an associated dimensions and benefits in the way to maximize the final benefit. The purpose of this work is to present an evolutionary metaheuristic for the two-dimension cut problem using guillotine, also it's shown how this approach can be applied to solve these types of problems, it's compared with other exact algorithms and finally it's defined an evolutionary representation which may be used with different metaheuristics...|$|R

5000|$|In place, {{the dark}} slide is {{in a film}} holder or magazine. Film holders usually refer to <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> film and {{magazines}} refer to roll film. Vintage film holders were made of wood and held in place either photo-sensitized plates or photo sensitive film. In either case, the construction must be such to reduce light leaks, or any unwanted light from striking the film until the holder is {{held in place by}} a camera and considered [...] "light tight". Some holders held only one piece of light sensitive material, some are double sided and hold two pieces of film.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|E
5000|$|General Glass Industries was a United States based {{wholly owned}} {{subsidiary}} of General Glass International. Also known as [...] "GGI", this company manufactured sheet glass from 1988 until 1993 using the Fourcault process. GGI also produced <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> and window glass from flat glass produced by other manufacturers. The site of GGI {{was located in}} Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which is located east of Pittsburgh, PA. GGI {{was one of the}} largest single employers in Jeannette {{and was one of the}} last of the [...] "major" [...] glass plants to operate in the [...] "Glass City".

25|$|Diagnosed with {{abdominal}} {{cancer in}} 1941, Matisse underwent surgery {{that left him}} chair and bed bound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to {{a new type of}} medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He would <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper, pre-painted with gouache by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.|$|R
50|$|Bullock {{moved to}} Pittsburgh, {{and in a}} couple of years, perfected a {{printing}} press called the web rotary press. Richard March Hoe had invented the rotary press in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening <b>cut</b> <b>sheets</b> with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.|$|R
