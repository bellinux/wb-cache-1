25|$|To {{increase}} memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips {{with the common}} address lines are called a memory rank. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal rows and banks. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term sides would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> the module.|$|E
25|$|By 12 October Third Army {{was held}} on the Selle River. On 14 October Plumer resumed his advance in the north, taking Roulers and {{reaching}} Courtrai. On the same day President Wilson rejected German peace overtures, causing the Germans to abandon the Belgian Coast {{and the city of}} Lille (17 October) which they had been hoping to hold as bargaining <b>chips.</b> <b>On</b> the same day Fourth Army crossed the River Sambre and plans were made to advance on the River Selle, amidst worrying signs of a stiffening of German resistance.|$|E

Using a device he finds in the room, the Doctor reverses Cassandra's teleport and brings her back onto the station. In the elevated temperature and without moisturising, Cassandra begins to dry out and crack. She begs for mercy from the Doctor, but he refuses to listen and Cassandra ruptures. Rose notes that with all the events that occurred no one had witnessed the actual destruction of Earth. The Doctor returns Rose to her present time, and explains {{to her that he}} is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet of Gallifrey was destroyed {{in the wake of a}} great war. The episode closes with Rose and the Doctor going off to get <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> a sunny London afternoon.|$|E

25|$|MIFARE Classic <b>chips,</b> <b>on</b> {{which the}} {{original}} Oyster card was based, are hard-wired logic smartcards, {{meaning that they}} have limited computing power designed for a specific task. The MIFARE DESFire chips used on the new Oyster card are CPUs with much more sophisticated security features and more complex computation power. They are activated only {{when they are in}} an electromagnetic field compatible with ISO/IEC 14443 type A, provided by Oyster readers. The readers read information from the cards, calculate whether to allow travel, assess any fare payable and write back information to the card. Some basic information about the MIFARE Classic or MIFARE DESFire chip can be read by any ISO/IEC 14443 type A compatible reader, but Oyster-specific information cannot be read without access to the encryption used for the Oyster system. While {{it has been suggested that}} a good reader could read personal details from a distance, there has been no evidence of anyone being able to decrypt Oyster information. By design the cards do not carry any personal information. Aluminium shielding has been suggested to prevent any personal data from being read.|$|E

[...] He ended the season with a 2–7 record and a 4.18 ERA. [...] Before undergoing surgery on his right elbow to remove bone <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> August 11, Cain revealed that he had pitched through bone chips for ten years, but that they had never been an issue until then. In late September, Cain underwent surgery on his right ankle to remove a bone spur. The Giants acquired Jake Peavy a few days before the trade deadline to fill in as a starting pitcher and went on to win the 2014 World Series. Cain won his third World Series ring in five years.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E

500|$|Finally in space, Homer reveals he has smuggled potato <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> board. He {{opens the}} bag, but is unaware that, {{due to the}} effects of weightlessness, they will spread around and clog the instruments. His {{appetite}} seems to save the day as he floats after the chips, eating them, but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm, letting the ants loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing [...] "You've Got a Friend", but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside, but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer bends the hatch handle, preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle's destruction on re-entry. When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration, Homer pulls a rod out of the wall to defend himself, and he inadvertently uses it to seal the door shut. With the problems solved, the shuttle successfully returns to Earth, making a convenient crash-landing through the roof of a press reporters' convention.|$|E

In response, Intel published the PC100 standard, which outlines requirements and guidelines for producing a memory module that can operate reliably at 100MHz. This standard was widely influential, and the term [...] "PC100" [...] quickly became a common identifier for 100MHz SDRAM modules, and modules are now commonly designated with [...] "PC"-prefixed numbers (PC66, PC100 or PC133 - although the actual meaning of the numbers has changed).|$|E
