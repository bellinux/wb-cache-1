50|$|Moquette, {{derived from}} the French word for carpet, {{is a type of}} woven pile fabric in which <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut</b> threads form a short dense cut or loop pile. As well as giving it a {{distinctive}} velvet-like feel, the pile construction is particularly durable, and ideally suited to applications such as public transport. Its upright fibres form a flexible, non-rigid surface, which are constantly displaced to give durability and anti-stain benefits. Traditional moquette fabrics are made from a wool nylon face with an interwoven cotton backing.|$|E
50|$|The infamous video nasty {{list was}} created in 1982 to protect against obscenity. Films on this list were banned and {{distributors}} of said films were liable to be prosecuted (some of the films were banned before the list was made). This list banned 74 films {{at one point in}} the mid-1980s; the list was eventually trimmed down, and only 39 films were successfully prosecuted. Most of the films (even of the 39 successfully prosecuted) have now been approved by the BBFC, <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut</b> (see Video Recordings Act 1984).|$|E
50|$|In {{northern}} regions, snowshoe hares occupy conifer {{and mixed}} forests in {{all stages of}} succession, but early successional forests foster peak abundance. Deciduous forests are usually occupied only in early stages of succession. In New England, snowshoe hares preferred second-growth deciduous, coniferous, and mixed woods with dense brushy understories; they appear to prefer shrubby old-field areas, early- to mid-successional burns, shrub-swamps, bogs, and upper montane krumholz vegetation. In Maine, snowshoe hares were more active in clearcut areas than in partially <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut</b> areas. Sapling densities were highest on 12- to 15-year-old plots; these plots were used more than younger stands. In northern Utah, they occupied all the later stages of succession on quaking aspen and spruce-fir, but were not observed in meadows. In Alberta, snowshoe hares use upland shrub-sapling stages of regenerating aspens (either postfire or postharvest). In British Columbia overstocked juvenile lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands formed optimal snowshoe hare habitat.|$|E
50|$|Like Kite, the OVA was {{released}} {{both in the}} United States and Japan in two different versions: one with these scenes taken out, the original version {{and the other with}} them left intact, the director's cut. Both versions, however, retain the more violent aspects of the movie. The United States release contains 20 minutes of extra footage not seen in the Japanese release, however, none of the pornographic content from the Japanese director's cut was included. The abridged version of Mezzo Forte, however, has no sex scenes and only contains two naked scenes (both showing the breasts, nipples and labia). But the uncut version is still up. In addition, an international version {{was released}} in Japan on July 23, 2004. This version includes 20 minutes of extra footage, but none of the adult scenes found in the director's <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> the <b>uncut</b> version.|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{responses}} to competition were analysed in Glechoma hederacea, a clonal herb with plagiotropic shoots. Ramets of clones were grown either in isolation or {{in competition with}} <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut</b> Lolium perenne swards. G. hederacea produced the same above ground biomass, but different morphologies when grown with short and tall grass. Despite considerable reductions in biomass and stolon branching when grown with competition rather than in isolation, the capacity for lateral extension of primary stolons was maintained. All other measured variables were reduced by competition, except for stolon internode length and petiole length and mass. These variables reached their greatest values in the uncut grass treatments. These responses could promote avoidance of competition by escape in both the horizontal and vertical planes; growth through vegetated sites would be rapid, and sites where competitors are absent would be occupied more densely. Reductions in PAR and in the R/FR ratio incident on the plant are both implicated in inducing these morphological changes. Differences in relative humidity, caused by the proximity of neighbours, also appeared to exert a considerable influence upon growth and morphology of G. hederacea. Connected parts of G. hederacea clones grown with and without competition developed different morphologies; each primary stolon behaved as an integrated physiological unit, developing a morphology appropriate for {{the conditions in which}} it was growing...|$|E
40|$|Moose (Alces americanus) vehicle {{collisions}} (MVCs) are {{an issue}} throughout {{the distribution of}} moose. Many mitigation strategies have been tested and implemented {{to reduce the number}} of MVCs, but there have been few empirical analyses of the effectiveness of roadside vegetation cutting. The goal of this study was to determine if roadside vegetation cutting attracted moose into roadside areas to browse on the vegetation regrowth. We hypothesized that moose would be attracted to roadside areas with cut vegetation. Consequently, we predicted that there would be higher levels of browsing in cut areas compared to uncut areas. To determine if moose were browsing more in <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut</b> areas, we measured the number of plants browsed by moose in paired treatment (cut on or after 2008) and control (not cut since at least 2008) sites, along with a suite of potential environmental covariates. Using a model selection approach, we fit generalized linear mixed-effects models to determine the most parsimonious set of environmental variables to explain variation in the proportion of moose browse among sites. In contrast to our hypothesis, our results show that the proportion of moose browse in the uncut control areas was significantly higher than in the cut treatment areas. The results of this study suggest that recently cut roadside areas (7 years or less based on our work) may create a less attractive foraging habitat for moose. The majority of the variance in the proportion of moose browse among sites was explained by treatment type and nested plot number within site identification (34. 16 %), with additional variance explained by traffic region (5. 00 %) and moose density (4. 35 %). Based on our study, we recommend that vegetation cutting be continued in roadside areas in Newfoundland as recently cut areas may be less attractive browsing sites for moose...|$|E
40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (<b>cut</b> <b>or</b> <b>uncut).</b> All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|E
40|$|Browsing {{may lead}} to an induced {{resistance}} or susceptibility of the plant to the herbivore. We tested the effect of winter browsing by Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber L., 1758) on food quality of holme willows (Salix dasyclados Wimm.) in and after the following growth season. Shrubs were pruned in February, and new shoots from these (cut) shrubs were {{compared with those of}} untreated (uncut) ones in May and November. The shoots were analysed for dry matter, nitrogen, acid detergent fibre, and total phenolics. In May, the leaves from the cut treatment had a better food quality (more water, more nitrogen, and less phenolics) than those from the uncut one. There was in part also a systemic response, with lower total phenolics in both the cut and untreated parts of pruned shrubs (uncut–cut) than in the uncut shrubs. In November, we did not find significant differences in biochemistry of bark among <b>cut,</b> <b>uncut,</b> <b>or</b> uncut–cut treatments. These results are in accordance with a cafeteria experiment in the field: in May the beavers preferred shoots from the cut treatment, but in November they showed no preference. The results suggest that willows invest in compensatory growth rather than a defence response early in the regrowing phase. ...|$|R
