25|$|The AW119 is a {{single-engine}} multirole helicopter, AgustaWestland {{promote the}} type as possessing excellent flight qualities {{with high levels}} of controllability, maneuverability and inherent safety. The design of the rotorcraft is derived from Agusta's earlier and highly successful A109 helicopter, differing primarily by only being equipped with a single engine (as the A109 was originally designed), a Pratt & Whitney PT6B-37A turboshaft engine, and using fixed skids in place of the A109's retractable wheeled landing gear arrangement. The AW119 shares the same cockpit and cabin of the AW109, along with commonality with various other systems, while costing roughly half of the latter's price tag. According to Flight International, the AW119 is competitively priced and provides good levels of accessibility, maintainability, <b>comfort,</b> <b>noise</b> levels, and speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — owadays, {{the studies}} and {{researches}} {{related to the}} improvement of the passenger comfort in the car are carried out vigorously. The comfort in the car interior is already become a need for the passengers and the buyers. Due to high competition in car industries, all the car manufacturers are concentrating in improving the interior <b>noise</b> <b>comfort</b> of the car. Vehicle oise Comfort Index (VCI) has been developed recently to evaluate the sound characteristics of passenger cars. VCI indicates the interior vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>comfort</b> using a numeric scale from 1 to 10. Most of the researches are relating the vehicle interior sound quality to psychoacoustics sound metrics such as loudness and sharpness for the frequency between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In this present paper, a vehicle comfort level indication is proposed to detect the comfort level in cars using artificial neural network. Determination of vehicle comfort is important becaus...|$|R

It found that the most prominent issue was indoor ventilation, and then air quality, thermal <b>comfort</b> and <b>noise</b> sequentially. Light and moisture problem was easy to be overlooked. Based on the current issues, it puts forward several measures to improve the built environment of underground shopping malls in this study...|$|R

50|$|When silence {{suppression}} is active, {{the line}} {{appears to have}} gone dead at the other (egress) end of the call. For this reason, so-called <b>comfort</b> <b>noise</b> needs to be generated {{to compensate for the}} lack of background noise. The ingress end must therefore signal the egress end that silence suppression is in effect. For best results, the level of <b>comfort</b> <b>noise</b> being generated on egress should match that of the background noise at the ingress end.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulically damped mounts and {{bushings}} are crucial for vehicle handling, ride <b>comfort</b> and <b>noise</b> vibration and harshness (NVH). Multi-body simulation (MBS) software {{is used to}} calculate loads and vibrations; where simple mount models lead to trade-offs in the overall vehicle simulation accuracy. A model for many sorts of hydro mounts is presented. Accurate results are reached by correctly implementing the amplitude dependence of the mount’s underlying rubber parts. The model is evaluated with experiments from a component test rig; with transient test signals from on-road durability events. Accuracy of full-vehicle simulation improves significantly, so that physical vehicle tests can be reduced to save costs and development time...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{updated information}} on the current market and operating environment and identifies interlinking technical possibilities for competitive future commuter-type transport aircraft. The conclusions {{on the market and}} operating environment indicate that the regional airlines are moving toward more modern and effective fleets with greater passenger capacity and <b>comfort,</b> reduced <b>noise</b> levels, increased speed, and longer range. This direction leads to a nearly 'seamless' service and continued code-sharing agreements with the major carriers. Whereas the benefits from individual technologies may be small, the overall integration in existing and new aircraft designs can produce improvements in direct operating cost and competitiveness. Production costs are identified as being equally important as pure technical advances...|$|R
5000|$|Most luxury {{vehicles}} with a tiptronic transmission have two fully automatic modes: the primary mode, identified as [...] "Drive", [...] "Comfort" [...] or similar; and another, usually called [...] "Sport," [...] which delays upshifts higher up the engine rev range (and will also downchange higher up the rev range) for a sportier driving and enhanced engine braking — {{at the expense}} of fuel, wear, <b>comfort,</b> and <b>noise.</b> Furthermore, because modern tiptronic-type transmissions use an electronic control unit (ECU), sometimes specifically referred to as the transmission control unit, the transmissions are able to adapt to the user's driving style through [...] "fuzzy logic". Shift points are tailored to the habits of the driver, through an evolutionary process.|$|R

25|$|Nine Fokker F27s were bought, four from Trans Australia Airlines for $9.5 million. Services {{commenced}} on 17 December 1984 {{with the}} first four aircraft under the subbrand Eurolink—operating shorter hauls out of Copenhagen Airport. Initially this included routes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu; Göteborg Landvetter Airport; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik; Jönköping Airport and Hamburg Airport. The services to Hamburg {{was by far the}} busiest, with five to seven daily services. The old aircraft, built between 1967 and 1969, were unpopular with the customers because of low <b>comfort,</b> high <b>noise</b> levels and many technical problems. Customers would often complain when they realized they would have to travel with a F27 rather than a DC-9. A further five F27 were bought from Aero Trasporti Italiani in 1985, costing 70 million Swedish kronor (SEK).|$|R
40|$|Road {{characteristics}} {{influence the}} amount of pollution generated by traffic. They govern the rolling resistance, which includes : the viscoelastic behaviour of the pavement structure, surface texture, and profile unevenness. Road works are performed on a periodic basis to maintain these characteristics at proper levels of service (e. g. safety, <b>comfort,</b> and <b>noise).</b> While such works produce additional pollution (due to congestion around worksites or extra fuel consumption along the detour route), they still result in less pollution over the long term. This article assesses the balance between an increase in gas emissions during road works and the reduction in emissions from traffic once the works are completed. It is demonstrated that when road works are introduced to correct longitudinal profiles, rather than texture, the emissions benefit is substantial...|$|R
