50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{creative}} thought was expended for the LGR stock designs. The stocks were designed to conform to UIT regulations and offer match shooters a great degree of comfort. The basic LGR and LGR Junior stocks were made of beech with little stippling. The higher grade LGR Match, LGR Match Universal and LGR Moving Target variants stocks had higher combs and raised sighting lines and were made of good grades of walnut and sported a fully stippled pistol grip area and fore end.The rear of the buttstock can be lengthened with 10 mm thick spacer plates so the length of pull and can be tailored for the individual shooter. The buttplate is also adjustable for height and can be raised or lowered up to 30 mm.A metal sling attachment rail is integrated in {{the underside of the}} front of the stock. The sling is attached with a <b>clamping</b> <b>lever</b> that can be slid along the rail to its desired position. The <b>clamping</b> <b>lever</b> accepts the sling swivel of the Walther or another shooting sling.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{mechanism is}} to <b>clamp</b> a <b>lever</b> to the shaft and measure using a single balance. The torque is then {{related to the}} lever length, shaft diameter and measured force.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, the {{sensitivity}} of an unreinforced and steel wire reinforced AZ 31 magnesium alloy to stress corrosion cracking is investigated by means of static stress corrosion testing (<b>clamping</b> <b>lever</b> tests) and cyclic stress corrosion testing (crack propagation tests). In static mechanical-corrosive testing, the AZ 31 alloy showed a relatively low sensitivity while the composite showed a higher sensitivity with earlier crack initiation due to weakening of the loaded specimen section. In cyclic experiments, hydrogen embrittlement crack growth acceleration could be attested. Reinforcing the matrix material leads to a compensation of the crack growth acceleration due to stress corrosion cracking by crack energy absorption by increased interface damage according to the aggressiveness of the corrosive media...|$|R
50|$|To {{mount the}} optics, a side-rail is {{permanently}} {{attached to the}} left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail rail mount with a <b>clamping</b> <b>lever</b> to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the locking lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give {{easy access to the}} receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place.|$|R
40|$|Postreplication DNA {{mismatch}} repair is {{initiated by the}} eukaryotic protein MSH 2 -MSH 6 or the prokaryotic protein MutS, both showing overall conserved structure and functionality. Crystal structures of MSH 2 -MSH 6 and MutS bound to the mismatch DNA reveal a closed architecture of the <b>clamp</b> and the <b>lever</b> domains exhibiting strong contacts with the bent DNA backbone. Long molecular dynamics simulations of the human MSH 2 -MSH 6 protein {{in the absence of}} a DNA show an altered conformation of the protein that reflects the protein's state before binding to DNA. The <b>clamp</b> and the <b>lever</b> domains of both MSH 6 and MSH 2 open in an asymmetric and dramatic fashion. The opening of the <b>clamp</b> and the <b>lever</b> domains in the absence of DNA is coupled to changes in the ATPase domains, which explains the experimentally observed diminished ATPase activity in DNA-free MSH 2 -MSH 6 and illustrates the allosteric coupling between DNA binding and ATPase activity...|$|R
40|$|Research Paper,A sheet {{folding machine}} {{that can be}} {{operated}} through hydraulics by two hydraulic cylinders or manually (with the cylinders disengaged) was designed. The design need emanated from the strained national electrical grid system that has recently seen industrialists and households in Zimbabwe experiencing major power cuts. The machine enables manufacturers to schedule heavier jobs during periods when power supply is up and lighter jobs during power cut periods hence run their workshops throughout the daily production shifts. The two hydraulic cylinders can be disengaged from the machine?s folding beam so that manual operation can be done through a manual <b>clamping</b> <b>lever</b> system. The folding force at full capacity is 294. 6 KN (29. 46 Ton), total bending length of 1. 8 m and working height of 1 m. The folding force decreases significantly in manual operating mode to 500 N, considering that on average an operate can manually exert that force. A student version of Simulation X 3. 5 was used to simulate the hydraulic operation of the machine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A fixture is a {{work holding}} device which holds and {{positions}} the work, but does not in itself guide, locate or position the cutting tool. The milling fixtures so far are generally used on milling machines. The present volume of this paper includes the unique aspect of designing of a 4 axis – 360 o indexing milling fixture for CNC. This fixture provides locating and clamping provisions for as large as 28 numbers of operations to be performed on support plate, one {{of the components of}} color mixing machine. The real time application of the research reflects from the fact that a real industrial component is taken for fixture designing. The designed fixture has the important characteristic of allowing all 28 operations to be performed on component in a single set up. Time estimation sheet for each operation is included, which also covers the details of type of tool & inserts to be used with data of cutting speed, spindle speed, feed & no. of passes required to accomplish the operations. 3 D exploded view of fixture in addition to 2 D & 3 D drawings of component and fixture using Pro/Engineer are also included. Index terms- 28 operations, 4 axis – 360 o indexing milling fixture, adjustable <b>clamping</b> <b>lever,</b> CNC I...|$|R
50|$|The FN40GL {{is deemed}} a third {{generation}} grenade launcher, meaning it is multifunctional: {{it can be}} used mounted to the rifle or as a standalone system; it is manufactured using a number of materials like aluminum, composites, and polymers; the breech opens to the side for use of longer 40 mm rounds including less-lethal; and it is mounted on the bottom accessory rail instead of requiring specialized mounting hardware. The FN40GL is attached to SCAR rifles on the bottom rail with a trigger adapter and dual locking <b>clamp</b> <b>levers</b> on the launcher, limiting the ability to integrate with other rifles. Barrel length is 9.6 in, and is unique in that it is the only system where the barrel can swivel to the left or right for loading, while other breech loading launchers pivot specifically to one side. This enhances its ambidextrousness, making it easy for a left-handed operator to load under fire. The standalone stock assembly has the FN40GL mounted to the bottom rail as with the rifle, but still has 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 9 o’clock rail positions for other accessories. This is mainly during non-lethal uses for other mounted additions like LED lights and laser dazzlers. The trigger is placed lower than normal for operation with the user's middle finger, while keeping their trigger finger free to use the rifle. The double-action trigger is long and heavy to prevent easily and unintentionally firing a round under stress.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake <b>lever</b> <b>clamp</b> diameter.|$|R
50|$|Tape can {{be applied}} in several ways, either wrapped from the ends towards the stem or {{starting}} near the stem and wrapped towards the ends. The tape is usually held {{in place at the}} ends with the bar-end plugs. The other end of the tape can be help in place with adhesive tape, usually electrical insulation tape or, if started near the stem, by first wrapping a few turns towards the stem before reversing direction to anchor it. A figure-eight can be made around the brake <b>lever</b> <b>clamp</b> to completely cover the bar, or a small, separate piece of tape can be place on the back side to cover the small v-shaped section that might otherwise be left bare. Strips of bar gel may optionally be applied to the handebars prior to applying the tape in order to reduce vibration transmission and increase comfort.|$|R
