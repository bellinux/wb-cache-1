5|$|This {{species is}} known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. It lives in humid {{evergreen}} forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It {{can be found}} at the edges of these forests typically in the middle and higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> is uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical <b>cloud</b> <b>forest,</b> tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} still being built, such as the first botanical garden in Oman, which {{will be one of}} the largest gardens in the world. Once completed, it will house the first {{large-scale}} <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> in a huge glasshouse. Development of botanical gardens in China over recent years has been a remarkable, including the Hainan Botanical Garden of Tropical Economic Plants South China Botanical Garden at Guangzhou, the Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden of Tropical Plants and the Xiamen Botanic Garden, but in developed countries, many have closed for lack of financial support, this being especially true of botanical gardens attached to universities.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{far from}} being universally {{accepted}} as true <b>cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> several forests in temperate regions have strong similarities with tropical <b>cloud</b> <b>forests.</b> The term is further confused by occasional reference to <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> in tropical countries as [...] "temperate" [...] due to the cooler climate associated with these misty forests.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{very little}} known about the ecology in which A. montecristoi. However, the species is an {{inhabitant}} of <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> which are {{a major source of}} biodiversity in the world. <b>Cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> as the name suggests, are covered by clouds because they are at high enough elevations where cloud formation occurs which ranges from about 5,000 to 10,000 ft. [...] These <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> are a place where there is the constant flow of water because they are surrounded by clouds. This results in large biodiversity. Again, it is unclear how A. montecristoi intereacts with its environment, but this species does live primarily in the trees of the <b>cloud</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
50|$|The frogs are {{restricted}} to <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> on {{one or a few}} nearby mountaintops, making the frogs vulnerable to extinction. <b>Cloud</b> <b>forests</b> are sensitive to climate changes and face threats from deforestation for pine tree plantations and cattle ranching.|$|R
5|$|Ficus aurea {{ranges from}} Florida, across the {{northern}} Caribbean to Mexico, and south across Central America. It {{is present in}} central and southern Florida and the Florida Keys, The Bahamas, the Caicos Islands, Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, San Andrés (a Colombian possession in the western Caribbean), southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. It grows from sea level up to 1,800m (5,500ft) above sea level, in habitats ranging from Bahamian dry forests, to <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E

40|$|Mexican <b>cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> {{situated}} between 600 and 3000 m of elevation, {{exhibit a}} remarkable high biotic diversity. They follow a fragmented pattern, {{similar to that}} of an archipelago, that makes them suitable to vicariance modelling. A Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) was applied to the presence/absence of 1267 species of vascular plants (gymnosperms, angiosperms, and pteridophytes) from twentyfour patches of Mexican <b>cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> in order to postulate a preliminary hypothesis of relationships. The single cladogram obtained grouped the twentyfour <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> into five clades. These results indicate that the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur, and Serranias Meridionales floristic provinces do not represent natural units. A preliminary vicariance model is presented to explain the sequence of fragmentation of the Mexican <b>cloud</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
50|$|The chief plant {{communities}} are oak <b>forests,</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> pine-oak forests, and fir forests. The plant communities vary with elevation and rainfall.|$|R

25|$|At {{the highest}} elevations, {{near the top}} of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, <b>cloud</b> <b>forest,</b> elfin forest and moss forest. This forest type is {{composed}} of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate—heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover.|$|E

25|$|The dwarf or <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> {{developed}} in the higher peaks of the Central Cordillera is quite different in general appearance from the <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> of Sierra Luquillo Mountains due to the less rigorous environment in Toro Negro. The physical effect of the wind is much reduced; the shrubs are neither bent nor shorn to an even surface, but are essentially erect and their crowns are rounded and uneven in outline. The mosses are reduced to a thin mantle on the more sheltered trunks and are absent in many places, while the great mats of Selaginella are completely lacking.|$|E

50|$|Through evapotranspiration, forests reduce water yield, {{except in}} unique {{ecosystems}} called <b>cloud</b> <b>forests.</b> Trees in <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> collect the liquid water in fog or low clouds onto their surface, which drips {{down to the}} ground. These trees still contribute to evapotranspiration, but often collect more water than they evaporate or transpire.|$|R

25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to oncilla mortality is human expansion, settling what was once open terrain for wild cats. Coffee plantations are most often established in <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> habitats, causing the reduction of preferred habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{often found in}} heavily grazed lower edges of the <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> where grazing, {{deforestation}} and fires are a threat to local populations. Even though the range is narrow, it is about 800 km long; and many populations are in undisturbed or protected areas.|$|E
25|$|Bears of the <b>Cloud</b> <b>Forest</b> {{opened in}} 2004 and {{is home to}} a pair of spectacled bears and other South American animals. The {{purpose-built}} exhibit is designed to mimic the bear's natural habitat by providing trees and a rocky terrain. Nearby are paddocks housing capybaras, Giant anteater and Brazilian tapirs.|$|E

25|$|A. pallipes {{morphology}} is {{also affected}} by the altitude with an inverse relationship between higher altitude and reduction in body size, especially hind femur length and head width. The <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> environment, where some of these A. pallipes are found, contribute negatively to foraging activity and force individuals to complete life cycles with a smaller body size. This study along the altitudinal gradient provides insight on A. pallipes capacity to adapt morphologically to more severe conditions.|$|E
25|$|Alajuela has a {{well-developed}} tourist sector {{throughout the}} province. Tourism is {{promoted by the}} Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (ICT) (Costa Rican Tourism Institute), although some Alajuelan politicians {{would like to see}} a separate bureau for Alajuela. Alajuela has various national parks including Poás Volcano National Park, Arenal Volcano National Park, Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park, Juan Castro Blanco National Park, Los Ángeles <b>Cloud</b> <b>Forest,</b> and Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge, as well as other reserves and protected areas.|$|E
25|$|Stomatal crypts are sunken {{areas of}} the leaf {{epidermis}} which form a chamber-like structure that contains one or more stomata and sometimes trichomes or accumulations of wax. Stomatal crypts can be an adaption to drought and dry climate conditions when the stomatal crypts are very pronounced. However, dry climates {{are not the only}} places where they can be found. The following plants are examples of species with stomatal crypts or antechambers: Nerium oleander, conifers, and Drimys winteri which is a species of plant found in the <b>cloud</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{reason for}} the establishment of the Biosphere was the prevalence of <b>cloud</b> <b>forests,</b> distinguished by heavy precipitation, foggy conditions, and abundant mosses and fungi, at elevations of 800 m to 1400 m. The El Cielo <b>cloud</b> <b>forests</b> receive precipitation of about 2500 mm annually. The closed canopy forests reach a height of about 30 m.|$|R

25|$|Tāwari {{can often}} be found {{together}} with the New Zealand kauri Agathis australis in the understory of the lowland rain forest. It is common in <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> up to 700m too. The species has a preference for shaded or sheltered locations, often in permanently damp soil and near streams. It is locally abundant but mostly individuals are far between. It is common in regenerating forests along with tawheowheo Quintinia serrata. Pollination is mainly by birds. The seeds are partly covered by a fleshy aril and are dispersed by birds and other animals that eat it. The wide spreading anthers are an adaptation to pollination by birds.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Colombia, the white-fronted {{capuchin}} {{is found}} from the Andes throughout eastern Ecuador, Peru and northern Bolivia to the Tapajós river in Brazil, {{south of the}} Amazon River. North of the Amazon River the species {{is found in the}} southern parts of the Venezuelan Federal State of Amazonas and in northern Brazil between Colombia and the Branco River. There are isolated populations of the Ecuadorian subspecies (ssp. aequatorialis) in the Pacific Equatorial Forest, with at least three troops present in the premontane <b>cloud</b> <b>forest</b> and moist transitional forest of the Jama-Coaque Reserve (Reserva Jama-Coaque) along the coastal equatorial mountain range in the province of Manabi, Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|In 1843, {{botanist}} and explorer Joseph Hooker {{visited the}} island. Four years later, Hooker, with much encouragement from Darwin, advised the Royal Navy {{that with the}} help of Kew Gardens, they should institute a long-term plan of shipping trees to Ascension. The planted trees would capture more rain and improve the soil, allowing the barren island to become a garden. So, from 1850 and continuing year on year, ships came with an assortment of plants from botanical gardens in Argentina, Europe and South Africa. By the late 1870s Norfolk pines, eucalyptus, bamboo, and banana trees grew in profusion at the highest point of the island, Green Mountain, creating a tropical <b>cloud</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
