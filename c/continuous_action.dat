Arriving off Lingayen Gulf on 5 January, and bombarding the vicinity of Cape Bolinao, she entered the Gulf the same day and commenced bombardment of the eastern shore but discontinued immediately when a large wave of Japanese kamikaze planes approached. Portland entered Manila Bay on 15 February, and bombarded the south shore of Corregidor in preparation for landings there.

5|$|In {{its defense}} of {{that part of}} Sobuk-san south of Battle Mountain and P'ilbong, the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, also had nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>action</b> {{in the last week}} of the month. During this time, Master Sergeant Melvin O. Handrich of C Company, 5th Regimental Combat Team posthumously won the Medal of Honor for actions on August 25 and 26. From a forward {{position}} he directed artillery fire on an attacking North Korean force and at one point personally kept part of the company from abandoning its positions. Although wounded, Handrich returned to his forward position, to continue directing artillery fire, and engaged North Korean troops alone until he was killed. When the 5th Regimental Combat Team regained the area, it counted over 70 dead North Koreans in the vicinity, all likely killed by Handrich. By the end of August, the fighting in the mountains west of Masan remained a stalemate. Neither side had secured a definite advantage.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of trails that linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of <b>continuous</b> <b>action,</b> 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E

25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in <b>continuous</b> <b>action</b> throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E

40|$|When {{controlling}} {{an autonomous}} system, it is inefficient or sometimes {{impossible for the}} human operator to specify detailed commands. Instead, the field of AI autonomy has developed goal-directed systems, in which human operators specify a series of goals to be accomplished. Increasingly, the control of autonomous systems involves performing a mix of discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> For example, a typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission involves discrete actions, like get GPS and set sonar, and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions,</b> like descend and ascend, which involve continuous dynamics of the vehicle. Accordingly, we develop a hybrid planner that determines a series of discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions</b> that achieve the mission goals. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to solving the generative planning problem for hybrid systems, involving both <b>continuous</b> and discrete <b>actions.</b> The planner, Kongming 1, incorporates two innovations. First, it employs a compact representation of all hybrid plans, called a Hybrid Flow Graph, which combines the strengths of a Planning Graph for discrete actions and Flow Tubes for <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> Second, it encodes the Hybrid Flow Graph as a mixed logic linear/nonlinear program, which it solves using an off-theshelf solver.

40|$|Abstract. We {{target the}} problem of {{closed-loop}} learning of control policies that map visual percepts to <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> Our algorithm, called Reinforcement Learning of Joint Classes (RLJC), adaptively discretizes the joint space of visual percepts and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> In a sequence of attempts to remove perceptual aliasing, it incrementally builds a decision tree that applies tests either in the input perceptual space or in the output action space. The leaves of such a decision tree induce a piecewise constant, optimal state-action value function, which is computed through a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the tree as a function approximator. The optimal policy is then derived by selecting the action that, given a percept, leads to the leaf that maximizes the value function. Our approach is quite general and applies also to learning mappings from continuous percepts to <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> A simulated visual navigation problem illustrates the applicability of RLJC. ...|$|R

It was quickly realized that the answer was negative, after which attention centered on the restricted problem.

500|$|Philippine Sea {{arrived in}} Korean waters on 1 August, and became {{flagship}} of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She immediately began launching {{air strikes against}} strategic targets, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People's Army. Her first strikes were against Iri, Mokpo, and Kunsan. The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but {{the intensity of the}} battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines. They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, Philippine Sea was in action continuously. She was put in a rotation of <b>continuous</b> <b>action</b> with Valley Forge to assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times.

40|$|Most {{unmanned}} {{missions in}} space and undersea are commanded by a "script" that specifies a sequence of discrete commands and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> Currently such scripts are mostly hand-generated by human operators. This introduces inefficiency, puts a significant cognitive burden on the engineers, and prevents re-planning in response to environment disturbances or plan execution failure. For discrete systems, the field of autonomy has elevated the level of commanding by developing goal-directed systems, to which human operators specify a series of temporally extended goals to be accomplished, and the goal-directed systems automatically output the correct, executable command sequences. Increasingly, the control of autonomous systems involves performing actions {{with a mix of}} discrete and continuous effects. For example, a typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission involves discrete actions, like get GPS and take sample, and <b>continuous</b> <b>actions,</b> like descend and ascend, which are influenced by the dynamical model of the vehicle.

In this thesis, I present a novel approach to solve the generative planning problem for temporally extended goals for hybrid systems, involving both <b>continuous</b> and discrete <b>actions.</b> The planner, Kongming, incorporates two innovations. First, it employs a compact representation of all hybrid plans, called a Hybrid Flow Graph, which combines the strengths of a Planning Graph for discrete actions and Flow Tubes for <b>continuous</b> <b>actions.</b> Second, it engages novel reformulation schemes to handle temporally flexible actions and temporally extended goals. I have successfully demonstrated controlling an AUV in the Atlantic ocean using mission scripts solely generated by Kongming. I have also empirically evaluated Kongming on various real-world scenarios in the underwater domain and the air vehicle domain, and found it successfully and efficiently generates valid and optimal plans. by Hui X.
