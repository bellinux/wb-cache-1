5|$|As a {{military}} man, al-Mu'tasim's outlook was utilitarian, and his intellectual pursuits {{could not be}} <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, but he continued his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi and Ahmad al-Farghani, the polymath al-Jahiz, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher al-Kindi, who dedicated his work On First Philosophy to his patron al-Mu'tasim.|$|E
5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> females of the same species.|$|E

5|$|As {{the case}} of Ælfwald shows, while the written sources for later Northumbria are few and often written down centuries after the events they describe, archaeological {{evidence}} from coinage is independent of the surviving annals. Anglo-Saxon coins usually named the king on whose orders they were issued and sometimes named the mint where they were struck—Northumbrian coinage names York as the place of issue—and the moneyer who produced them. Their weight and silver content can be compared with other reigns, providing {{a hint of the}} prevailing economic conditions, and the style and size may also throw light on cultural influences when the coins are <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> neighbouring kingdoms and with other forms of art.

5|$|Flerovium is {{currently}} the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical investigations have so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium. The first experiment involved the reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl and the second the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,4n)288Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied. The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> radon, {{as it was then}} expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour. Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.|$|E

The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings.

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E

The nest is often ill-concealed <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents {{for up to three}} weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food.

Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Cetiosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E
