25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} {{about the real}} identity of {{the architect of the}} Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of <b>cast</b> <b>bearing</b> his name was discovered {{at the foot of the}} tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the analysis, design, {{and control of}} {{a new class of}} magnetic nanopositioner. Applications for this class of positioner include sample positioning for scanning microscopy and interferometry, nanofabrication, vibration cancellation, biological cell tracking/positioning, and beam focusing/steering. The nanometer-resolution positioning required in these applications is often provided using piezoelectric ceramic actuators. The drawbacks to using piezoelectric actuators include high hysteretic heating, lightly damped structural resonances, the need for preload on the actuator stack, as well as the requirement for a high voltage amplifier. This thesis demonstrates an electromagnetically driven nanopositioner that is suspended on rubber bearings as a promising, low cost alternative to the piezoelectric nanopositioners. Several key features of the electromagnetic nanopositioner are the flux-steering actuator that applies a force linear in both coil current and displacement, replacement of the conventional metal flexures with rubber bearings, as well as power and sense electronics that can be easily integrated into a compact package. A prototype of this class of nanopositioner with 100,pm of travel and a maximum force output of 460 N was built and tested. (cont.) A closed-loop bandwidth of 580 Hz was obtained using capacitance distance sensor feedback. The feasibility and procedure for <b>casting</b> rubber <b>bearings</b> was investigated. Several room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) rubbers were considered for low volume, in-lab production of test specimens. A compression specimen was cast from a two-part RTV silicone rubber that was found to be suitable. A compression fixture that was previously used to test bonded rubber pads was modified to accept the <b>cast</b> rubber <b>bearings.</b> The <b>cast</b> rubber <b>bearing</b> was found to have the predicted DC stiffness and the stiffness increased with frequency as expected. <b>Casting</b> of rubber <b>bearings</b> was demonstrated as a feasible method for putting rubber bearings into devices such as nanopositioners. by David P.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to assess whether stable undisplaced ankle {{fractures}} treated conservatively with a below knee non weight <b>bearing</b> <b>cast</b> ever displace. METHODS: Retrospective case notes analysis was performed. Between August 2007 and August 2009, one hundred and twenty one patients sustained a stable undisplaced ankle fracture which was treated conservatively. Their age range was from 16 to 86 years (mean 53 years). Male to female ratio was 74 : 47. The mean number of clinic follow ups was 3. 7. These patients were classified according to the Danis-Weber Classification for analysis. Thirty (25 %) patients had Weber A 1 fractures, seventy two (60 %) had Weber B 1 fractures, five patients (4 %) had Weber B 2 fractures, three patients (2 %) had Weber C 1 fractures, ten patients (8 %) had isolated medial malleolus fracture and one patient suffered an isolated posterior malleolus fracture. RESULTS: An average of 4. 7 radiographs were performed on each patient from the time of diagnosis to discharge from clinic. None of these fractures displaced on follow up radiographs.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} hydraulically operated squeeze pins to reduce porosity formation in <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>bearing</b> caps. Two complete sets are cast in an eight-cavity die with a 2000 t cold chamber high pressure die casting machine. The initial die configuration used a sliding core assembly with stationary pins to core a through hole in a thick section of the front cam caps. This configuration resulted in high post machining scrap rates, primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the sliding core assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate. The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover. Density measurements and visual inspection confirmed the substantial improvement in porosity levels in the critical region of the castings. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Horizontal {{casting machine}} {{is one of}} the key {{equipments}} of the continuous casting production line for aluminum ingot, the stable running of transporting chain has direct effects on the surface roughness of the finished aluminum ingots and the technical data of the machine. The casting machine supports are the main carriers of molds,the drive chain and other components,which have long-term work in hot and humid environment and easily leads to the running stationarity of transporting chain reduced. So in order to improve the operation stability of the transporting chains of the casting machine and the surface roughness of the finished aluminum ingots, the sequential coupling analysis methods of thermal-structural coupled analysis module of the finite element software ANYSYS is used to analysis of thermal deformation and temperature field simulation for the casting machine supports, and determine the size and distribution pattern of the thermal deformation and thermal stress of the <b>casting</b> machine <b>bearing</b> parts,the simulation results provide a theoretical basis for new product design and development work in the selection,structure and layout optimization...|$|R

On manual (non-CNC) machine tools, the way that machinists compensate for the effect of backlash is to approach all precise positions using the same direction of travel.

The setups, tool approaches, and toolpaths are designed around this constraint.|$|R

Methods: Over a period of one year, fifty pediatric patients of tibial shaft fractures, with average age of 9. 68 yr (SD= 2. 37), were treated with elastic stable intramedullary nail.
