50|$|In November and December 1941, the United States National Defense Research Committee {{conducted}} extensive tests {{between the}} Bausch and Lomb M1 stereoscopic rangefinder and the Barr and Stroud FQ 25 and UB 7 coincidence rangefinders:COINCIDENCE AND STEREOSCOPIC RANGE FINDERSThe {{first of these}} reports {{is concerned with the}} comparative test of coincidence and stereoscopic range finders. (353) In these tests the American stereoscopic Height Finder Ml was operated against the British coincidence type Range Finders FQ 25 and UB 7, in ranging on fixed ground targets, moving naval targets and moving aerial targets. The coincidence and stereoscopic methods utilize the same basic principles of geometrical optics for the determination of the distance to a target. The two methods differ radically, however, {{in the nature of the}} criterion presented for human judgement. These British instruments were of the split field coincident type. American crews were being trained at Fort Monroe to operate the coincidence instruments but this plan was dropped when six British seamen, who were experienced range takers, were made available for the tests. Until recently the British Services had tended strongly to the coincidence type of instrument while the American Services had adopted the stereoscopic principle for long-base instruments at least. The decisions of both the British and American Services apparently grow out of different interpretations of the experience of the Battle of Jutland in World War I and are of no concern in this place. Tests were run in November and December 1941 using the British seamen on the British instrument and experienced American observers on the Standard M1. Bad weather conditions and various experimental difficulties and mishaps made it impossible to obtain a really satisfactory quantity of data before the tests hall to be terminated. Fixed target reading were made on targets from 2,700 to 14,500 yards. Only five aerial courses could be recorded and these were all level flight courses, at altitudes of 3,000 to 4000 yards and slant range between 4,000 and 12,000 yards Continuous contact was used. Nine courses were obtained on slow moving naval targets at ranges from 4,000 to 12,000 yards. In these latter courses continuous and broken contact were used at different times.It was found, throughout the tests, that the performances of the various instruments were more nearly alike when measured in external units (Reciprocal range) than when measured in terms of error at the observer's eye, in spite of marked differences in physical dimensions of the instruments. The American MI has a base length of 4.5 yards and used 12 power; FQ 25 with a 6 yard base used 28 power and UB 7, a portable instrument, has 25 power and 3-yard base. The coincidence instruments did not use internal adjusters but were calibrated on targets of known range. In other words. the net performance of the different instruments were essentially comparable although the instruments exhibited varying degrees of efficiency in performance relative to the size. On aerial courses precision errors of the four instruments were about alike when measured in reciprocal-range units. In UOE, the FQ 25 had comparatively poor precision, while the UB 7, for three of the five aerial courses, had very small precision errors. The number of aerial courses was too small to yield much information about consistency of observations from one course to the next.For the naval target courses, one American instrument was not operating. Precision errors of the other three instruments were similar to those on aerial height courses. In reciprocal range units the three instruments had comparable precision. In UOE the FQ 25 was worse and the UB 7 was better than the American M1. <b>Consistency</b> <b>error</b> of the UB 7 was smaller than that of the M1, even when measured in reciprocal range units, while the FQ 25 was similar in consistency to the Ml, again in reciprocals units. On ground targets the same general situation holds. Consistency errors of the four instruments over the 9-day period were the same when measured in reciprocal-range units. Again the UB 7 was better than the stereoscopic instruments in UOE and the FQ 25 was worse. Consistency over the 9 days was not perceptibly worse than daily consistency for any of the instruments. In other words, the readings over the 9 days did not scatter in total more than did readings for a typical day.An analysis or these results leads to the following conclusions. (1) Performance of the coincidence and stereoscopic instruments was about the same when range errors were measured in yards (2) The UB 7 however, with a virtual base length smaller than that of the American stereoscopic instruments was more efficient than the stereoscopic height finders in terms of performance for its size, while the large coincidence instrument, the FQ 25. was less efficient in this sense. This situation held for all types of targetsâ€” fixed ground, naval, and aerial. (3) The UB 7 is somewhat better than the American instrument in consistency on naval targets, even when measured in external units. This report is attached, as supporting data, to a Report to the Services issued by the Fire Control Division of NDRC (20). This points out that the tests indicate no important difference in the precision obtainable from the two types of instrumentâ€” coincidence and stereoscopic They do indicate, however, that the difference in performance between large and small instruments is by no means as great as would be anticipated from simple geometrical optics. The report concludes with the belief that stereoscopic and coincidence acuities are about equal. Under favourable conditions existing instruments of the two types perform about equally well, and the choice between them for any given purpose must be based on matters of convenience related to the particular conditions under which they are to be used.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Effective {{treatment}} programs for communication disorders {{are based on}} the underlying nature of the impairment; therefore, accurate diagnosis is critical. In some cases, however, reliable and valid methods of differentially diagnosing disorders with similar behavioral profiles are lacking. This is particularly true of acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) and aphasia characterized by frequent occurrences of phonemic paraphasia (PP). The differential diagnosis of AOS and aphasia with PP is challenging because both disorders result from left hemisphere stroke and share clinical characteristics. Therefore, the identification of characteristics that pattern uniquely to each disorder is important. One way in which to strengthen the current diagnostic process is to examine the validity of diagnostic criteria used to inform differential diagnosis. The current criteria proposed to differentiate AOS from aphasia with PP include: 1) slow speech rate characterized by prolonged segment and intersegment durations, 2) sound distortions, 3) distorted sound substitutions, 4) prosodic abnormalities, and 5) relatively consistent errors in regard to error location and error type. Of these characteristics, <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> is the most controversial. <b>Error</b> <b>consistency</b> refers to whether or not errors are relatively consistent from trial to trial in regard to the location of errors within a word (e. g., word initial) and the type of errors produced (e. g., distortions vs. substitutions). Investigations comparing the nature of <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> in AOS and aphasia with PP have revealed conflicting results. These studies, however, differ in important methodological areas, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the nature of <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> in these two populations. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> may be influenced by a number of variables, such as error rate, severity of impairment, and stimulus presentation condition. This study sought to further examine the nature of <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> in a group of 10 individuals with AOS and concomitant aphasia and a group of 11 individuals with aphasia with PP. Specifically, this study examined group differences in the <b>consistency</b> of <b>error</b> location and error type during the repetition of two-, three-, and five-syllable words. The influence of error rate, severity of impairment, and stimulus presentation condition on measures of <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> was also examined, as well as group differences in the types of errors produced. Results suggest that <b>consistency</b> of <b>error</b> location does not differentiate group performance, whereas the variability of error type does. In particular, individuals with AOS and aphasia demonstrate more variable errors compared individuals with aphasia with PP. Results also indicate that the <b>consistency</b> of <b>error</b> location is influenced by error rate and severity of impairment. Stimulus presentation condition, however, did not appear to influence group performance on either measure of <b>error</b> <b>consistency.</b> Lastly, results of an error type analysis show that individuals with AOS and aphasia demonstrate significantly more phonetic errors compared to individuals with aphasia with PP. In conclusion, results do not support the use of <b>error</b> <b>consistency</b> as a valid measure in which to differentiate individuals with AOS and aphasia from individuals with aphasia with PP...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Deformable image {{registration}} (DIR) {{is necessary for}} accurate dose accumulation between multiple radiotherapy image sets. DIR algorithms can suffer from inverse and transitivity inconsistencies. When using deformation vector fields (DVFs) that exhibit inverse-inconsistency and are nontransitive, dose accumulation on a given image set via different image pathways will lead to different accumulated doses. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the dosimetric effect of and propose a postprocessing solution to reduce inverse <b>consistency</b> and transitivity <b>errors.</b> Methods: Four MVCT images and four phases of a lung 4 DCT, each with an associated calculated dose, were selected for analysis. DVFs between all four images in each data set were created using the Fast Symmetric Demons algorithm. Dose was accumulated on the fourth image in each set using DIR via two different image pathways. The two accumulated doses on the fourth image were compared. The inverse <b>consistency</b> and transitivity <b>errors</b> in the DVFs were then reduced. The dose accumulation was repeated using the processed DVFs, the results of which were compared with the accumulated dose from the original DVFs. To evaluate the influence of the postprocessing technique on DVF accuracy, the original and processed DVF accuracy was evaluated on the lung 4 DCT data on which anatomical landmarks had been identified by an expert. Results: Dose accumulation to the same image via different image pathways resulted in two different accumulated dose results. After the inverse <b>consistency</b> <b>errors</b> were reduced, the difference between the accumulated doses diminished. The difference was further reduced after reducing the transitivity errors. The postprocessing technique had minimal effect on the accuracy of the DVF for the lung 4 DCT images. Conclusions: This study shows that inverse <b>consistency</b> and transitivity <b>errors</b> in DIR have a significant dosimetric effect in dose accumulation; Depending on the image pathway taken to accumulate the dose, different results may be obtained.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in single particle reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy {{is to establish}} a reliable ab-initio three-dimensional model using two-dimensional projection images with unknown orientations. Common-lines based methods estimate the orientations without additional geometric information. However, such methods fail when the detection rate of common-lines is too low due to the high level of noise in the images. An approximation to the least squares global self <b>consistency</b> <b>error</b> was obtained using convex relaxation by semidefinite programming. In this paper we introduce a more robust global self <b>consistency</b> <b>error</b> and show that the corresponding optimization problem can be solved via semidefinite relaxation. In order to prevent artificial clustering of the estimated viewing directions, we further introduce a spectral norm term that is added as a constraint or as a regularization term to the relaxed minimization problem. The resulted problems are solved by using either the alternating direction method of multipliers or an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real images demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce the orientation estimation error when the detection rate of common-lines is low...|$|E

The first and important step of this activity is risk analysis. During risk analysis, two main studies concerning human factors must be integrated: task analysis and human error analysis. This multidisciplinary analysis often leads to a work sharing between several stakeholders who use their own languages and techniques. This often produces <b>consistency</b> <b>errors</b> and understanding difficulties between them. Hence, this paper proposes to treat the risk analysis on the common expression language UML (Unified Modeling Language) and to handle human factors concepts for task analysis and human error analysis based on the features of this language.
