The company soon expanded into different geographical areas (Madrid, Aragon, Costa del Sol, Baleares and Canary Islands).

He {{was a member of}} the high school track and {{football}} teams before he left school in 1948 to work as a <b>concrete-mixer</b> operator for C.W. Organ, a Los Angeles contractor.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, {{after working}} on a gill-netter (fishing boat) in Bristol Bay, and after {{completion}} of the pipeline, she worked numerous jobs including as a researcher for the Alaska Federation of Natives human resources department, layout artist and writer for the Tundra Times, researcher for North Pacific Rim, and other contracts. She paid for {{two years of college}} by driving trucks in the early 1980s as Alaska's first female union <b>concrete-mixer</b> driver. She did volunteer research work for the Berger Commission, and from 1986 until 1988 was a paralegal for Alaska Legal Services. Through the 1990s Benson ran the Northern Stars Talent Agency, promoting Alaska's talent in films and commercials nationally and internationally.|$|E
30|$|Differences between {{life-cycle}} {{energy use}} and GHG emissions results among studies of NGVs in China {{and other countries}} are largely due to (1) {{the difference in the}} adopted fuel consumption rate, including the impact of different application types and tonnage types. For example, a study by Tu et al. (2013 b) evaluated the life-cycle emissions of GHGs and other pollutants from NG-powered <b>concrete-mixer</b> trucks, a typical type of truck (Cai et al. 2017; Hao et al. 2015; Song et al. 2017; Tu et al. 2013 b); (2) differences in the energy consumption and GHG emissions produced in the process of fuel acquisition, particularly for widely used industry boilers largely fuelled by coal, which have an low efficiency compared with the global level (Cai et al. 2017; Ou et al. 2010; Wang 2015); and (3) different operating environments (Ercan and Tatari 2015; Lajunen and Lipman 2016; Lin et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the physical effort demanded and the posture of the workers in forest nursery activities and to propose an ergonomic reorganization to improve the security and health levels of workers. The study was carried out with workers of a forestry company located in Parana State, Brazil. The physical effort demanded was evaluation with in a survery of the workers cardiac frequency in different stages of the work using a Polar monitor from Finlandia and work classified in categories as proposed by Apud (1997). To evaluation posture the workers were filmed during the performance of his activities and the data submitted to the software WinOwas of analysis of postures. The results indicated that the work stages considered of higher physical exigency were the substrate preparation and transport of seedlings in polythene bags to vegetation home with cardiac frequency of 120 and 115 bpm and cardiovascular load of 42 % and 37 %, respectively, with the activities classified as average heavy. The critical posture to workers was at removal substrate in <b>concrete-mixer,</b> due an overload of lumbar column. The seedling production activity showed the necessity of the correction at posture of the workers because in 97 % of the total time they stand with the lumbar column curved. It is possible to conclude that the forestry company should take preventive measures to avoid backaches, using educational strategies or changing the operational system...|$|E
30|$|Life-cycle {{analysis}} (LCA) is {{a useful}} modelling tool for quantitatively estimating the energy consumption, environmental emissions and economic effects resulting {{from the use of}} alternative fuels and vehicle technologies. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the fuel consumption and GHG emissions of alternative vehicle technologies from the life-cycle perspective (Ou et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2015). However, the number of published LCA studies on vehicles using alternative fuels such as NG is relatively small. These studies have focused on LCA studies on NGVs in China from the perspective of alternative fuels, highlighting a wide range of alternatives and analysing fuel pathways (Kliucininkas et al. 2012; Ou and Zhang 2013; Shen et al. 2012). Moreover, most previous studies have conducted an LCA of one or two types of NGVs, such as light-duty passenger vehicles or heavy-duty commercial vehicles (buses or trucks) (Hao et al. 2013; Tu et al. 2013 a, b; Ou et al. 2013). Hao et al. (2013) conducted an LCA to estimate the future trends in fuel consumption and life-cycle GHG emissions for on-road trucks in China and emphasized that if the share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) powered trucks in all newly registered semi-trailer towing trucks and heavy-duty trucks is increased to 20 % in 2030, an estimated 7.9 % and 10.9 % of the total diesel consumption by trucks will be replaced by LNG in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In another study, Tu et al. (2013 b) evaluated the life-cycle emissions of GHGs and other pollutants from <b>concrete-mixer</b> trucks (a typical type of trucks) powered by diesel and LNG. The use of LNG was suggested to result in a 9 % reduction in GHG emissions compared with diesel, whereas other pollutants varied. As demonstrated by Ou et al. (2013), a life-cycle model is used to assess the GHG emissions of vehicles powered by NG-based fuels and to assess the electric vehicles (EVs) powered with NG-to-electricity in China. From the life-cycle perspective, NG electricity-powered EV and NGV pathways can decrease the life-cycle GHG emissions compared to vehicles powered by petroleum-based gasoline by 42 % and 10 %, respectively. In addition, few previous studies have focused on the quantitative evaluation of petroleum substitution effects of NGV fleets considering multiple types of NGVs in China (Jiao et al. 2017; Niu et al. 2017). Jiao et al. (2017) constructed a conceptual model of substituting automotive fuels and an evaluation model to investigate the substitutive effects of three kinds of substitutive policies in the Chinese transportation industry: NG, ethanol and methanol. They concluded that these three substitutive policies can significantly reduce the cost of oil dependence, and they suggested that China should promote an NG alternative policy in the short term. In another study, Niu et al. (2017) evaluated the impact of the development of alternative energy such as gas vehicles, new energy vehicles and biomass fuel on the petroleum demand in China.|$|E
