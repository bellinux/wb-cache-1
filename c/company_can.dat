They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the <b>company</b> <b>can</b> offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E

The chip stores the bearer's name, gender, date and place of birth, a digital image of their face, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format. In addition, the new ID card {{can be used for}} online authentication (e.g. for age verification or for e-government applications).

5|$|The <b>company</b> <b>can</b> trace {{its history}} {{back to the}} Edinburgh Street Tramways Company of 1871, also {{involving}} at various times the tramway companies of Leith, Musselburgh and Edinburgh North. The City Council (Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department) took over operation of the tramways in 1919, at which time most of the system was cable operated. Electrification of the tram network was completed in 1923, but the first motor buses had arrived in 1919.|$|E

There are tools such as Google Consumer Survey that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers.

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a <b>company</b> <b>can</b> perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the <b>company</b> <b>can</b> resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a <b>company</b> <b>can</b> still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

5|$|Though the Baltimore Opera <b>Company</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced}} back to the 1924 {{founding}} of the Martinet Opera School, the direct antecedent of the Company was founded in 1950, with Rosa Ponselle, a well-known soprano, as artistic director. In the following decade the Company modernized, receiving new funding from, among other sources, the Ford Foundation, which led to professionalization and the hiring of a full-time production manager and the stabilization on a program consisting of three operas every season; this schedule has since been expanded to four performances. In 1976, the Company commissioned Inês de Castro for the American Bicentennial, composed by Thomas Pasatieri with a libretto by Bernard Stambler; the opera's debut was a great success and an historic moment for American opera.|$|E

25|$|Some {{bonds are}} callable, meaning {{that even though}} the company has agreed to make {{payments}} plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the <b>company</b> <b>can</b> choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor {{might not be able to}} find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.|$|E
