40|$|The Balbiani ring (BR) {{genes in}} the midge Chironomus, a genus {{belonging}} to Diptera, code for large secretory proteins, used to construct the larval tube. The 15 - 23 -kb long <b>core</b> <b>block</b> in each gene consists of an array of tandemly arranged approximately 200 -bp long repeat units, where a single repeat unit is composed of a constant and a subrepeat region. In order to investigate the evolutionary fate of highly repetitive coding DNA, the BR 1 γ <b>core</b> <b>block</b> in Chironomus pallidivittatus was characterized and compared to the orthologous <b>core</b> <b>block</b> in the sibling species Chironomus tentans. We find that the 75 - 100 repeat units in the BR 1 γ <b>core</b> <b>block</b> have evolved in an unusual fashion. In all repeat units the constant regions display an expected high degree of homology between the two species, 94 % at the nucleotide level. In contrast, the subrepeat regions in all repeat units have diverged concertedly, both as to length, number and sequence of the subrepeats. The observed changes in all repeat units of the <b>core</b> <b>block</b> probably have occurred after speciation of C. pallidivittatus and C. tentans. These findings demonstrate that a tandemly reiterated coding sequence can rapidly and concertedly convert into a related sequence, much {{in the same way}} as has been described for satellite DNA...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unimolecular core−shell {{and hollow}} polymer {{nanoparticles}} with well-defined dimensions were crafted using spherical core−shell star-like diblock copolymers as templates. Monodisperse and structurally stable star-like diblock copolymers composed of inner degradable <b>core</b> <b>blocks</b> and outer photo-cross-linkable shell blocks were synthesized via {{a combination of}} two living polymerization techniques, namely, coordina-tion−insertion ring opening polymerization (ROP) followed by reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT). Subse-quently, uniform unimolecular core−shell nanoparticles were successfully produced by photo-cross-linking the shell blocks of star-like diblock copolymers. The core diameter and shell thickness of nanoparticles are determined by molecular weights of inner <b>core</b> <b>block</b> and outer shell block, respectively, thereby rendering nanoparticles with tunable structural characteristics. The cross-linking density of nanoparticles can be readily controlled by varying the exposure time of star-like diblock copolymer templates to UV illumination. The selective degradation of inner <b>core</b> <b>blocks</b> yielded hollow polyme...|$|R

40|$|Frequent pattern mining is an {{essential}} tool in the data miner’s toolbox, with data applications running the gamut from itemsets, sequences, trees, to graphs and topological structures. Despite its importance, a major issue has clouded the frequent pattern mining methodology: the number of frequent patterns can easily become too large to be analyzed and used. Though many efforts have tried to tackle this issue, {{it remains to be}} an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel block-interaction model to answer this call. This model can help summarize a collection of frequent itemsets and provide accurate support information using {{only a small number of}} frequent itemsets. At the heart of our approach is a set of <b>core</b> <b>blocks,</b> each of which is the Cartesian product of a frequent itemset and its support transactions. Those <b>core</b> <b>blocks</b> interact with each other through two basic operators (horizontal union and vertical union) to form the complexity of frequent patterns. Each frequent itemset can be expressed and its frequency can be accurately recovered through the combination of these <b>core</b> <b>blocks.</b> This is also the first complete generative model for describing the formation of frequent patterns. Specifically, we relate the problem of finding a minimal block-interaction model to a generalized set-cover problem, referred to as the graph set cover (GSC) problem. We develop an efficient algorithm based on GSC to discover the <b>core</b> <b>blocks.</b> A detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R

30|$|The release {{behavior}} of the NPs is an important aspect because this information {{is directly related to}} the design of nano drug delivery system. Generally, the release of drug from polymeric NPs will depend upon the diffusion rate of the drug from the NPs, NP stability, and the biodegradation rate of the copolymer. If the NPs are stable and the biodegradation rate of the copolymer is slow, the release rate will be most likely influenced by the following factors: the strength of the interactions between the drug and the <b>core</b> <b>block,</b> the physical state of the core, the drug-loaded content, the molecular volume of the drug, the length of the <b>core</b> <b>block,</b> and the localization of the drug within the NPs.|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} fingerprint {{identification system}} (AIFS) {{plays a major}} role in forensic applications such as criminal identification, ATM card verification, etc. The fingerprint enhancement is essential in the issues of AIFS to ensure robust performance. This paper describes the design and implementation of fingerprint enhancement in two stages: extraction of high ridge curvature area (core) and enhancing the <b>core</b> <b>block.</b> This enhancement algorithm is concentrated on enhancing the <b>block,</b> around the <b>core</b> <b>block</b> for two reasons 1) Rich minutiae exist close around the core point. 2) Absence of delta point in certain fingerprint images. This feature of enhancing <b>core</b> <b>block</b> is essential for fast and robust performance of fingerprint verification / identification. The high ridge curvature area is extracted using the local ridge orientation and the enhancement is based on the estimated local ridge orientation and frequency. The system has been tested on a variety of fingerprint images even of very poor quality and the results showed remarkable performance. Experimental results showed that fingerprint enhancement algorithm is best suited for the verification with high accuracy. The complete fingerprint enhancement procedure takes on an average of about three seconds which is remarkably good.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the generation and the propagation in system-on-chips of the switching noise due to embedded <b>core</b> logic <b>blocks.</b> Such disturbances contribute to degrade {{the performance of}} the other on-chip circuits and cause unwanted electromagnetic emission. These parasitic effects can be largely ascribed to the steep currents that flow into the power supply interconnects of the <b>core</b> logic <b>blocks</b> and to the parasitic coupling of the system-on-chip building blocks through the silicon substrate they share. In this work it is shown that the substrate voltage bounce due to the switching noise can be significantly attenuated if conventional low-impedance DC power supplies are replaced by high-impedance one. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through computer simulations and experimental tests carried out on the digital <b>core</b> <b>block</b> of a test chi...|$|R

A technique is presented to correct the measured absorbed dose values for TL efficiency in the radiation climate on-board the spacecraft. Average LET is determined from the high-temperature TL emission in the TLD- 700 glow curve and used as a parameter in the TL efficiency correction.

The agreement between self-consistent field theory and experiment for the micelle structure is sometimes quantitative and is generally more successful than scaling theory. For copolymers with relatively light <b>core</b> <b>blocks,</b> SCFT predictions for the critical micelle concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude.
