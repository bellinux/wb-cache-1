25|$|The {{application}} of copper fungicide {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the {{application of}} fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and <b>control</b> <b>treatment.</b> On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.|$|E
25|$|In Ghana, a {{study that}} {{combined}} the sanitation and fungicide application showed {{a significant reduction in}} the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in <b>control</b> <b>treatment</b> (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Figures {{from the}} 1982 Lebanon war showed that with {{proximal}} treatment 90% of CSR casualties {{returned to their}} unit, usually within 72 hours. With rearward treatment only 40% returned to their unit. It was also found that treatment efficacy went up with {{the application of a}} variety of front line treatment principles versus just one treatment. In Korea, similar statistics were seen, with 85% of US battle fatigue casualties returned to duty within three days and 10% returned to limited duties after several weeks. Though these numbers seem to promote the claims that proximal PIE or BICEPS treatment is generally effective at reducing the effects of combat stress reaction, other data suggests that long term PTSD effects may result from the hasty return of affected individuals to combat. Both PIE and BICEPS are meant to return as many soldiers as possible to combat, and may actually have adverse effects on the long term health of service members who are rapidly returned to the front-line after combat stress <b>control</b> <b>treatment.</b> Although the PIE principles were used extensively in the Vietnam War, the post traumatic stress disorder lifetime rate for Vietnam veterans was 30% in a 1989 US study and 21% in a 1996 Australian study. In a study of Israeli Veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, 37% of veterans diagnosed with CSR during combat were later diagnosed with PTSD, compared with 14% of control veterans.|$|E

A study was made of the effects of seedbed preparation and weed <b>control</b> <b>treatments</b> on seedling establishment in a weed pasture. The seedbed preparations involved plowing and disking as compared to no tillage.

30|$|Results: Six animals (4 <b>controls</b> and 2 <b>treatment)</b> {{were kept}} in the lateral-Trendelenburg {{position}} and aspiration was performed every 4  hours.
