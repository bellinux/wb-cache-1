5|$|Bloodlines is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game optionally presented from the first- or third-person perspective. Before the game begins, players create a {{male or female}} vampire character by selecting a vampire clan and configuring available points in three areas—Attributes, Abilities and Disciplines (vampiric powers)—or by answering questions, which create a character for the player. The player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> one of seven vampire clans: the powerful Brujah, the decadent Toreador, the insane Malkavian, the aristocratic Ventrue, the monstrously-deformed Nosferatu, the blood-magic wielding Tremere, or the animalistic Gangrel.|$|E
5|$|Helping Alisia in her quest are her pet monsters. These creatures {{fly around}} the heroine on their own, attacking her foes, and {{blocking}} enemy attacks from hitting her.

5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. At the start, players <b>can</b> <b>select</b> Sonic, Tails, or both. In {{the latter}} choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join in {{at any time}} and control Tails separately. Sonic 3 adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by {{spinning}} his twin tails like a propeller; when he gets too tired, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.|$|E
5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they <b>can</b> <b>select.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion {{at a location}} called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist <b>can</b> <b>select</b> two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon Compendium, a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E
5|$|Blood Money is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players <b>can</b> <b>select</b> any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E
5|$|In Chocobo Racing, {{the player}} {{controls}} Final Fantasy-inspired characters, {{most of whom}} race in go-karts. Other characters fly, drive scooters, ride magic carpets, or even run. Players have five different racing modes to choose from: Story Mode, Versus Mode, Grand Prix, Relay Race, and Time Attack. In the Story Mode, players are guided through the story of Chocobo Racing, which is narrated by Cid, {{in the form of}} an onscreen version of a pop-up book. Players who complete the Story Mode are given the chance to customize their own racer; completing the Story Mode also unlocks secret character racers. In the Versus Mode, two players can race each other on a horizontally split screen, where one player races viewing the top half of the screen and the other player races viewing the bottom half. In Grand Prix (GP) Mode, the player races computer-controlled opponents in four selected tracks of his or her choice. In Relay Race Mode, the player chooses three racers to compete in a relay match. In Time Attack Mode, the player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> any stage and try to beat the fastest time record set there. There are ten track options: Cid's Test Track, Moogle Forest, The Ancient Gate, Mythril Mines, The Black Manor, Floating Gardens, Gingerbread Land, Vulcan-O Valley, Fantasia, and F.F.VIII Circuit.|$|E

5|$|The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is {{an annual}} {{exhibition}} basketball game played between the Eastern-Conference and the Western-Conference All-Stars. It {{is the main}} event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Twelve players—five starters and seven s—from each conference are chosen {{from a pool of}} 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, with the media and current players each accounting for 25%. The reserves are chosen by voting among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and <b>can</b> <b>select</b> two guards, three big men, and two players regardless of positions. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement. The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.|$|E
5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E
5|$|The game {{retains the}} {{real-time}} battle mechanics of previous {{games in the}} Mana series. The game sports four weapons with their own unique abilities: sword, flail, bow and arrow, and hammer. The player can have two weapons ready to attack with at a time, and {{any of the four}} character options can use any weapon. The player can change which weapons they have available at any time. Each weapon has standard normal attacks, special attacks, and fury attacks. The fury attacks are the strongest and require a full Fury Gauge to use, which is filled by striking enemies with standard attacks and taking damage from enemies. Different weapons can have different effects on the environment, such as the hammer's ability to smash pots. In addition to weapons, the player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> from one of eight Elementals, which provide different magical attacks and magical enhancements to weapon attacks. The player can switch between Elementals in the Mana Village. Elemental attacks can be made stronger by equipping Gems, which can also boost the player's attributes.|$|E

5|$|The player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> any two-member {{permutation}} of {{its five}} playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails {{are available at}} the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman {{over the course of the}} game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air, Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller, Amy can smash enemies with her hammer, Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls, and Cream can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button; for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air. In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.|$|E
5|$|The player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> {{from four}} {{difficulty}} levels: Walk on the Beach, Combat Op, Suicide Mission, and FUBAR. A player only {{gain access to}} the FUBAR difficulty after completing the game on Suicide Mission. Various new weapons and equipment become available as the game progresses, some dropped by downed enemies. These include several different rifles, handguns, and machine guns. Some offer alternate firing modes, like attaching a suppressor or using a telescopic sight. Players can also acquire and make use of grenade launchers, hand grenades, and turrets. However, the player can only carry two weapons at a time. Supply caches can be found {{in different parts of the}} game, allowing the player to refill their ammo and grenades. Whenever the player successfully shoots an enemy in the head, the game enters a slow-motion mode for a short period of time. The player can also defeat enemies at close range via melee combat. Dying enemies can be executed, which grants the player additional ammo. Hiding behind cover can provide protection and prevents the player from being shot, as well as providing opportunities to blindfire or lean out to shoot enemies.|$|E
5|$|When players deal enough {{damage to}} an enemy, they can {{activate}} an execution sequence. Once the execution sequence has been initiated, enemies {{involved in the}} execution are highlighted automatically with colors by the game, and players can perform a series of quick time events by pressing the appropriate buttons. These execution sequences serve to grant additional resources to players, depending on how well the execution is performed. At any time prior to initiating an execution, the player <b>can</b> <b>select</b> one of four categories of executions to perform upon weakened enemies; the selected type of execution determines the type of resource that will be granted when an enemy is executed. Upon completing a successful execution sequence, players are granted the type of execution that was selected. There are four perks available for players. One boosts the player's damage {{for a short period}} after the execution; one refills the player's Focus bar; one allows players to regain lost health, and the last significantly boosts the amount of experience points received from the kill. These experience points can be used to purchase upgrades for various attributes, such as health, damage, or Focus bar capacity, and to unlock additional execution moves. The game still automatically completes and finishes these execution sequences when players fail to press the highlighted buttons, but provides a much smaller reward. Lining up two or more weakened enemies in close proximity allows the player to perform a double execution sequence, which greatly increases the reward granted.|$|E
