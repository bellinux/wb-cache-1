40|$|About 80 % of Albanian {{small scale}} farms farming 1 - 2 dairy cows. The small {{agriculture}} land surface on farm property (1 - 1, 5 ha) {{is the main}} limiting factor for cow’s number increasing. So the farmer interest is not to {{increasing the number of}} cows in their farm but to fattening of calf’s born both for nutritive need of the family and market. The main objective {{of the study was to}} show the effect of industrial crosses (F 1) of Holstein Frison cows with meat breeds like as Piementese(P), Limousine(L), Kianina(C), Sharole(Sh) and Markixhana(M) on meat production increasing on small scale farms. To carried out this objective, two study methods were used: (i) The survey - 284 small scale farms was observed in the Albanian coastal field and (ii) Comparative essay of fattening calves (F 1) in semi intensive small scale farm condition - 32 calves, F 1 crosses of Holstein cows with above mentioned meat breeds were put in fattening in semi intensive small scale farm condition. 6 Holstein breed (H) calves of 3 - 4 months age was used as control group. The feeding of animals was based on forages produced in farm: corn silage 30 % D. M, fresh alpha-alpha and its hay. 35 % of dry matter requirements were supplied by bought concentrate feedstuffs with 15 % crude protein on dry matter bases. The fattening period lasted 8 months. The average daily body weight increasing for each crosses and control group were respectively 889 g (PxH), 998 g (LxH), 850 g (KxH), 1010 g(ChxH), 953 g (MxH) and 702 g (HxH). Multivariate analyses according to a linear model with constant factors (genotype, sex, genotype x sex) and covariance “live body weight in the beginning of experiment” showed that: (i) The effect of crossbreds on average daily gain is evident under the small-scale farms conditions, also, (ii) The average daily gain increases with 23 - 38 %, depending on the type of crosses, (iii) The crosses of dairy cattle with Limousine and Sharole result as most effective. The differences between F 1 crosses of Markigiana, Kianine and Piemonteze are not statistically significant, (iv) In semi intensive small scale farms the <b>calf</b> <b>fattening</b> can start from second month of life, (v) The farmers even though small scale farm condition can produce more meat though the crossing of dairy cattle with meat breeds in comparison with pure dairy breed calves...|$|E
40|$|Dairy farms produce {{significant}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions {{and are therefore}} a focal point for GHG-mitigation practices. To develop viable mitigation options, we need robust (insensitive to changes in model parameters and assumptions) predictions of GHG emissions. To this end, we developed a stochastic model to estimate the robustness of predictions based on input parameters (GHG emission factors and production traits) and their uncertainties. In our study we explored how sensitive predictions of GHG emissions are to three factors: (1) system boundaries of the emission model (2) the uncertainty of input parameters due to quality of data or methodological choices (epistemic uncertainty) and (3) inherent variability in input parameters (variability uncertainty). To assess the effect of system boundaries, we compared two different boundaries: the “dairy farm gate” boundary (all GHG emissions are allocated to milk) and “system expansion” (the model gives a GHG credit to beef derived from culled cows and bull, heifer and <b>calf</b> <b>fattening</b> of surplus dairy calves outside the farm). Results using the farm-gate boundary provide guidance to dairy farmers to reduce GHG emissions of milk production. The results using system expansion are important for defining GHG abatement policies for milk and beef production. We found that the choice of system boundary had the strongest impact on the level and variation of predicted GHG emissions. Model predictions were least robust for lower-yielding dairy cow production systems and when we used system expansion. We also explored which GHG-abatement strategies have the most leverage by assessing the influence of each input parameter on model predictions. Predicted GHG emissions were least sensitive to variability-related uncertainty in production traits (i. e. replacement rate, calving interval). Lower-yielding production systems had the highest variation, indicating the highest potential for GHG mitigation of all production systems studied. Variation in predicted GHG emissions increased substantially when both epistemic and variability uncertainty in emission factors and variability uncertainty in production traits were included in the model. If the system boundary was set at the farm gate, the emission factor of N 2 O from nitrogen input into the soil had the highest impact on variation in predicted GHG emissions. This variation stems from uncertainties in predicting N 2 O emissions (epistemic uncertainty) but also from inherent variability of N 2 O emissions over time and space. The uncertainty of predicted GHG emissions can be reduced by increasing the precision in predicting N 2 O emissions. However, this additional information does not reduce GHG emissions itself. Knowing site specific variability of N 2 O emissions can help reduce GHG emissions by specific management (e. g. reduce soil compaction, adopted manure management, choice of suitable crops). In case of system expansion, uncertainty in GHG emission credit for dairy beef contributed the most to increasing the variation in predicted GHG emissions. The stochastic-model approach gave important insights into the robustness of model outcomes, which is crucial in the search for cost-effective GHG-abatement options. Despite the high degree of uncertainty when using system expansion, its results help identifying global GHG mitigation options of combined milk and beef productio...|$|E

40|$|In March-April 2008 - 09, using CARMA protocols, 81 {{cows and}} 16 calves were {{collected}} in West Greenland from two caribou populations; Akia-Maniitsoq (AM) and Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut (KS). In both populations, warble larvae numbers were highest in calves and higher in non-pregnant than pregnant cows. Nose bots showed no relationship with pregnancy or lactation; KS calves had higher nose bot loads than cows, a pattern not observed in AM. Pregnant cows had more rump fat than non-pregnant cows. KS cows lacking rump fat entirely had the highest warble burdens. We observed lactating pregnant cows with moderate larval burdens. Projected energy cost of the heaviest observed combined larvae burdens was equivalent to 2 - 5 days basal metabolic rate (BMR) for a cow, and 7 - 12 days BMR for a <b>calf.</b> Foregone <b>fattening</b> in adult cows with average burdens was 0. 2 to 0. 5 kg, but almost doubled with the heaviest infestations to 0. 4 and 0. 8 kg. Average burdens in calves resulted in forgone fattening of about 0. 5 kg, with peak costs equivalent to 0. 7 and 1. 1 kg fat for AM and KS calves respectively. Although modest, these projected energy costs of hosting larvae for cows support the negative relationship between rump fat and larvae burden. For calves, hosting high burdens of warble larvae could affect winter survival, specifically those weaned normally in October or in early winter. Harmful effects of oestrid larvae burdens may remain subtle but clearly cumulative in relation to seasonal forage availability and incidence of other parasites...|$|R
40|$|The Kuri is a rare, {{little known}} breed of cattle of the Hamitic Longhorn (Bos taurus longifrons) type which is {{found on the}} islands and shores of Lake Chad Basin in the area {{covering}} the common borders of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. It is taller and more massive than its longhorn counterpart, the trypanotolerant N'Dama. The Kuri is trypanosusceptible. It is a dual-purpose milk-and-meat breed which is tolerant of insect bites and has excellent swimming abilities. It has unique bulbous horns which are believed to aid in flotation as it searches for water weeds, its main food. The Kuri is very well adapted to the aquatic conditions of the Lake but is susceptible to heat stress and solar radiation. The breed is quite fertile, with a reported age at first calving as early as 36 months and a calving interval as short as 15 months. Indeed, the Kuri cow can produce as many as 12 calves in her lifetime. The cow is capable of producing as much as 6 kg of milk a day after feeding her <b>calf</b> and <b>fattens</b> well on pasture and in feedlot. Meat quality of the Kuri is considered exceptional. The limited data on its population and distribution suggest that the Kuri can only survive in the environs {{of the lake and}} is rapidly declining in numbers. Possible reasons for the declining trend include drought, protracted civil conflicts in the region, the retreating waters of the Lake and extensive crossbreeding with the Zebus when they graze on the shores. The trend is exacerbated by lack of improvement programmes for the breed. The authors suggest immediate action to assess the extent of Zebu introgression and the establishment of a breeding/multiplication centre in the Lake area for characterization, enhancement and conservation of the breed...|$|R
