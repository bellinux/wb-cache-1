50|$|Released: December 25, 2006. This edition is {{the special}} final <b>cut</b> <b>edit</b> of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds and is 125 minutes long, fifty-five minutes {{shorter than the}} original. It has added scenes, re-edits, and re-tooled special effects; the {{director}} says this is the definitive version. The Classic War of the Worlds replaces the 3 hour rough cut version, H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, that was widely distributed and is now discontinued.|$|E

50|$|The second {{development}} was cheaper video recorders. Though {{not suitable for}} broadcast use directly, these provided {{a way to make}} a copy of the master, with its time code visibly inserted into a small box or 'time code window' in the picture. This tape could then be played in an office or at home on a video recorder costing only as much as a used car. The editor would note down the numbers of the shots and decide the order. They might simply write them in a list, or they might dub from one of these small machines to another to create a rough <b>cut</b> <b>edit,</b> and note the necessary frame numbers by watching this tape.|$|E
50|$|Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, {{the company}} pioneered in {{integrating}} computers with videotape editing, starting in 1971 with the CMX 600, the first {{non-linear video editing}} system. The 600 was designed primarily for off-line editing, by creating both a rough <b>cut</b> <b>edit</b> of a video program, along with an edit decision list, or EDL. It stored its video & audio content on disk pack drives supplied by Memorex for instant random access of the video content. The 600 was paired with the CMX-200, which took the edit decision list created by the 600, and automatically controlled several VTRs to auto-assemble the final program. The 600 was controlled using a Digital PDP-11 minicomputer, and the 200 used a Teletype Model 33 terminal to input EDLs from the 600.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Sound is a {{vital part}} of daily life for most people, but has yet to be fully {{explored}} in the area of education, particularly in terms of student feedback. Feedback so far has generally been limited to documents if by students and teacher are apart, or by a mixture of documents and talking if students and teacher are face-to-face. The aim of this project is to change this situation, by automating the processes of recording, editing, compression and playback of speech. By developing a series of applications, one for the teacher and another for the student, this project hopes {{to meet the needs of}} student feedback on such a scale as would be suitable for student assessment in a university environment. Specifcally, the design needs to meet the following requirements: The teacher should be able to create, <b>cut,</b> <b>edit,</b> save and load sound files. The students should be able to open and play sound files sent to them by the teacher. As an optional extra (if time permits), the teacher should be able to create a naming convention using student ID's. Able to be operated safely by both student and teacher. Areas that are covered in this document include: sound waveforms, codecs, the meaning of speech compression, comparison of development platforms during project development, issues identifed during development, various libraries investigated, the program itself, and possible topics for future research...|$|E

30|$|To {{help the}} face-tracking process, a {{standard}} shot segmentation derived from color histogram thresholding is provided (segments in blue in Fig. 2 - 1). This is a contiguous segmentation, without in-between gaps corresponding to video <b>cut</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the film exist, the original theatrical version and the director's cut.

50|$|For {{editors and}} {{producers}} wanting to produce broadcast-quality output, Forscene provides an {{environment for the}} early stages of post-production to happen remotely and cheaply(logging, shot selection, collaborative reviewing, rough cutting and offline editing, for example) and more recently fine <b>cut</b> <b>editing.</b> Forscene then outputs instructions in standard formats which {{can be applied to the}} high-quality master-footage for detailed and high-quality editing prior to broadcast.|$|R
50|$|When {{the rights}} reverted to Warner Bros. in 1985, CBS aired the film {{one last time}} on network {{television}} in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable) TV stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut. The stations that showed the extended <b>cut</b> <b>edited</b> the second half to squeeze in commercials and 'What happened yesterday flashbacks'.|$|R
5000|$|Formalism, at {{its most}} general, {{considers}} the synthesis (or lack of synthesis) of the multiple elements of film production, and the effects, emotional and intellectual, of that synthesis and of the individual elements. For example, take the single element of editing. A formalist might study how standard Hollywood [...] "continuity editing" [...] creates a more comforting effect and non-continuity or jump <b>cut</b> <b>editing</b> might become more disconcerting or volatile.|$|R

50|$|Not {{only was}} {{destructive}} art seen in traditional art, but also performance art. Jeff Keen, a film-maker, included forms of destruction in his “collaged films”. Keen would <b>cut</b> and <b>edit</b> scenes from pop culture, comics, and other films to create “multi-screen projections”. His films {{were seen as}} disconnected and jumbled which confused viewers. Keen symbolizes destruction in his <b>cut</b> and <b>edit</b> skills of previous works. By using other sources and editing them together, Keen has destructed the old and created something new.|$|R

40|$|This essay reads Lyndsey Turner’s 2015 Hamlet at the Barbican Theatre in London {{against the}} production’s priorities, namely, being star, new {{audience}} and box-office driven. It explores {{the negotiation of}} the script, space and politics {{at the heart of}} this production. Giving its due when discussing the cinematic employment of <b>cuts,</b> <b>editing,</b> lighting and freeze frames, it acknowledges that some of the special effects were lost to the theatre spectator, per force cast in a secondary role in a production that prioritised live-streaming across the world...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the theatrical <b>cut,</b> D'Souza <b>edited</b> an 80-minute <b>cut</b> for educational purposes, removing interviews with political pundits. He said, [...] "It's all purely historical content now." ...|$|R
