25|$|Early grain {{elevators}} and bins {{were often}} built of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire. Grain-elevator bins, tanks, and silos are now usually {{made of steel}} or reinforced concrete. Bucket elevators are used to lift grain to a distributor or <b>consignor,</b> from which it falls through s and/or conveyors and into one or more bins, silos, or tanks in a facility. When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers, and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos it is conveyed, blended, and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges, and shipped to grain wholesalers, exporters, and/or local end-users, such as flour mills, breweries, and ethanol and alcohol distilleries.|$|E

40|$|The Road Safety Remuneration Act 2012 (Cth) (the Act) {{explicitly}} {{enables the}} Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to make orders that can impose binding requirements {{on all the}} participants in the road transport supply chain, including <b>consignors</b> and consignees at the apex the chain, for the pay and safety of both employee and independent contractor drivers. The tribunal is also specifically empowered to make enforceable orders to reduce or remove remuneration related incentives and pressures that contribute to unsafe work practices in the road transport industry. Recently the tribunal handed down its first order. The article considers whether, and the degree to which, the tribunal has been willing to exercise its explicit power to impose enforceable obligations on <b>consignors</b> and consignees — such as large supermarket chains — at the apex of road transport supply chains. It examines the substance and extent of the obligations imposed by the tribunal, including whether the tribunal has exercised the full range of powers vested in it by the Act. We contend that the tribunal’s first order primarily imposes obligations on direct work providers and drivers without making large, powerful <b>consignors</b> and consignees substantively responsible for driver pay and safety. We argue that the tribunal’s first order could have more comprehensively fulfilled the objectives of the Act by more directly addressing the root causes of low pay and poor safety in the road transport industry...|$|R
2500|$|This is the practice, {{especially}} by high-end art auctioneers, of raising false bids at crucial {{times in the}} bidding {{in order to create}} the appearance of greater demand or to extend bidding momentum for a work on offer. To call out these nonexistent bids auctioneers might fix their gaze at a point in the auction room that is difficult for the audience to pin down. The practice is frowned upon in the industry. In the United States, chandelier bidding is not illegal. In fact, an auctioneer may bid up the price of an item to the reserve price, which is an unstated amount the <b>consignor</b> will not sell the item for. [...] However, the auction house is required to disclose this information.|$|E

The clerk in Terry Kelly's said A crown! but the <b>consignor</b> held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the {{footpaths}} were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions.

40|$|In this paper, we have empirically {{analyzed}} {{the factors that}} lead to longer business relationships in the logistics industry. The main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, the terms of relationships observed between the <b>consignors</b> and the trucking carriers that receive consignment of the transportation of the <b>consignor’s</b> main products have significantly positive associations {{with the level of}} information exchanged and consignments of distribution processing operations proposed by the consignee. Transaction cost economics implies that long-term relationships facilitate investment in relation-specific assets so as to improve efficiency. Then, we have sound reason to assume that the content of the shared information and the equipment for distribution processing have a significantly relation-specific nature, and accumulation of the related human capital, such as skill in workers and know-how, is important to improve efficiency of the whole logistics system. At the same time, these assets may function as hostages to maintain the long-term relationships. In regard to all of these points, the same mechanism is at work as in the commercial distribution market. The second conclusion is that the long-term business relationship is affected by the demand volatility of the <b>consignor’s</b> product. <b>Consignors</b> who belong to industries with a large volatility of demand tend to rely on transportation services procured from spot logistics markets with a shorter contract term. This finding is also consistent with previous research in the commercial distribution market. These results suggest that the mechanism to minimize transaction costs by establishing long- term business relationships is likely to exist in the logistics market. This is the same mechanism which is pointed out in the commercial distribution market. Generally, assets consisting of a system with a network structure tend to be sunken. Therefore, in order to save coordination costs which are incurred to make the whole distribution market function efficiently, long-term business relationships are indispensable. Thus, relationships between companies in the logistics market are likely to be affected by the shortening of the delivery time in the commercial distribution market. transaction cost, logistics, Japanese system, long-term relationship...|$|R

40|$|The US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have jointly {{prepared}} a comprehensive set of draft guidance for <b>consignors</b> and inspectors {{to use when}} applying the newly imposed regulatory requirements for low specific activity (LSA) material and surface contaminated objects (SCOs). The guidance is being developed to facilitate compliance with the new LSA material and SCO requirements, not to impose additional requirements. These new requirements represent, in some areas, significant departures from {{the manner in which}} packaging and transportation of these materials and objects were previously controlled. On occasion, it may be appropriate to use conservative approaches to demonstrate compliance with some of the requirements, ensuring that personnel are not exposed to radiation at unnecessary levels, so that exposures are kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). In the draft guidance, one such approach would assist <b>consignors</b> preparing a shipment {{of a large number of}} SCOs in demonstrating compliance without unnecessarily exposing personnel. In applying this approach, users need to demonstrate that four conditions are met. These four conditions are used to categorize non-activated, contaminated objects as SCO- 2. It is expected that, by applying this approach, it will be possible to categorize a large number of small contaminated objects as SCO- 2 without the need for detailed, quantitative measurements of fixed, accessible contamination, or of total (fixed and non-fixed) contamination on inaccessible surfaces.

Among his reasoning for adopting the Arkansaurus as the state dinosaur Oury pointed out that Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri all have listed state dinosaurs, and Arkansas already has 24 designated state symbols, and since it was the 25th state to be admitted to the union, it made sense to add one more.
