40|$|AbstractThe paper {{introduces}} a new patch-based dissimilarity measure for image comparison employing an approximation strategy. It extends the Average Common Sub-matrix measure computing the exact dissimilarity among images. In the exact method, dissimilarity between two images is obtained {{by considering the}} average area of the biggest square sub-matrices in common between the images, by exact match of the extracted sub-matrices pixel by pixel. As an extension, the proposed dissimilarity measure computes an approximate match between the sub-matrices, which is obtained by omitting a controlled number of pixels at a given <b>column</b> <b>offset</b> inside the sub-matrices. The proposed dissimilarity measure is extensively compared with other well-known approximate methods for image comparison in the state-of-the-art. Experiments demonstrate {{the superiority of the}} proposed approximate measure in terms of execution time with respect to the exact method, and in terms of retrieval precision with respect to the other state-of-the-art methods...|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} type of {{magazine}} in modern rifles and handguns, a box magazine stores cartridges in a column, either one above the other or staggered zigzag fashion. This zigzag stack is often {{identified as a}} double-column or double-stack since a single staggered column is actually two side-by-side vertical <b>columns</b> <b>offset</b> by half of the diameter of a round. As the firearm cycles, cartridges are moved {{to the top of}} the magazine by a follower driven by spring compression to either a single feed position or side-by-side feed positions. Box magazines may be integral to the firearm or removable.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} ISO a and BIMA {{observations of}} the z = 0. 04 Seyfert 1 ring galaxy NGC 985 which suggest close parallels with some quasar host galaxies. NGC 985 contains two closely spaced nuclei embedded in an R 1 / 4 –law stellar bulge and an outer ring, evidence of an ongoing merger. The system contains ∼ 1. 8 × 10 10 M ⊙ of highly disturbed molecular gas which lies in an asymmetric bar-like structure with the peak in observed CO <b>column</b> densities significantly <b>offset</b> from the compact double nucleus. In contrast to this, the ISO observations show strong dust emission centered on the AGN, located {{in one of the}} two nuclei. Fainter CO, MIR, and radio continuum emission provide a glimpse of the complexities of star formation in the outer ring. An analysis of the kinematics of the main CO emission reveal evidence for two dynamically distinct molecular components within NGC 985. The first is a set of isolated super-giant molecular clouds (SGMCs) which are concentrated within 9 – 10 kpc of the active nucleus. Although randomly distributed about the center, the clouds may form part of a clumpy highly-disturbed disk which may be either just forming around double-nucleus (the making of a ULIRG), or alternatively may be in the process of bein...|$|R
40|$|Mahoney Lake is a {{permanently}} anoxic and sulfidic (euxinic) {{lake that}} has a dense plate of purple sulfur bacteria positioned at mid-water depth (∼ 7 m) where free sulfide intercepts the photic zone. We analyzed the isotopic composition of sulfate (δ 34 SSO 4 and δ 18 OSO 4), sulfide (δ 34 SH 2 S), and the water (δ 18 OH 2 O) to track the potentially coupled processes of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and phototrophic sulfide oxidation within an aquatic environment with extremely high sulfide concentrations (> 30 mM). Large isotopic offsets observed between sulfate and sulfide within the monimolimnion (δ 34 SSO 4 -H 2 S = 51 ‰) and within pore waters along the oxic margin (δ 34 SSO 4 -H 2 S > 50 ‰) are consistent with sulfate reduction in both the sediments and the anoxic water column. Given the high sulfide concentrations of the lake, sulfur disproportionation is likely inoperable or limited to a very narrow zone in the chemocline, and therefore the large instantaneous fractionations are best explained by the microbial process of sulfate reduction. Pyrite extracted from the sediments reflects the isotopic composition of water column sulfide, suggesting that pyrite buried in the euxinic depocenter of the lake formed in the water <b>column.</b> The <b>offset</b> between sulfate and dissolved sulfide decreases at the chemocline (δ 34 SSO 4 -H 2 S = 37 ‰), a trend possibly explained by elevated sulfate reduction rates and inconsistent with appreciable disproportionation within this interval. Water column sulfate exhibits a linear response in δ 18 OSO 4 –δ 34 SSO 4 and the slope of this relationship suggests relatively high sulfate reduction rates that appear to respond to seasonal changes in the productivity of purple sulfur bacteria. Although photosynthetic activity within the microbial plate influences the δ 18 OSO 4 –δ 34 SSO 4 relationship, the biosignature for photosynthetic sulfur bacteria is restricted to the oxic/anoxic transition zone and is apparently minor relative to the more prevalent process of sulfate reduction operative throughout the light-deprived deeper anoxic water column and sediment pore waters...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of seismic waves in inhomogenious media is influenced mainly by the reflection/transmission process at seismic boundaries and by attenuation inside the layers. Small scale (in {{relation to the}} profile length) variations of mean seismic amplitude level are frequently observed in onshore exploration for oil. Detailed investigations relating the cause of diminishing are unknown. Starting with {{the hypothesis that the}} described effect relates to near surface inhomogeneities a new technique was developed. It provides information for the interpretation of amplitudes and frequencies of deep seismic soundings. As for the changed amplitude level, some 'dynamic' parameter have been calculated from the spectra of the data and put into a surface chart. Colour coding leads to special arrangements of rows and columns. A crossing of equal coloured rows and <b>columns</b> at zero <b>offset</b> position in the surface chart means that there is a good agreement between the subsurface conditions of shots and receiver at the same profile position, respectively. Searching for crosses means searching for positions on the profile where the transmission conditions are disturbed in relation to geophones and source points. Applications of this new technique have been performed successfully with model data and with parameters life f_m_a_x, bandwidth, mean amplitude and energy. A careful and thorough analysis of vibrator reflection data shows that there has been an unknown normalization before correlation. Therefore this data has been excluded from further amplitude investigations. The method developed is a contribution to the interpretation of deep seismic reflection data. Its potential consists in a compressed representation of information from the subsurface. That can be used to correct for amplitude changes which otherwise are interpreted as crustal effects. (orig.)
