5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the <b>city</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>city</b> <b>core</b> is {{situated}} in a region dominated by old Hercynian granites, including Póvoa de Varzim Granite and Santo André Granite. A continuous area dominated by schist exists to the Northeast and vernacular architecture of the rural areas highlight the local geological diversity. Oldest rocks, from the Pre-Ordovician epoch, {{are found in the}} Schist-greywacke Complex between Rates, Laundos, and Estela. Wandering even further Northeast, there is shale of micaceous clay nature, occasionally quartzite, dating to the Devonian period, that may contain fossils.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, a Lane County {{planning}} director {{predicted that}} by 1980, residents of Eugene {{would live in}} an age of push-button automation where hands-free cars would speed them into the <b>city</b> <b>core,</b> and they could park in multi-story structures and be whisked on moving sidewalks to an extensive, plastic-covered shoppers' mall.|$|E

25|$|The Post–World War II {{economic}} expansion created a gradual exodus from <b>city</b> <b>core</b> {{areas in the}} United States, and federally funded urban renewal projects empowered communities to demolish historic downtown areas and build new, modern structures. With dramatic increases in automobile purchases accompanied by a post-WWII decline in public transportation, many communities accepted urban renewal financing to demolish buildings and install much-needed parking areas.|$|E
25|$|Baku has wildly varying architecture, {{ranging from}} the Old <b>City</b> <b>core</b> to modern {{buildings}} and the spacious layout of the Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in eclectic style. Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Bern had {{expanded}} as far as it could within the old city walls. An increasing number of people were living outside the city walls in neighboring communities. Throughout the nineteenth century, this ring of modern cities grew up around the Old City without forcing it to demolish the medieval <b>city</b> <b>core.</b> However, the growth around the Old City did lead to several projects.|$|E
25|$|Downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring are {{the largest}} urban {{business}} hubs in the county; combined, they rival many major <b>city</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R

25|$|During Li's ten-year {{tenure in}} the city, his {{government}} reportedly spent some 12 million yuan (~$1.96 million) {{to hire a}} Peking University architecture professor to oversee the redesign of the entire <b>city</b> <b>core.</b> Within the <b>city</b> <b>core,</b> a large and elaborate government complex was constructed modeled on classical Chuyun Hanfeng (楚韵汉风) style architecture. The imposing and elaborate nature of the complex has elicited comparisons with Zhongnanhai, the residential compound of China's leaders. Li's government also spent some 70 million yuan ($11.42 million) for the Ruyi Avenue project, a giant axial thoroughfare through the city that was decorated with 9,999 lotus flowers, and reputed to be the longest Hanbaiyu (a form of alabaster) road in the world. A giant water fountain that could reach a height of 100 meters was also constructed. While some residents criticized these projects as needlessly extravagant, Li's supporters believed that the projects increased the prestige and image of Pizhou and {{played a role in}} attracting further investment into the city. They also asserted that these projects were mostly completed without much cost to the local taxpayer.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of the trams have {{suggested}} expanding the tramway from its present terminus at St. Olav's Gate through the <b>city</b> <b>core</b> to Trondheim Central Station or Nedre Elvehavn onwards to Brattøra and Trondheim Port. This {{has been supported}} by the city council, but no definite decision has been made. Estimates of costs lay between NOK 50 and 80 million, with completion in 2009 {{at the same time}} as Nordre Avlastningsvei.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{the city}} {{boundary}} was expanded by the 'Greater Bandung' (Bandung Raya) plan; with a relocation of higher concentration development zones {{outside the city}} {{in an attempt to}} dilute population density in the old city. During this development, the <b>city</b> <b>core</b> was often uprooted, with old buildings torn down, lot sizes regrouped and rezoned, changing idyllic residential areas to commercial zones with bustling chain supermarkets, malls, banks and upscale developments.|$|E

25|$|On weekdays all {{stations}} are served {{at least every}} 10 minutes until the evening. There are six main lines and one peak hour support line. Since all lines, with exception of one, use the same path through the <b>city</b> <b>core,</b> train departures occur every second minute there, at the general limit of metro lines. On most suburban lines, trains depart every five minutes. On Sundays these time intervals are doubled.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} five barrios {{within the city}} limits (Canas Urbano, Machuelo Abajo, Magueyes Urbano, Portugués Urbano, and San Antón) that in {{addition}} to the original six <b>city</b> <b>core</b> barrios — named Primero, Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, Quinto, and Sexto — make up the 11 urban zone barrios of the municipality. The historic zone of the city is within these original six core city barrios. These eleven barrios composed {{what is known as the}} urban zone of the municipality.|$|E
25|$|The city sprawls {{along the}} eastern slopes of lake Storsjön {{and most of the}} city and the <b>city</b> <b>core</b> itself is located on the {{mainland}}, facing the non mainland part of the city, the island of Frösön, which for a very long time was the actual centre of Jämtland. Today, a sizeable part of the city's population live on the slopes of the island that face the city centre. Östersund is a bimunicipal town because a minor part of it with roughly 400 inhabitants is actually situated in Krokom Municipality.|$|E
50|$|Area code 314 {{serves the}} {{independent}} city of St. Louis, Missouri {{including some of}} its suburbs in neighboring St. Louis County. Most of the suburbs in area code 314 are to the northwest or west-central from the <b>city's</b> <b>core.</b>|$|R

25|$|Downtown Dallas has {{undergone}} a series of important changes that city officials believe will drastically improve the <b>city's</b> <b>core.</b> These changes are located in four downtown areas: Victory Park, the Arts District, the Trinity River, and the Convention center corridor.|$|R
25|$|The {{settlement}} was inhabited by aboriginal people called Comechingones, {{who lived in}} communities called Ayllus. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suquía River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa, planned the first layout {{of the city as}} a grid of seventy blocks. Once the <b>city</b> <b>core</b> had been moved to its current location, it acquired a stable population. Its economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.|$|E
25|$|Tri-Rail {{service on}} the FEC line would bring {{stations}} to Downtown Miami's transit hub, Government Center Station via the new MiamiCentral station under construction for All Aboard Florida's Brightline service, as well as service in Midtown Miami/Miami Design District, Upper East Side/Miami Shores, North Miami, North Miami Beach/Aventura, Downtown Hollywood, and Downtown Fort Lauderdale, putting it {{within walking distance of}} thousands of potential riders. Getting to and from the current stations has always been a major detractor of Tri-Rail's convenience since opening. Miami's Downtown Development Authority along with Miami-area politicians are actively lobbying to bring Tri-Rail to the <b>city</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{capital was}} the {{political}} nerve {{centre of the}} empire {{as well as a}} center of commerce and pilgrimage. Envoys from other kingdoms, merchants, pilgrims, soldiers and ordinary people all travelled about in the great city on its extensive network of roads. Research has shown over 80 transportation related sites linked by several broad roads about 30 to 60m wide that were the major transport routes into the <b>city</b> <b>core.</b> Smaller roads, less than 10m wide, led to temples, settlements and irrigation fields. All major roadways could be monitored from watch towers, gates and rest houses.|$|E
50|$|Philadelphia's City Hall {{is another}} example, {{situated}} on Penn Square where Broad and Market Streets intersect. The two streets form the north-south and east-west axes of the <b>city's</b> <b>core</b> grid, leaving the large masonry structure visible from all {{sections of the}} city.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{what its}} name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region {{is not the}} capital of Belgium in itself.

25|$|The four acre site {{runs along}} {{the eastern edge of}} Birmingham Snow Hill station, which marks the western {{boundary}} of the site. To the north, the site is bounded by Great Charles Street Queensway and St. Chad's Circus on the Inner Ring Road, and to the east the site is bounded by Snow Hill Queensway. To the south the site is bounded by Colmore Circus. It is located between the <b>City</b> <b>Core</b> and the Gun and Jewellery Quarters. The level of the site drops significantly from Colmore Circus to St. Chad's Circus and also drops from Snow Hill Queensway to the railway station.|$|E
25|$|To ensure Mirabel's survival, all {{international}} flights for Montreal {{were banned}} from Dorval from 1975 to 1997. However, public pressure {{in support of}} Dorval prevented its planned closure. As a result, Dorval's continued existence made Mirabel comparatively expensive and unattractive to airlines and travellers alike. While Dorval was only 20 minutes away from the <b>city</b> <b>core,</b> it took 50 minutes to get to Mirabel even in ideal traffic conditions. Passengers who used Montreal in transit had to take long bus rides for connections from domestic to international flights, and Montrealers grew to resent Mirabel as {{they were forced to}} travel far out of town for international flights.|$|E
25|$|This form of {{government}} was scrapped in 1950 {{in favor of a}} council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the <b>city</b> <b>core</b> began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metro-area population is over 600,000 today.|$|E

25|$|Downtown Fargo {{has been}} gentrified {{due in part}} to {{investments}} by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone.
