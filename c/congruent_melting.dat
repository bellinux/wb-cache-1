It can be contrasted with incongruent melting. This generally happens in two-component systems. To take a general case, let A and B be the two components and AB a stable solid compound formed by their chemical combination. If we draw a phase diagram for the system, we notice that there are three solid phases, namely A, B and compound AB. Accordingly, there will be three fusion or freezing point curves AC, BE and CDE for the three solid phases. In the phase diagram, we can notice that the top point D of the phase diagram is the <b>congruent</b> <b>melting</b> point of the compound AB because the solid and liquid phases now have the same composition.

The phase diagram of the system TBAOH + water was first investigated, confirming the existence of one <b>congruent</b> <b>melting</b> hydrate and one non-congruent melting hydrate. Secondly, the effect of hydrogen pressure was studied under the range from 0 to 40 MPa, and salt mole fractions from 0. 0083 to 0. 0244. (p, T) equilibrium data for hydrate dissociation in the system H 2 + TBAOH + water were determined. These results showed that hydrogen has a strong stabilizing effect on the non-congruent TBAOH hydrate structure, dissociation temperatures being increased by about 8 K under a pressure of 40 MPa. This effect was attributed to hydrogen enclathration into the TBAOH hydrate structure. Hydrogen pressure revealed to have much less effect on {{the stability of the}} <b>congruent</b> <b>melting</b> TBAOH hydrate, the increase in dissociation temperatures being of the order of 1 K at 40 MPa, therefore indicating an absence of H 2 enclathration.

Alloys were prepared by argon-arc or vacuum-electron beam melting of elemental powder blends. X-ray powder diffraction, metallography, SEM and EMPA-techniques were employed to analyze the samples in the as-cast state as well as after annealing at 800, 900 and 1000 °C. The existence of the four ternary compounds, τ 1 to τ 4, has been confirmed, although homogeneity regions differ significantly from reports in the literature. The homogeneous phase, previously claimed at “Al 23 Ni 26 Ti 51 ”, is shown by high resolution microprobe and X-ray diffraction measurements to be an extremely fine-grained eutectic structure.
