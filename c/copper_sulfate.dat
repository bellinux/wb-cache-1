5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate.</b> Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Anhydrous copper(II) sulfate {{is a white}} solid. It can be {{produced}} by dehydration of the hydrates. It occurs as the very rare mineral known as chalcocyanite.

Uneaten vegetables can very quickly decompose and create water quality problems.To keep a clean substrate, some shrimp keepers put a glass bowl or glass plate on the bottom for the food.

The mountain formation created extensive folding with numerous anticlines and synclines across much of Norway.

40|$|Basic <b>copper</b> <b>sulfates,</b> CuSO 4 (OH) 4 and cuprite, Cu 20, are {{the major}} {{corrosion}} products found during field exposure of copper. The active species of the atmosphere which lead to formation of these corrosion products are, however, still uncertain. In this study, we investigated whether submicron acid ammonium sulfate particles, NH 4 HSO 4, can lead to for-mation of a patina with the above composition. The corrosion process was followed by various analytical techniques, including in situ analysis by X-ray diffraction, pH, and scanning Kelvin probe measurements. The main corrosion prod-ucts found at 300 K are mixed ammonium <b>copper</b> <b>sulfates,</b> (NH 4) 2 Cu(SO 4) (OH) 2 xH 2 O, and small amounts of cuprite, Cu 20. Those formed at 373 IC are antlerite, Cu 3 (S 04) (OH) 4, and cuprite Cu 20. From the room temperature results, NH 4 HSO 4 {{does not appear to}} be responsible for patina formation. The corrosion mechanism is discussed and compared to that of copper with (NHJ 2 SO 4 particles, which has earlier been shown' 2 to lead to the corrosion products found in field exposed copper. Iniroduction During atmospheric corrosion of copper, a patina is formed over time. Initially, a layer of Cu 20, CuO, and Cu 0 xH,O forms. Cuprite, Cu 20, is the main component.
