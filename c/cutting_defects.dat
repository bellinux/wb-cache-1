40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the influences of carbon fibers on the fracture mechanism of carbon fibers both in macroscopic view and microscopic view by using single-point flying cutting method. Cutting tools with three different materials were used in this research, namely, PCD (polycrystalline diamond) tool, CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamond thin film coated carbide tool and uncoated carbide tool. The influence of fiber orientation on the cutting force and fracture topography were analyzed and conclusions were drawn that cutting forces are not affected by cutting speeds but significantly influenced by the fiber orientation. Cutting forces presented smaller values in the fiber orientation of 0 / 180 ° and 15 / 165 ° but the highest one in 30 / 150 °.

40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP) {{have seen}} {{a significant increase in}} use over the years thanks to their specific properties. Despite continuous improvements in the production methods of laminated parts, a trimming operation is still necessary to achieve the functional dimensions required by engineering specifications. Laminates made of carbon fibers are very abrasive and cause rapid tool wear, and require high cutting temperatures. This creates damage to the epoxy matrix, whose glass-transition temperature is often recognized to be about 180 °C. This study aims to highlight the influence of the cutting temperature generated by tool wear on the surface finish and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests. Trimming operations were performed on a quasi-isotropic 24 -ply carbon/epoxy laminate, of 3. 6 mm thickness, with a 6 flutes diamond-coated (CVD) cutter. The test specimens of 6 mm and 12 mm wide were obtained by trimming. The reduced width of the coupons allowed amplification of the effect of defects on the measured properties by increasing the proportion of coupon cross-section occupied by the defects. A new tool and a tool in an advanced state of wear were used to generate different cutting temperatures. Results showed a cutting temperature of 300 °C for the new tool and 475 °C for the worn tool. The analysis revealed that the specimens machined with the new tool have no thermal damage and the cut is clean. The plies oriented at − 45 ° presented the worst surface finish according to the failure mode of the fiber. For the worn tool, the surface was degraded and the matrix was carbonized. After cutting, observations showed a degraded resin spread on the machined surface, which reduced the surface roughness and hid the <b>cutting</b> <b>defects.</b> In support of these observations, the tensile tests showed no variation of the mechanical properties for the 12 mm-wide specimens, but did show a 10 % loss in mechanical properties for the 6 mm-wide specimens.

When the edge radius is 20 µm, the least wear can be obtained. Then tool wear value increases with the edge radius. A suitable edge radius will have a reasonable cutting temperature distribution.

Thus, in this study, a fly-cut system developed as an attachment on ultra-precision turning machine is used to explore the problems associated with micro-groove machining. Burr formation mechanism is discussed both theoretically and experimentally. With the further development in the process, micro-grooves that are burrminimized and with mirror finish have been successfully obtained.

40|$|Although Germany has a {{share of}} 15 % of all plywood {{consumed}} in Europe, the German plywood producers have a market share as low as 1 % in Europe. On the other hand, German forests have a high stock of logs suitable {{for the production of}} plywood. In order to make plywood production in Germany attractive for investors again, improvements in manufacturing technology are necessary, and new technology should enable plywood producers to broaden their raw material basis [1]. Material yield using present technology is estimated to approximately 40 % due to losses caused by defects, peeling, drying, trimming etc. During the drying process and due to anisotropic shrinking of the veneer ribbon splits and wavy edges appear. Although several methods are used to achieve an "ironing effect", drying losses cannot be avoided. A possible solution could be processing veneer sheets in a hot press. An increase in yield seems possible if the peeled veneers are processed in a way which adapts to the real size and frequency of defects: Clipping of fixed sizes and post-grading is one possibility, and <b>cutting</b> of <b>defects</b> and joining the sheets to an endless ribbon free of defects is the other choice. But a decision one of the alternatives is only possible of the defects on a veneer ribbon typical for the available material are recorded and processing regimes are simulated and evaluated by yield.

At room temperature the anisotropies decrease with irradiation due to the <b>defects</b> <b>cutting</b> the conducting chains into decoupled segments. A quite satisfactory fit of all the dose and temperature curves in the longitudinal and transverse directions has been obtained with a law accounting for the chain segmentation and for the transverse hopping from segment to segment.

At low temperature (21 K) the anisotropies increase with irradiation dose up to a defect concentration where the Peierls transition has been smeared out of the resistivity vs. temperature curves. When the anisotropy values are those of the metallic state the anisotropies decrease with dose {{as in the case of}} room temperature irradiations.

Methods: The teeth were divided as follows: a) K 3 (SybronEndo, Orange, CA, EUA) (with radial bands) and b) ProTaper (Dentsply-Maillefer, Tulsa, Oklahoma, EUA) (without radial bands). The files were assessed by {{scanning electronic microscopy}} before first use to visualize fabrication defects, and after 7 and 13 cycles of debridement in the canals.

40|$|Accelerating {{a project}} can be rewarding. The consequences, however, can be {{troublesome}} if productivity and quality are sacrificed {{for the sake}} of remaining ahead of schedule, such that the actual schedule benefits are often barely worth the effort. The tradeoffs and paths of schedule pressure and its causes and effects are often overlooked when schedule decisions are being made. This paper analyses the effects that schedule pressure has on construction performance, and focuses on tradeoffs in scheduling. A research framework has been developed using a causal diagram to illustrate the cause-and-effect analysis of schedule pressure. An empirical investigation has been performed by using survey data collected from 102 construction practitioners working in 38 construction sites in Singapore. The results of this survey data analysis indicate that advantages of increasing the pace of work—by working under schedule pressure—can be offset by losses in productivity and quality. The negative effects of schedule pressure arise mainly by working out of sequence, generating work <b>defects,</b> <b>cutting</b> corners, and losing the motivation to work. The adverse effects of schedule pressure can be minimized by scheduling construction activities realistically and planning them proactively, motivating workers, and by establishing an effective project coordination and communication mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of the {{allowances}} for shrinkage, scrap in <b>cutting,</b> and <b>defects</b> in the materials pose challenges in planning quantity of fabric for production control and management. In addition, the garment business {{in general is}} a low margin competitive business, the fashion business tend to be high variety, change dynamically – and with relatively long lead time for fabric production, estimating the amount of fabric required often becomes an important factor deciding the business profitability. Therefore, most companies have implemented a series of existing ordinary processes for achieving accurate fabric estimation. However, a flood of obsolete and overrun fabric is commonly found in the warehouse and storages in most companies. Against this background of overrun, {{a high percentage of}} orders have found actual shortages of fabric to fulfill a customer’s requirement. This thesis attempts to develop a new methodology to design a fabric planning process to ensure sufficient quantity of garments can be produced on time with low cost and minimum fabric wastage. Though most of the data required to solve the above problems often can be found within the companies, the communication among different functional departments {{have not been able to}} take advantage of the wealth of these information and thus, the problems persist. To ensure timely flow of key information between technicians representing the production side and the merchandizing department representing the customer side, business process design is applied to solve the root problem. A step-wise structured business process methodology consisting of five design stages with Axiomatic design concept is developed. Lean process principles and lean process principles and lean information flow ideas are also introduced to the methodology. Finally, using a real case study, an evaluation of a process design is demonstrated. The approach is further validates with a simulation model.

40|$|Purpose: The {{work was}} aimed at {{temperature}} measurement {{with respect to the}} heating process in the bundles of metal sheets in the direct cutting zone during the cutting process conducted on a guillotine. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a methodology to analyse the process of heating the bundles of metal sheets during cutting on a guillotine, designed and built from scratch. The temperature in bundles in the direct cutting zone has been determined in an experimental way using a specialised infrared camera. The research has been conducted {{in order to reduce the}} number of randomly occurring <b>defects</b> during <b>cutting</b> of metal sheets on a guillotine. Findings: Possibilities of finding of the optimum cutting parameters on account of maximum permissible temperature in the bundles of metal sheets have been determined. The experimental data indicates that it is possible to select a set of guillotine parameters which allow for reducing of temperature measured in the direct cutting zone. Temperature reduction allows for avoidance of defects which might occur in the direct cutting zone as the result of progressing heat transfer during <b>cutting.</b> The <b>defects</b> occurring on the blade of a cutting tool might also contribute to the local growth of temperature corresponding to the positions of the defects on the blade. Research limitations/implications: The experimentally assumed characteristics of temperature versus time for in advance chosen cutting parameters may be generalized for a wide gamut of materials and for changeable cutting conditions; however, the obtained experimentally values of temperature are specific and related to the chosen types of materials and fixed cutting conditions of a guillotine. Practical implications: The appropriate selection of the cutting parameters on account of temperature characteristics is essential in terms of industrial economy. It enables reducing the amount of waste caused by <b>defects</b> in <b>cutting</b> bundles of sheets and decreases wear of the cutting tool. Originality/value: The results acquired from the research form a base for selection of the best parameter settings required for conducting the optimum cutting process on a guillotine. The optimum set of cutting parameters combined with the lowest possible value of temperature generated in the direct cutting zone leads to the reduction of defects’ number occurring during the process...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHow to electromagnetically test damaged {{anisotropic}} multilayers like planar composite panels {{applied in}} aeronautic and automotive {{industry is a}} difficult question to solve: one needs fast and robust inversion algorithms aimed at measuring transforming fields (in high- frequency cases, microwaves) or impedances (in low-frequency cases, eddy-currents) and transforming the results into images amenable to end-users’ decision about the damages. Besides, {{it is also important}} to have the results in close-to-real-time. Yet one also needs accurate modeling of the multilayers’ responses to the electromagnetic sources at preliminary forward stage. Here, one proposes a comprehensive solution aimed at modeling the scattering by such multilayers, in harmony with [1 - 2]. It involves particularly the fast calculation of dyadic Green’s functions for uniaxial multilayers and the response of sources distributed within, and solutions of the associated inverse problems in the hypothesis of small defects. The Green’s functions have to be accurate even when the sources are far away from the origin, which yields a fast-oscillating spectrum of the dyads, as carefully considered in the present contribution. The material of defects could be isotropic, like voids or fluid-filled cavities, or even uniaxial. Here, “small defects” means with respect to the wavelengths or skin-depth of the probing waves at location of the defects depending on the conductivity of the medium. A first-order solution of the direct problem involving possibly anisotropic defects described by the depolarization tensors will be presented and compared to a somewhat brute- force approach involving <b>cutting</b> the small <b>defects</b> into smaller pieces [3]. To some extent, the inversion proposed herein is the generalization of the work summarized in [4]. The focus is on MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) imaging which calls for the input of dyadic Green’s functions which associate sources assumed in the region of interests, excited by a finite-array input source and scattering when testing the damaged medium, and exploitation of the resulting Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix, to the fields observed at nodes of a fine sampling mesh of a parallelepiped search domain in which one finds the defects to be located.

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} based on six {{articles}} and proposes new approaches for modelling {{of the life of}} cutting tools and for determining the optimal tool replacement time. These issues are very closely related and {{play a critical role in}} machining economics. Replacing a tool too early means wasting of its potential and leads to high costs and reduced productivity. Late replacement poses a risk of wear-out and other types of tool failures, which can damage the component being produced and can cause expensive equipment downtimes. Therefore a lot of work has been done to develop models for predicting the life of a tool and to optimize its replacement time. Probably the best known of them is the Taylor’s tool life equation. Developed in 1906 Taylor’s equation expresses the tool life in terms of the cutting speed. Despite being over a century old, this model is still widely used in practice. However, Taylor’s equation has a few drawbacks. For example, it ignores the effect of other, though less important, process parameters such as the depth of cut and the feed. To walk around this issue several extensions of Taylor’s equation have been proposed and are discussed in this thesis. Nevertheless all these models share another common flaw. They assume that tool life is deterministic, i. e., that given the process parameters the exact time to wear-out can be calculated. Unfortunately, in real machining processes there are a lot of sources of variation that affect the rate of tool wear and influence its life. As a result, deterministic models rarely give accurate estimates and are only valid as approximations. To improve tool life predictions and assist process planners in choosing the optimal replacement time this PhD thesis proposes new methods. The underlying assumption is that tool life is a stochastic quantity and follows a certain probability distribution. With this in mind the reliability function is derived. Based on the physical analysis of machining processes it is assumed that a tool can fail due to the three main causes: (i) wear, (ii) internal defects and (iii) external stresses. Tool wear depends on a number of factors, including the characteristics of the tool itself, such as its material, geometry and coating, properties of the workpiece material, cutting parameters, rigidity of the machine tool and the efficiency of the cooling process. This last factor is particularly important as most of the tool wear mechanisms depend on temperature. Therefore in this PhD thesis a lot of attention is given to high pressure cooling, which is an effective way to reduce the temperature in the <b>cutting</b> zone. Internal <b>defects</b> are micro voids and cracks that develop inside the tool material during its manufacturing process or as a result of inappropriate handling. They act as stress concentrators and lead to shorter than normal tool life. External stresses are severe overloads that cause immediate tool failure regardless of its quality. They are random in nature and may originate from machine operator errors, failure of supporting equipment or some other external sources. Considering all three failure modes total tool reliability function is found. It is assumed that in a given batch a certain percentage of tools are “bad”, i. e., they contain internal defects, while the rest are “good”. The life of the normal tools is modelled by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Failures due to internal defects are also accounted for by the Weibull distribution, but with different parameters. Then the life of a tool chosen at random is predicted by the mixture model. In addition, tools of both types can fail due to external stresses, the occurrence of which is model by a homogeneous Poisson process. The derived tool reliability function is used to determine the replacement time. Two models are proposed for this purpose. The first one is called the minimum acceptable reliability approach. The idea is to select such a replacement period that the reliability of the tool during it would not fall below a certain minimum level. We show that, when the reliability function is known, this can be done by using a simple graphical procedure. The second model {{is based on}} the age replacement policy, which attempts to balance the costs of preventive and failure provoked tool changes. To solve this optimization problem the total time on test (TTT) transform of the reliability function is introduced, and a method for estimating it form the experimental data is proposed. Then, as in case of the first model, the replacement time is found by employing a simple graphical procedure. For the above approach to be used in practice the expected costs of preventive and failure provoked replacements need to be known. It is shown that the former one can be determined by applying traditional formulas found in machining economics handbooks. The penalty cost, on the other hand, is not so well defined, and no good estimation models are available. Therefore, a new, probability tree-based approach is developed in this thesis. The relevance and the applicability of the proposed models is tested in a few experimental and case studies described in the appended articles. In Article 1 reliability of machining systems as a whole is investigated, and the stochastic nature of the processes involved is clearly shown. In Article 2 it is demonstrated that a two-parameter Weibull distribution can be used to model the tool life, and a simple replacement model based on the reliability function is proposed. In Article 3 a more generic tool life model is developed, but a two-parameter Weibull distribution is still found to be a good approximation. The replacement time is than found by employing an optimization procedure based on the age replacement policy. In Article 4 an approach for estimating the penalty cost, which is a key input to the age replacement model, is developed. Finally in Articles 5 and 6 it is shown that high pressure cooling can help to extend the tool life and possibly to reduce its variation, which is the main reason why probabilistic models are needed. Based on this experimental work and case studies the thesis concludes that stochastic approaches for tool life modelling and for determination of replacement time are relevant and applicable in practice. Therefore further work needs to be done to extend the use of these methods beyond the set-ups and conditions tested throughout the research described in this PhD thesis.
