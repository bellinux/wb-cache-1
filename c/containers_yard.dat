40|$|To {{expedite}} {{the process}} of loading export containers onto vessels, {{it is common for}} port terminals to gather containers in advance and stack them in <b>container</b> <b>yards</b> according to their attributes, such as voyage, port of discharge, weight and size.

Reducing unnecessary movement of empty containers by facilitating collaboration between shippers of outbound containers (exporters) and receivers of inbound containers (importers) could help improve efficiency. A Virtual <b>Container</b> <b>Yard</b> is an internet based system containing information on container movements for the purpose of matching container importing and exporting needs and minimizing unnecessary empty container kilometers travelled. In this paper, the Virtual <b>Container</b> <b>Yard</b> concept, applied to the Vaughan CP intermodal terminal, is analyzed to demonstrate the potential effect on vehicle kilometers travelled. Container movement data were obtained from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario’s Commercial Vehicle Survey, and a linear program was formulated and solved to determine optimal matching of inbound and outbound containers to minimize empty container movements. It was determined that implementing a Virtual <b>Container</b> <b>Yard</b> could reduce the vehicle kilometers travelled to and from the Vaughan CP rail terminal by almost 40 % assuming full collaboration between all importers and exporters. While the prospect of full collaboration may be optimistic, there is potential for significant decreases in vehicle kilometers travelled, and the practicality of implementing the virtual <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> concept at rail intermodal terminals should be further explored...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of global ocean transportation, storage space in container terminals {{is becoming a}} scarce resource. Hence, the terminal yard only performs as a temporary storage facility for inbound cargos. A storage charge is levied for inbound cargos that stay longer than a free storage time (called free-time-limit). After the free-time-limit, customers may move cargos from the terminal yard to a remote <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> where the storage price is lower than that in the terminal. This paper proposes inbound container storage pricing game models between the container terminal and a remote <b>container</b> <b>yard.</b> Two cases are considered: (1) the inbound container's dwell time is random and follows a probability distribution function; (2) the inbound container's dwell time is sensitive to the storage prices.

The models discuss the total bulk queuing system costs of <b>containers</b> at <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> and specific cost ratio. Here, we propose different models in relation to old and new explicit formulae from previous investigations. Comparing these various models with bulk arrival of containers would give the optimal value of queue discipline. Finally, a given comparative analysis between these models and analytical approach will improve the best values for container performances at <b>container</b> <b>yard.</b> Computational experiments are reported to evaluate the efficiency of all considered models for container terminal in Port of Bar, Montenegro. container yards; queuing approaches; bulk arrival; Montenegro; bulk queuing models; container performance; container terminals; modelling...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to develop a system {{dynamics}} model that account for flow of containers, their dwell times, type of equipments and constraints that determine the <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> capacity. The structure of the system is captured with the delays in capacity building and resultant impact on <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> capacity, investments and customer satisfaction. The paper identifies two governing loops. These loops explain the dynamics of yard capacity planning and enable identification of policy variables. The model shows that the policy decisions relate to enhancement of stacking area through right deployment of equipment; and minimization of dwell time through reduction of average stay at yard and faster shifting rate. The paper concludes that the faster rate of clearance can be achieved through right choice of the equipment. The paper focuses on need for timely information flow for proper planning leading to minimization of dwell time. <b>Container,</b> <b>Container</b> <b>Yard,</b> Planning, Capacity, System Dynamics, Governing Loops, Policy Variables, Hard and Soft Ceiling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLevel {{crossings}} or paved ballasted tracks laid in {{freight train}} <b>container</b> <b>yards</b> {{are subjected to}} train loads and forklift loads. Those asphalt pavements in the level crossings or paved ballasted tracks are designed using performance-based design method. Nevertheless, in the conventional design for ballasted tracks itself at the level crossing or paved ballasted tracks in the freight <b>container</b> <b>yards</b> in Japan, truck loads or forklift loads are generally not taken into account, and therefore, heavy duty truck loads or 12 ft-container-forklift loads had not induced a typical problem to level crossing structures or paved ballasted tracks. However, because of the recent increase in the transportation of the large marine containers on freight trains, very large forklifts have been increasingly introduced to freight <b>container</b> <b>yard.</b> Maximum wheel loads of those large forklifts reach up to 500 kN. Consequently, damages to level crossings and paved ballasted tracks in freight <b>container</b> <b>yard</b> are increasing. Concrete slab tracks {{are considered to be}} effective track structure to reduce the deformation of roadbeds or subgrades which are subjected to heavy forklift loads. However, to maintain the concrete slab tracks in the freight <b>container</b> <b>yards</b> in a decent condition, it is necessary to design the roadbeds and subgrades properly to avoid excessive deformation, because once the deformation are induced bebeath concrete slab tracks, {{it is not easy to}} correct track irregularity. To deal with above issues, deformation characteristics of subgrades, roadbeds and track structure under the heavy forklift loads were investigated using small scale model tests and full scale model tests in this study. In the scale model tests, moving wheel loads were applied to an asphalt paved ballasted track model and concrete slab model. In the full scale model tests, train loads and heavy forklift loads were applied on the asphalt paved ballasted track and concrete slab track. Through those tests, it was confirmed that the load applied by heavy forklift have predominant effect on the deformation characteristics of asphalt paved ballasted track. Besides, it was confirmed that the concrete slab track effectively reduces the vertical stress applied on the roadbed and subgrade...|$|R
