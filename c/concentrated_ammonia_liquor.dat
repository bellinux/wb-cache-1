There were many structural units for cubic phase changing to hexagonal phase in the CdS crystals in the process of hydrothermal resulting in forming a large number of stacking fault structures. Photo-generated electrons and holes migrating directionally along the nanorods direction and the stacking fault structures in some nanorods could promote the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, which enhanced the activity of visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production.
