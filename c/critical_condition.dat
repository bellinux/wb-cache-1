40|$|In {{the present}} study, diblock {{copolymers}} of PS-b-PEO synthesized by sequential living anionic polymerization {{as well as}} the blends of PS, PEO homopolymers will be investigated by using liquid chromatography at <b>critical</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>Critical</b> <b>conditions</b> will be established for the PS block of the copolymer. At these conditions, the PS block is chromatographically invisible and does not contribute to retention so the block copolymer is separated according to the block length of the PEO block. At the <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> of PS, it is also possible to separate the PS homopolymer formed. The <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> will be established {{in such a way that}} the non-critical PEO block elutes in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) mode.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of PMMA {{standards in}} mixtures {{composed of two}} binary critical eluents was investigated. It was found that combinations of two critical eluents do not result in a molar mass independent elution (<b>critical</b> <b>conditions).</b> When mixing two binary critical eluents, elution might occur in SEC, LAC or close to <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> in a non-predictable fashion. It can be assumed that the deviation from <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> is caused by preferential adsorption of some eluent components to the stationary phase or the polymer. In {{order to have a}} fast estimate, in which mode of chromatography elution will occur when mixing two critical eluents, ternary <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> were estimated from gradient experiments. A good agreement was observed between the so obtained critical lines and the elution behaviour resulting in mixtures of two critical eluents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Connected-k-coverage {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an effective notion for prolonging the sensor network lifetime. It requires the monitored region to be k-covered by a connected component of active sensors, which is less demanding than requiring k-coverage and connectivity among all active sensors simultaneously. While <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for k-coverage and connectivity have been studied separately before, {{there is a lack}} of fundamental understanding about connected-k-coverage. In this paper, as one of the first efforts in understanding the fundamental basics about connected-k-coverage, we analyze the <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for connected-k-coverage using the percolation theorem and demonstrate their effectiveness using simulation results.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the study of}} galloping <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> on square cylinders having an arbitrary attitude in the wind flow.

The availability of specific experimental data allows a sound definition of aerodynamic actions. The analysis of <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> can be performed in closed form in the plane of the aerodynamic damping matrix invariants. Preliminary results concerning laminar wind flow point out that yaw effects can influence <b>critical</b> <b>conditions,</b> leading to values of critical velocities that can also be remarkably different from those in classical crossflow conditions...|$|R

His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a <b>critical</b> <b>condition</b> from which none expected her to recover.

When the flow is subcritical, defined by a Froude number less than 1, the reach is mild.

40|$|Olefin {{copolymers}} are {{of increasing}} scientific interest {{due to their}} important application potential. Liquid chromatography can deliver important information, especially on their molecular structure. In particular, liquid chromatography at <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> (LCCC) is of interest because, in this chromatographic mode, the elution is molar mass independent for a given repeat unit. LCCC is conducted at conditions where the entropic effect of size exclusion {{is equal to the}} enthalpic effect of interaction between the macromolecules and the stationary phase and can be used to separate copolymers as well as some homopolymers containing one single repeat unit but having different end groups. For the first time, <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for linear PE were experimentally identified by using porous graphite (Hypercarb™) as the stationary phase, and either 1 -decanol/ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), 1 -decanol/ 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB), n-decane/ODCB, or n-decane/TCB as the mobile phase at 160 °C. The identified <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for PE using the above approach in the above solvents have been verified to be correct, barring slight deviations, by two different techniques which were previously used to determine <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for polymers soluble at ambient temperature. The <b>critical</b> <b>conditions</b> for polyethylene were applied to separate statistical copolymers of ethylene/ 1 -octene with similar molar mass...|$|R

5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment.

5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a <b>critical</b> <b>condition</b> for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed.

He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes.

Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in <b>critical</b> <b>condition.</b> In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an elderly man had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck.
