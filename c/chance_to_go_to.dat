25|$|Marion Barry {{first began}} his spirit {{of civil rights}} {{activism}} {{when he was a}} paperboy in Memphis. The paper he worked for organized a contest in which any boys who gained 15 new customers could win a trip to New Orleans. Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. The paper said it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi's segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his paper route until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip. After the paper offered the black paperboys a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> St. Louis, Missouri on a trip, because it was not a segregated city, Barry resumed his paper route.|$|E
500|$|James Ingram later {{described}} {{working with}} Jackson and Jones {{as being in}} The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. [...] "It's almost like I got the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Oz and Quincy was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson was who {{he was dealing with}} in his world. Their work ethic is unbelievable." [...] He noted how Jones would fall asleep on the board, waking up to answer a question. [...] "He works in the Alpha state a lot", Ingram added. Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song. It has a tempo of 126 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's fastest songs.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E

500|$|As {{they had}} no {{permanent}} drummer, McCartney looked for someone to fill the position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were [...] "few and far between", because a set of drums was an expensive item. Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club (which was run by his mother, Mona Best). He {{was regarded as a}} steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm, and was known in Liverpool at the time as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent" [...] by female fans, which convinced McCartney he {{would be good for the}} group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn £15 per week each. Best had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school exams, unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{controlled}} the 49ers throughout the game, and with four minutes {{left in the}} third quarter held a 38–14 lead, which would have been even larger had not Shockey dropped a touchdown pass in the third quarter. The 49ers rallied however, scoring a field goal and three touchdowns—two on Jeff Garcia touchdown passes, one on a Garcia 14-yard touchdown run, and two two-point conversions made by Terrell Owens—which gave the 49ers a 39–38 lead with a minute to go. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds to play, setting up a 41-yard potential game-winning field goal attempt by Matt Bryant. However, Bryant never got an opportunity to make the kick. 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin—who had been signed out of retirement for this playoff game—snapped the ball low and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball for the attempt. With no other options, Allen threw it downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert. The Giants were penalized for an illegal man downfield (Seubert), and the game was over. However, after the game, the NFL recognized that San Francisco should have been penalized on that play as well for pass interference. This would have created offsetting penalties and given New York a chance to kick again. After the game a devastated Junkin said [...] "I cost 58 guys a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Super Bowl. I'd give anything in the world, except my family at this point, right now to still be retired." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 Karel Čapek married actress Olga Scheinpflugová, {{after a long}} acquaintance. In 1938 {{it became}} clear that the Western allies, namely France and the United Kingdom, would fail to fulfil the pre-war agreements, and they refused to defend Czechoslovakia against Nazi Germany. Although offered the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> exile in England, Čapek refused to leave his country – despite the fact that the Nazi Gestapo had named him [...] "public enemy number two". While {{repairing}} flood damage to his family's summer house in Stará Huť, he contracted a common cold. As he had suffered all his life from spondyloarthritis and was also a heavy smoker, Karel Čapek died of pneumonia, on 25 December 1938.|$|E

When I was invited to the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By doing that, and by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I knew that I would be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The author Ahmed Rashid {{suggests}} that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology. It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, {{brought up in a}} totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, herding, or handicraft-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages. In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders [...] "repeatedly told" [...] Rashid that [...] "if they gave women greater freedom or a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school, they would lose the support of their rank and file." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Zoya was 14, the Burmese army {{attacked}} Manerplaw and Per He Lu, {{forcing her}} and her family to run to Mae Ra Moh, a refugee camp {{just across the border}} in Thailand. In 1996, she and her family managed to cross back into Burma, settling in a Karen village called Ther Waw Thaw (The New Village). [...] Halfway through the school year, she nearly died of an unknown disease, only recovering after weeks of being on an IV drip. [...] In March 1997, the village came under attack by the Burmese army, and she and her family fled back across the border to another refugee camp called Noh Poe, near a Thai-Karen village. After ten months, Zoya and her older sister, Nant Bwa Bwa Phan, were able to get to Mae Sot in Thailand for three months, hoping for a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university in Australia; however, this fell through, and they decided to complete their education at another refugee camp, Mae La. [...] In 1999, Zoya and Bwa Bwa took an Open Society Institute (OSI) exam to earn a scholarship to go to a university. Both of them passed the first time; however, there was only enough space for Bwa Bwa, who went to Bangkok University, and Zoya had to retake the exam the following year. While waiting, she caught cerebral malaria, and almost died a second time. In 2000, she retook the OSI exam and was granted an OSI scholarship and a scholarship from Prospect Burma, giving her the chance to join her sister studying in Bangkok.|$|E
2500|$|Born in 1947 to Jewish {{parents in}} poverty-stricken Hungary {{and growing up}} in the darkest age of {{communism}} in Eastern-Europe. Nogradi looks back on his childhood as harrowing and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status and the inexorable antisemitism of the communist regime. He had a very close, loving relationship with his mother, Katalin Hoffman, a survivor of Auschwitz. She was a literate and thoughtful woman who loved poetry and classical music. Gabor's mother died from cancer when he was seven. She had taught him how to read. He became a fervent reader and devoured every book he could find in the local library. He read at night, hiding under the bed coverw with a flashlight, because his father, a woodworker, viewed reading books as [...] "utterly useless" [...] and [...] "a waste of time". Although he did very well in school, he was refused admission into the Gmnyasium (academic high school, and therefore was denied the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university. He was forced to go to Technical School, where he learned how to operate machinery, but he never worked as a technician. He wanted to become a poet - an idea that both his family and his environment regarded as utterly insane. His life mirrors his philosophy on survival: [...] "The deeper one finds himself {{at the bottom of the}} pool, the bigger push he can give to himself, as long as he is determined enough to get to the surface." [...] Nogradi credits his early childhood experiences with much of his success in writing, as he says it helped him to [...] "develop an extreme layer of toughness to handle rejections." ...|$|E
