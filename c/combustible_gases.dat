40|$|A {{program to}} {{determine}} the feasibility of performing in situ calibration of <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> detectors was successfully completed. Several possible techniques for performing the in situ calibration were proposed. The approach that showed the most promise involved {{the use of a}} miniature water vapor electrolysis cell for the generation of hydrogen within the flame arrestor of a <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> detector to be used for the purpose of calibrating the <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> detectors. A preliminary breadboard of the in situ calibration hardware was designed, fabricated and assembled. The breadboard equipment consisted of a commercially available <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> detector, modified to incorporate a water vapor electrolysis cell, and the instrumentation required for controlling the water vapor electrolysis and controlling and calibrating the <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> detector.

25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting <b>combustible</b> <b>gases</b> in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} flame {{is the third}} possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter {{than the other two}} flames because the <b>combustible</b> <b>gases</b> will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an {{oxidizing flame}} because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals.

40|$|A {{water heater}} has a gas inlet (8) for a <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> and air mixture and an inlet for a fluid {{to be heated}} (11, 18) which is {{partially}} surrounded {{by at least one}} fluid chamber (4, 7) filled with the fluid (2).

Thereby, there are two combustion stages, whereby the first combustion stage (16) is a catalytic splitting burner (11) and the second combustion stage (20) is a monolithic burner (18, 19). As a result of the two- stage arrangement, about 80 percent of the <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> is converted in the first stage (16), whereby the remaining <b>combustible</b> <b>gas</b> components are themselves converted practically without any residue at the prevailing low partial pressures in the second stage (20), in particular without NO<-x emissions...|$|R

He expresses the immediate cause thus: [...] "The platina determines upon its surface a continual renovation of concrete laminæ of the combustible substance of the gases or vapours, which flowing over it are burnt, pass away, and are renewed: this combustion at the surface raises and sustains the temperature of the metal." [...] The combustible substance, thus reduced into imperceptible laminæ, of which the concrete parts are in contact with the oxygen, is presumed to be in a state combinable with the oxygen at a much lower temperature than when it is in the gaseous state, and more in analogy with what is called the nascent condition. That <b>combustible</b> <b>gases</b> should lose their elastic state, and become concrete, assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered as proved by facts, some of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 1824[B]; and though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures, and though the similar films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action of heat, still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all opposition of reasoning.|$|E

50|$|Catalytic bead sensors are {{commonly}} used to measure <b>combustible</b> <b>gases</b> that present an explosion hazard when concentrations are between the lower explosion limit (LEL) and upper explosion limit (UEL). Active and reference beads containing platinum wire coils are situated on opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge circuit and electrically heated, up to a few hundred degrees C. The active bead contains a catalyst that allows combustible compounds to oxidize, thereby heating the bead even further and changing its electrical resistance. The resulting voltage difference between the active and passive beads {{is proportional to the}} concentration of all <b>combustible</b> <b>gases</b> and vapors present. The sampled gas enters the sensor through a sintered metal frit, which provides a barrier to prevent an explosion when the instrument is carried into an atmosphere containing <b>combustible</b> <b>gases.</b> Pellistors measure essentially all <b>combustible</b> <b>gases,</b> but they are more sensitive to smaller molecules that diffuse through the sinter more quickly. The measureable concentration ranges are typically from a few hundred ppm to a few volume percent. Such sensors are inexpensive and robust, but require a minimum of a few percent oxygen in the atmosphere to be tested and they can be poisoned or inhibited by compounds such as silicones, mineral acids, chlorinated organic compounds, and sulfur compounds.|$|E
