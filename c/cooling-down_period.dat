5|$|Iraqiâ€“British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period</b> {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
5000|$|The Mali Uromastyx (Uromastyx (dispar) maliensis) is {{considered}} an ideal species of Uromastyx to choose as a pet because they readily adapt to a captive environment. Another species that adapts to captivity well, and comes in [...] "red" [...] and [...] "yellow", is Uromastyx geyri, commonly called the Saharan Uromastyx. The red version is marketed as a red Niger Uromastyx but the yellow version is marketed as a yellow Niger Uromastyx. Artificial UVB/UVA light and vitamin supplements must be balanced with proper food and nutrition, UVB light is required for calcium absorption from the gut. Most commercially available UVB lights lose efficiency after 6 months {{and need to be}} replaced. Proper enclosures can be costly, as these are roaming animals with large space needs for their size, combined with the need to provide heat and ultraviolet light. Though the lizards bask at very high temperatures, there must be a temperature gradient within the enclosure allowing them to cool off away from the heat lamps. A <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period</b> over winter months can trigger the breeding response when temperatures rise in the spring. The temporary slowing-down of their metabolisms also lengthens the animals' lifespans.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} an {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) study on self-assembled In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) was performed. Surface morphology of self-assembled In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As QDs changes with different growth time. Increasing growth time increased the dots size and decreased the dots density. In addiditon, self-assembled In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As QDs was grown on In 0. 1 Ga 0. 9 As underlying layer with different after-growth AsH 3 flow time during cooling-down. The underlying layer caused lattice strain relaxation in the QDs on the surface. Increasing the period of AsH 3 flow during cooling-down reduced {{the diameter of the}} dots and increased the density. The migration of groups III species in the growth of In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As/GaAs system was influenced by AsH 3 flow during <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period.</b> This was due to the increase in surface population of active arsenic species. Underlying layer and the period of AsH 3 flow during cooling-down are the two key factors in the fabrication of small and dense In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As QDs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum pump-down time and heating-up and <b>cooling-down</b> <b>periods.</b> Furthermore, larger substrates are gaining interest in the system design of MECS devices and it is not apparent that uniaxial pressing within a hydraulic vacuum hot press will provide the bonding pressure uniformity necessary for large substrate bonding. This thesis presents a novel fabrication approach for the high-volume thermal bonding of large substrate MECS devices with the use of controlled thermal expansion. A large substrate thermal bonding clamp based on the principle of differential thermal expansion was developed with focus on controlling the bonding pressure magnitude, timing, sensitivity and uniformity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} the influence of arm-crank exercise in reproductive hormone levels in adults with chronic SCI. Further objectives were to assess the influence of arm-crank exercise on muscle strength and body composition. Materials and Methods Seventeen male adults with complete SCI at or below the 5 th thoracic level (T 5) volunteered for this study. Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 9) or control group (n = 8) using a concealed method. The participants in the intervention group performed a 12 -week arm-crank exercise program, 3 sessions/week, consisting of warming-up (10 - 15 min) followed by a main part in arm-crank (20 - 30 min [increasing 2 min and 30 seconds each three weeks]) at a moderate work intensity of 50 - 65 % of heart rate reserve (HRR) (starting at 50 % and increasing 5 % each three weeks) and by a <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period</b> (5 - 10 min). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and estradiol were determined by ELISA. Muscle strength (handgrip) and body composition (waist circumference [WC]) were assessed. Results After the completion of the training program, testosterone level was significantly increased (p = 0. 0166;d = 1. 14). Furthermore, maximal handgrip and WC were significantly improved. Lastly, a significant inverse correlation was found between WC and testosterone (r =- 0. 35; p = 0. 0377). Conclusion The arm-crank exercise improved reproductive hormone profile by increasing testosterone levels in adults with chronic SCI. A secondary finding was that it also significantly improved muscle strength and body composition in this group...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of a 12 -week aim-cranking {{exercise}} program on reducing oxidative damage in untrained adults with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Community-based supervised intervention. Participants: Male adults with complete SCI at or below the fifth thoracic level (T 5) (N = 17) volunteered for this study. Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 9) or control (n = 8) group using a concealed method. Intervention: A 12 -week arm-cranking exercise program, 3 sessions/wk, consisting of warming-up (10 - 15 min) followed by a main part in arm-crank (20 - 30 min [increasing 2 min and 30 s every 3 wk]) at a moderate work intensity of 50 % to 65 % of the heart rate reserve (starting at 50 % and increasing 5 % every 3 weeks) and by a <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period</b> (5 - 10 min). Main Outcome Measures: Plasmatic levels of total antioxidant status as well as erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity were measured. Lipid and protein oxidation were determined as malondialdehyde and carbonyl group levels, respectively. Furthermore, physical fitness and body composition were assessed. Results: When compared with baseline results, maximum oxygen consumption was significantly increased (P =. 031), suggesting an improvement in physical fitness in the intervention group. Regarding the antioxidant defense system, it was found that both total antioxidant status (P =. 014) and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity (P =. 027) were significantly increased {{at the end of the}} training program. As a consequence, plasmatic levels of malondialdehyde (P =. 008) and carbonyl groups (P =. 022) were significantly reduced. Conclusion: A 12 -week arm-cranking exercise program improved the antioxidant defense system in adults with chronic SCI, which may finally attenuate both lipid and protein oxidation in this population.

40|$|Following the October 1987 {{stock market}} collapse, {{interest}} in the effect and impact of circuit breakers on market volatility has grown among practitioners, academics and regulators. Circuit breakers are market tools designed to control prices from falling in times of panic selling by providing a short <b>cooling-down</b> <b>period</b> to prevent non- rational overreaction and avoid stock market crashes. They have been recommended as a mechanism to stabilize trading activities and to reduce stock market volatility. Hence, many stock markets have adopted circuit breakers to temporarily control trading after large and rapid price changes. Although many research papers investigate the issue of circuit breakers, the critical impact of circuit breakers on the operation of markets is still uncertain whether in academia or industry. Studies that support the implementation of circuit breakers point out their importance in managing settlement risk and reducing volatility by giving traders some time to think rationally during times of panic trading. On the other side, opponents argue that circuit breakers increase volatility and interfere with trading, liquidity and price discovery. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to give an empirical examination of the effect of one type of circuit breaker rules - price limits - on the daily stock return volatility in Amman Stock Exchange(ASE). Whether price limits reduce or increase the stock price volatility is a question that has long attracted research interest. By comparing the volatility level in the ASE market before and after the price limit hit days, the study will show the effectiveness of adopting the price limit rule. This study will investigate the behavior of stock price volatility around the price limit hit for a sample of 25 Securities listed in Amman Stock Exchange in both the first and second markets representing different sectors for the period between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2006. Overall, the study arrives at the result of price limits effectively reducing stock market volatility by acting as a market stabilizer and providing a time out for investors to think rationally with less emotion during times of panic trading...|$|E
