30|$|The <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> is the {{quantity}} of matter that can be thermally degraded in a given substance. This {{is a measure of}} the amount of matter that can be recovered upon cracking [18]. High <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> indicates high energy and matter recovery from a material. The <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> of the polypropylene feedstock is high enough (93.77 %). This result indicates that high amount of products can be obtained upon thermal cracking. This value is in close range to most reported work; 89.65 % by Panda [19], 91.48 % by Khaing and Chaw [4], and 94.59 % by Gao [17]; however, the value obtained was significantly different from the study of Sonawane et al. [8] with a reported value of 83.56 %. This considerable variation can be attributed to differences in the polymeric material used. Other properties determined were in consonance to most documented work on the proximate analysis of plastic materials [20, 21]).|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{bituminous}} coal was co-fired with municipal sewage sludge in a 12 MWth circulating fluidized bed (CFB) research boiler. The fraction of sewage sludge(both wet and dry) in the feed was varied {{in the range}} 0 - 67 % (on dry mass). The impact of co-combustion on ash leaving the boiler, bed material in the furnace and concentrations of O 2, CO 2, CO and total hydrocarbons throughout the furnace was studied. In order to evaluate {{the influence of the}} wide size distribution of the coal on the results, the coal was pre-sieved into a fine and a coarse size fraction and separately burned. The higher ash content in the sewage sludge resulted in increasing fly ash flows and lower <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in the fly ash with increasing fraction of sludge in the fuel mix. The bottom ash flow and <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> were more sensitive to the feed coal size distribution than to the sludge supply. Compared to coal combustion, co-combustion of coal with sewage sludge was found to lead to a higher concentration of fine solids in the furnace, caused by attrition of sludge ash particles. Furthermore, as the density of sewage sludge ash is lower than that of coal ash, coarser sludge ash particles than coal ash particles could be entrained from the bottom bed. These two phenomena contributed to wider solids size distributions throughout the furnace in the case of co-combustion with sewage sludge. The effect of the entering coal size distribution on the size distribution of the inert ashes was negligible compared to the impact of the sludge fraction in the feed. The size distributions of the combustible solids in the bed material, on the other hand, were dependent on variations in feed size distribution of the coal rather than on sludge supply. The introduction of sewage sludge in the fuel mix resulted in greater measured concentrations of CO and total hydrocarbons in the furnace, leading to an increased combustion of volatiles above the bottom bed and higher temperatures {{in the top of the}} furnace...|$|E

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Mine Safety and Health Administration conducted a joint survey recently on coal particle ranges as measured in US coal mine samples. In underground coal mines, dust explosions are prevented {{by the addition of}} enough rock dust (usually limestone) to make the total dust mixture inert. The rock dust acts as a heat sink for the dispersed dust mixture by reducing the temperature below the value needed to propagate an explosion. Federal regulations require 65 % in <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in intake airways and 80 % incombustible content in return airways, where the coal dust is assumed to be finer in size.

40|$|Open dumpsite {{has become}} the most widely used and common {{practices}} in most of the developing countries in waste management due to their lack of will, technology, capital and virtuous attitudes. This has elevated the risk to the ecosystem and humans derived by the improper dumping of waste in bare lands, sloping lands (valleys, river banks), wet lands etc. Characterization of waste is an important primary stage in studying dumpsites in sloping lands to identify its effects and potential remedial actions, and to develop new technologies to reduce their adverse effects on the environment and society. In this research, waste characteristics of some selected plots located at up and down slope of a dumpsite were studied to identify the possible difference and their relationships with the slope. The results revealed that waste characteristics such as ash content, <b>combustible</b> <b>content,</b> ignition loss and aggregated soil content vary in the plots located at up and down slope, suggesting that the rolling and sliding of larger particles in high sloping dumpsites has a profound effect in varying waste characteristics. This was further confirmed by the particle size distribution of both plots...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale mining in {{developing}} countries is generally labour-intensive and carried out {{with low levels of}} mechanization. In the Mererani area {{in the northern part of}} Tanzania, there are about 15000 underground miners who are constantly subjected to a poor working environ-ment. Gemstones are found at depths down to 500 m. The objectives of this pilot study were to monitor the exposure to dust during work processes, which are typical of small-scale mining {{in developing}} countries, and to make a rough estimation of whether there is a risk of chronic pulmonary diseases for the workers. Personal sampling of respirable dust (n = 15) and ‘total ’ dust (n = 5) was carried out during three consecutive days in one mine, which had a total of 50 workers in two shifts. Sampling started immediately before the miners entered the shaft, and lasted until they reappeared at the mine entrance after 5 – 8 h.

30|$|In the {{underground}} coal mine settings, the essential conditions for coal dust {{to participate in}} an explosion are: (1) fine coal dust suspended in air with a minimum concentration of 100  g/m 3 for biyuminous coal and (2) sufficient ignition energy with a minimum temperature of 440  °C (Stephan). The first condition ensures sufficient reaction surface between the fine coal dust particles and oxygen in the air. The second condition provides sufficient thermal energy to ignite the coal dust and to sustain the chain explosion process. It should be noted that among the <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> in the coal (mainly the volatile matters and the fixed carbon), the volatile matters should be the first part and most likely the only part {{to be involved in the}} explosion process considering the short contact time between the passing hot air and the coal dust particles. However, the volatile matters have to be devolatilized, stimulated with sufficient thermal energy, into vapor before the start of dust explosion.|$|R
40|$|The revised Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{guidelines}} for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories recommends that more comprehensive {{and thus more}} reliable characteristics of the local fossil fuels {{should be used for}} the national GHG inventory calculations. This paper deal with the carbon emission characteristics of low-calorific lignite recovered from the Kolubara open-pit mine. The samples of coal were carefully selected in order to cover the net calorific value, ash and water content of the broad spectrum {{of the quality of the}} raw lignite supplied to the Serbian thermal power plants. Correlation analysis of the laboratory analysis data gave a linear dependency of the net calorific value on the <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in the coal samples. Also, linear correlation between the carbon content and the net calorific value was found. The regression analysis of experimentally determined coal characteristics implies that the carbon emission factor is dependent on the net calorific value. For the subset of raw lignite samples with the net calorific value Qdr = 6 ÷ 10 MJ/kg, that is most representative for current and near future use for power generation in Serbian thermal power plants, the linear dependency CEFr (tC/TJ) = 34. 407 - 0. 5891 ×Qdr (MJ/kg) was proposed.

40|$|While total exhaust {{emissions}} from individual road vehicles {{continue to be}} reduced, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to identify and quantify the residual chemical compounds in tail-pipe emissions that are potential hazards to the environment and to human health. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is known to consist mostly of carbonaceous soot together with minor components, such as volatile organic fractions (from unburned fuel), lubricating oil, and inorganic compounds that include ash and sulphur compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are invoked as the key intermediates in diesel soot formation. These are mutagenic air pollutants formed as by-products of combustion. PAH-precursors identified in soot include single ring structures such as benzene and toluene. Soot nucleation and growth gradually leads to the formation of five to six membered ring structures, such as benzopyrene, dibenzopyrene and coronene. Several methods have been devised to reduce the emissions of DPM, which include the use of a diesel particulate filter, or a technology which combines selective catalytic reduction of NOx with a regenerating particulate trap in a single unit. These oxidise the <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> of the particulate matter collected on the filter through a non-catalytic reaction with NO 2. As an alternative, the more difficult catalysed oxidation of soot by direct reaction with O 2 has been gaining a lot of attention. Several {{studies have shown that the}} oxidation of soot requires a redox catalyst, such as CeO 2, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 and CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -Al 2 O 3, or other reducible metal oxides including perovskites and spinels. In the past, proposed mechanisms have assumed that exhaust soot is simply graphitic carbon, and so have not taken into account the other organic components. In this work, we have carried out a speciation of soot that has been sourced from a diesel particulate trap. The soluble components have been identified by GC-MS, following extraction by Soxhlet and ultrasonication techniques. The speciation has been repeated as a function of temperature during the non-catalysed and catalysed combustion of the soot, allowing the conversion of individual components to be tracked. The results provide important catalyst design information, which should allow the formulation of materials that will be catalytically active in the combustion both of graphitic carbon and the complete range of retained organic species...|$|E
40|$|District heating covers around 80 % of {{the heating}} demand in {{apartment}} buildings and 10 % in single-family homes in Sweden. In the year 2010 the total input {{of energy to}} the Swedish district heating grids was about 70 TWh, which corresponds to 11 % of the total energy input to the whole energy system in the country. Through the combined production of heat and power the CHP-plants often reaches an efficiency of 90 % from energy in the fuel to produced heat and power. In {{order to keep the}} efficiency high {{it is important for the}} owners of the plant to have good knowledge about the plants performance at different operation points. Strängnäs Energi AB initiated this diploma work together with FVB Sverige ab in order to come up with a program for short term planning of the production of heat and power at the company´s CHP-plant. The work consists of three main parts. The first part is an introduction to district heating and optimization of such systems and it also handles a short explanation of the district heating system in Strängnäs. The second part covers the performance tests that have been done at Strängnäs Energi AB´s CHP-plant. The performance tests were carried out in order to investigate how the plant is operating. The results from the tests show that the efficiency of the plant is very poor. This has its explanation in the losses in forms of <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in the bottom ash, which in some cases reaches over 4 %. The problems with the combustion have been known for a while at Strängnäs Energi AB, but they did not have any calculated value of the efficiency. The company is working hard in order to come up with good solutions for the combustion and therefore this is not included in the diploma work. Instead the third part of the diploma work is focused on developing of a model for short term production planning. The model was made in MS Excel and it consists of a number of power and mass balances over one day. The key to the calculations in the model is the calculation of the alfa-value. The alfa-value together with the power in the hot water condenser gives an iterative calculation. The hot water accumulator is then either charged or discharged depending on current electrical price, demand of district heating and the level in the accumulator. The results from the simulations done with the model shows that it is possible for Strängnäs Energi AB to earn between 0 – 20 000 SEK during one day if they operate their plant as suggested in the model...|$|E

The Waste to methanol (WtM) process can be divided into four main sections, namely RDF gasification, syngas purification, conditioning, and methanol synthesis. Methanol manufacturing needs a suitable syngas composition; therefore, the ultimate goal is to achieve a tailored gasification unit in order to decrease conditioning step efforts. In this work, a steady-state simulation of gasification unit has been developed using Aspen Plus.

In order to use waste fi ne coal effi ciently, a retrieval technique is necessary for the recov-ery of <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> of coal from fi ne waste coals. Nowadays, a fl otation process has been used for the treatment, but it is impractical for developing countries due to its higher costs. Therefore, oil agglomera-tion process has been used to deal with these problems. In this study, the factors affecting the coal cleaning effi ciency of the oil agglomeration process were investigated with the element contents and chemical structure of three different grade coals. Chemical contents in three different grade coals were determined by proximate and ultimate analyses and the differences in chemical structure of carbonaceous contents of different grade coals were investigated by a Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry. In free coals or their mixed samples, the ratio of ash and carbonaceous contents were maintained to make it homogeneous. From the results of oil agglomeration experiments, it was concluded that the characteristics of agglomerate and the coal cleaning effi ciency of oil agglomeration were not only infl uenced by the type of oils but also by the oxygen contents and the aromatic and aliphatic chemical structures in different grade coals.

It involves flame heat transfer, transient conduction,convection, and radiation between drums (stored in an array configuration). There are several phenomena which may occur when drums are exposed to fire. The most dramatic is violent lid failure which results in total lid removal. When a drum loses its lid due to fire exposure, {{some or all of}} the contents may be ejected from the drum, and both the ejected combustible material and the <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> remaining within the container will burn. The scope of this guide is limited to storage arrays of steel drums containing combustible (primarily Class A) and noncombustible <b>contents.</b> Class B <b>combustibles</b> may be included in small amounts as free liquid within the solid waste contents. Storage arrays, which are anticipated in this guide, include single or multi-tier palletized (steel or wood pallets) drums,high rack storage of drums, and stacked arrays of drums where plywood sheets are used between tiers. The purpose of this guide is to describe a simple methodology that estimates the consequences of a fire in drum storage arrays. The extent of fire development and the resulting heat release rates can be estimated. Release fractions applicable to this type of storage are not addressed, and the transport of contaminants away from the source is not addressed.

This imposes {{a need for more}} efficient recycling and recovery. Despite this shredder residue (SR) is commonly land filled. This report investigated the magnetic fines residue generated at Stena Metall shredder facility in Halmstad, Sweden. Magnetic fines is a complex material containing e. g. ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, glass, plastic, rubber, polyurethane, sand, dirt, brominated flame retardants and PCB. Characterisation of the material and discussion around area of application resulted in suggestions for possible recycling alternatives. Characterisation included e. g. particle size, total organic content, x-ray fluorescence, x-ray powder diffraction and elemental analysis with a focus on the metals. The results indicated a higher organic content in larger particles and an increasing content of e. g. lead, cadmium and mercury in smaller particles. X-ray fluorescence can be used to measure lead in magnetic fines. The conclusion was that the <b>combustible</b> organic <b>content</b> needs to be separated before further metal recycling can be applied.

40|$|Fire {{resistance}} {{rating of}} {{light gauge steel}} frame (LSF) wall systems is obtained from fire tests based on the standard fire time-temperature curve. However, fire severity has increased in modern buildings due to higher fuel loads {{as a result of}} modern furniture and light weight constructions that make use of thermoplastics materials, synthetic foams and fabrics. Some of these materials are high in calorific values and increase both the spread of fire growth and heat release rate, thus increasing the fire severity beyond that of the standard fire curve. Further, the standard fire curve does not include a decay phase that is present in natural fires. Despite the increasing usage of LSF walls, their behaviour in real building fires is not fully understood. This paper presents the details of a research study aimed at developing realistic design fire curves for use in the fire tests of LSF walls. It includes a review of the characteristics of building fires, previously developed fire time-temperature curves, computer models and available parametric equations. The paper highlights that real building fire time-temperature curves depend on the fuel load representing the <b>combustible</b> building <b>contents,</b> ventilation openings and thermal properties of wall lining materials, and provides suitable values of many required parameters including fuel loads in residential buildings. Finally, realistic design fire time-temperature curves simulating the fire conditions in modern residential buildings are proposed for the testing of LSF walls...|$|R

Egg size variation was considerable. The ratio in egg volume of the largest over the smallest egg was more than 1. 5 in each of five years. Differences between females accounted for, on average, 61 % of the total variance of egg volume. Individual females produced similarly sized eggs from one year to another. Nevertheless, average egg volume per clutch declined by 0. 2 cm(3) per year as females aged, but this explains little of the observed variation. Female size and food supplementation had no significant effect on egg volume. In absolute terms, large eggs contain more lean dry matter and lipid than small eggs, but the proportion of both constituents decreases with egg size. Consequently, the <b>combustible</b> energy <b>content</b> of eggs increases less than proportionally with egg size. Hatchability averaged 87 % and was not correlated with egg volume. Hatchling weight increased with egg size, averaging 65 % of fresh egg weight. Chick survival until fledging did not increase with egg volume. Consequently, within the size range observed, large and small eggs are of comparable quality. Since both {{the costs and benefits of}} large eggs compared with small eggs seem small at best, we propose that, within the size range encountered in this population, egg size can be considered an evolutionarily neutral trait...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of biomass based energy warrants {{the evaluation of}} syn-gas from biomass gasification as a fuel for power systems. The earlier investigations reveal that the operating parameters strongly affect the syn gas quality. The gasifier performance was investigated with different operating pressure. The downdraft gasifier has tested with silver oak woodchips of size approximately 12 mm× 12 mm× 12 mm. The total feed of 8 - 8. 5 kg of wood was fed into the system and an airflow rate of 130 lpm supplied by compressor and the gasifier was tested different pressure conditions. The main variables namely oxidation zone temperature, <b>combustible</b> gas <b>contents</b> (H 2, CO & CH 4), calorific value, gas production rate and conversion efficiency was studied. The percentage of total combustible gas is varied between 30. 60 % - 35. 97 % and the average composition is N 2 = 44. 29 % – 54. 78 %, CH 4 = 0. 62 % – 1. 51 %, H 2 = 15. 7 % – 25. 48 %, CO = 7. 96 % – 11. 4 %, CO 2 = 11. 37 % – 19. 70 %. The calorific value of syn gas was found to vary between 3. 860 MJ/m 3 – 4. 374. 94 MJ/m 3. The conversion efficiency varied between 86. 8 % - 73. 7 %. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to predict {{the performance of the}} down draft biomass gasifier. For simulation purpose the combustion zone of the gasifier was separately modeled and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, April 2014. This research was undertaken to assess the validity and applicability of the pan systems’ current Ramsar classification. In areas of the Ramsar classification scheme where the classification was considered lacking, a regional classification was offered based on the fieldwork and lab work analysis. Physical variables such as soil moisture <b>content,</b> <b>combustible</b> organic carbon <b>content</b> and soil particle size distribution surrounding the pan systems were measured during the wet and dry periods of the fieldwork sampling. Aquatic invertebrates were selected for the study as they {{are known to be}} good indicators of ecosystem health. The macro aquatic invertebrates were sampled within the pan systems over the wet and the dry periods. The investigation showed that the pan systems supported mainly tolerant macro aquatic invertebrate species as expected, however sample sites Mapimbi and Nwambi due to their access to the water table were able to support sensitive aquatic invertebrate species. The use of these pan systems by the macro aquatic invertebrates was then compared to the water quality found within the pans. Water quality in the pans was affected by the types of inflow they received and how regularly this inflow occurred. The data for the physical and ecological assessment of the pan systems was then considered and related to the current use of the Ramsar classification scheme. The results showed that the current Ramsar classification scheme does not capture all of the ecological, water quality and morphological properties of the systems. The classification too does not allow for environmental changes within the systems. This research proposes a regional or localized classification scheme to be used in conjunction with the international Ramsar classification scheme. The combined use of the international and regional classifications allowed for the seven systems within the network of wetlands in the Makuleke area to be distinguished as individual systems with unique properties that can be defined locally and not conformed under an international umbrella-type classification scheme...|$|R
3000|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to convert {{polypropylene}} waste into usable liquid fuel via pyrolysis [...] technique using kaolin as a low-cost catalyst. Waste polypropylene was thermally and catalytically degraded in a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) horizontal glass reactor at a temperature of 450  °C, residence time of 30  min, and heating rate of 30  °C/min. The kaolin clay was characterized by XRF analysis while the ultimate and proximate analysis of the polypropylene feed carried out gave <b>combustible</b> materials <b>content</b> of 93.77  wt%, fixed carbon of 1.62  wt%, calorific value of 45.20  MJ/kg and elemental composition with carbon (83.65 %), hydrogen (14.27 %), oxygen (0.15 %), sulphur (0.1 %), chlorine (1.16 %), and nitrogen (0.67 %). Thermal cracking was carried out in the absence of catalyst and the process gave a yield of liquid, gaseous, and solid products of 67.48, 8.85, and 23.67  wt%, respectively. Furthermore, kaolin clay was employed as a catalyst in catalytic pyrolysis of the same feedstock for catalyst-to-plastic ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4 at the same operating parameters as in thermal cracking. Optimum yield was obtained at a catalyst-to-plastic ratio of 1 : 3 with a yield of 79.85, 1.48, and 18.67  wt% for liquid, gaseous, and solid products, respectively. The liquid products obtained for both thermal and catalytic cracking at optimum conditions were characterized for their suitability as fuel. The properties determined were density, viscosity, flash point, fire point, pour point, and calorific value. The results suggest that catalytic pyrolysis produced liquid products, whose properties are comparable to conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel oil) than that produced through thermal pyrolysis. FTIR analysis of the liquid product from catalytic pyrolysis also shows that it contains hydrocarbons with different functional groups such as aromatics, olefins, carbonyl, amines, sulphides, and hydroxyl.|$|R
