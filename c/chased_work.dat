60|$|This last notion {{no sooner}} glanced athwart our heroine's mind, than she began {{diligently}} {{to search for}} the hidden spring. Perhaps curiosity had its influence on the eagerness to arrive at the secret, which she now manifested; possibly a tenderer and still more natural feeling lay concealed behind it all. At any rate, her pretty little fingers never were employed more nimbly, and {{not a part of the}} exterior of the box escaped its pressure. Still, the secret spring eluded her search. The box had two or three bands of richly <b>chased</b> <b>work</b> on each side of the place of opening, and amid these ornaments Maud felt certain that the little projection she sought must lie concealed. To examine these, then, she commenced in a regular and connected manner, resolved that not a single raised point should be neglected. Accident, however, as before, stood her friend; and, at a moment when she least expected it, the lid flew back, once more exposing the paper to view.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the plants}} {{collected}} in the West-Indies by I. Boldingh during the years 1909 and 1910 there was a grass determined as Paspalum hemisphericum Poir., a name changed into glabrum. These determinations are incorrect because Paspalum hemisphericum Poiret {{is the same as}} the wellknown Paspalum paniculatum L. and also quite different from Poiret’s Paspalum glabrum, which, according to Mrs. A. Chase’s investigations, is the Paspalum laxum of Lamarck. Among Bolding’s plants there is a good specimen from the island of Bonaire, which, studied with <b>Chase’s</b> <b>work</b> on the North-American species of Paspalum, could not be identified. In <b>Chase’s</b> <b>work</b> also the species of Central-America and the West-Indian Islands are taken up, moreover the latter are also treated in Hitchcock’s posthumous work on the grasses of that region...|$|R

50|$|Even {{the engines}} of Scheider's Pontiac and McQueen's Mustang sound alike, {{and during the}} car chases in both films there is an almost {{complete}} lack of dialogue, although the reason why these <b>chases</b> <b>work</b> so well (and why Hickman himself was so highly regarded) is their gritty realism and the danger of each tire-busting slide, accompanied by close camera angles and camera-cars moving at high speed and parallel to the action car so you actually {{get to see the}} nervous faces of the actors behind the wheel.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Chase</b> <b>worked</b> in all media. He {{was most}} fluent in oil {{painting}} and pastel, but also created watercolor paintings and etchings. S.G.W. Benjamin {{said of his}} style in a contemporary review: [...] A noble sense of color is perceptible in all his works, whether in the subtle elusive tints of flesh, or in the powerful rendering of a mass of scarlet, as in his notable painting of the [...] "Court Jester". In the painting of a portrait he endeavors, sometimes very successfully, to seize character, although occasionally rather too impressionist in style.|$|R
