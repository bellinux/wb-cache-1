The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of this signals is in the region of millisec-onds. Signals with a smaller <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> can cause high voltage stresses if the frequency of the signal corresponds to the natu-ral frequencies of the winding system.

These TDR/T techniques are used for IC and IC package interconnect characterization and equivalent circuit model extraction, which are important for evaluating the overall system performance in today's digital IC design. The frequency domain error correction has been used to get parameters for a Device Under Test (DUT) from time domain measurements. The same technique can be used as an intermediate step for obtaining the EA-TDR/T. Careful choice of the acquisition window and precise alignment of the DUT and calibration standard waveforms are necessary to get the accuracy enhancement for the TDR/T. Improved FFT techniques are used in order to recover the actual spectra of the step-like time domain waveforms acquired with an acquisition window with a finite time length. The EA-TDR/T waveform are recovered from error corrected frequency domain parameters of the DUT by launching an ideal excitation at the DUT and finding the response.

The solar wind velocity in the speed jump simulations is higher than that in the density jump simulations. Therefore, the <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> in the speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. In both the speed jump and density jump simulations, the PI amplitude increases as the PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> decreases. This tendency {{is the same as the}} relation between the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and the amplitude of the DL investigated by Araki et al. (2004). On the other hand, a difference is that the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is shorter than that of the DL. The <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the PI is at most 90 s, while the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the DL is at least 1.5 – 9 min. We can estimate the effective length of the PI from the product of the solar wind velocity and the <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> in our simulation results, which is ~ 3.5 Re from the speed jump simulations. This indicates that the effective region of the PI is more localized than that of the DL, which has an effective length of 30 Re. The reason for the short PI <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is that the dynamo generating the FAC is localized in the dayside magnetosphere. We next discuss the mechanism by which the dynamo generates the magnetic field disturbance on the ground via the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the self-modulation instability using bunches with finite <b>rise</b> <b>times.</b> Using particle-in-cell simulations we show that unlike long bunches with sharp <b>rise</b> <b>times,</b> there are large variations of the wake amplitudes and wake phase velocity when bunches with finite <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> are used. These results show that use of bunches with sharp <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> is important to seed the self-modulation instability and to ensure stable acceleration regimes.
