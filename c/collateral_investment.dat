When Þrms are able to pledge their assets as <b>collateral,</b> <b>investment</b> and borrowing become endogenous: pledgeable assets support more borrowings that in turn allow for further investments in pledgeable assets. We show that this credit multiplier has a Þrst-order effect on investment when Þrms face Þnancing frictions. In particular, investment—cash ßow sensitivities will be increasing {{in the degree of}} tangibility of constrained Þrms ’ assets. In contrast, if Þrms are unconstrained, investment—cash ßow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility. This theoretical prediction allows us to use a “differences in differences ” approach to identify the effect of Þnancing frictions on corporate investment: we compare the differential effect of asset tangibility on the sensitivity of investment to cash ßow across different regimes of Þnancial constraints. Using two layers of cross-sectional contrasts sidesteps concerns that cash ßows might correlate with a Þrm’s (residual) investment opportunities when Q fails as a control.

We show that this credit multiplier has {{a significant effect on}} investment when firms face credit constraints. Specifically, investment—cash flow sensitivities will be increasing in the degree of tangibility of financially constrained firms ’ assets. If firms are unconstrained, however, investment—cash flow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility. This theoretical prediction allows us to use a “differences in differences ” approach to identify the effect of financing frictions on corporate investment: we compare the differential (marginal) effect of asset tangibility on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow across different regimes of financial constraints. Using two layers of cross-sectional contrasts helps address the concern that inferences based on investment—cash flow sensitivities are biased when Q does a poor job in controlling for investment opportunities. We implement our testing strategy on a large sample of manufacturing firms drawn from COMPUSTAT between 1971 and 2000.

40|$|When {{firms are}} able to pledge their assets as <b>collateral,</b> <b>investment</b> and {{borrowing}} become endogenous: pledgeable assets support more borrowings that in turn allow for further investment in pledgeable assets. We show that this credit multiplier has an important impact on investment when firms face credit constraints: investment-cash flow sensitivities are increasing {{in the degree of}} tangibility of constrained firms' assets. If firms are unconstrained, however, investment-cash flow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility. Crucially, asset tangibility itself may determine whether a firm faces credit constraints - firms with more tangible assets may have greater access to external funds. This implies that the relationship between capital spending and cash flows is non-monotonic in the firm's asset tangibility. Our theory allows us to use a differences-in-differences approach to identify the effect of financing frictions on corporate investment: we compare the differential effect of asset tangibility on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow across different regimes of financial constraints. We implement this testing strategy on a large sample of manufacturing firms drawn from COMPUSTAT between 1985 and 2000. Our tests allow for the endogeneity of the firm's credit status, with asset tangibility influencing whether a firm is classified as credit constrained or unconstrained in a switching regression framework. The data strongly support our hypothesis about the role of asset tangibility on corporate investment under financial constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{the effect}} of real assets as {{collateral}} on the economy. As pointed out by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), when loans are collateralized and firms are credit constrained, the amount borrowed {{is determined by the}} value of the collateral; a decrease in the price of productive assets will therefore {{have a negative impact on}} firm investments. These effects are cumulative, which leads to credit cycles. There are potentially two major difficulties in empirically testing the relationship between <b>collateral</b> and firm <b>investments.</b> First, the value of collateral often is not observable due to the lack of active secondary markets for collateralizable assets, such as plants and machineries. Second, collateral is endogenous. For example, when firms invest they need to purchase machines and build plants, which expands their collateralizable assets. This paper deals with these two difficulties by using the land-price collapse in Japan in the early 1990 s as a natural experiment. In Japan, the main form of collateral for corporate borrowing is land, the value of which is observable. In addition, between 1990 and 1993, there was a near 50 % drop in land prices, which was unambiguously exogenous to any one individual firm. As firms suffer losses proportionate to their land holding, the amount of land held prior to the shock can serve as an exogenous instrument to measure collateral. I find that collateral affected Japanese firm investments in two important ways. The first is a collateral-damage effect: losses in <b>collateral</b> value reduced <b>investments.</b> The second is an indirect internal-liquidity effect: with reduced borrowing capacity, the firms had to rely more upon internally generated cash to finance their investments. In addition to the investment analysis, we use a unique dataset of matched firm-bank lending, which permits us to further examine the mechanism through which <b>collateral</b> affects firm <b>investments.</b> In particular, I investigate whether collateral losses also leads to reduced borrowing capacities. The matched sample allows me to control for unobservable heterogeneity in the loan supply. The results show, again, a significant collateral-damage effect: banks tended to lend less to those who suffered greater collateral losses...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{firm level}} data {{to show how}} R&D {{investment}} responds to shocks in sales growth in credit constrained firms. A credit constrained firm has to rely on its cash flow and borrowing capacity to survive its short-run liquidity shock when hit by a negative shock. This reduces the possibility for further borrowing in order to invest in non-tangible long term R&D, hence a negative shock should hit R&D investments more in firms that are more credit constrained. We find that in financially constrained firms sales growth is positively associated with R&D investment, suggesting procyclical behavior of R&D investment in credit constrained firms. In contrast, we find that in firms with no financial constraints R&D investment is negatively correlated with sales growth, suggesting countercyclical behavior of R&D, consistent with the Schumpeterian idea of restructuring. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} firm level response in R&D investment to sales growth is stronger in firms that are more financially dependent, such as firms that are no part of a multinational, firms not receiving subsidies or firms with less <b>collateral.</b> R&D <b>investment,</b> financial constraints, cyclicality...|$|R

30|$|We {{make three}} {{distinct}} contributions. Firstly, we {{contribute to the}} debate on the role of house price dynamics in bank balance sheets and business credit. Gan (2007) finds that Japanese banks that were more exposed to real estate development cut business lending after a sizable fall in aggregate real estate prices. However, Chaney et al. (2012) or Cuñat et al. (2014) advocate the use of local house prices to study balance sheet effects, as aggregate prices may correlate with macro factors such as exchange rates. Chaney et al. (2012) find that shocks to the value of firms’ <b>collateral</b> diminish <b>investment</b> while Cuñat et al. (2014) document that banks cut their lending in response to local house price drops. We estimate how local house prices and banks’ exposure to real estate development affect capital growth, NPLs and loans granted by banks. We also document that house price increases did not affect capital or business lending growth, but house price reductions actually did. Secondly, we find that house prices in the provinces where a bank operates affect business lending even when the prices in the locality where firms operate hold constant. That finding suggests that changes in local house prices spread to other regions through banks’ balance sheets.|$|R

The Henry George effect refers to the beneficial effects when land rent was main source of fiscal revenue allowing a very low tax rate on incomes and consumption. Prior to 1997, a strong property market, nurtured by a regime of low taxes and a policy that encouraged people to pour their savings into the housing market, gave much impetus {{to the economy and}} allowed entrepreneurs to obtain bank credit with relative ease using properties held as <b>collaterals.</b> Strong <b>investment</b> and consumption, sustaining economic growth even when exports growth was not so strong, caused an economic boom, further bolstering the run-up in property prices. Unfortunately, the Special Administrative Region Government did not realize the inevitability of property price increases during times of sustained prosperity and set out to increase housing supply significantly in an attempt to dampen the price increase. At the same time it went about boosting homeownership by selling public housing at deeply discounted prices, without knowing that this would immediately reduce the flow of funds from the richer public housing tenants into the housing market. The result was a collapse in property prices that amounted to several years of Hong Kong’s GDP. This destroyed an important source of fiscal revenue and also eroded the collateral values of properties. The resulting credit crunch also caused a dramatic shrinkage in the demand for office space, resulting in an even steeper decline in office rents and prices than residential rents and prices...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of credit-supply factors in {{business}} cycle fluctuations. For this purpose, we introduce an imperfectly competitive banking sector into a DSGE model with financial frictions. Banks issue collateralized loans to both households and firms, obtain funding via deposits and accumulate capital from retained earnings. Margins charged on loans depend on bank capital-to-assets ratios and {{on the degree of}} interest rate stickiness. Bank balance-sheet constraints establish a link between the business cycle, which affects bank profits and thus capital, and the supply and cost of loans. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using data for the euro area. The analysis delivers the following results. First, the existence of a banking sector partially attenuates the effects of demand shocks, while it helps propagate supply shocks. Second, shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share of the fall of output in 2008 in the euro area, while macroeconomic shocks played a limited role.

In a setting with uncertainty, two inputs with different <b>collateral</b> value and <b>investment</b> unobservability, {{we show that}} a firm-bank secured credit contract is time-inconsistent: Once credit has been granted, the entrepreneur has an ex-post incentive to alter the input combination towards the input with low collateral value and higher productivity, thus jeopardizing total bank revenues. Anticipating the entrepreneur's opportunism, the bank offers a non-collateralized credit contract, thereby reducing the surplus of the venture. One way for the firm to commit to the contract terms is to purchase inputs on credit and pledge them to the supplier in case of default. Observing the input investment and having {{a stake in the}} bad state, the supplier acts as a guarantor that the input combination specied in the bank contract will be actually purchased and that the entrepreneur will stick to the contract terms. The paper concludes that: (1) Buying inputs on account facilitates the access to collateralized bank financing; (2) Firms using both trade credit and collateralized bank nance invest more in pledgeable assets than firms only using uncollateralized bank credit. Our results are robust to the possibility of collusion between entrepreneur and supplier...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{financial}} markets in the interna-tional transmission mechanism {{in the context of}} a two-country gen-eral equilibrium model. I incorporate realistic frictions with respect to the external financing of investment, and I calibrate these fric-tions to reflect important differences in lending institutions between developed and developing economies. To overcome these frictions, the paper focuses, in particular, on {{the role of}} leverage in transmit-ting shocks from developed economies to developing economies. The results imply that high-leverage economies are particularly vulner-able to external shocks, and that asymmetries between lending con-ditions across economies provide a strong source of transmission for shocks from developed to developing economies. Furthermore, slow-downs in economic activity are severely amplified by financial fric-tions. The model implies that the degree of amplification is directly related to the degree of leverage in the economy. In many developing economies, firms face significant capital mar-ket imperfections when raising external funds to finance new invest-ment projects. These frictions stem from underlying asymmetries of information between borrowers and lenders. To overcoming these frictions, lenders must either engage in costly monitoring activities or require significant levels of <b>collateral</b> when financing <b>investment</b> projects. In such an environment, fluctuations in world demand lead to fluctuations in asset values that influence the overall level of self-financing.

40|$|We {{develop an}} OLG model aimed at {{explaining}} the joint determination of housing prices, rents, and interest rates, {{in an environment}} featuring a positive home ownership bias and individual borrowing limits that generate a mismatch between desired and available funds to finance housing purchases. Individual heterogeneity on this mismatch gives rise to three different types of households: renters, landlords (i. e. buy-to-let investors, who provide the stock of houses for rent) and home buyers who {{do not participate in}} the rental market. We investigate the conditions under which two alternative stationary equilibria may coexist: (i) a low valuation equilibrium (LVE) in which landlords do not exhaust their borrowing limits; and (ii) a high valuation one (HVE) where every household is financially constrained at the time of purchasing its housing stock. In a HVE (relative to the LVE) the volume of buy-to-let investment, the price-to-rent ratio and the housing price are higher while the interest rate is lower. Due to binding borrowing constraints, in a HVE further reductions in the interest rate only bear a positive networth effect through a reduction of the cost of repaying outstanding mortgaged debt, which fuels future availability of funds, thus sustaining the higher demand for credit. More generally, coexistence of both types of equilibria provides a rationale for the existence of speculative paths from a LVE to a HVE. price-to-rent ratio, <b>collateral</b> constraints, buy-to-let <b>investment,</b> multiple equilibria...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{the role}} of real assets in credit rationing. The {{analysis}} {{is based on the}} idea that asset tangibility is inversely related to the probability that a firm will be credit constrained. Indeed, when loans are collateralized, the amount borrowed is determined by the value of collateral. This happens because in a context of asymmetric information banks use real assets as a guarantee in the case of project’s default. Consequently, a reduction in <b>collateral</b> values reduces <b>investments</b> and the borrowing capacity. Although many papers have explained the relationships between the debt level and the value of real assets, empirical evidence is mainly based on large “listed” firms. The question as to the whether these arguments are valid for smaller firms has received limited attention. Many papers also show that specialized assets should fetch a low resale price. This suggests that a high resale price corresponds to a highly redeployable asset and that the reduction in resale value aggravates credit rationing, so that investment declines. My purpose is to show empirically how the value of real assets explains credit rationing of Italian small and medium firms. It is interesting to analyze small and medium firms because of their ownership structure and size they have fewer financial options. Large firms can obtain credit on the public markets while small firms depend on financial intermediaries. This implies that their main source of funds is banks. These firms are more likely to face credit rationing or very high cost of non collateralized debt because banks resolve asymmetric information by charging higher interest rates or collateral requirement on small firms. Moreover, using the Propensity Score Analysis I show that public subsidies reduce credit rationing. credit rationing, panel data, public subsidies...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, leading {{industrial}} nations and many developing countries have deregulated their financial markets. Financial liberalization has produced major benefits, including more efficient intermediation of financial resources, more rapid economic development and faster growth in trade.

This historical evidence indicates that financial liberalization encourages banks to increase their lending commitments and equity investments in the real estate and securities markets. A rapid growth of credit and investment in those markets typically produces an economic 2 ̆ 2 boom, 2 ̆ 2 which is fueled by positive feedback between rising asset prices and the willingness of creditors and investors to provide additional financing in the belief that asset values will continue to increase. Under such conditions, asset prices tend to 2 ̆ 2 overshoot 2 ̆ 2 and reach levels that cannot be justified by economic 2 ̆ 2 fundamentals 2 ̆ 2 (e. g., the actual cash flow generated by real estate projects and business ventures).

This apparent correlation between deregulation and banking crises suggests that financial liberalization has a 2 ̆ 2 dark side, 2 ̆ 2 because it tends to create a banking system that is more vulnerable to systemic risk.

Cross section analysis results show that in 2007 PT. Excelcomindo Pratama, Tbk. have the best performance in the management of working capital and for liquidity, namely PT. Mobile- 8 Telecom, Tbk. In the year 2008 shows that companies with working capital management is best, namely PT. Excelcomindo Pratama, Tbk. and PT. Bakrie Telecom, Tbk. have the best level of liquidity. The year 2009 PT. Excelcomindo Pratama, Tbk. have better performance in the management of working capital when compared to other companies, whereas in liquidity guarantees PT. Bakrie Telecom, Tbk. showed better results. Suggestions that may be filed in this research that is expected to telecommunications companies to maintain and improve upon the company's financial performance so far, where the results are showing a tendency to increase. However, expected the company to strengthen its position in particular valuation measure the ratio of the price compared to earnings ratio, to measure the operating efficiency ratio is expected to improve the company's billing period is expected to be able to provide <b>collateral</b> for the <b>investments</b> that have been granted by the investor. For investors are expected to analyze the performance of the company not only uses a single analysis but rather by using a combination of the results of the analysis of financial performance so that it can be seen in depth on the performance achieved by the company Keywords: Working Capital and Liquidity Approac...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} field of asset price bubbles. It is {{comprised}} of three independent chapters. Each of these chapters {{either directly or indirectly}} analyse the existence or implications of asset price bubbles. The type of bubbles assumed in each of these chapters is consistent with rational expectations. Thus, the kind of price bubbles investigated here are known as rational bubbles in the literature. The following describes the three chapters. Chapter 1 : This chapter attempts to explain the recent US housing price bubble by developing a heterogeneous agent endowment economy asset pricing model with risky housing, endogenous <b>collateral</b> and defaults. <b>Investment</b> in housing is subject to an idiosyncratic risk and some mortgages are defaulted in equilibrium. We analytically derive the leverage or the endogenous loan to value ratio. This variable comes from a limited participation constraint in a one period mortgage contract with monitoring costs. Our results show that low values of housing investment risk produces a credit easing effect encouraging excess leverage and generates credit driven rational price bubbles in the housing good. Conversely, high values of housing investment risk produces a credit crunch characterized by tight borrowing constraints, low leverage and low house prices. Furthermore, the leverage ratio was found to be procyclical and the rate of defaults countercyclical consistent with empirical evidence. Chapter 2 : It is widely believed that financial assets have considerable persistence and are susceptible to bubbles. However, identification of this persistence and potential bubbles is not straightforward. This chapter tests for price bubbles in the United States housing market accounting for long memory and structural breaks. The intuition is that the presence of long memory negates price bubbles while the presence of breaks could artificially induce bubble behaviour. Hence, we use procedures namely semi-parametric Whittle and parametric ARFIMA procedures that are consistent for a variety of residual biases to estimate the value of the long memory parameter, d, of the log rent-price ratio. We find that the semi-parametric estimation procedures robust to non-normality and heteroskedasticity errors found far more bubble regions than parametric ones. A structural break was identified in the mean and trend of all the series which when accounted for removed bubble behaviour in a number of regions. Importantly, the United States housing market showed evidence for rational bubbles at both the aggregate and regional levels. In the third and final chapter, we attempt to answer the following question: To what extend should individuals participate in the stock market and hold risky assets over their lifecycle? We answer this question by employing a lifecycle consumption-portfolio choice model with housing, labour income and time varying predictable returns where the agents are constrained in the level of their borrowing. We first analytically characterize and then numerically solve for the optimal asset allocation on the risky asset comparing the return predictability case with that of IID returns. We successfully resolve the puzzles and find equity holding and participation rates close to the data. We also find that return predictability substantially alter both the level of risky portfolio allocation and the rate of stock market participation. High factor (dividend-price ratio) realization and high persistence of factor process indicative of stock market bubbles raise the amount of wealth invested in risky assets and the level of stock market participation, respectively. Conversely, rare disasters were found to bring down these rates, the change being severe for investors in the later years of the life-cycle. Furthermore, investors following time varying returns (return predictability) hedged background risks significantly better than the IID ones...|$|R
