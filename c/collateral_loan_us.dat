Especially, {{a case of}} Yamaguchi prefecture in the 1870 s is focused on. At {{the beginning of the}} Meiji era, although the system of the remittance draft was sufficiently developed, that of the commercial bill, which should be crucial for distant trades to expand, was in an undeveloped stage. In such a stage, what sustained the expanding distant trade? To answer the question, this paper investigates the commodity <b>collateral</b> <b>loan,</b> which had developed through the Tokugawa era. "Jun-eki-sha", which was established in 1874 at Yamaguchi prefecture, is the one of the representatives of such a traditional financial organization. Through the investigation of their books, "Jun-eki-sha" was found to be managed rather healthily, and it provided the commission merchants with the short term operating capital. Thus, expanding trades at the begging of the Meiji era were sustained, at least partially, by the heritage from the Tokugawa era: That is, the commodity <b>collateral</b> <b>loan.</b> Japanese modern economic history, Rural financial institution, Commodity <b>collateral</b> <b>loan.</b> ...|$|R

If the person pays off the car loan and wants to sell the car, the bank may veto the deal because the car is still used to secure the home loan and other loans. Technically, cross-collateralization expires when the borrower has no outstanding loans with the bank. In the context of bankruptcy, cross-collateralization also means the collateralization of general unsecured prepetition debt by <b>collateral</b> securing postpetition <b>loans.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to {{an early}} lack of bridges across Burrard Inlet, and the {{distance}} from Jewish institutions, the Jewish population of West Vancouver and North Vancouver was small until after the Second World War. One of the notable Jewish businessmen who settled there was Samuel Gintzburger. He served on the first West Vancouver municipal council in 1912, founded the Vancouver Hebrew Free Loan Association, was a long-time president of Vancouver's Temple Emanu-El, and mentored Jewish children from the Juvenile Court. Another North Shore businessman was Louis Brier, who willed his Gold Rush fortune to fund a non-sectarian seniors' home, orphanage, and hospital. This became the Louis Brier Home in Vancouver. A third notable resident was Harry Evans, who helped to establish Beth Israel Cemetery in Burnaby in 1946. He also founded the B.C. <b>Collateral</b> <b>Loan</b> Co.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting results in the literature concerning the empirical relation between <b>collateral</b> and <b>loan</b> risk. We posit that certain economic characteristics of collateral may be associated with the empirical dominance of different risk-collateral channels implied by economic theory, namely the “lender selection,” “borrower selection,” “risk-shifting,” and “loss mitigation” channels. Each of these four channels has different predictions regarding the empirical relations between <b>collateral</b> and <b>loan</b> risk. For our sample of commercial loans, we find that the “lender selection” channel appears to be especially important for outside collateral, the “risk-shifting” and “loss mitigation” channels are important for liquid collateral, and the “borrower selection” channel appears to hold weakly for nondivertible collateral. Our results suggest that the conflicting results in the extant riskcollateral literature may occur because different samples may be dominated by collateral with different economic characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{corporate}} governance role of banks by investigating the effect of bank monitoring on the borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses suggest that a borrowing firm's earnings management behavior generally decreases as the strength of bank monitoring increases. The strength of bank monitoring is measured as (1) the magnitude of a bank loan, (2) the reputation (rank) of a lead bank, (3) {{the length of a}} bank loan, and (4) the number of lenders. These results imply that bank monitoring {{plays an important role in}} the corporate governance of bank-dependent firms. We further examine other bank <b>loan</b> characteristics (<b>collateral,</b> refinancing, <b>loan</b> types, and loan purposes) and their effects on borrowers' earnings management behavior. Our analyses show that <b>collateral</b> and <b>loan</b> types are significantly associated with borrowers' earnings management behavior while refinancing and loan purposes have no association.
