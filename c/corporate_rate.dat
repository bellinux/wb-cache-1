40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{effective}} <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> on the size distribution of firms. In modelling this relationship we account for conditional variables as well as unobservable time and industry effects. A number of hypotheses are tested concerning heterogeneity in the impact of effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> on the size distributions of firms with regard to firm size class, industry and time. The results are based on data covering the whole Swedish economy for the period 1973 - 2002. The descriptive results suggest that effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> differ by firm size, industry and over time. Application of t-tests demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> between major size classes but not within major size classes: smaller firms report a higher effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rate</b> than larger firms. The t-tests also demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> between industrial sectors: service sector reports a higher effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rate</b> than production sector. The regressions show effective <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> to have: {{a negative effect on}} the size distribution of large firms, negative effect on transportation, financing and service sector and a positive effect on manufacturing, electricity and on production sector.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports on}} a large {{empirical}} study of <b>corporate</b> <b>rates</b> of return in emerging markets during the 1980 's and 1990 's. It focuses on the nature and intensity of competition and {{how it should be}} measured. The data on <b>corporate</b> <b>rates</b> of return, profit margins and output:capital ratios are used to examine the question whether liberalization and globalization in the 1990 's have led to greater competition than before. Persistency in <b>corporate</b> <b>rates</b> of return is analyzed to address issues of the dynamics of the competitive process in these economies. The sample frame consists normally of the 100 largest corporations quoted on the stock markets of the following countries: Argentina, India, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Zimbabwe. The results are compared with those for advanced countries. Although the paper does not directly address the question of the present crisis in East Asian countries, it inter alia provides evidence on some of the structural hypotheses about the deeper causes of the crisis. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1990 s the SADC {{region has}} closely {{followed}} declining trends {{that occurred in}} the industrialised world in terms of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates.</b> The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to find appropriate explanations behind these trends as experienced in the SADC region. A cross-section panel, including the so-called Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), is applied to uncover the main determinants of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> in the region. The main findings of the paper acknowledge the vulnerability of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates</b> to global influence. The presence-of-trade variable relating to openness and international pressure takes precedence in the determination of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates.</b> The results indicate that higher trade ratios mean lower statutory <b>corporate</b> <b>rates</b> as international influence intensifies. It also tends to confirm the region’s dependency on trade for tax revenues, but also its ability to still attract tax revenues from capital flows. Some evidence exists in terms of an association between the government expenditure-GDP ratio and the statutory and average <b>corporate</b> tax <b>rates,</b> although this is not definitive. The paper re-emphasises the importance of international pressure in terms of future tax policy-making in the SADC region but also opens an avenue for further tax co-operation efforts. J. E. L.

However, as of 2005, the <b>corporate</b> <b>rate</b> was set at 24%. The revised depreciation schedule for corporate assets favors investments in high-tech equipment and oil and gas exploration. Depreciation rates are 10% a year for buildings, 25% a year for equipment and computers, 25% for geological and exploratory costs, and 20% a year for all other assets. However, accelerated depreciation is allowed for capital spending allocated for production purposes at twice the standard rates. Included in this are expenditures on the building of those facilities {{that are to be}} used in the actual manufacture of goods. The value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18%, while the property tax was raised from [...]5% to 1% of assessed value. A [...]05% Road Fund Tax on turnover was abolished, but there is a highway tax imposed on foreign-registered vehicles collected by customs authorities. There are payroll taxes paid by the employer amounting to 32%, 30% going to the Social Protection Fund, and 2% going to the Employment Fund. There are excise taxes, but excise paid for goods used in production can be off set against excise charged for the finished product.
