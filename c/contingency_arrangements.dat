40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studied and}} compared Special Educational Needs (SEN) provision in two selected schools catering for pupils {{with a variety}} of learning difficulties; one in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia and the other in the south west region of the United Kingdom (UK). The project aims were to:- • identify the different types of SEN which are recognised in the two countries; • discover what provision exists for pupils with SEN, and what methods are employed to ensure they are able to access curriculum learning opportunities efficiently in each school; • consider the effect of cultural attitudes and differences upon SEN provision in both settings; • improve the author's, and colleagues' practice, in SEN provision, by the sharing and exchanging of methods and strategies in Zambia and the UK; • provide a useful resource for others involved in global development education. Permission was obtained from the Head Teachers of both schools before the project began, and all participants were fully informed {{about the nature of the}} study through discussion with an agreed Ethics Protocol. Agreement was obtained either in person, or via e-mail, from UK and Zambian colleagues, during the period of study from October 2007 to March 2008. Methods of systematic observation and semi-structured interview were used for the collection of qualitative data, in order to produce a comparative case study of the selected Zambian and UK schools. By combining or "triangulating" the findings from both data collection methods a greater insight into the area of study was achieved. <b>Contingency</b> <b>arrangements</b> for adoption were considered, should the plan to collect enough data in Zambia be unsuccessful. It was decided that redirection of efforts to researching UK SEN provision in greater depth, possibly with more emphasis on differentiation and teaching styles, would be appropriate. In reality this proved un-necessary, since Zambian colleagues were enthusiastic and supportive, enabling adequate collection of relevant data. From the findings of this study it was concluded that similar types of SEN are identified in both countries, with the exception of Behavioural, Emotional and Social Disorder (BESD) in Zambia. The greatest difference encountered was the effect of cultural attitude on SEN Provision, particularly concerning girls, other vulnerable children, and the impact of HIV/AIDS in Zambia. Despite lower levels of funding, staffing and resources, SEN provision in the Zambian setting compared favourably with that in the UK setting; due to the commitment and resourcefulness of staff.

This article critically analyzes the practice of lawyers taking equity in their clients as compensation for rendering legal services. The article concludes that equity billing can provide significant private benefits to law firms and clients, as well as indirect public benefits. The article also concludes that equity billing can be usefully analogized to contingency fee arrangements: equity billing is to start-up clients and corporate legal work what <b>contingency</b> fee <b>arrangements</b> are to impecunious litigants and access to the courts.

40|$|The BRIC acronym {{was created}} at the {{beginning}} of the 2000 s to represent a group of four fast-growing economies – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and was changed to BRICS in December 2010 with the inclusion of South Africa. At its fifth annual summit in Durban at the end of March 2013, the group announced the future establishment of a New Development Bank (NDB) to meet infrastructure investment needs in the developing world. At their sixth annual summit in Fortaleza the following year (July 2014), the BRICS finally agreed on the broader arrangements for the bank – an initial US$ 50 bn fund – and coupled this achievement with the launch of the <b>Contingency</b> Reserve <b>Arrangement</b> (CRA) – US$ 100 bn to be accessed to alleviate members’ financial difficulties (US$ 41 bn from China, US$ 5 bn from South Africa and US$ 18 bn from each of the others). The Bank will start lending in 2016. Despite this achievement, commentators estimate that even if the NDB eventually increases its capital to US$ 100 bn with injections from non-BRICS states and institutions (up to a maximum capital share from non-BRICS countries of 45 per cent), most infrastructure needs in the developing world will remain unmet. Compared to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank – whose subscribed capital is US$ 223 bn and US$ 162 bn respectively – the additional capital available from the NDB is too small to fill the financing gap (Spratt 2014). According to World Bank estimates, South Asia alone requires US$ 2. 5 tn over the next ten years, while overall the BRICS states are estimated to need a total of more than US$ 4. 5 tn over the next five years for infrastructure development.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. The research used diaries, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions of householders, floodworkers and other affected stakeholders and followed the recovery experiences of people across Hull after the floods of June 2007 which affected over 8, 600 households across the city. The project undertook a real-time longitudinal study to document and understand the everyday experiences of individuals following the floods of June 2007 in interaction with networks of actors and organisations, strategies of institutional support and investment in the built environment and infrastructure. The research aimed (i) to identify and document key dimensions of the longer term experience of flood impact and flood recovery, including health, economic and social aspects, (ii) to examine how resilience and vulnerability were manifest in the interaction between everyday strategies of adaptation during the flood recovery process, and modes of institutional support and the management of infrastructure and the built environment, (iii) to explore {{to what extent the}} recovery process entailed the development of new forms of resilience and to identify the implications for developing local level resilience for flood recovery in the future, and (iv) to develop an archive that will be accessible for future research into other aspects of flood recovery. The findings showed flood recovery to be a long and difficult process with no clear beginning or end. Far from being an incremental, linear process, respondents' recovery is punctuated by 'highs' and 'lows' which are closely tied to other pressures and life events. Recovery is not complete when people move 'back home', as aspects of daily life are shown to have fundamentally changed – both for better and for worse. Many of the difficulties experienced by residents result from the existence of a 'recovery gap'. This emerges as the legally-defined <b>contingency</b> <b>arrangements</b> provided to the community by its local authority diminish and the less well-defined services provided by the non statutory/private sector e. g. insurance, builders start. The nature of this gap means that residents receive little support during this time and, as a result, they must attempt to coordinate the actions of the different organizations involved. Such 'project management' is time-consuming, exhausting and stressful as it requires residents to acquire new skills, challenge 'expert' judgements and engage in new kinds of physical, mental and emotional work. By suggesting ways in which residents can be better supported, the research is of direct practical relevance for organizations involved in recovery and the building of resilience. Further information about the project may be found on the Flood, vulnerability and resilience: a real-time study of local recovery following the floods of June 2007 in Hull webpage.

40|$|Natural gas {{presently}} provides {{nearly one}} quarter of New Zealandʼs primary energy and, since the production started at the Maui gas field over twenty years ago, the quantity of gas used in electricity generation has more than doubled, with about {{one quarter of}} electricity demand now generated from natural gas. Gas {{has proven to be}} a competitive and versatile thermal fuel in the industrial, commercial and residential markets and is a necessary and reliable complement to renewable resources in electricity generation. Underpinning the attractiveness of gas is efficient and cost-effective combustion and generation technology and a highly reliable system of supply. Gas is supplied from the production and processing facilities in Taranaki to the principal gasfired power stations through a high-pressure transmission system. Whilst this system has operated to a high level of reliability since the 1970 ʼs, it does not have built into its design 1 the reliability criteria, such as N- 1, applied in electricity transmission networks whereby the loss of a linkage within the system will not cause a failure elsewhere. The reliability of the gas transmission system can be ascribed to its engineering and operational competence rather than the availability of back-up supplies through the design of the network layout. The few failures in gas supplies which have occurred have generally been of short duration and caused by damage to the transmission pipelines, such as washout by flooding or impact by digging machinery operating adjacent to the buried pipeline. Unlike the electricity transmission network, there is some storage capacity within the gas system as the gas is transmitted at high pressure (up to 86 bar) and consumers can be supplied for some time as the gas decompresses in the pipeline downstream of the damage. During the washout of the Hawkes Bay pipeline in 2004, there was sufficient compressed gas, or linepack, in the pipeline to supply the residential gas market for the week the pipeline was out of operation. However, larger industrial consumers could not receive gas during this period. Government and the gas industry is aware of this potential vulnerability to gas supplies and, through the Gas Industry Company, is replacing existing industry arrangements for dealing with critical contingencies with regulations under the Gas Act. The resulting Gas Governance (Critical Contingency Management) Regulations 2008 include, inter alia, the appointment of a critical contingency operator, the preparation of critical contingency management plans, and curtailment arrangements to reduce gas supply to consumers. They are intended to permit the more efficient management of situations when gas supply is affected by short-term production outage or physical problems with the transmission system which the market proves unable to manage although they do not specify a maximum period for which the <b>contingency</b> <b>arrangements</b> will be applied. One of CAENZʼs principal areas of activity is developing a more thorough understanding of the resilience of New Zealand infrastructure to natural hazards and the inter-dependencies between any vulnerabilities and the wider economy. The natural gas supply system is a significant part of this infrastructure and little publicized work has been undertaken to investigate the impact of sustained failures within the supply system on gas availability and the consequent impact on gas consumers, in particular the electricity generators which have a wider impact on electricity consumers. This lack of investigation is due in part to the high level of reliability of gas supplies. Whilst gas supplies may be crucial to many commercial and industrial consumers, relatively few have back-up measures in place to replace gas if it were not available. In some cases this is because the consumersʼ operations require the particular properties of natural gas but in most cases it is due to the costs of making provision for back-up fuels which is deemed unnecessary given the high reliability of natural gas supply. However, this is not to say that situations cannot occur which result in a sustained shortfall of gas supplies. It is the intention of this investigation to provide a better understanding of the impact of breakdowns in the gas supply system on the availability of gas to consumers and the consequent impact on their operations. Specific attention is given to the impact of gas availability on electricity generation and the interplay between gas and electricity demand when gas is in short supply...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (International Commercial Law) The Original BRIC Organization {{comprising}} Brazil, Russia, India and China, {{was first}} conceived in 2001 {{as part of}} an economic modeling exercise to forecast global economic trends. Fast forward almost a decade into its existence and BRIC was up for a change. The BRIC foreign Ministers at a meeting held in New York in 2010, came to an agreement to invite South Africa to join the Organization. On the 14 April 2011, South Africa attended the first joint summit, evolving the former BRIC to what is known today as BRICS, the “S” referring to South Africa. This move is seen as a significant step, as its members‟ now come from four different continents and is sure to turn heads in the “old North”, {{what used to be the}} traditional Western dominance over the global economy. BRICS comprises some of the world‟s fastest growing and biggest economies, as illustrated by the statistics that emanated from the most recent summit held in Durban in March 2013. Senior Goldman Sachs economist Jim O‟ Neil, the person responsible for coining the „BRIC‟ acronym, predicted in 2001 that the combined economies of Brazil, Russia and China would overtake the United States and the G- 7 countries. Since that bold statement in 2001, the words uttered by O‟Neil have become more than just a prediction. As Bidwai points out, BRICS account for over 40 % of the world‟s population, 18 % of its market- exchange GDP, 15 % of world trade and two-fifths of its foreign currency reserves. It goes without saying that the BRICS group has many advantages and strengths that would stand it in good stead going forward. As previously stated, its members are among the fastest growing in the world, economically speaking, and were also least affected by the financial crisis that rocked many of the world‟s powerhouses. There has even been talk of a BRICS Development Bank, which was first tabled in 2012 at the Delhi summit.

40|$|Discovering whether {{children}} prefer reinforcement via {{a contingency}} or independent {{of their behavior}} is important considering the ubiquity of these programmed schedules of reinforcement. The current study evaluated the efficacy of and preference for social interaction within differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) and noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) schedules with typically developing children. Results showed that 7 of the 8 children preferred the DRA schedule; 1 child was indifferent. We also demonstrated {{a high degree of}} procedural fidelity, which suggested that preference is influenced by the presence of a contingency under which reinforcement can be obtained. These findings are discussed in terms of (a) the selection of reinforcement schedules in practice, (b) variables that influence children’s preferences for contexts, and (c) the selection of experimental control procedures when evaluating the effects of reinforcement. DESCRIPTORS: concurrent-chains <b>arrangement,</b> <b>contingency</b> strength, differential rein-forcement, noncontingent reinforcement, preference assessment _______________________________________________________________________________ Two treatments routinely programmed after determining the social function of problem behavior (Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, & Richman, 1982 / 1994) involve either the con-tingent or noncontingent delivery of reinforce-ment. Contingent reinforcement is usually delivered following the occurrence of a target response (e. g., differential reinforcement); by contrast, noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) is delivered independent of responding via a time-based schedule (Vollmer, Iwata, Zarcone, Smith, & Mazaleski, 1993). Selecting either schedule type may be influenced by the relative effectiveness of each (Kahng, Iwata, DeLeon, & Worsdell, 1997) or practical issues associate...|$|R
40|$|Norway’s {{perception}} {{that it is}} a ‘peace nation’, embodied in the annual presentation of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo since 1901, has been shaped by its traditions of social solidarity, egalitarianism, consensual approaches to resolving conflict, absence of a colonial history, and its economic dependence on a rule based international order. In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords affirmed peacemaking’s place within foreign policy, and defined the ‘Norwegian Model’ of peacemaking, characterised by a close partnership between the Norwegian state and academic and humanitarian organisations. This was underwritten by generous and long term humanitarian aid in conflict affected areas. Through the 1990 s, the Norwegian model of peacemaking was highly resistant to institutionalisation and capture by the state, drawing heavily on informal NGO networks held by State Secretary Jan Egeland, which attracted increasing state funding in a positive feedback loop. From 2000 onward, Norwegian peacemaking activity experienced increasing institutionalisation as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) adjusted to the exit of Egeland and sought to adopt long term and consistent approaches. Based on extensive evaluation of past interventions, the current institutional structure features a section within the Department for UN and Humanitarian Affairs dedicated to peace and reconciliation work with 14 employees and a budget of approximately AUD $ 105 million working in close coordination with the NGO sector. Norway’s experience underlines the importance of managing the tension between a flexible and effective framework for peacemaking which incorporates the NGO and development community and resists potentially harmful procedural capture by the state, and the need to create durable state institutions in order to sustain peacemaking within foreign policy over long time frames. States seeking to learn from Norway’s experience can consider adopting a general strategic framework for peacemaking to ensure consistency and coherence {{in the context of the}} country’s broader foreign policy, coupled with specific peacemaking strategies in response to a given conflict, which cannot be pre-determined. Modest institutional structures are required to support this approach, including: a) a standing inter-departmental peacemaking committee or unit responsible for overall strategy, coordinating personnel, reviewing capabilities and ensuring coherence between interventions and broader peacemaking strategy; b) an analytical unit of the standing committee to monitor conflicts and undertake intervention need and feasibility assessments; c) a strategic evaluation group; d) a mediation standby roster; e) core funding to support the standing committee and sub units; and, f) <b>contingency</b> funding <b>arrangements</b> to enable rapid responses to emerging crises.

40|$|The {{conference was}} {{organized}} {{in part to}} dispel some of the misinformation that interferes with cooperative efforts of attorneys and physicians to redress the malpractice situation. During discussion of the hypothetical case, participants identified how medical decision-making responsibilities were allocated among health care providers caring for the patient. Panel members suggested ways in which medical decision making might be affected by non-medical factors such as third-party reimbursement (e. g., selection of inpatient or outpatient setting, the opportunity to discuss issues related to informed consent prior to the day of a procedure) and potential malpractice litigation (e. g., documentation in charts, use of diagnostic procedures). The characterization of decision-making roles and responsibilities differed somewhat for purposes of malpractice litigation; that is, which caregivers might be named as defendants. Panel members reconstructed {{the development of the}} medical incident into a legal case. Plaintiff's attorney commented that it is often a hospital employee who advises the family to consult an attorney and described some of the constraints on information gathering (e. g., the rule of "discovery" requiring that suit be filed before defendants can be forced to give statements about what happened, insurance contract provisions prohibiting physicians from talking without legal counsel present to persons who indicate that they plan to file suit). He also briefly explained the rationale for the <b>contingency</b> fee <b>arrangement</b> in these cases. Describing the role of the medical expert witness and the need to review the medical record, he outlined the process of deciding whether to pursue a malpractice case. In making this decision, plaintiff's attorney evaluates the facts to identify issues in the case, to determine if there are deviations from the standard of care, and to try to predict jury reaction. If a suit is filed, defense attorneys employed by the hospital, insurance company, or individual defendants will decide, based on facts including coverage limits, possible publicity, and likelihood of successful prosecution, whether the case should be settled and for what amount. Interests represented by the defense attorneys differ and may affect settlement strategies. Physician feelings of concern for the patient/family or desire for vindication will, to varying degrees, be factors in the decision to try or settle a case. Panel members explored several important policy issues. Among these were the effect of malpractice cases on doctor-patient communications and ethical issues concerning expert witnesses.
