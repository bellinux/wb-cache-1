500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a <b>coiled</b> <b>spring,</b> although most pitchers {{think of him as a}} coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the percentage of force degradation of elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at different time intervals in different media. Materials and methods: Three types of space closing auxiliaries, such as elastomeric chains, NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and stainless steel <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthrinse (Colgate plax) and alcohol-containing mouthrinse (Listerine) at time interval of 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days were divided into nine groups of 15 each: Group I- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group II- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group III- 15 polyurethane elastomeric chain immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group IV- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group V- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group VI- 15 stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. Group VII- 15 NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside artificial saliva (Control). Group VIII- 15 nickel titanium closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-free mouthrinse. Group IX- 15 NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> immersed inside alcohol-containing mouthrinse. The percentage of force degradation was measured with the universal testing machine. Results: The force produced by elastomeric chain, stainless steel closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and NiTi closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at seven time intervals in artificial saliva, alcohol-free mouthwash and alcohol-containing mouthwash showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The force degradation in alcohol-containing mouthwash solution (Listerine) is more as compared to alcohol-free mouthwash solution (Colgate plax) ...|$|R
40|$|Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> {{are used}} {{commonly}} to create {{space for a}} buccally or lingually/palatally blocked out a tooth. However, as space opens up the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> loosens most of its activation and thus requires reactivation. Various techniques {{have been developed to}} re-activate the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> without removing the base archwire. While reactivating the open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> has to be compressed towards one side using wire tucker or with the tip of the finger, thus making the procedure very cumbersome for the clinician. A new simple and efficient method to overcome this problem is an open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> retractor, which secures the compressed open <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on one side to the adjacent bracket, thus rendering clinician to perform reactivation procedures with ease...|$|R

The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: [...] "I much obligated to you. You be good man to me." [...] Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant’s heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said [...] "I die like a soldier" [...] before he was shot to death.|$|E

Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi <b>coil</b> <b>spring.</b> Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> (30 each). Open <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> were tested in compression and closed <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> in tension using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001). Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit. Permanent deformation exhibited by SS <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> is due to high stiffness is low spring fact.
