5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a belt of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} system near Gustav was forecast {{to have an}} effect on the development of the system; however, the tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status around 1200UTC on August26. Not long after attaining hurricane-status, the ridge steering Gustav to the west began to break down, causing the hurricane to slowly turn towards the north. By 0600UTC on August27, the storm attained Category 2 intensity, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles, passing 205miles (330km) to the east. By this time, hurricane and tropical storm-force winds extended 35miles (55km) and 175miles (280km) from the center respectively.|$|E
50|$|Polar {{vortices}} are weakest {{during summer}} and strongest during winter. Extratropical cyclones that migrate into higher latitudes when the polar vortex is weak can disrupt the single vortex creating smaller vortices (<b>cold-core</b> <b>lows)</b> within the polar air mass. Those individual vortices can persist {{for more than}} a month.|$|R
5000|$|Tropical-like systems, {{referred}} to as [...] "medicanes," [...] are occasionally observed over the Mediterranean Sea. Several of these storms have developed eye-like features and hurricane-force winds; however, their nature is contrary {{to that of a}} tropical cyclone. The majority of these storm originate from deep, <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> which they do not fully disassociate from. Additionally, unlike tropical systems, sea surface temperatures above 26 C are not required for their development.|$|R
500|$|Most {{cloud cover}} and {{precipitation}} {{in association with}} cold lows occurs during the daylight hours as sunlight warms the Earth's surface, destabilizing the atmosphere and causing upward vertical motion. The development of severe weather, particularly tornadoes, can occur {{near the center of}} these systems over land during any season of the year. During winter, when <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach [...] move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible.|$|R
5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed <b>cold-core</b> <b>low.</b> The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|On June16, {{satellite}} imagery revealed {{an area of}} increased convection east of the Bahamas, which was {{believed to have been}} associated with a tropical wave. On June17, the convection increased in organization at the lower levels of the atmosphere. By 1800UTC, the system had organized sufficiently to be designated as a tropical depression, making it the first of the season. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwest under the steering currents of the low-level flow around the western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical ridge. Strong wind shear due to fast upper-level winds associated with a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> over the eastern Gulf of Mexico hindered further intensification for a time, but on June18, an area of deep convection developed north of the center of circulation. Based on analysis of reconnaissance data, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur at 1900UTC on June19.|$|E
2500|$|Using charts of mean 200-hectopascal {{circulation}} for July through August (located [...] {{above sea}} level) {{to locate the}} circumpolar troughs and ridges, trough lines extend over the eastern and central North Pacific and over the North Atlantic. [...] Case studies of upper tropospheric cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific have been performed by using airplane reports (winds, temperatures and heights), radiosonde data, geostationary satellite cloud imagery, and cloud-tracked winds throughout the troposphere. It was determined they were the origin of an upper tropospheric <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows,</b> or cut-off lows.|$|R
50|$|Polar lows {{form for}} a number of {{different}} reasons, and a spectrum of systems is observed on satellite imagery. A number of lows develop on horizontal temperature gradients through baroclinic instability, and these can have the appearance of small frontal depressions. At the other extreme are the polar lows with extensive cumulonimbus clouds, which are often associated with cold pools in the mid- to upper-troposphere. During winter, when <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach -45 C move over open waters, deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible.|$|R
50|$|This Barotropic {{vorticity}} equation assumes {{the atmosphere is}} nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, there is no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones).|$|R
5|$|Tropical Storm Marco was {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall on the United States during the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. The 13th named storm of the season, Marco formed from a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> pressure area along the northern coast of Cuba on October9, and tracked northwestward through the eastern Gulf of Mexico. With most of its circulation over the western portion of Florida, Tropical Storm Marco produced 65mph (100km/h) winds over land. However, it weakened to a tropical depression before moving ashore near Cedar Key. The cyclone combined with a cold front and the remnants of Hurricane Klaus to produce heavy rainfall in Georgia and the Carolinas. After interacting with the nearby Hurricane Lili, Marco continued northward until being absorbed by a cold front on October13.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> which {{affected}} the latter stages of Josephine {{developed at the}} surface and became a subtropical storm on October 6, about 875mi (1,408.1km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward, nearly intensifying into a hurricane. On October 11, the subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics. Simultaneously, the now-tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane, and was re-classified as Hurricane Lili. After becoming a hurricane, Lili headed rapidly west-southwestward, and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h). After passing 140mi (230km) south of Bermuda later that day, Lili began to curve slowly northward, thereby avoiding landfall in the United States. While about 200mi (321.9km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, Lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, Lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. However, Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm on October 14, just offshore of Nova Scotia. The post-tropical cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cold-core</b> <b>low,</b> {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
5000|$|Polar {{cyclones}} are climatological features which hover {{near the}} poles year-round. They are weaker during summer and strongest during winter. When the polar vortex is strong, the Westerlies increase in strength. When the polar cyclone is weak, the general flow pattern across mid-latitudes buckles and significant cold outbreaks occur. Extratropical cyclones which occlude and migrate into higher latitudes create <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> within the polar vortex. [...] Volcanic eruptions {{in the tropics}} lead to a stronger polar vortex during the winter {{for as long as}} two years afterwards. [...] The strength and position of the cyclone shapes the flow pattern across the hemisphere of its influence. An index which is used in the northern hemisphere to gage its magnitude is the Arctic oscillation.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The baroclinic properties of the Mediterranean region, with high temperature gradients, also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising cool air, provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows,</b> is possible in a conducive environment for formation.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of medicanes often {{results from the}} vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well, resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding {{with an increase in}} relative humidity, creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. This, in turn, leads to in an increase in potential energy, producing heat-induced air-sea instability. Moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts—the vertically downward movement of air—which often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones, and in such a scenario, wind shear remains minimal; overall, <b>cold-core</b> cut-off <b>lows</b> serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced warm-core lows such as medicanes. The regular genesis of <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>lows</b> and the infrequency of Mediterranean tropical cyclones, however, indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter. Elevated sea surface temperatures, contrasting with cold atmospheric air, encourage atmospheric instability, especially within the troposphere.|$|R
5|$|At Valencia {{and other}} regions of eastern Spain, the storm {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched down over the Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance of the tropical cyclone's landfall. Medicanes as small as the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale low over the western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off <b>cold-core</b> <b>low,</b> a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debra was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that {{developed during the}} 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season, Debra originated from the interaction of a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> and a tropical wave on July15. The system was designated a tropical depression on July23 when it was south of Louisiana and meandered westward while it swiftly intensified into a tropical storm along the Gulf Coast of the United States. A turn towards the northwest became evident as it attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale the following day while it organized into a developed storm. As the hurricane curved northward at a slow forward speed, strength was maintained as it approached the coast of Texas as a minimal hurricane. It came ashore during the evening of July24 local time (0000UTC on July25) between Freeport and Galveston, Texas. It rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland, and dissipated on July28 while it turned northwestward. The remnant moisture later sparked upper-level thunderstorms in late July and early August.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, the {{tropical}} cyclone {{that was once}} Hurricane Ilsa degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, about 1,200miles (1,950km) west of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Ilsa drifted northwestward through the stratocumulus cloud field of the eastern north Pacific Ocean. At the same time, a mid-tropospheric trough slowly intensified while gradually undergoing cyclogenesis to develop into a cold-core upper-level low. Early on August 31, a low-level circulation formed within the upper-level low about 930 miles (1,500 km) northeast of Hawaii; at that time, the circulation and the remnants of Ilsa were located within 370 miles (600 km) of each other. The <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> rapidly intensified as convection increased, and late on August 31 it absorbed the remnants of Ilsa, which influenced the development of the system. Convection steadily organized as it tracked westward, and it is estimated it transitioned into a subtropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 1.|$|E
5000|$|The {{season began}} on June 1, {{which was the}} date when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{activated}} radar stations across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The season ended on November 30, which ended the conventional delimitation of the time period when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. At {{the end of the}} season, NHC director Gordon Dunn retired and was replaced by Robert Simpson. For the first time in 1967, the NHC tracked weaker, developing tropical disturbances, observing that 90% of systems do not develop. Tropical cyclogenesis [...] - [...] the process in which a tropical cyclone develops [...] - [...] resulted mainly from tropical waves, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and decaying frontal systems. There were 30 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa at Dakar, Senegal, of which 14 became tropical depressions. Another 20 tropical disturbances originated offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, and 7 disturbances derived from <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Barotropic models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours.

If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately 5.5 km is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a geopotential height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>low.</b> By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|R
5|$|On July29, 1987, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward along the southern edge of the Saharan Air Layer, a feature associated with large masses of dry air, little convective development took place over the following several days. Once near the Lesser Antilles in early August, atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development. Traveling across the Caribbean Sea, the system became increasingly organized and a mid-level circulation formed shortly before the wave moved inland over Central America on August7. The following day, the northern portion of the wave interacted with a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> over the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the formation of a low-level circulation, exhibiting tropical characteristics, on August9. Over the following two days, the system tracked in a general north-northwest direction towards the Texas coastline. Aided by an anticyclone aloft, outflow became pronounced and convection increased in coverage and intensity. Around 1200UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system developed into {{a tropical}} depression while located about 145miles (235km) south-southeast of Galveston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|With {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h) and strengthening, the {{subtropical}} storm initially drifted northeastward. On December 13, a ridge of high pressure to its north forced the storm southeastward, {{and the following}} day the storm turned to the south after an upper-level <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> developed over the system. A break in the ridge resulted in the storm turning to the northeast, with its forward motion accelerating to nearly 40mph (65km/h). After turning to the northwest on December 17, the high pressure system again halted its northward movement, leaving the storm drifting south-southeastward. Conditions favored further strengthening, and the subtropical storm reached 70mph (115km/h) winds on December 18. Satellite imagery estimated the storm attained hurricane status on December 19, and a day later ship near the center reported winds of 75mph (120km/h). Based on the wind report, {{as well as a}} minimum central pressure of 980 mbar and a well-defined eye, the storm was classified as Hurricane Lili while located 730miles (1,180km) east of Bermuda.|$|E
25|$|A {{low-pressure}} area formed {{south of}} Guam on September 22. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. Owing to the low-level circulation center (LLCC) rapidly consolidating with convective banding, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression {{late on the}} same day. Overall, the environment was favorable for further development, with a developing anticyclone over the LLCC, weak vertical wind shear, and good poleward outflow due to a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> north of the system.|$|E
50|$|Late on June 3, 2009, a <b>cold-core</b> non-tropical <b>low</b> {{pressure}} area located {{over the}} Baltic Sea {{collided with a}} warm air mass, creating atmospheric instability. The result was a line of severe thunderstorms, {{also known as a}} squall line, in the Moscow area. One of the thunderstorms broke off and developed into a supercell thunderstorm about 30 km from Moscow, Russia. The supercell spawned a 150 m wide tornado in Krasnozavodsk. The tornado reached F3 intensity along its path. The tornado was the first intense tornado to impact the Moscow region in nearly 25 years. Upwards of 38 mm of rain fell throughout the impacted regions. This is roughly half the monthly rainfall average.|$|R
500|$|A {{polar low}} is a small-scale, {{short-lived}} atmospheric low-pressure system (depression) that is found {{over the ocean}} areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Polar <b>lows</b> are <b>cold-core</b> {{so they can be}} considered as a subset of extratropical cyclones. Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes. The most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the Arctic during the winter, such as the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Labrador Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall. Antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller [...] However, vigorous polar lows can be found over the Southern Ocean. During winter, when <b>cold-core</b> <b>lows</b> with temperatures in the mid-levels of the troposphere reach [...] move over open waters, deep convection forms, which allows polar low development to become possible. The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than [...] and exist for no {{more than a couple of}} days. They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems. Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations, such as shipping and gas and oil platforms. Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, Arctic hurricane, Arctic low, and cold air depression. Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17m/s.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{originated}} in a <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>low</b> that persisted {{for several days}} in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also {{led to the formation}} of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas.|$|R
500|$|Debra {{originated}} in an upper-level <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> pressure system that developed over southwestern Florida in late August1978. The low moved southwest towards the Yucatán Peninsula {{over the next}} day, as a tropical wave drifted westwards from the Caribbean Sea. The interaction between the upper-level system and the wave {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression on August 26 around [...] south of New Orleans.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{confined}} {{character of}} the Mediterranean and the limited capability of heat fluxes—in the case of medicanes, air—sea heat transfer—tropical cyclones with a diameter larger than [...] cannot exist within the Mediterranean. Despite being a relatively baroclinic area with high temperature gradients, the primary energy source utilized by Mediterranean tropical cyclones is derived from underlying heat sources generated {{by the presence of}} convection—thunderstorm activity—in a humid environment, similar to tropical cyclones elsewhere outside the Mediterranean Sea. In comparison to other tropical cyclone basins, the Mediterranean Sea generally presents a difficult environment for development; although the potential energy necessary for development is not abnormally large, its atmosphere is characterized by its lack of moisture, impeding potential formation. The full development of a medicane often necessitates the formation of a large-scale baroclinic disturbance transitioning late in its life cycle into a tropical cyclone-like system, nearly always under the influence of a deep, cut-off, <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> within the middle-to-upper troposphere, frequently resulting from abnormalities in a wide-spreading Rossby wave—massive meanders of upper-atmospheric winds.|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Diane {{originated}} in a tropical wave first observed as a tropical depression on August7 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. The system moved generally to the west-northwest, intensifying into {{a tropical storm}} on August 9. By the time the Weather Bureau first classified the storm on August 10, Diane was south of the Bermuda high, a semi-permanent ridge in the jet stream just east of Nova Scotia. Ships {{in the region of}} the storm reported winds of [...] During the next day, the Hurricane Hunters reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized. The storm interacted with Hurricane Connie to its northwest in a process known as the Fujiwhara effect, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a <b>cold-core</b> <b>low</b> that increased atmospheric instability. On August 12, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in barometric pressure, despite moving away from the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>low.</b> The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|R
5|$|The {{depression}} moved westward quickly, {{and moved}} through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September 6. The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern Venezuela, though after entering the Caribbean Sea, another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm {{the existence of a}} low-level circulation. Shortly thereafter, while moving into an area of light wind shear, it was able to organize and strengthen further, and on September 7 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith near the island of Curaçao. While initially, a <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>low</b> persisted about 750 miles (1200 km) northwest of the storm, Edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent ridge of high pressure, which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean, the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone. This allowed the storm to strengthen further, and on September 8, Edith became a hurricane in the south-central Caribbean Sea.|$|R
500|$|The 1975 Pacific Northwest {{hurricane}} was {{an unusual}} Pacific tropical cyclone that attained hurricane status farther north than any other Pacific hurricane.

The twelfth tropical cyclone of the 1975 Pacific hurricane season, it developed from a <b>cold-core</b> upper-level <b>low</b> merging with {{the remnants of a}} tropical cyclone on August 31, well to the northeast of Hawaii. Convection increased as the circulation became better defined, and by early on September 2 it became a tropical storm. Turning to the northeast through an area of warm water temperatures, the storm quickly strengthened, and, after developing an eye, it attained hurricane status late on September 3, while located about 1,200miles (1,950km) south of Alaska. After maintaining peak winds for about 18hours, the storm rapidly weakened, as it interacted with an approaching cold front. Early on September 5, it lost its identity near the coast of Alaska.|$|R
