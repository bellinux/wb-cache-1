5|$|Scattered {{throughout}} {{each level}} are {{various types of}} <b>crates,</b> most of which contain items such as Wumpa Fruit and Aku Aku masks, {{which can be broken}} by jumping on or spinning into them. Other types of crate include checkpoint <b>crates,</b> which lets players resume their progress after losing a life, arrow <b>crates</b> which Crash can bounce on, and explosive TNT <b>crates</b> that explode upon being broken, or following a timer that activates by jumping on them. Certain <b>crates,</b> including steel platform <b>crates,</b> are invisible, requiring the player to hit an exclamation box to make them tangible. If the player clears a level with all <b>crates</b> broken without dying, they will earn a gem. Additional gems can be obtained through hidden levels or alternate routes, and some gems are required to access new areas. Collecting all gems in the game allows the player to reach its true ending. If the player manages to collect enough bonus icons, they will be warped to a Bonus Stage which, upon completion, will allow the player to save their progress, either via memory card or password.|$|E

50|$|Locking {{the dog in}} a <b>crate</b> {{and letting}} it whine, bark and attempt to escape is common but such {{attempts}} to introduce <b>crate</b> training may cause a negative association with <b>crating.</b> The dog should become slowly accustomed to the <b>crate.</b> This can involve making a <b>crate</b> an inviting place by placing small familiar toys inside, moving the pet bed into <b>crate,</b> leaving unwashed items of the owner's clothing inside, rewarding pets for entering the <b>crate</b> and remaining inside, incorporating the <b>crate</b> as part of play, feeding the pet in the <b>crate,</b> allowing the pet to explore and use the <b>crate</b> until {{it is no longer}} intimidating, and eventually building to the pet sleeping in the <b>crate</b> overnight.|$|R

5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo <b>crates,</b> as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo <b>crates</b> during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply <b>crates</b> to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot <b>crates</b> – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on <b>crates</b> and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden <b>crate</b> designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. A Closed <b>Crate</b> {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open <b>Crate</b> is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an open <b>crate</b> as compared to a closed <b>crate.</b> Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the <b>crate</b> would be considered an open <b>crate.</b> The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the <b>crate</b> unsheathed. An unsheathed <b>crate</b> is a frame <b>crate.</b> A Frame <b>Crate</b> is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an open <b>crate</b> will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|R

5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} at Yangon International Airport (formerly RAF Mingaladon) in early 2013 failed to locate any of the rumoured aircraft, and the team {{reported}} that they {{found no evidence that}} Spitfires were shipped there in <b>crates</b> or buried. Pat Woodward, who was an RAF pilot operating from Burma {{at the end of the}} war, reported that no such burying took place. In 2016 it was reported that the hunt was continuing.|$|E
5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in <b>crates</b> in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} {{soldiers on the}} high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in <b>crates</b> and assembled on the airfield.

5000|$|<b>Crate</b> {{training}} {{is the process}} of teaching a pet to accept a dog <b>crate</b> or cage as a familiar and safe location. Advocates claim that dogs are den-dwelling animals and that a <b>crate</b> can become a den substitute. While this is a widely held belief, there is little evidence to support it. Regardless, most puppies can learn to tolerate <b>crate</b> training if it is introduced properly. The initial stress from being confined can give way to [...] "increased feelings of security, safety, and comfort" [...] after repeated exposure to the <b>crate.</b> Long term or excessive <b>crate</b> confinement [...] "may lead to emotional and behavioral deterioration over time." [...] On the other hand, if properly done, <b>crate</b> training can {{play a major role in}} housebreaking a dog as fast as possible. Ordinarily, it is seen as a way of confining a dog and restricting its movement and freedom. However, it serves a bigger and greater purpose. <b>Crate</b> training can help dogs gain full bowel and bladder control while enjoying some delicious treats in their cozy and well set-up “apartment”. If <b>crate</b> {{training is}}n’t taken seriously, things can get out of hand and a dog may start soiling around the house.|$|R

5|$|The {{second level}} {{of the game is}} in Beirut, and focuses on the player, along with a group of Navy Seals, rescuing hostages in a 3D {{presentation}} of the city. If the player is successful in rescuing the hostages and recovering all missiles, the remaining forces will rendezvous at a submarine. During the game, the player-character may grapple onto ledges, climb ladders, crawl, and jump in any direction. The player can also push large <b>crates</b> in order to reach higher platforms. Combat is focused on shooting an enemy with a weapon on sight, however the player can crawl at any time {{in order to avoid the}} oncoming bullets of an enemy. The player is also able to neutralise enemies by dropping down onto them whilst dangling from a higher platform. In every level, the game sets a time limit when a bomb is placed on one of the <b>crates</b> containing Stinger missiles.|$|E
5|$|At the Port of San Francisco, Steilberg {{inspected}} each {{shipment of}} stones, several thousand <b>crates</b> in all. The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier, {{was used for}} storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E

50|$|A <b>crate</b> is a box (chassis) that mounts in an {{electronics}} rack with {{an opening in}} the front facing the user. There are rails on {{the top and bottom of}} the <b>crate</b> that extend from the open (user) end to the back end of the <b>crate.</b> The back end of the <b>crate</b> contains power and data connectors that modules connect to. Electronics modules slide into the <b>crate</b> along the rails and plug into the power/data connectors at the back. Modules have signal connectors, controls, and lights on their faceplate that are used to interact with other modules.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>crate</b> {{engine is}} {{typically}} a fully assembled automobile engine that is {{shipped to the}} installer on a [...] "Crate". <b>Crate</b> engines are manufactured by many different companies, but they all share the same characteristics of being complete engines ready to install once removed from the <b>crate.</b> Generally a <b>crate</b> engine only needs bolt on accessories such as water pump, fuel system, and exhaust. This type of engine has various applications including general replacement, hot rod builds and motorsports competition. <b>Crate</b> engines are often seen as an economical solution opposed to engine overhauls or custom builds.|$|R
5|$|Halo 3 is {{the final}} game in the main Halo trilogy, ending the story arc begun in Halo: Combat Evolved. The game was {{released}} on the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. It adds to the series new vehicles, new weapons, and a class of items called equipment. The game also includes a limited map-editing tool, known as the Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and <b>crates,</b> into existing multiplayer map geometry. Players can also save a recording of their gameplay sessions, and view them as video, from any angle.|$|E
5|$|Kaga {{entered the}} {{shipyard}} on 15 December 1938, where her arrester gear {{was replaced by}} a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters, 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in <b>crates</b> as spares.|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through <b>crates.</b> During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E

5|$|The department's origins lie in {{the royal}} collection, but it was {{augmented}} by Napoleon's 1798 expeditionary trip with Dominique Vivant, the future director of the Louvre. After Jean-François Champollion translated the Rosetta Stone, CharlesX decreed that an Egyptian Antiquities department be created. Champollion advised the purchase of three collections, formed by Edmé-Antoine Durand, Henry Salt and Bernardino Drovet; these additions added 7,000works. Growth continued via acquisitions by Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mariette, after excavations at Memphis, sent back <b>crates</b> of archaeological finds including The Seated Scribe.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported <b>crates.</b> In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon <b>crates.</b> These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in <b>crates</b> on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. Part {{of the reason for}} deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents. The exiled Norwegian military authorities had originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be able}} to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crate</b> {{engines are}} {{often seen as}} an {{economical}} choice no matter the application. In general automobile engine replacement a <b>crate</b> engine is often very competitively priced {{when compared to the}} cost of a full rebuild of a faulty engine. Installers often opt for the <b>crate</b> engine because of the cost and ease of replacement. <b>Crate</b> engines are typically a bolt in replacement with no internal work being performed to the engine compared to a complete overhaul that required internal part replacement by trained mechanics. Hot Rod and other custom street applications also often choose a <b>crate</b> engine because of the value when compared to a custom built engine.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Ampeg, and {{its parent}} company, St. Louis Music (also makers of <b>Crate</b> amps) was {{purchased}} by LOUD Technologies Inc.
