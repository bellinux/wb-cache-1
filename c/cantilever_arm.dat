50|$|A {{suspension}} bridge works by hanging a roadway from cables or chains under tension. Though a few unstiffened {{suspension bridge}}s exist, a longitudinal stiffening truss or girder is usually added to prevent excessive {{movement of the}} deck. The cables pass over towers and are anchored at both ends. Conventional suspension bridges use massive concrete or rock anchorages to resist the cable’s tension. In self-anchored suspension bridges, however, the cables are fastened to {{both ends of the}} longitudinal girders. These girders are therefore compression struts in addition to stiffening the roadway.Because each of Pittsburgh's Three Sisters appears to be a self-contained unit not dependent on the river banks for anchorage, a debate ensued among engineers whether these structures were cantilevers rather than suspension bridges. While current wisdom holds them to be the latter, the erection procedure shows how each bridge was built in halves toward the center. Temporary diagonal struts between chain and deck provided shear resistance turning each incomplete half into a trussed <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm.</b> These struts 'freed themselves' when the halves were jacked together and connected to form a suspension bridge.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Because many {{mechanical}} {{variables are}} present in the oral cavity, the proper load transfer between the prosthesis and the bone is important for treatment planning and for the longevity of the implant-supported fixed partial denture. Objectives To verify the stress generated on the peri-implant area of cantilevered implant-supported fixed partial dentures and the potential effects of such variable. Material and Methods A U-shaped polyurethane model simulating the mandibular bone containing two implants (Ø 3. 75 mm) was used. Six groups were formed according to the alloy’s framework (CoCr or PdAg) and the point of load application (5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm of <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm).</b> A 300 N load was applied in pre-determined reference points. The tension generated on the mesial, lingual, distal and buccal sides of the peri-implant regions was assessed using strain gauges. Results Two-way ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests were applied showing significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the groups. Pearson correlation test (p< 0. 05) was applied showing positive correlations between the increase of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> and the deformation of the peri-implant area. Conclusions This report demonstrated the CoCr alloy shows larger compression values compared to the PdAg alloy for the same distances of cantilever.

50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor <b>arms,</b> two <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor <b>arms</b> and <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 ft feet long, the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> are 50 ft long, and the suspended span is 100 ft. The bridge has a total length of 430 ft. The center span of 200 ft is the longest box girder span constructed in the state during the 1940s.|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the biological and}} technical success outcomes of implant-supported fixed dental prostheses with and without cantilevers, after a minimum of one year loading. Material and methods One hundred and seven subjects with 128 cantilever FDPs (cFDP) supported by 132 implants were compared with 99 individuals with 144 non-cantilever FPDs (ncFDPs) supported by 203 implants. Outcomes such as marginal bone loss from FDP insertion to final follow-up as well as frequency and extent of biological and technical complications were investigated and correlated with patient, site, implant and FDP design characteristics. Results The cFDPs were followed for average of 51 months (1551 days, SD ᠹ 77), and ncFPDs for 49 months (1483 days, SD ᠸ 09 days). Implant survival and success rates were 96. 7 % and 87. 9 % for implant supporting cFDPs, and 99. 5 % and 92. 6 % for ncFDPs. There {{was no significant difference}} in overall bone loss between cFDPs and ncFDPs (cantilever side: 0. 58, SD ᠱ. 16 - non-cantilever side: 0. 59, SD ᠰ. 99), but implants in the cantilever group lost significantly more bone in the posterior mandible (0. 50 SD ᠱ. 3 mm for cFDPs and 0. 24 SD ᠰ. 80 mm for ncFDPs). Within the cantilever group, <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> length and implant location had an influence on bone loss. Regardless of the presence of cantilever, implants associated with technical complications had a higher rate of biological complications as well. Furthermore, the length of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> was positively correlated with implant failure, technical complications and bone loss = 1. 5 mm (P = 0. 011, < 0. 001, and 0. 007).

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the remote {{maintenance}} system project (WPRM) for the demonstration fusion power reactor (DEMO). Following ITER, DEMO aims to confirm the capability of generating several hundred of MW of net electricity by 2050. The main objective of these activities is to develop an efficient and reliable remote handling (RH) system for replacing the divertor cassettes. This paper presents the preliminary results of the concept design of the divertor RH system. The proposed divertor mover is a hydraulic telescopic boom driven from the transportation cask through the maintenance tunnel of the reactor. The boom is divided in three sections of 4 m each, and it is driving an end-effector in order to perform the scheduled operations of maintenance inside the vacuum vessel. Two alternative design of the end effector to grip and manipulate the divertor cassette are also presented in this work. Both the concepts are hydraulically actuated, basing on the ITER previous studies. The divertor cassette end-effector consists of a lifting arm linked to the divertor mover, a tilting plate, a <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> and a hook-plate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the deformation suffered by cantilevered implant-supported fixed prostheses frameworks cast in silver-palladium alloy and coated with two occlusal veneering materials: acrylic resin or porcelain. Material and Methods: Two strain gauges were bonded to the inferior surface of the silver-palladium framework and two other were bonded to the occlusal surface of the prosthesis framework covered with ceramic and acrylic resin on each of its two halves. The framework was fixed to a metallic master model and a 35. 2 N compression force was applied to the cantilever at 10, 15 and 20 mm from the most distal implant. The measurements of deformation by compression and tension were obtained. The statistical 2 -way ANOVA test was used for individual analysis of the experiment variables and the Tukey test was used for the interrelation between all the variables (material and distance of force application). Results: The results showed that both variables had influence on the studied factors (deformation by compression and tension). Conclusion: The ceramic coating provided greater rigidity to the assembly and therefore less distortion compared with the uncoated framework and with the resin-coated framework.
