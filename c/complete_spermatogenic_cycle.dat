40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to clarify the effect of Kemzyme or Bentonite and their mix as feed additives on the main semen characteristics, testicular enzyme markers, plasma testosterone level and fertility indices of bucks. Twenty four mature NZW rabbit bucks of about 4 -month age and average body weight 2. 400 kg were equally divided into four groups (6 in each). The first group was kept untreated (C). The second group (K) was supplemented with 0. 1 % “Kemzyme”, a multi-enzyme. The third group (B) was supplemented with 2 % sodium bentonite while the fourth group (KB) was supplemented with Kemzyme plus bentonite. The dietary treatment lasted for 10 weeks to cover a <b>complete</b> <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Results obtained revealed better sexual activity and higher libido of (K) and (KB) bucks. Besides, significant improvement in their different semen parameters, blood testosterone level, seminal total lipids concentration and the activities of different seminal enzymes. Such improvement was complementary to the higher fertility indices that also noticed on bucks of the same groups. Practically, it could be considered that (K) supplementation is a good reproductive promotant tool in the field of rabbit production. </p...|$|E

The temporal–spatial dynamics of the cycle highlight the unique, complex, and interdependent interaction between germ and somatic cells, and {{are the key to}} continual sperm production. Although understanding the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> has important clinical relevance for male fertility and contraception, {{there are a number of}} experimental obstacles. For example, the lengthy process cannot be visualized through dynamic imaging, and the precise action of germ cells that leads to the emergence of testicular morphology remains uncharacterized.

The computer model is able to elaborate the germ cell dynamics in a time-lapse movie format, allowing us to trace individual cells as they change state and location. More importantly, the model provides mechanistic understanding of the fundamentals of male fertility, namely how testicular morphology and sperm production are achieved. By manipulating cellular behaviors either individually or collectively in silico, the model predicts causal events for the altered arrangement of germ cells upon genetic or environmental perturbations. This in silico platform can serve as an interactive tool to perform long-term simulation and to identify optimal approaches for infertility treatment and contraceptive development...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{seasonal}} {{changes in}} {{the capacity of the}} testicular tissue of the masked civet cat, Paguma l. larvata, to produce testosterone from radioactively labelled pregnenolone in vitro, has been measured chroma-tographically, together with an analysis of the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> and the lipid cycle of the interstitial Leydig cells. Testosterone is the main androgen produced by the civet cat testis in vitro and its production, assessed as a percentage conversion from the precursor added, closely follows the interstitial lipid <b>cycle</b> and seasonal <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle,</b> reaching a peak in March and rapidly declining {{at the end of the}} reproductive season. The most active period of testo-sterone production takes place at a time when the interstitial cells are becoming rapidly depleted of their lipids, and the very rapid decline which takes place in July is marked histochemically by the interstitial tissue entering a heavily lipoidal end-phase.

40|$|The {{different}} cellular {{stages of}} the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> in man were identified and categorised from the array of cells observed in preparations obtained from whole tubules of the testis. This included description of meiotic figures. An attempt to establish {{the dynamics of the}} spermatogenic process was then made by two complementary approaches. Experimental work, initiated to establish and maintain differentiation in tissue culture, was successful. In vitro labelling with tritiated thymidine identified S phase spermatogonia and S phase primary spermato- cytes and followed the fate of these cells. At ten days, labelled primary spermatocytes were distinguishable from labelled spermatogonia and at 10 - 12 days a surge of unlabelled primary spermatocytes, identified at diakenesis, was observed. Changes in cell category frequencies were recorded with time in tissue culture and between individuals. Cell category frequencies were also studied in a series of infertile males. This revealed very considerable variation, with some categories not represented in some individuals. Significant relationships were found between some cell categories in the series. These trends allowed the cell categories to be assigned to the sequence of events within the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> with some confidence. Reasons were given for assigning differences in cell category frequencies to a rate effect due to a combination of cell division events and the proportional duration of each cell stage. Previous models of spermatogenesis have concentrated on multiplication due to division to explain ratios between cell categories. One cell category was a particularly important factor for describing the activity of the germinal epithelium.

Parental generations (BALB/c mice) were exposed to air pollution in chambers with or without filtering PM(2. 5) for 4 months. Animals were mated, and half of the 1 -day-old offspring were moved between chambers, which yielded prenatal and postnatal groups. Remaining offspring comprised the non-exposed and pre+postnatal exposed groups. After 90 days, the animals were sacrificed for testis collection and weighing. Optical microscopy was used for the morphometric analyses of the cell counts, <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle,</b> proliferation, and apoptosis. Prenatally exposed animals presented reduced body and testicular weight with an increased gonadosomatic index (GSI). Testicular volume also decreased, as well as the tubular diameter in testes of the same animals.

40|$|International audienceDirect {{evidence}} for a role of endogenous retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of vitamin A in the initial differentiation and meiotic entry of spermatogonia, and thus in the initiation of spermatogenesis is still lacking. RA is synthesized by dedicated enzymes, the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH), and binds to and activates nuclear RA receptors (RARA, RARB, and RARG) either within the RA-synthesizing cells or in the neighboring cells. In the present study, {{we have used a}} combination of somatic genetic ablations and pharmacological approaches in vivo to show that during the first, prepubertal, <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> (i) RALDH-dependent synthesis of RA by Sertoli cells (SC), the supporting cells of the germ cell (GC) lineage, is indispensable to initiate differentiation of A aligned into A 1 spermatogonia; (ii) RARA in SC mediates the effects of RA, possibly through activating Mafb expression, a gene whose Drosophila homolog is mandatory to GC differentiation; (iii) RA synthesized by premeiotic spermatocytes cell autonomously induces meiotic initiation through controlling the RAR-dependent expression of Stra 8. Furthermore, we show that RA of SC origin is no longer necessary for the subsequent <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycles</b> but essential to spermiation. Altogether, our data establish that the effects of RA in vivo on spermatogonia differentiation are indirect, via SC, but direct on meiotic initiation in spermatocytes, supporting thereby the notion that, contrary to the situation in the female, RA is necessary to induce meiosis in the male...|$|R

However, in Djungarian hamsters up to 15 days of age, the rate of spermatogenic development was accelerated. The estimated duration of the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> ranged between 5. 0 and 5. 3 days. In the rats, spermatogenesis also was accelerated during the first 15 days of life, with an estimated duration of the seminiferous cycle of 4. 5 - 5. 3 days. From 15 days of age onward, the rate of progression was strongly reduced, being compatible with the adult value of 12. 8 days. In the Chinese hamsters, a similar change in the rate of spermatogenesis occurred at 25 days. Before this age, spermatogenesis proceeded with an estimated duration of the cycle of 8. 8 - 9. 2 days. From 25 days onward, spermatogenesis advanced much more slowly, at a rate compatible with the adult value of 17. 0 days. Despite the strong reduction in the rate of spermatogenic progression in the three species, the cellular associations in the stages of spermatogenesis were not affected. In the three species, the clear reduction in the rate of spermatogenic progression correlated with the process of testicular descent, with the appearance of pachytene spermatocytes associated with preleptotene spermatocytes, and with the onset of tubular lumen formation.

40|$|Abstract Background Inorganic arsenic {{is a major}} water {{pollutant}} and a known human carcinogen that has a suppressive influence on spermatogenesis and androgenesis in male reproductive system. However, the actual molecular events resulting in male reproductive dysfunctions from exposure to arsenic remain unclear. In this context, we evaluated the mode of action of chronic oral exposure of sodium arsenite on hypothalamo-pituitary- testicular activities in mature male albino rats. Methods The effect of chronic oral exposure to sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg body weight/day) via drinking water without or with hCG (5 I.

Changes in paired testicular weights, quantitative study of different varieties of germ cells at stage VII of <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle,</b> epididymal sperm count, circulatory concentrations of hormones (LH, FSH, testosterone and corticosterone), testicular activities of delta 5, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (delta 5, 3 beta-HSD), 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as the levels of biogenic amines (dopamine, noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT)) in the hypothalamus and pituitary were monitored in this study. Hormones were assayed by radioimmuno- assay or enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay and the enzymes were estimated after spectrophotometry as well as the biogenic amines by HPLC electrochemistry. Results Sodium arsenite treatment resulted in: decreased paired testicular weights; epididymal sperm count; plasma LH, FSH, testosterone and testicular testosterone concentrations; and increased plasma concentration of corticosterone. Testicular enzymes such as delta 5, 3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD, and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) were significantly decreased, but those of acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly increased. A decrease in dopamine or an increase in noradrenaline and 5 -HT in hypothalamus and pituitary were also noted after arsenic exposure. Histological evaluation revealed extensive degeneration of different varieties of germ cells at stage VII of <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> in arsenic exposed rats. Administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) along with sodium arsenite partially prevented the degeneration of germ cells and enhanced paired testicular weights, epididymal sperm count, plasma and intratesticular testosterone concentrations, activities of delta 5, 3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD and sorbitol dehydrogenase along with diminution in the activities of ACP, ALP and LDH. Since many of the observed arsenic effects could be enhanced by oestradiol, it is suggested that arsenic might somehow acts through an estrogenic mode of action. Conclusion The results indicate that arsenic causes testicular toxicity by germ cell degeneration and inhibits androgen production in adult male rats probably by affecting pituitary gonadotrophins. Estradiol treatment has been associated with similar effects on pituitary testicular axis supporting the hypothesis that arsenite might somehow act through an estrogenic mode of action. </p...|$|R

In the immature rat testis, there is a marked developmental increase in AMH type II receptor (AMHRII) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in Sertoli cells, concomitant with the initiation of spermatogenesis. AMHRII mRNA is also expressed {{at a high level}} in Sertoli cells in adult rats. To obtain information about the possible functions of AMH in the testis, we investigated the postnatal expression patterns of the genes encoding AMH and AMHRII in the rat testis in more detail. Using RNase protection assays, AMH and AMHRII mRNA expression was measured in total RNA preparations from testes or testicular tubule segments isolated from control rats and from rats that had received various treatments. The testicular level of AMHRII mRNA was found to be much higher than that of AMH mRNA in adult rats. AMH mRNA was detected at a maximal level at stage VII of the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> and at a low level at the other stages. AMHRII mRNA increases from stage XIII, is highest at stages VI and VII, and then rapidly declines at stage VIII to almost undetectable levels at stages IX-XII. It was found that the increase in testicular AMHRII mRNA expression during the first 3 weeks of postnatal development also occurs in sterile rats (prenatally irradiated), and hence, is independent of {{the presence or absence of}} germ cells. Yet, the total testicular level of AMHRII mRNA was decreased in sterile adult rats (prenatally irradiated or experimental cryptorchidism), as compared with intact control rats.

The species feeds exclusively on vertebrates: mammals (45 %), reptiles (28 %), birds (17 %), and amphibians (10 %). There was an ontogenetic dietary shift in terms of frequency of prey consumed and in terms of prey size; moreover, an intersexual difference in prey frequency was found. Sexual maturity was attained at 540 mm snout-vent length (SVL) in males, and 720 mm SVL in females. Males showed a vernal <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Oviposition occurred at the beginning of summer, and offspring were observed in the field during September...|$|R
40|$|Histomorphology and {{ultrastructure}} of the testis during {{breeding and}} nonbreeding {{phases of the}} reproductive cycle of the lizard Mabuya carinata are studied. Observations of the ultrastructural features of the testis during breeding and nonbreeding phases of the reproductive cycle reveal a prenuptial type of spermatogenesis and a clearcut discontinuous <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Seminiferous tubules are enlarged and there is active spermatogenesis {{as shown by the}} presence of all the stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia to spermatids) and spermatozoa during the breeding phase (November). During the nonbreeding phase (April) only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells are seen in the shrunken seminiferous tubules. Leydig cells and Sertoli cells show distinct changes in the morphological appearance with hypertrophy of the cells in breeding phase and atrophy of the cells in the nonbreeding phase of the reproductive cycle. The present study suggests that Sertoli cells and Leydig cells functions are synchronous in the lizard M. carinata. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
40|$|De novo point {{mutations}} and chromosomal structural aberrations (CSA) {{detected in}} offspring of unaffected parents show a preferential paternal origin with {{higher risk for}} older fathers. Studies in rodents suggest that heritable mutations transmitted from the father can arise from either paternal or maternal misrepair of damaged paternal DNA, and that the entire <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> can be at risk after mutagenic exposure. Understanding the susceptibility and mechanisms of transmission of paternal mutations is important in family planning after chemotherapy and donor selection for assisted reproduction. We report that treatment of male mice with melphalan (MLP), a bifunctional alkylating agent widely used in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during male mouse meiosis that persist unrepaired as germ cells progress through DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development. After fertilization, unrepaired sperm DNA lesions are mis-repaired into CSA by the egg's DNA repair machinery producing chromosomally abnormal offspring. These findings highlight the importance of both pre-and post-fertilization DNA repair in assuring the genomic integrity of the conceptus...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we identified active Notch signaling in key cellular events occurring at adult spermatogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the function of Notch signaling in spermatogenesis through the effects of in vivo Notch blockade. Adult CD 1 male mice were either submitted to a long term DAPT (?-secretase inhibitor) or vehicle treatment. Treatment duration was designed to attain one half the time (25 days) or the time (43 days) required to accomplish a complete cycle of spermatogenesis. Blockade of Notch signaling was depicted from decreased transcription of Notch effector genes. Notch signaling blockade disrupted the expression patterns of Notch components in the testis, induced male germ cell fate aberrations, and significantly increased germ cell apoptosis, mainly in the last stages of the <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle,</b> and epididymis spermatozoa morphological defects. These effects were more pronounced following the 43 day than the 25 day DAPT treatment schedule. These results indicate a relevant regulatory role of Notch signaling in mammalian spermatogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} Farancia abacura reinwardtii was studied using samples of snakes collected throughout Arkansas from 1985 to 1991;museum specimens were also examined. The right testis of 22 males was examined by light microscopy. Histological {{analysis of the}} testis indicated a postnuptial <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Testicular recrudescence begins in late May with sperm production peaking in late summer; sperm over winter in the ductus deferens. Ovarian follicles of 22 females were measured and counted; two follicular sizes were noted. In those undergoing primary vitellogenesis, a maximum size of 6. 5 mm was reached; those exhibiting secondary vitellogenesis ranged in size from 12 to 21 mm. Average clutch size in females with follicles over 10 mm was 14. 6 (n= 6). Oviductal eggs were observed in a single female in early September. Female F. abacura require at least 2. 5 years to become sexually mature. Follicular growth is slow over {{the first two years}} but increases dramatically during the spring of the third year...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{glucocorticoids}} (GCs) {{leads to}} numerous changes in various biological systems including the reproductive system. The {{aim of the}} present study was to find out whether dexamethasone (Dex), a widely used GC, would influence the apoptosis and expression of Bax, an important proapoptotic protein, in the mouse testicular germ cells. Experimental groups of 8 male NMRI mice received one of the following treatments daily for 7 days: 4, 7 and 10 mg/kg Dex. Control groups were treated with equivalent volumes of saline. Experimental and control animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. Immunohistochemical procedure was used to evaluation of Bax expression and the deoxyuridine nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was applied to assessment of the apoptotic germ cells. Bax expression was upregulated mainly at stages VII-VIII of <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> (p< 0. 05) in experimental groups. Apoptotic index was significantly increased in 7 and 10 mg/kg Dex treated mice (p< 0. 05). It appears that GCs such as Dex could induce apoptosis through the expression of proapoptotic proteins...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{kinetics}} of the spermatogenic epithelium {{in the adult}} boar, a method has been developed to prepare seminiferous tubules mounted as a whole, after which these tubules have been processed and studied as described previously only for rats, mice and hamsters. The tubules were fixed in Zenker for 24 hours and stained with periodic acid - Schiff - haematoxylin to identify the steps in spermatid development, or by Harris' hemalum to identify spermatogonia and spermatogonial divisions. Spermatid development in the boar is comparable with spermatid development in small laboratory rodents. The <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> was divided into 12 steps, each characterized by one step {{in the development of}} the acrosome or the shape of the nucleus of the spermatids. By studying whole mounts we could distinguish four classes of spermatogonia in the boar: undifferentiated A spermatogonia (A s, A pr, A al), differentiating A spermatogonia (A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4), intermediate and B spermatogonia. The boar demonstrates a striking similarity with small laboratory rodent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of Dex, a widely used GC, on apoptosis and expression of FasL protein in the mouse testicular germ cells. The effects of dexamethasone (Dex) on expression of Fas ligand (FasL), an important proapoptotic protein, in the mouse testicular germ cells were investigated. Six groups, each of 8 male NMRI mice were chosen for the experiment. Experimental groups received one of the following treatments daily for 7 days: 4, 7 and 10 mg kg - 1 Dex. Control groups were treated with equivalent volumes of saline. Experimental and control animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. Immunohistochemical procedure was used to evaluation of FasL expression and the deoxyuridine nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was applied to assessment of the apoptotic germ cells. FasL expression of testicular germ cells were significantly increased in 10 mg kg - 1 Dex treated mice (p< 0. 05), particularly at stages VII-VIII of <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Apoptotic indexes (AIs) of germ cells were significantly increased in 7 and 10 mg kg - 1 Dex treated mice...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the progression of germ cell populations through the rat <b>spermatogenic</b> <b>cycle</b> when spermatogenesis was suppressed by LH withdrawal through the use of a combination of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E) and then reinitiated by the administration of high doses of T. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received 3 -cm T and 0. 4 -cm E silastic implants for 6, 8, or 12 wk to suppress spermatogenesis followed by high-dose T (24 -cm implants) for up to 12 wk to reinitiate sper-matogenesis. The number of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and round spermatids per testis was established by stereo-logical techniques, and the elongated spermatid number was determined by the testicular content of nuclei resistant to homog-enization in Triton X- 100. Suppression for 6 - 12 wk resulted in moderate and significant (p < 0. 05) reductions in the numbers of type A and type B spermatogonia (to 44 - 59 % of control levels), preleptotene (68 - 72 % of control), and leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes (62...|$|R
