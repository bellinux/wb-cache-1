5|$|Sailing on {{her first}} {{eastbound}} journey on 1 July, George Washington commenced regular service between Bremen and New York with intermediate stops in Southampton and Cherbourg. North German Lloyd considered the Washington, as her crew affectionately <b>called</b> <b>her,</b> such a success that they soon ordered another liner of similar, but slightly larger, size.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg had Miranda Otto in {{mind for}} the part of Mary Ann, {{but at the time}} he <b>called</b> <b>her</b> she was {{pregnant}} and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto's pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her.|$|E
5|$|A {{month later}} in March 2011, it was {{announced}} that Francis had landed the newly created role of the mother of Daniel Goddard's character, Cane Ashby, on The Young and the Restless. The casting would reunite her with several of her former General Hospital alumni, including Tristan Rogers, Stephen Nichols, Judith Chapman and Kin Shriner. In a statement on how she received the newly created role, Francis revealed that Maria Arena Bell, the series' executive producer and head writer, <b>called</b> <b>her</b> (having seen her appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show) and offered her a role personally, to which Francis accepted.|$|E

5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes <b>called</b> <b>her</b> from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon <b>called</b> <b>her</b> again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
5|$|At school, Dawn {{is crying}} in the {{bathroom}} upset that a girl <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a freak. In art class she talks with a boy as they sketch, and the two share a moment of understanding about being troubled. Buffy arrives and pulls Dawn out of class into the hall. Through {{the windows of the}} art room, the class watches Buffy tell her that Joyce has had an accident. The rest of the conversation is muffled. Dawn collapses in the hall, sobbing.|$|E
5000|$|She is {{addressed}} {{in various ways}} by fellow officers. Captain Picard <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> [...] "Counselor", but when he is concerned about her, or in emergencies, he <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> Deanna. Picard also refers to her as [...] "Commander" [...] in the pilot episode ("Encounter at Farpoint"), {{which is consistent with}} her uniform's rank pips. Riker addresses her as [...] "Lieutenant" [...] a single time in the pilot episode; her service rank is not referred to again for several seasons. Doctor Crusher (one of her most noted female friends) usually <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> [...] "Troi". Data very rarely <b>calls</b> <b>her</b> by her first name, usually <b>calling</b> <b>her</b> [...] "Counselor Troi". Depending on the situation, Commander Riker will <b>call</b> <b>her</b> [...] "Deanna", or [...] "Imzadi", which means [...] "beloved" [...] in the Betazoid language.|$|R

5|$|Before the 2008 U.S. Championships, Meissner {{worked on}} her spins with Todd Eldredge. She placed 4th {{in the short}} program and 7th in the free after falling three times. She placed 7th overall and was {{selected}} for the U.S. team to the 2008 World Championships. After Nationals, Eldredge <b>called</b> <b>her</b> with more input on her spins and recommended his long-time coach Richard Callaghan. Meissner made the choice to switch coaches from long-time coach Pam Gregory to a temporary arrangement with Richard Callaghan in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. She trained with Callaghan for the six weeks between Nationals and the 2008 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was first}} {{cared for by}} her {{paternal}} grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of Piero de' Medici). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people <b>called</b> <b>her</b> duchessina ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E
5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{arrives at}} the crime scene and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has <b>called</b> <b>her</b> in out of his belief that the murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective that it was not devil worship, and that the killer {{probably}} was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal.|$|E
5000|$|Marika's {{mother and}} Gonzaemon's wife, {{who was once}} a space pirate herself known as [...] "Blaster Ririka".

After leaving the Bentenmaru, Ririka started working as an Air Traffic Controller. Sometime after Marika becomes {{the captain of the}} Bentenmaru, she joins the crew of the Parabellum, under captain Ironbeard.|$|R

5|$|Procter was the {{favourite}} poet of Queen Victoria. Her poetry {{went through}} numerous editions in the 19th century; Coventry Patmore <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{the most popular}} poet of the day, after Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and {{were published in the}} United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, {{although}} she is not {{playing the role of}} Martha Jones, which she would play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and <b>called</b> <b>her</b> back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín <b>called</b> <b>her</b> at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.|$|E

5|$|At Will and Grace's apartment, Will and Val play Pyramid against Will's friends Ellen (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Rob (Tom Gallop). Grace, {{who comes}} home, is shocked when her Pyramid record with Will—2 minutes and 14 seconds—is {{the same as}} Will and Val's. Before leaving, Grace is horrified that Will <b>called</b> <b>her</b> Val. While at her office, Grace learns that Will is sick. She goes home to attend to him and is {{surprised}} to see Val there. Grace tells her that since she is home that Val can go. Val, however, does not leave. This results in the two fighting. The fight, however, is broken by Will and tells them to work the situation out. Grace admits she felt jealous of Val as she believed Val had replaced her, due to her not being there for Will. Will, however, reassures Grace {{that no one can}} replace her as his best friend. As a result, Grace and Val make up.|$|E
5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually <b>called</b> <b>her</b> and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others <b>called</b> <b>her</b> the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E

5|$|Devotions to Mary {{are part}} of Catholic piety but are {{distinct}} from the worship of God. Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI <b>called</b> <b>her</b> Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she {{is considered to be}} the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe, are also popular Catholic devotions.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He <b>called</b> <b>her</b> twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they <b>called</b> <b>her</b> a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
