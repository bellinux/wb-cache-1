25|$|Nitrox {{is used to}} {{a lesser}} extent in surface-supplied diving, as these {{advantages}} are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas with}} {{coal-fired}} power stations, {{the use of}} CFLs saves on mercury emissions when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of incandescent bulbs. This {{is due to the}} reduced electrical power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned. In July 2008 the U.S. EPA published a data sheet stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for incandescent lighting of comparable lumen output. This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U.S. electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill. Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals, sulfur, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|If a building's indoor {{incandescent}} lamps {{are replaced by}} CFLs, the heat produced due to lighting is significantly reduced. In warm climates or in office or industrial buildings where air conditioning is often required, CFLs reduce the load on the cooling system when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of {{incandescent lamps}}, resulting in savings in electricity {{in addition to the}} energy efficiency savings of the lamps themselves. However, in cooler climates in which buildings require heating, the heating system needs to replace the reduced heat from lighting fixtures. In Winnipeg, Canada, it was estimated that CFLs would only generate 17% savings in energy compared to incandescent bulbs, as opposed to the 75% savings that could have been expected without space heating considerations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A new {{technique}} for solving the forward problem in electrical capacitance tomography sensor systems is introduced. The {{new technique}} {{is based on}} training a feed-forward neural network (NN) to predict capacitance data from permittivity distributions. <b>The</b> capacitance data <b>used</b> in training and testing the NN is obtained from preprocessed and filtered experimental measurements. The new technique has shown better results when <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commonly <b>used</b> linear forward projection (LFP) while maintaining fast prediction speed.
