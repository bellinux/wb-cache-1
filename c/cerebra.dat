Horrified, she runs after Scott to tell him about what she saw and what she remembered. Finding him in <b>Cerebra,</b> Scott tells her five new mutants have manifested their powers across the globe.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the events}} of the 2010 [...] "" [...] storyline, Frost acts as moral support to Scott as well as the prime means of {{communication}} between Scott and his Alpha Roster of X-Men. When Rogue becomes aware that she has an empathic connection to Hope, she contacts Frost for help, Frost finds that the bond is not telepathic in nature. Along with all the other telepaths among the X-Men, Frost is affected by the psionic backlash when Bastion shuts <b>Cerebra</b> down and informs Scott that Ariel has died in a missile strike. Frost takes part in the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge and watches with concern as Hope manifests the Phoenix Force energy signature.|$|E

5000|$|Originally Skullfire {{was capable}} of {{absorbing}} all forms of ambient energy particles into his body where he metabolized it to a usable form and then dispersed it in destructive energy blasts. He {{had no control over}} this power though and was only capable of using it during moments of great stress. <b>Cerebra's</b> powers allowed her to trigger his powers at will, but she had to make physical contact with him. After La Lunatica made him relive Reiko's death, Timothy could control his powers at will. While helping to free the mutant Book, it is revealed that he can also absorb mystical energies. Absorbing the energy of Halo City's powerplants gave Timothy a permanent source of power, but as a side-effect he was constantly glowing with a green light.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the ongoing}} Cable series, set in 2043, an older Cannonball arrives when Cable is badly hurt {{and unable to}} time travel. Solicitations of the comics refer to Cannonball as Cable's [...] "old war buddy."

As Cannonball dies, he asks Bishop why, to which Bishop responds, with visions of his future, mutants with M's on their faces and herded into concentration camps, [...] "To save you".|$|E
60|$|It was {{pleasant}} on the pier. Once you {{had passed the}} initial zareba of fruit stands, souvenir stands, ice-cream stands, and the lair of the enthusiast whose aim in life it was to sell you picture post-cards, and had won through to the long walk where the seats were, you were practically alone with Nature. At this {{hour of the day}} the place was deserted; George had it to himself. He strolled slowly along. The water glittered under the sun-rays, breaking into a flurry of white foam as it reached the beach. A cool breeze blew. The whole scenic arrangements were a great improvement on the stuffy city he had left. Not that George had come to Marvis Bay with the single aim of finding an antidote to metropolitan stuffiness. There was a more important reason. In three days Marvis Bay was to be the scene of the production of Fate's Footballs, a comedy in four acts by G. Barnert Callender. For George, though you would not have suspected it from his exterior, was one of those in whose <b>cerebra</b> the grey matter splashes restlessly about, producing strong curtains and crisp dialogue. The company was due at Marvis Bay on the following evening for the last spasm of rehearsals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dengue {{infection}} that {{is accompanied by}} unusual complications has been described in Brazil. We report {{on the presence of}} dengue virus in the central nervous system (CNS) of a patient who died in 1998 in Rio Grande do Norte, northeast Brazil. DEN- 2 viruses were isolated from the brain liver, and lymphnode tissue of a 67 -year-old man whose signs and symptoms were those of dengue infection and a secondary immune response. A postmortem revealed nose bleeds a liver that was brownish with yellow areas, and pulmonary and <b>cerebrae</b> congestion. Immuno-peroxidase staining showed a dengue antigen-specific positive reaction in the gray matter cells of the cerebrall cortex; a granular citoplasmatic reaction was seen in the neurons. Dengue infection should always be considered as a cause encephalitis in tropical countries, especially in those where the disease is endemic...|$|R
5000|$|The X-Men try to {{move forward}} with their lives and come out of hiding now that the threat of {{extinction}} is finally gone. Magneto's team of X-Men disbands and Psylocke kills him for taking part in Emma's deceptions that led to the war. Unbeknownst to her, Magneto was prepared for her to kill him so he had Exodus and Elixir find him and revive him so they could continue with their agenda. Storm's team of X-Men vacates Limbo and the mutant refugees return home now that the Terrigen is no longer a threat to them. No-Girl manages to track <b>Cerebra's</b> whereabouts and they're able to upload her consciousness from her damaged-beyond-repair body into a new mechanism. Feeling guilty for having led the X-Men to war instead of looking for a diplomatic solution, Storm steps down as leader of the X-Men and recruits Kitty Pryde to take over leadership duties and attempts to quit the X-Men. Kitty has Storm stay, however Storm {{spends a lot of time}} questioning her own morality. Kitty relocates the X-Men from Limbo to Central Park in hopes of helping the X-Men reestablish themselves as heroes instead of hiding in fear all the time even though the general populace fears mutants even more due to their war against the Inhumans.|$|R

50|$|In {{the video}} game X-Men Legends, Cerebro is {{identical}} to its appearance and usage in the X-Men film. Jean Grey and Emma Frost use the device at one point to attempt to return Professor X's mind to his body. In X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, it was destroyed {{along with the rest}} of the mansion, but Forge mentioned plans on building <b>Cerebra</b> to replace it. He described <b>Cerebra</b> as Cerebro's big sister.|$|E
50|$|In the White House, Valerie Cooper {{is talking}} with Quicksilver and the President of the United States about <b>Cerebra.</b> Pietro convinces the President that using <b>Cerebra</b> {{to guide the}} Nimrod Sentinels will make the public view him as a true hero in these hard times. The President excuses Valerie. She asks her assistant, Philip, to {{retrieve}} for her as much info as she can on both Pietro and Stryker, the latter being more important.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{following}} the example {{set by the}} X-Men films, Cerebro {{has been replaced by}} <b>Cerebra</b> (referred to as Cerebro's big sister), a machine {{the size of a small}} room in the basement of Xavier's School For Higher Learning. Though designed to resemble the movie version of Cerebro, <b>Cerebra</b> is much smaller than the films' version. It resembles a pod filled with a sparkling fog that condenses into representations of mental images.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{characters}} to use Cerebro on a frequent basis are Professor X, Jean Grey, Emma Frost and the Stepford Cuckoos. However, Rachel Summers and Psylocke have also used it. After {{the device was}} upgraded to <b>Cerebra,</b> Cassandra Nova used {{it in order to}} exchange minds with Xavier. The Stepford Cuckoos once utilized the machine to amplify their combined ability, with only one of them directly connected to the machine, but all of them experiencing its interaction due to their psychic rapport. The strain of mentally halting a riot during Open Day killed Sophie, the Stepford Cuckoo who was hooked up to <b>Cerebra.</b> Sophie was both inexperienced at using <b>Cerebra</b> and was high on the mutant-enhancing drug [...] "Kick"; however, it was revealed that it was not the strain of using the machine, nor the drug, that was responsible for her death, but Sophie's own sister Esme, who also used Kick to power her own abilities, seize control of the Cuckoos temporarily, and manipulate Sophie into her death. The now remaining three Cuckoos demonstrated that they were capable of using <b>Cerebra</b> with relative ease in Phoenix: Endsong.|$|E

While Storm's team of X-Men began returning refugees to their homes from X-Haven after Medusa destroyed the Terrigen cloud, <b>Cerebra</b> was found severely damaged in an abandoned barn surrounded by wild Sentinels. Once she was discovered and the X-Men saw that her current sentinel body was far beyond repair they uploaded her into a new body.|$|E

However, Jean Grey (who was becoming increasingly powerful due to {{a manifestation of the}} Phoenix entity) was able to split Xavier's consciousness into pieces and store a little part of him in every single living mutant mind. When Cassandra used <b>Cerebra</b> and focused on all the mutants, the pieces of Xavier's mind were brought back together; at the same time, Jean Grey telepathically attacked, successfully defeating Cassandra, and forcing her out of Xavier's body.|$|E

50|$|At {{some time}} during their stay at Halo City, Luna {{is one of}} the X-Men who visit the Oasis, a paradise created by Ryu Kobolt, a past friend of <b>Cerebra.</b> Kobolt had built the Oasis to bring {{together}} a chosen few downtrodded citizens, who would be put into cryogenic stasis for 250 years, during which time a barrage of chemical warheads would destroy all other life on the planet. Luna, along with Skullfire, <b>Cerebra</b> and Bloodhawk, stop this plan and destroy Kobolt and the Oasis. As this was a bookshelf edition standalone story it is not entirely clear where it fits into the storyline. However, it is inferred to be after they arrive in Halo city but before Shakti leave the team.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2099, Victor Von Doom {{approached}} <b>Cerebra</b> of the X-Men with a proposition. He {{told her that}} through a mathematical probability program he had deduced {{that there would be}} a mutant Messiah in the next generation, and he offered her the position of finding it for him. <b>Cerebra</b> agreed and left the X-Men in search of this figure who would lead all of mutantkind into a golden age.

She was aided, albeit unwillingly, by Morphine Somers, former Minister of Humanity and interim liaison to Halo City while Doom was still President.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, this {{development}} proceeds further, {{so that the}} cortex covers almost {{the whole of the}} cerebral hemispheres, especially in more developed species, such as the primates. The paleopallium is pushed to the ventral surface of the brain, where it becomes the olfactory lobes, while the archipallium becomes rolled over at the medial dorsal edge to form the hippocampus. In placental mammals, a corpus callosum also develops, further connecting the two hemispheres. The complex convolutions of the cerebral surface (see gyrus, gyrification) are also found only in higher mammals. Although some large mammals (such as elephants) have particularly large <b>cerebra,</b> dolphins are the only species (other than humans) to have <b>cerebra</b> accounting for as much as 2 percent of their body weight.|$|E
