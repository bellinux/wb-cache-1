5|$|<b>Cracks</b> are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating <b>cracks</b> with 120 degree joints, so three <b>cracks</b> {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight <b>cracks</b> form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new <b>cracks,</b> at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of <b>cracks</b> indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, <b>cracks</b> form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage <b>cracks</b> to form; in a thaw, water fills the <b>cracks,</b> expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the <b>cracks</b> into wedges. These <b>cracks</b> may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that fatigue <b>crack</b> growth is retarded after an overload, {{which has been}} explained either by plasticity-induced <b>crack</b> closure or near-tip residual stress. However, any interpretation of overload effect is insufficient if strain evolution in front of <b>crack</b> tip is not properly considered. The current understanding of overload-induced retardation lacks the clarification {{of the relationship between}} <b>crack</b> closure at <b>crack</b> wake and strain evolution at <b>crack</b> tip. In this work, a material with low work hardening coefficient was used to study the effect of overload on <b>crack</b> tip strain evolution and <b>crack</b> closure by in-situ SEM observation and digital image correlation technique. <b>Crack</b> opening displacement (COD) and <b>crack</b> tip strain were measured before and after the overload. It was observed that the evolution of <b>crack</b> tip strain follows the <b>crack</b> opening behaviour behind the <b>crack</b> tip, indicating a smaller influence of overload on micro-mechanical behaviour of fatigue <b>crack</b> growth. After the overload, plastic strain accumulation was responsible for <b>crack</b> growth. The strain at a certain distance to <b>crack</b> tip was mapped, and {{it was found that the}} <b>crack</b> tip plastic zone size correlated well with <b>crack</b> growth rate during post-overload fatigue <b>crack</b> propagation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work the fatigue <b>crack</b> growth in AISI 304 {{specimens}} is investigated experimentally. In 3 D {{finite element analysis}} the virtual <b>crack</b> closure technique is applied to calculate distributions and variations of the stress intensity factor along the surface <b>crack</b> front. It is confirmed that the stress intensity factor along the surface <b>crack</b> front varies non-uniformly with <b>crack</b> growth. <b>Crack</b> growth rate {{is proportional to the}} stress intensity factor distribution in the 3 D <b>cracked</b> specimen. The fatigue <b>crack</b> growth in surface <b>cracked</b> specimens can be described by the Forman model identified in conventional compact tension specimens. For <b>crack</b> growth in the free specimen surface the arc length seems more suitable to quantify <b>crack</b> progress. Geometry and loading configuration of the surface <b>cracked</b> specimen seem to not affect the fatigue <b>crack</b> growth substantially...|$|R

5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle.

30|$|After a <b>crack</b> initiates from a {{pre-existing}} flaw, {{the manner}} in which this <b>crack</b> propagates dictates whether the bridging fibers will be ruptured or pulled out. A lot of this depends on the opening magnitude of the <b>crack.</b> If <b>crack</b> opening is large, rupturing or pulling out of fibers on the <b>crack</b> flanks will be inevitable as the <b>crack</b> propagates. In an ideally brittle material, the <b>crack</b> opening is known to scale parabolically with distance behind the <b>crack</b> tips, which means that the <b>crack</b> opening will increase indefinitely with the propagating <b>crack</b> length. In normal fiber reinforced concrete, the parabolic shaped opening near the <b>crack</b> tip is modified by the closing pressure of bridging fibers, but otherwise follows the same trend in terms of <b>crack</b> opening scaling with the <b>crack</b> length. This implies that the bridged <b>crack</b> must undergo tension softening as fibers are ruptured or pulled out in such composites. This is the normal scenario for ordinary fiber reinforced concrete.|$|R
40|$|A major eason for {{the failure}} of <b>crack</b> growth rate versus applied stress {{intensity}} factor ange correlation under smoothly varying small scale yielding loadings at a given (negative) stress ratio is dissimilarities in the <b>crack</b> closure stress field. It is essential to assess the relevance and accuracy of <b>crack</b> closure measurement before coming to a conclusion that <b>crack</b> closure phenomenon is unable to explain the trends in growth rate in a given experiment [1]. While establishing the presence/absence of <b>crack</b> closure in a fatigue <b>crack</b> growth experiment is relatively straightforward, nogeneral method has yet evolved to measure the effect of <b>crack</b> closure on the <b>crack</b> driving force. Load-crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) records during fatigue cycling are routinely used for estimating <b>crack</b> closure. A fundamental issue is the relevance of the load level at which <b>crack</b> closure begins (or <b>crack</b> is completely open) in estimating the correct <b>crack</b> driving force.

5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in <b>cracks,</b> under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in the <b>cracks</b> in the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E

40|$|In certain {{ceramics}} one observes {{an increase}} in <b>crack</b> resistance with increasing <b>crack</b> length (R-curve behaviour).

The <b>crack</b> grawth in Al 2 o 3 -ceramics has been studied by Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) and Acoustic Emission (AE).

40|$|In {{environmentally}} assisted <b>cracking</b> processes, various parameters in mechanics, {{chemistry and}} metallurgy have synergistic effects on fracture and are cross-linked each other. Purely theoretical formulations were developed from slip/oxidation mechanism {{to deal with}} the synergy of these parameters for quantitative prediction of <b>crack</b> growth and lifetime of structures in high temperature water environments especially for energy conversion systems The formulations were derived based on an equation of metal oxidation for <b>cracking</b> and analysis of <b>crack</b> tip strain rate for a growing <b>crack</b> in an elastic/plastic work hardening material, in which <b>crack</b> tip strain redistribution due to <b>crack</b> advance was taken into consideration as a crucial part of <b>cracking</b> processes. The obtained formulations were solved numerically to get relations between <b>crack</b> growth rate da/dt and stress intensity factor K in various situation. The well-known phenomena of existence of threshold stress intensities and plateau growth rates in da/dt-K diagrams for many materials/environments combinations can be reproduced by the theoretical formulations from <b>crack</b> tip strain rate point, without any assumption on <b>crack</b> tip water chemistry for the threshold or on diffusion-controlled process for the plateau growth behavior.

5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by <b>cracks</b> in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows <b>cracks</b> to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing <b>cracks</b> as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.

In this study, {{we deal with}} not only a specimen including both a <b>crack</b> and grain boundaries but also a specimen including only a <b>crack.</b> For the specimen including both the <b>crack</b> and the grain boundaries, we can observe the emission of edge dislocations in order to relax stress concentration around the <b>crack</b> tip during loading. The dislocations emitted from the <b>crack</b> tip return to the <b>crack</b> tip because of interaction between dislocations during unloading. The <b>crack</b> propagates due to coalescence of the <b>crack</b> tip and the vacancies caused by the repeat of the dislocation emission and absorption at the <b>crack</b> tip. For the specimen including only the <b>crack,</b> the emission of edge dislocations from the <b>crack</b> tip is observed during the first loading.
