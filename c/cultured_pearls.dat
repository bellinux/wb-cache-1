25|$|The Great Depression harmed Kuwait's economy, {{starting}} in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As {{a result of the}} decline of European demand for goods from India and Africa, Kuwait's economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India. Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich from this smuggling. Kuwait's pearl industry also collapsed {{as a result of the}} worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearl industry.|$|E
500|$|After the Restoration, {{wives of}} kings– queens consort– {{traditionally}} wore the Crown of Mary of Modena, wife of JamesII, who first wore it at their coronation in 1685. Originally set with 561 hired diamonds and 129 pearls, {{it is now}} set with crystals and <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> for display in the Jewel House along with a matching diadem that consorts wore in procession to the abbey. The diadem once held 177 diamonds, 1 ruby, 1 sapphire, and 1 emerald. By the 19thcentury, the crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, so a new crown was made for Queen Adelaide, wife of WilliamIV, to wear in 1831 using gemstones from her own collection of jewellery.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> with a bead nucleus is X-rayed, {{it reveals}} a {{different}} structure {{to that of}} a natural pearl (see diagram). A beaded <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> shows a solid center with no concentric growth rings, whereas a natural pearl shows a series of concentric growth rings. A beadless <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> (whether of freshwater or saltwater origin) may show growth rings, but also a complex central cavity, witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac.|$|R

500|$|The Sovereign's Orb, {{a type of}} globus cruciger, is {{a hollow}} gold sphere about [...] in {{diameter}} and weighing [...] (more than twice as heavy as the original) that was made for CharlesII in 1661. A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator {{and there is a}} half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross symbolising the Christian world. Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 piece of glass. It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey. Queen MaryII's Orb is a smaller version made in 1689 for MaryII to hold at her joint coronation with WilliamIII; it was never used again at a coronation, and is set with imitation gems and <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls.</b> Both orbs were laid on top of Queen Victoria's coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using MaryII's orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria's position as Empress of India.|$|E
2500|$|Fancy hat (nacarpiaq in Yup'ik, {{literally}} [...] "real hat", nacarpig'ar in Cup'ig) a Yup'ik men's ceremonial headdress (angutet nacait [...] "men's hats") with {{strips of}} fur hanging on shoulders or a drummer's hood traditionally used for opening ceremonies and dances. The nacarpiaq {{is made from}} bird feet leather, glass and crystal beads, <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> and the skins and furs of wild animals like the mink, land otter, wolf and wolverine. The Yup’ik use animal hide because they believe animals sacrifice themselves {{in order for the}} wearer of the garment to survive. Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig men wore caps with many strips of fur hanging from the bottom edge over the neck and shoulders. The main body of these caps, worn at dances, was usually made of squirrel skins with a crown and borders of white reindeer fawn skin. Sometimes a wolverine tail was fastened on the back, and the long bottom fringe might be of reindeer skin strips. Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig wolf head caps, which consisted of an entire head skin including ears and nose, were also worn at ceremonies. Edward S. Curtis (1930) mentions animal-head caps worn during the Messenger Feast.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are the {{response}} of the shell to a tissue implant. A tiny piece of mantle tissue (called a graft) from a donor shell is transplanted into a recipient shell, causing a pearl sac to form into which the tissue precipitates calcium carbonate. There are a number of methods for producing cultured pearls: using freshwater or seawater shells, transplanting the graft into the mantle or into the gonad, and adding a spherical bead as a nucleus. Most saltwater <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are grown with beads. Tradenames of <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are Akoya, white or golden South sea, and black Tahitian. Most beadless <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are mantle-grown in freshwater shells in China, and are known as freshwater <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls.</b>|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{defeated}} by this sudden {{collapse of the}} industry, Nicholas drew inspiration from {{the success of the}} booming Japanese Akoya <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> industry, and sought to resurrect the South Sea pearl project commenced by Baron Iwasaki in 1916 - this time taking advantage of North Australia’s abundant and superior beds of South Sea pearl oysters - with the dream to cultivate the world’s largest and most valuable <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> - the <b>cultured</b> South Sea <b>pearl.</b>|$|R

After perfecting his techniques in the late 1970s, he went on to establish a further 4 farms. Latendresse also developed the technique for producing shaped pearls, which he called [...] "fancishapes", which today are used by the American Pearl Company to produce shapes including coin, bar, navette, marquise, teardrop, cabachon and triangle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> can be {{distinguished}} from natural pearls by X-ray examination. Nucleated <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are often 'preformed' as they tend to follow {{the shape of the}} implanted shell bead nucleus. After a bead is inserted into the oyster, it secretes a few layers of nacre around the bead; the resulting cultured pearl can then be harvested in as few as six months.|$|E
50|$|Mikimoto was {{extremely}} successful at promoting the new Japanese cultured pearl {{to the international}} jewellery industry. He challenged and won against the French natural pearl dealers in the French Courts who attempted to prevent the Japanese from describing their new <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> as “pearls”.
