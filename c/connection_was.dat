40|$|The Klein-Grifone {{approach}} to global Finsler geometry is adopted. A global existence and uniqueness theorem for Chern <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> formulated and proved. The torsion and curvature tensors of Chern <b>connection</b> <b>are</b> derived. Some properties and the Bianchi identities for this <b>connection</b> <b>are</b> investigated. A concise comparison between Berwald, Cartan and Chern <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> presented. Comment: LaTeX file, 14 page...|$|R

50|$|A {{special case}} of a metric <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> the Riemannian <b>connection,</b> of which the Levi-Civita <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> a {{particularly}} important special case. For both of these, the bundle E is the tangent bundle TM of a manifold. The Levi-Civita <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> the specific Riemannian <b>connection</b> that <b>is</b> torsion free.|$|R
5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, {{the course of the}} river was to be changed from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on the North–South <b>connection,</b> <b>was</b> only finished in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
40|$|Possible {{implementations}} of {{full strength}} moment <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> analyzed in this thesis. Firstly {{the concept of}} connections and their classifications are presented. The third chapter discusses {{the circumstances in which}} full strength <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> to be used an also their advantages and disadvantages are shown. Six different implementations of moment <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> presented with the load paths and plastic deformations discussed for each of them. Finally basic assumptions and requirements for full strength <b>connections</b> design <b>are</b> given and in the penultimate chapter a design procedure for bolted stiffened extended endplate moment <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> shown...|$|R
40|$|General {{properties}} of Abelian connection in Fedosov deformation quantization are investigated. Criteria {{of being a}} finite series for an Abelian <b>connection</b> <b>are</b> presented. Conditions for different symplectic connections to generate the same correction to the Abelian <b>connection</b> <b>are</b> given. A proof that in 2 –dimensional case the Abelian <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> an ifinite series is done. A class of symplectic connections on that space generating the same correction to the Abelian <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> shown...|$|R
30|$|Structural {{connectivity}} results (i.e., fiber density values) for {{the three}} groups are reported in Table  2, which shows the {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD) for the fiber density values of 16 <b>connections.</b> The values <b>were</b> computed from both hemispheres. Overall, nine <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between PD and NC. Of these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD compared with NC and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in NC compared with PD (p <  0.05, corrected). Four <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between SWEDD and NC. Among these <b>connections,</b> two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in NC and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). Nine connections showed significant differences between PD and SWEDD. Among these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex-thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and pallidum–thalamus connections. SWEDD patients showed significant differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and SN–thalamus connections. PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with SWEDD in associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen, pallidum–thalamus and putamen–thalamus connections. Associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen and pallidum–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> commonly identified as significant in NC-PD, SWEDD-NC and SWEDD-PD comparisons, as shown in italic font in Table  2.|$|R
5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so that there would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>Connection</b> <b>was</b> the {{nickname}} of a forward line that {{played for the}} Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1979. The line consisted of Hall of Famer Gilbert Perreault at centre and All-Stars Rick Martin and Rene Robert at left wing and right wing, respectively. All three players were French-Canadians from Quebec: Perreault from Victoriaville; Robert from Trois-Rivières; and Martin from Verdun, Quebec. The name referred both to {{the origins of the}} players and to the 1971 movie The French Connection, based upon the book of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} freeway <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> completed {{with the}} opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and westbound traffic from the cut in Bergen Hill just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. On September14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele Circle to connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S.Route1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route7 that leads to Interstate280.|$|E
50|$|When FTP is {{transferring}} {{over the}} data connection, the control <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> idle. If the transfer takes too long, the firewall or NAT may {{decide that the}} control <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> dead and stop tracking it, effectively breaking the connection and confusing the download. The single HTTP <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> only idle between requests and it is normal and expected for such <b>connections</b> to <b>be</b> dropped after a time-out.|$|R
40|$|Invariance {{properties}} for the covariant and contravariant connections on a Riemannian manifold {{with respect to}} an almost product structure are stated. Restricting to a distribution of the contravariant <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> also discussed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{synthetic}} {{treatment of}} nonlinear <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> given. Synthetic nonlinear <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> {{shown to be}} no other than Ehresmann connections on tangent bundles. Their relation to semisprays (= second-order differential equations) is discussed. A nice nonlinear generalization of torsion form already discussed {{in the context of}} synthetic linear <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> given, and its properties are developed...|$|R
5|$|The {{station was}} built {{as part of}} the Chrystie Street Connection between the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. The Chrystie Street <b>Connection</b> <b>was</b> first {{proposed}} in 1947 as {{the southern end of the}} Second Avenue Subway (SAS), which would feed into the two bridges, allowing Sixth Avenue Line trains to access the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line in Brooklyn. Construction started in 1962, and the first part of the connection, including this station, opened on November 26, 1967, when the link between the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge north tracks opened. The <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> fully opened on July 1, 1968 with the opening of the 57th Street and the opening of the connection between the Sixth Avenue Line and the Williamsburg Bridge. With the connection completed, the most significant service changes ever carried out in the subway's history were introduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{street level}} {{interchange}} between the GNP and CLR involving {{two sets of}} lifts was considered a weakness in the network. A below ground subway <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> considered in 1907. A proposal to enlarge the CLR's tunnels to create new platforms at Holborn station and to abandon British Museum station was included in a private bill submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, although the First World War prevented any works taking place.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is served}} by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The {{chocolate}} factory had its own rail system which {{was connected to the}} main line, but the <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> taken out of use 26–27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council.|$|E

5000|$|Transmission {{fluid cooler}} line <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> found on the {{right-hand}} side of the THM400. The lower <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> the cooler feed, and the upper <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> the return. The case is tapped for either self-sealing 1/4"NPT fittings, or 1/2"UNF fittings with a washer seal. 5/16" [...] or 3/8" [...] rigid coolant lines are generally connected via appropriate double-flared adapters.|$|R
5|$|Trondheim's first station, {{dating from}} 1864, was located at Kalvskinnet. In 1877 the current station {{was built to}} serve the Meråker Line to Sweden—since {{integrated}} into the Nordland Line. At {{the same time a}} <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> built between the two stations, and the central station took over as the main station serving Trondheim. In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started, finishing in 1921. The main station building consists of an older section in historicism brick, while the annex is in postmodernistic concrete and glass.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, a paved county road {{connected}} Vallejo and Benicia {{north of}} the Carquinez Strait, following the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, now I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, now SR 29), this <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> not added until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned designation) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former Route 7 to Fairfield. (A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 in 1937.) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street, making several turns in between. Two realignments {{were built in the}} 1940s, reducing the number of turns to one, at the corner of L and East Second Streets.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E

5000|$|Through {{the use of}} plugin modules, <b>connection</b> {{tracking}} can <b>be</b> given {{knowledge of}} application-layer protocols and thus understand that two or more distinct <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> [...] "related". For example, consider the FTP protocol. A control <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> established, but whenever data is transferred, a separate <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> established to transfer it. When the [...] module is loaded, the first packet of an FTP data <b>connection</b> will <b>be</b> classified as [...] "related" [...] instead of [...] "new", as it is logically part of an existing connection.|$|R
5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
5|$|Moves {{to connect}} the town to the UK's railway network gained pace in 1845, when the Act of Parliament for the {{construction}} of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) was passed. The first train left Altrincham early on 20 July 1849, carrying 65passengers. The MSJAR had two stations in the town: Altrincham, on Stockport Road, and Bowdon– though not actually in Bowdon– on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 by Altrincham & Bowdon railway station on Stamford New Road. The London and North Western Railway's station at Broadheath, on the town's northern edge, was opened in 1854, while a further <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> created on 12 May 1862 by the Cheshire Midland Railway (later the Cheshire Lines Committee), who opened their line from Altrincham to Knutsford.|$|E
5|$|On Alamagan, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} contact officials on other islands on September17. Despite the extreme {{intensity of the}} storm, all sixteen residents on the island, including the 4-day old infant were safe. During their attempted contact, the <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> poor and hard to understand. The following day, the United States Navy sent a ship and helicopter to the island to assess the situation. The Navy stated that the entire island of Alamagan was a total loss, with {{all but one of}} the structures, a facility for laboratory and research, completely destroyed and most of the islands' trees downed.|$|E
