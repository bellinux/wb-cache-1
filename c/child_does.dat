Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a <b>child</b> <b>does.</b> Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of linguistics, Plato's Problem {{is the problem of}} finding an {{explanation}} for how a child acquires language though the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not receive explicit instruction and the primary linguistic data a <b>child</b> <b>does</b> receive is limited. This PLD is the input, or stimuli, from the environment, necessary for the development of an individual's grammar – language – via input into UG. This limited environmental stimulus is referred to as poverty of the stimulus. Specifically, the stimuli to which children are exposed during the critical period do not encompass every lawful example of grammatical structure relevant to the particular language.|$|E

25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of beta thalassemia. Depending on your family history, if your parents or grandparents suffered from beta thalassemia there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not have beta thalassemia major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta thalassemia. Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta thalassemia occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status to accrue to the child, but the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the Dual Language System Hypothesis {{states that}} bilinguals have a {{separate}} system for the L1 and L2 which they learn right from the start, so both languages can be acquired simultaneously. Research on vocabulary development have generally provided strong support for this theory. Monolingual children in early language development learn one term for each concept, so does a bilingual child, just that the bilingual <b>child</b> <b>does</b> so for both L1 and L2, and hence they know two language terms of the same concept that has similar meaning, which {{is also known as}} translational equivalents. The awareness of synonyms do not appear till a much later age. For example, they know that both 'two' in English and 'dos' in Spanish refer to the numerical number '2'.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} supernatural {{entities}} {{are believed to}} exist; they make themselves known by means of inexplicable sounds or happenings. Among these phenomena are khmaoc (ghosts), pret and besach (particularly nasty demons, the spirits {{of people who have}} died violent, untimely, or unnatural deaths), arak (evil spirits, usually female), neak ta (tutelary spirits residing in inanimate objects), mneang phteah (guardians of the house), meba (ancestral spirits), and mrenh kongveal (elf-like guardians of animals). All spirits must be shown proper respect, and, {{with the exception of the}} mneang phteah and mrenh kongveal, they can cause trouble ranging from mischief to serious life-threatening illnesses. An important way for living people to show respect for the spirits of the dead is to provide food for the spirits. If this food is not provided, the spirit can cause trouble for the offending person. For example, if a <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not provide food for the spirit of its dead mother, that spirit can cause misfortunes to happen to the child.|$|E
25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

25|$|As {{the year}} 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu {{had given birth}} to her daughter, the baby died, with some {{evidence}} suggesting deliberate strangulation, including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder. Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first {{he wanted to make sure}} that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle Zhangsun Wuji, the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official Xu Jingzong, who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail. Scientifically credible forensic pathology information about the death of the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death.

25|$|F64.2 Gender {{identity}} {{disorder of}} childhood: A disorder, usually first manifest during early childhood (and always well before puberty), {{characterized by a}} persistent and intense distress about assigned sex, together {{with a desire to}} be (or insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex and repudiation of the individual's own sex. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient. Gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in F66.0.In the DSM of mental disorders used by psychologists in the United States, gender identity disorder is given two sets of criteria. Criterion A indicates that a child identifies {{as a member of the}} opposite sex. The child needs to demonstrate four of the five following symptoms: dressing as a member of the opposite sex, primarily befriending members of the opposite sex, demonstrating a desire to engage in play activities characteristic of the opposite sex, and actively stating that they wish to be the opposite sex. Criterion B, on the other hand, indicates that the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> not identify with the sex they were born. This could manifest itself as a dislike of styles of dress characteristic of the sex they were born, avoidance of association with members of their born sex, and distress towards the aspects of their physiology which indicate their born gender (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).|$|E
500|$|Fainites and fains (or vainites and vains) predominated in London and {{throughout}} southern England, {{apart from the}} scribs and screams of east Hampshire, and extended north as far as Olney in Buckinghamshire. Variations included fennits, fannies, fainsies, faylines, vainlights and vainyards. Notes and Queries reported in 1870 that fains was in common use by London schoolboys. Faints appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and fainits in 1891. According to philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, the term derives from the medieval term fein I, descended in turn from the Old French se feindre meaning [...] "to make excuses, hang back or back out of battle". He also proposes that this {{use of the term}} throws light on line 529 of the Clerk's Tale by Chaucer that [...] "lordes heestes mowe nat been yfeyned" [...] (the lords orders cannot be treated with a fain I; in other words, declined). Another translation of the Anglo-Norman word feindre is [...] "pretend, feign, turn a blind eye to", which is what the more powerful <b>child</b> <b>does</b> whilst granting respite.|$|E
