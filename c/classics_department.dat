5|$|The University of Wisconsin {{faculty and}} regents voted {{to end the}} Experimental College in May 1932. There was a {{farewell}} banquet for 250 guests in June 1932. Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its permanence, {{which he did not}} expect—he said he attempted the college as a test. Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and innovative, and Agard became the <b>Classics</b> <b>department</b> chair.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the award}} of his B.A. In Classics, Hayward {{commenced}} a Master's Degree {{program at the}} University of Canterbury in 1991. He first considered a thesis topic in Ancient History, but was informed by faculty in the <b>Classics</b> <b>Department</b> that {{he would need to}} study another year of Greek and Latin first. [...] After consultation with Dr. Vincent Orange, a Reader (equivalent to Associate Professor) in the History Department who became his thesis supervisor, Hayward settled on the topic of the historiography of Holocaust denial. Hayward later stated that this topic combined three of his great interests: World War II, the German language, and Jewish history. Besides his thesis, Hayward was also required for the M.A. degree to complete four honours papers, which he wrote during 1992. The four honours grades together constituted fully half of Hayward's master's program. All four papers underwent examination both internally and externally before their grades (an A-, two As, and an A+) were confirmed.|$|E
