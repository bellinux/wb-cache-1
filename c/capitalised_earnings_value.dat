40|$|Recent U. S. studies {{report that}} <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> {{relevance}} has declined over time. Some authors suggest non-recognition of intangible {{assets in the}} U. S. is {{a major reason for}} declining <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> relevance. However, the evidence is mixed on the effect of non-recognition of intangible assets. To examine this conjecture, this paper examines <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> relevance for Australian firms since Australian GAAP has not prohibited intangible asset recognition. Using a variety of established models and specifications, our results indicate that for the average firm, there is weak evidence of decline in <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> relevance. However, firms that capitalize intangibles have increasing <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> relevance.

40|$|This {{research}} analyses {{the effect}} of earnings’ information content, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality to the relevance of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. Retained earnings and net cash flow will be analysed as a control variables too. The analysis to the issue is crucial to be investigated due to earnings is considered as a principal information that becomes an attention for the users of accounting information in taking the investment decision, credit decision, etc. The differences from previous researches are: First, on the previous researches consider the information contents of earning, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality, whereas on the other researches the three variables were not analysed together. Second, the previous researches haven’t put retained earnings and net cash flow as control variables, because {{they are supposed to}} have effect to the causal relation. This research apply both the Ohlson (1995) valuation theory and efficient capital market theory (Beaver, 1998) as a valuation basis to investigating {{the effect of}} earnings’ information contents, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables to the relevance of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. This research hypothesizes that: First, <b>earnings</b> has <b>value</b> relevancy for the stock market. Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality have positive effect to increase the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. Third, retained earnings ad net cash flow have positive effect to increase the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. Fourth, earnings’ information contents, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables have positive effect to increase the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. By using sample from listed manufacture firms at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2006, the results indicate that <b>earnings</b> has <b>value</b> relevancy for the stock market generally. As especially, the results indicate that: First, significantly earnings has positive effect to the stock return (accept Ha 1). Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality increase the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market. Earnings’ information contents proxied by direction of earnings growth and timeliness of earnings announcement proxied by reporting velocity of earnings have positive effect to the stock return while earnings quality proxied by earnings management has negative effect to stock return (reject Ha 2). Third, by putting retained earnings and net cash flow as control variables, the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market is increased. Retained earnings has negative effect to stock return and net cash flow has positive effect to stock return (reject Ha 3). Forth, earnings’ information contents, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables increase the relevancy of <b>earnings</b> <b>value</b> for the stock market.

Since {{the paper is the}} first, as the researcher believes, that {{examines the}} influence of foreign ownership and trading volume on the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings,</b> book <b>value</b> and cash flows in an emerging exchange, it aims to provide evidence regarding the influence of these factors on the value relevance of accounting information. The paper found that the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value</b> is greater for companies having foreign ownership and larger trading volume. With the effect of these factors, closing share price shows more response than the other share price proxies. The findings suggest that market participants might be able to extract the firm value via these economic factors. The paper extends the valuation model by including cash flows together with <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value.</b> The findings demonstrate that there is a shift away from <b>earnings</b> towards book <b>value</b> as the basis of firm valuation. </p...|$|R

The study employed the efficient market hypothesis and {{analyzed the}} differences between estimated risk- adjusted rates of return and actual returns of common stock and was designed {{to answer the following}} questions: 1. Is there information content in the P/E ratio when earnings are based on historical cost earnings? 2.

Does the information content in the P/E ratio with historical cost earnings have more or less value than the information content in the P/E ratio with current <b>value</b> <b>earnings?</b> According to the findings of this study, there was significant information content in the P/E ratio when earnings were based on historical cost earnings; low P/E stocks consistently outperformed middle and high P/E stocks. This would indicate an inefficiency in the market and/or a misspecification of the market model employed in the study.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the changes in}} <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>values</b> over the last 50 years in the USA. Value relevance refers {{to the ability of}} accounting data to explain stock market values or returns. The common claim of the prior research is that the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> has decreased over time, while the value relevance of book values has increased. Researchers have presented several reasons for these changes. The reasons include, firstly, the balance sheet approach pursued by the FASB, and secondly the increasing intangible intensity. Other reasons include the increasing frequency of special items, the growing incidence of negative earnings, the decreasing average firm size as well as the decline in matching over time. The empirical part of the study was conducted using cross-sectional regressions of market <b>value</b> on <b>earnings</b> and book <b>values.</b> The sample consists of U.

The study investigates the value relevance of accounting information in Chinese listed companies {{for the period}} from 2000 to 2015 based on Ohlson’s (1995) valuation framework. The results demonstrate that <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value</b> are value relevant to the pricing process in all years. Furthermore, the combined <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value</b> {{does not have a}} temporal trend of either increase or decrease, but fluctuates substantially over time. The relative importance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value</b> in explaining stock price also fluctuates remarkably and exceeds each other alternately over time. Besides, negative earnings and large intangibles do not change the trend of fluctuations in the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value,</b> and the fluctuations are not correlated with the stock market sentiment. In addition, this paper develops Ohlson’s valuation framework by adding financial leverage and operating size as independent variables into the previous price model. Results suggest that financial leverage variable has little value relevance and thus should not be included in the extended valuation model. In contrast, operating size has much value relevance incremental to the original price model, particularly in the years when <b>value</b> relevance of <b>earnings</b> and book <b>value</b> becomes relatively lower.
