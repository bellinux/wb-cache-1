Then {{in order to get}} the fabric pore size distribution parameters under the best mechanical strength, the different fancy openwork should be applied in tensile and tear strength tests, which can contribute to analyze the relationship between mesh fabric structure and its mechanical property. In recent years, with the development of military reconnaissance techniques, the applications of thermal infrared detection equipment in various fields are increasingly being used, corresponding to it thermal infrared <b>camouflage</b> <b>equipment</b> has become the hot spot which the expert, the scholar studies.

5000|$|Swiss Militärblachen, {{a kind of}} Military Tarpaulins (tent cloth) in swissgerman called [...] "Blache", {{are printed}} in {{camouflage}} tarpaulins. They are used as rain protection, as elements in bivouac and for <b>camouflaging</b> military <b>equipment.</b> They are specially treated and therefore water repellent and highly resistant to abrasion and dirt. In Germany and Austria the military {{is also known as}} [...] "multi-purpose Plane". This, however, is different from the Swiss military Militärblachen, trapezoida.|$|R
5|$|<b>Camouflage</b> for <b>equipment</b> and {{positions}} was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and <b>equipment</b> <b>camouflage</b> differs from {{personal}} camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance. The goal is to disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, {{and to make the}} vehicle difficult to identify even if it is spotted.|$|R
25|$|In {{its second}} winter of {{operations}} {{but no longer}} under federal control, the 1st Aero Company continued training flights {{in conjunction with the}} small force of reserve candidates flying from Governors Island. On November 18, 1916, Bolling led a flight of seven Jennies from Mineola to New York harbor, where they were joined by a pair of JN-4s from the Governors Island school. One of Carroll's instructors in his own plane accompanied the group as the ten airplanes flew cross country together to Princeton, New Jersey, to attend the Yale-Princeton football game, the largest such formation of airplanes to date. In one of its final tactical maneuvers, led by Bolling on March 8, 1917, the 1st Aero Company participated in an exercise that involved 25 aircraft and half of the company's 44 personnel, simulating battlefield reconnaissance of <b>camouflaged</b> <b>equipment</b> and fortifications, and smoke from a simulated artillery battery. Despite their achievements, Bolling's report to the Chief of the Militia Bureau concluded that the development of national guard aviation was not practical at that time because of difficulties in attracting skilled mechanics into the guard to maintain the aircraft. As a result, and because of a curtailment of federal funding for the project, the War Department decided not to use national guard aero squadrons for service in the war. The 1st Aero Company was disbanded on May 23, 1917.|$|R

[...] His father Joseph was a professional photographer, and during the war {{was transferred to the}} North East to work on <b>camouflaging</b> military <b>equipment.</b> The family relocated to Whitley Bay, and it was here that David started to perform in local groups. His big break came in 1942 when he won the Melody Maker poll for best new jazz pianist.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAnalysis of data collected during a ground-based experiment of an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) hyperspectral imaging system illustrates {{the utility of}} this technology for military applications. The unique ability of an AOTF system to simultaneously acquire two orthogonally polarized images allows both spectral and polarimetric characterization of targets. The data images selected for analysis contain <b>camouflaged</b> military <b>equipment</b> deployed in a desert background. After geometric and atmospheric correction, spectral analysis is accomplished using two different methods. Comparing images created by the difference between polarizations for each band provides the basis for polarimetric analysis of the data. An algorithm developed to combine the information provided by spectral and polarimetric analysis shows how features within a scene can be distinguished from the background. Results show that AOTF hyperspectral technology has potential to enhance current military intelligence collection capabilities[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

[...] It had been anticipated that Buccaneers might need to perform in the target designation role, although early on, this had been thought to be [...] "unlikely". [...] Following a short-notice decision to deploy, the first batch of six aircraft were readied to deploy in under 72hours, including the adoption of desert <b>camouflage,</b> and additional <b>equipment,</b> and departed from Lossiemouth for the Middle Eastern theatre early on 26 January 1991. [...] In theatre, it became common for each attack formation to comprise four Tornados and two Buccaneers; each Buccaneer carried a single laser designator pod, and acted as backup to {{the other in the}} event of an equipment malfunction. [...] The first combat mission took place on 2 February, operating at a medium altitude of roughly , and successfully attacked the As Suwaira Road Bridge.|$|R

[...] The project took {{three months to}} complete and soon came under attack; becoming the first road to be built by the Royal Engineers under fire since British operations against rebel forces in the Dhofar Rebellion in southern Oman in the early 1970s. [...] Methods of attack included small arms, rocket propelled grenades and IEDs; and the construction team came under attack, on average, every few days. [...] The attacks meant that the engineers had to carry full arms, body armour and <b>camouflage</b> their surveying <b>equipment</b> when setting out and undertaking reconnaissance for the road. [...] In addition units from the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards Battle Group and the Afghan National Army were brought in to provide protection. [...] International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Afghan patrols in the area were also stepped up and unmanned drones engaged enemy combatants preparing to attack construction personnel.|$|R
