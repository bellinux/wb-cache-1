50|$|Helichrysum italicum is a {{flowering}} plant of the daisy family Asteraceae. It {{is sometimes called}} the <b>curry</b> <b>plant</b> because of the strong smell of its leaves. It grows on dry, rocky or sandy ground around the Mediterranean. The stems are woody at the base and can reach 60 cm or more in height. The clusters of yellow flowers are produced in summer, they retain their colour after picking and are used in dried flower arrangements.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oil of the Sardinian dwarf <b>curry</b> <b>plant</b> [Helichrysum italicum G. Don ssp. microphyllum (Willd) Nym] was studied. Genetic analysis suggested the presence of two chemotypes; morphological and chemical differences confirmed the presence of two chemotypes (A and B). The maximum yields were 0. 18 and 0. 04 % (v/w) for flowering tops and stems, respectively. The concentrations of nerol and its esters (acetate and propionate), limonene, and linalool reach their highest values during the flowering stage both in flowers and in stems. Besides the essential oil, type B showed an interesting antifungal activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of Sardinian dwarf <b>curry</b> <b>plant</b> (Helichrysum italicum G. Don ssp. microphyllum (Willd.) Nym.) essential oils was studied. Oil samples were isolated by water and steam distillation of flowering tops collected at different locations. The constituents of the oils {{were analyzed by}} GC/MS. Since both the {{chemical composition}} and physicochemical characteristics of the oils obtained during these trials were significantly different, they {{were divided into two}} groups. One oil was rich in nerol (10. 7 %), neryl acetate (28. 9 %), neryl propionate (11. 4 %) and γ-curcumene (11. 4 %), while the other was rich in linalool (14. 9 %) and γ-curcumene (18. 2 %) ...|$|E
5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and {{dovecote}} {{were retained}} at the public's request {{when the house}} was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and <b>curry</b> <b>plants.</b> To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|R

40|$|Huanglongbing or citrus {{greening}} disease (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) is vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). Currently, {{the most}} effective biological control agent for ACP is the parasitic wasp Tamarixia radiata. Feeding and egg-laying habits of ACP were studied by manipulating the plants they fed and laid eggs upon, Citrus volkameriana and Murraya koenigii or curry leaf. This research was conducted {{in order to better}} understand how to create the optimum environment which would lead to the greatest numbers of ACP nymphs as a steady food supply for the mass rearing of T. radiata. ACP adults were released into cages with only <b>curry</b> <b>plants,</b> where they were allowed to feed and mate. Some were then transferred to cages with nine curry, while others to cages with eight curry and a single citrus plant. Data collected showed that ACP adult females laid more eggs when introduced to a mix of citrus and <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, the numbers of nymphs on the monoculture of curry leaf were not as dense in comparison to the cages with curry and citrus combined...|$|R
40|$|Piroxicam (chemically 4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-N- 2 -pyridinyl- 2 H- 1, 2 -benzothiazine- 3 -carboxamide), a {{classical}} {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) is orally administered to arthritic patients. Inhibition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) synthesis and subsequent free hydroxyl radical generation in vivo exert gastro-toxic side effects on piroxicam treatment. Leaves of <b>curry</b> <b>plant</b> are rich in antioxidants with prolific free radical scavenging activities. This led us to investigate {{the efficiency of the}} use of curry leaves in ameliorating piroxicam induced gastric damage. Piroxicam was orally (30 mg per kg body weight) administered in male albino Wistar rats to generate gastric ulcers. These rats were orally fed with graded doses of aqueous extract of curry or Murraya koenigii leaves (Cu LE) prior to piroxicam administration. Oxidative stress biomarkers, activities of antioxidant and pro-oxidant enzymes, mucin content and nature, PGE 2 level, activities of mitochondrial enzymes and histomorphology of gastric tissues were studied. Piroxicam treatment altered all the above mentioned parameters whereas, curry leaf extract pre-treated animals were protected against piroxicam induced alterations. Hence, the protective action of the antioxidant rich Cu LE was investigated to propose a new combination therapy or dietary management to arthritic patients using piroxicam...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean area in Croatia is characterised by geomorphological, relief, climatic, pedological and vegetational synecological factors. Apart from {{autochthonous}} (climatozonal) species, a {{large number}} of alochthonous (foreign) species were introduced for the purpose of carrying out ameliorative operations in degraded sites and meeting the horticultural and landscape objectives. Unfortunately, unfamiliarity with biological-ecological properties of foreign species gave rise to a number of mistakes in terms of the choice of species. Horticulturally, the introduced species frequently failed to fulfil the desired aesthetic and composition effects. However, there were also situations in which the newly introduced species adapted exceptionally well to the new conditions and developed far beyond expectations, suppressing the autochthonous vegetation from its original areas. Wherever possible, autochthonous vegetation should be favoured over aloththonous vegetation because the former is already well adapted to the environmental and habitat conditions. The possibilities and quality of autochthonous species as elements of urban vegetation in the Mediterranean are still insufficiently utilised. The auto-chthonous floral elements have, apart from their decorative-aesthetic values (the qualities shared with the alochthonous species), a historical-traditional value. For this reason old plantations of autochthonous species in urban areas should be replaced with the same (or similar) autochthonous ones. The Croatian insular, coastal and hinterland areas are inhabited by {{a large number}} of mainly evergreen autochthonous species. The warmer eu-Mediterranean belt is characterised by the following interesting species: holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus L.), privet (Phillyrea latifolia L., Phillyrea media L.), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), common myrtle (Myrtus communis L.), Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus L.), cyprus (Cupressus sempervirens L.), juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus L.), Juniperus macrocarpa Sibth. Et Sm., creeping juniper (Juniperus horizontalis Moench.), <b>curry</b> <b>plant</b> (Helichrysum angustifolium D. C.), tree purslane (Atriplex halimus L.) and others. From an ecological-aesthetic standpoint, the colder, sub-Mediterranean area is characterised by the following species: pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.), manna ash (Fraxinus ornus L.), Montpelier maple (Acer monspessulanum L.), terebinth tree (Pistacia terebinthus L.), smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis Mill.), whitebeam (Sorbus aria L.), wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis Crantz), Bosnian maple (Acer obtusatum Kit.), common juniper (Juniperus communis), winter savory (Satureia montana L.) and others...|$|E

30|$|India is {{a country}} of diverse range of {{medicinal}} and aromatic plants which are the integral part of Indian traditional medicine. One of such <b>plants</b> is Indian <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plant</b> (Murraya koenigii Spreng.; Family: Rutaceae) and it is non-toxic and less expensive, therefore, easily available. Leaves of this traditionally used medicinal plant are extensively used in Indian cuisine, and as a whole, this plant is the rich sources of wide spectrum of multifunctional and biologically active natural products [23, 24].|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: In {{order to}} {{establish}} the important host range of D. citri, the performance of this psyllid on different rutacous host plants was assessed. Apparent regional differences in host preferences of D. citri as noted above {{and the need for}} empirical knowledge of its host preferences in Malaysia where it is lacking. Approach: Experiments on host plant preference between citrus, jasmine orange and curry leaf were conducted over a period of 14 days in the field cage in October 1998 at the agricultural research centre, Semonggok, 15 km from Kuching, Kuching Division, Sarawak in Malaysia. Results: A comparative life cycle study of the Asian Citrus Psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama on three different Rutaceous plant hosts namely citrus, jasmine orange and <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plants</b> was conducted inside the temperature controlled growth chamber maintain at 26 ± 1 °C temperature, 75 - 80 % relative humidity with artificial illumination intensity of 10, 000 lux equipped with a photoperiod of 14 : 10 h light: dark regime to permit normal growth. Conclusion: The screenhouse studies confirmed that D. citri can colonise and breed on citrus, jasmine orange and <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plant</b> and that jasmine orange is the preferred host. It is also confirmed that females prefer to oviposit on immature flush 3 - 10 mm in length. In growth chamber experiments the life cycle of the psyllid was 18. 5 days on jasmine orange, 19. 0 days on citrus and 23. 0 days on curry leaf...|$|R

50|$|In India, {{the tender}} {{leaves of the}} plant {{are used in the}} making of <b>curries,</b> but the <b>plant</b> is {{cultivated}} mainly as a fibre crop in drier regions. In order to cultivate the plant properly, moisture is required during the growing period, so rainfall should be at least 100 mm or more per month during the crop cycle, with a fairly uniform temperature.|$|R
30|$|Aqueous {{methanol}} (water:methanol 20 : 80) extract {{of leaves}} (AMEL) of Indian <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plant</b> {{was found to}} be highly efficient in the rapid and controlled synthesis of stable and fluorescent monometallic (Ag and Au) and also bimetallic (Ag/Au alloy) nanoparticles with wide spectrum of task specific morphologies under sonochemical condition. The nanoparticles synthesized by the present economically viable and environment-friendly protocol showed characteristic fluorescence activity. This was exploited in the fluorometric sensing of the dithiocarbamate pesticide, Mancozeb in aqueous medium. The surface chemistry of these nanoparticles was extensively studied to understand their sensing activity. The naturally occurring flurophoric/chromophoric compounds (carbazole alkaloids and polyhydroxy flavonoid) present in AMEL instilled (in situ) strong and characteristic fluorescent behavior to the synthesized nanoparticles which opened up their utility as the fluorometric sensors and detectors for pesticides in aqueous medium.|$|R
30|$|This gummy mass {{obtained}} from AMEL (GAMEL) obtained after evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure was stored at 4  °C and diluted appropriately in Milli-Q water by sonication before its use as green multifunctional agent (GMA) in {{the synthesis of}} three types of NPs: monometallic Ag, Au, and bimetallic Ag/Au NPs (discussed in later section). We have quantified the total flavonoid and polyphenol contents of AMEL using the standard colorimetric methods [25, 26] which {{are found to be}} 102.5  mg quercetin equivalent g− 1 and 214.3  mg gallic acid equivalent g− 1. Detailed procedures are discussed in the Electronic Supplementary Material (page S 3). In our previous work, we have observed that leaves of Indian <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plants</b> are rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, such as quercetin, and quercetin- 3 -glucoside [16]. Other reported flavonoids present in aqueous methanol extract of leaves of this plant are myricetin- 3 -galactoside, quercetin-O-pentohexoside, quercetin- 3 -diglucoside, quercetin- 3 -O-rutinoside, quercetin- 3 -acetylhexoside, kaempferol-O-glucoside, and kaempferol-aglucoside [24].|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, we {{have used}} an {{indigenous}} source (as leaves of Indian <b>curry</b> leaf <b>plant,</b> a well-known Indian medicinal plant along with its chemical components) as GMA to develop energy-efficient, economically viable and environment-friendly synthetic protocols for stable, crystalline, and fluorescent monometallic (Ag and Au) and also bimetallic (Ag/Au alloy) nanoparticles with wide spectrum of controlled and target specific morphologies under sonochemical condition. These NPs showed their extreme efficacy towards the fluorometric sensing of a dithiocarbamate pesticide, Mancozeb in aqueous medium. AMEL (aqueous methanol extract of leaves) itself along with its active chemical constituents having characteristic fluorescent activity controlled the surface chemistry of the synthesized NPs and also imposed specific fluorescent behavior (in situ) to them. This opened up their possible utility as the eco-friendly and easily synthesizable fluorometric sensors and detectors for the hazardous dithiocarbamate pesticides/fungicide, such as Mancozeb (extensively used in agriculture industries) in aqueous medium. Moreover, the use of non-toxic (leaves are edible) GMA may render these NPs biocompatibility, and thus, these NPs can be explored {{in the future for}} the in vivo detection of toxic fluorescent compounds.|$|R
50|$|Curry {{was plagued}} {{by a series of}} unfortunate events leading to its {{ultimate}} demise. A fire in 1926 destroyed the engine house and power plant. The engine house was again destroyed by fire in 1933. The construction of a larger hotel in Denali National Park in 1939 drew visitors away from Curry, but the Railroad continued investing in the town, housing employees there in 1945. Disaster came again {{in the way of a}} boiler explosion in 1946, completely destroying the power <b>plant.</b> <b>Curry</b> rebuilt, and added a ski area, which would be popular for years to come. The final disaster, however, was a fire in April 1957, in which fire burned down the town's lifeblood, the 75-room hotel. Three people were killed in the blaze. The hotel was never rebuilt, and Curry faded away.|$|R
30|$|We {{have also}} shown the {{efficacy}} of quercetin, abundantly found polyhydroxy flavonoid in leaves of Indian <b>Curry</b> leaf <b>plant</b> towards the synthesis of Au, Ag, and Ag/Au NPs. For Ag NP synthesis by quercetin, 100  μL of 0.05 (M) aqueous solution of AgNO 3 {{was added to the}} 10  mL aqueous solution of quercetin (0.025  mg mL− 1). Aqueous NaOH solution was added to the reaction mixture to adjust the pH at 9 (optimum pH). The final Ag+ ion concentration became 0.5  ×  10 − 3 (M). This mixture was sonicated at 40  kHz at room temperature, and golden yellow coloration was developed within 5  min indicating the onset of formation of Ag NP (Table  2). Similar method using 100  μL of 0.05 (M) aqueous HAuCl 4 solution was followed for the synthesis of monometallic Au NPs. For bimetallic Ag/Au NP (1 : 1) synthesis, 50  μL of 0.05 (M) aqueous AgNO 3 and 50 μL of 0.05 (M) aqueous HAuCl 4 solution were added simultaneously (Table  2) and sonicated as stated earlier. In these two cases, we kept all other reaction parameters unchanged. Color was developed within 5  min which indicated the formation of NPs. In all the cases, the progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture with time.|$|R
