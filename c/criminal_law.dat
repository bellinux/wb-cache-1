5|$|On 3 February 2013, the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was {{promulgated by}} President Pranab Mukherjee. It {{provides}} for amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences. The ordinance {{provides for the}} death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the criminalisation of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{review the}} extant {{literature}} on HIV <b>criminal</b> <b>laws,</b> {{and to determine}} {{the impact of these}} laws on public health practice. Methods The available research on this topic was obtained and reviewed. Results The extant literature addressed three main topics: people’s awareness of HIV criminal laws; people’s perceptions of HIV criminal laws; and the potential effects of HIV <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> on people’s sexual, HIV-status disclosure and healthcare-seeking practices. Within these categories, the literature demonstrated a high level of awareness of HIV <b>criminal</b> <b>laws,</b> but a poor comprehension of these laws. For perceptions, on the whole, the quantitative research identified support for, while the qualitative literature indicated opposition to, these laws. Lastly, the behavioural effects of HIV <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> appear to be complex and non-linear. Conclusions A review of the extant literature from a public health perspective leads to the conclusion that HIV <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> undermine public health...|$|R

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
