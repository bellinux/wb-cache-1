25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a <b>coppice</b> <b>stool</b> instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E

40|$|Ancient coppice {{woodlands}} are coppice-originated forest {{stands with}} a long-term continual development, {{and with the}} preserved typical natural and historic elements of old sprout forests. Prominent natural elements in the ancient coppice woodlands are namely old <b>coppice</b> <b>stools.</b> There is, in scientific literature, lack of information about features of ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools.</b> Therefore, our contribution aims to describe shape and form of ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools,</b> including the most important microhabitat of coppice woodlands – dendrothelms. Based on field survey of 20 localities of important coppice woodlands we recorded 135 ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> of 13 tree species {{and a total of}} 80 dendrothelms in 9 tree species. Basic features of ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> and dendrothlems were measured and evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Old hazel <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> {{exist in}} some of the shrubs borders.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> in the wood; {{coppicing}} was practiced {{from at least}} the 13th Century until the early 20th Century, with a revival from 1964. Dead wood is left as it is an excellent habitat for liverworts and woodpeckers.|$|R
50|$|The {{tree canopy}} {{includes}} beech (some huge old <b>coppice</b> <b>stools),</b> ash, sessile oak, silver birch, common whitebeam and small-leaved lime. Yew {{is the dominant}} shrub, particularly beneath beech trees. There is hazel coppice, field maple, hawthorn, holly and goat willow. There is a rare hybrid present between rowan and whitebeam.|$|R
50|$|This is ancient {{woodland}} and has {{a canopy}} comprising mainly ash (including <b>coppiced</b> <b>stools),</b> pedunculate oak and field maple, and some crab apple and holly. There has been some interplanting with beech, Scots pine, spruce and larch. The understorey is dominated by hazel. This also contains goat willow and dogwood.|$|R
50|$|These ancient woods have {{woodland}} types {{typical of}} spring-fed valleys and light sandy soils. Holbrook Park has <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> over 3 metres in diameter, {{among the largest}} in Britain. Sweet chestnut, which {{was introduced in the}} Middle Ages, is found widely, and other trees include the rare wild service tree.|$|R
2500|$|Pollarding was {{preferred}} over coppicing in wood-pastures {{and other}} grazed areas, because animals would browse the regrowth from <b>coppice</b> <b>stools.</b> Historically, {{the right to}} pollard or [...] "lop" [...] was often granted to local people for fuel on common land or in royal forests; {{this was part of}} the right of Estover.|$|R
2500|$|Coppicing {{maintains}} {{trees at}} a juvenile stage, and a regularly coppiced tree will never die of old age—some <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> may therefore reach immense ages. The {{age of a}} stool may be estimated from its diameter, and some are so large—perhaps as much as [...] across—that they {{are thought to have}} been continually coppiced for centuries.|$|R
5|$|Sycamores {{make new}} growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can {{therefore}} be coppiced to produce poles {{and other types of}} small timber. Its <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> grow comparatively rapidly, reaching up to 10feet in diameter in 450 years. It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found.|$|R
50|$|Ancient woods were well-defined, often being {{surrounded}} by a bank and ditch, {{so that they could}} be easily recognised. The bank may also support a living fence of hawthorn or blackthorn to prevent livestock or deer entering. They are attracted by young shoots on <b>coppice</b> <b>stools,</b> so must be excluded if the coppice is to regenerate. Such indicators can still be seen in many ancient woodlands, and large forest are often sub-divided into woods and coppices with banks and ditches as before. The hedges at the edges are often overgrown and may have spread laterally owing to the neglect of many years.|$|R
50|$|It {{is notable}} for bluebells in mid-Spring {{in many parts}} of the forest {{together}} with other ancient woodland indicator species such as Yellow rattle and the Lesser celandine. There are stands of beech and oak interspersed with hazel coppice as well as conifer plantations within the forest. The conifer plantations are slowly being removed as a part of a national policy to restore ancient woodland. They will be replaced with native hardwoods such as oak and beech. As with most ancient woods, coppicing is no longer practised, and many former <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> can be seen in the woods.|$|R
25|$|The {{planting}} programme of the 1940s was principally of oak, {{but also}} larch, Scots pine and Corsican pine. Unlike in a coppice-with-standards rotation, Bedford Purlieus woodland {{is much more}} even in age. However, when an ancient woodland is cleared and planted the result {{is not just a}} monoculture of the newly planted trees. The canopy is now a mix of the planted trees, self-sown trees and shrubs, and regrowth of <b>coppice</b> <b>stools,</b> some probably of more recent origin, other stools clearly dating back to antiquity. The species diversity that characterises the woods was thus retained, and oak, lime, large-leaved elm, hazel, ash, field maple, English elm, sycamore, chestnut and birch are all to be found in substantial quantities.|$|R
50|$|Burgate Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI. Its 75 acre are {{particularly}} {{good example of}} the type of oak-hornbeam woodland characteristic of this part of north Suffolk. It is ancient, with a coppice-with-standards structure and continues to support entirely semi-natural stands. Many giant <b>coppiced</b> <b>stools</b> are present which indicate its great antiquity. The ground flora is diverse and includes several species that are indicators of ancient woodland, including one rarity. The ground flora contains much Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis) with frequent Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Enchanter's Nightshade (Circaea lutetiana), Sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and Water Avens (Geum rivale). A number of uncommon species are present including Herb Paris (Paris quadrifolia), Yellow Archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), Hairy Woodrush (Luzula pilosa) and the rare Lungwort (Pulmonaria officinalis).|$|R
50|$|Most ancient {{woodland}} in the UK {{has been}} managed {{in some way}} by humans for hundreds (in some cases probably thousands) of years. Two traditional techniques are coppicing (harvesting wood by cutting trees back to ground level) and pollarding (harvesting wood at about human head height to prevent new shoots being eaten by grazing species such as deer). Both techniques encourage new growth while allowing the sustainable production of timber and other woodland produce. During the 20th century, use of such traditional management techniques has declined while {{there has been an}} increase in large-scale mechanised forestry. Thus coppicing is now rarely practised, and overgrown <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> are a common sight in many ancient woods, with their many trunks of similar size. These changes in management methods have resulted in changes to ancient woodland habitats, and a loss of ancient woodland to forestry.|$|R
50|$|Several notable {{but very}} small and {{vulnerable}} areas of ancient woodland can still be seen. Known as Ashen Shaw, Rainbow Shaw and Shrove Hill, each adheres to the parish boundary, a noticeable feature of many ancient woodlands in the district. The former {{takes its name from}} its outline, being set on the northern edge of West Tilbury in a curve around the stony hill summit. In spring its canopy of wild cherries in blossom is a continuing delight. Its ancient <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> include Field Maple, Ash, Crab Apple, Hornbeam and Oak (Q.robur), while the woodland floor is prolific with violets, native bluebell and wild arum. Pignut is also present. Shrove Hill, upon the west boundary with Chadwell, is so called from ‘shrough’, an old word for rough woodland. Another tiny parcel of wood is Coopers Shaw - the latter an Elm thicket of more recent origin. The local word ‘shaw’ derives from a medieval term for woodland which was usually managed as coppice.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum) as a small, water-conserving landscape tree {{for the western}} United States {{is limited by the}} selection of superior accessions from a morphologically diverse gene pool and the ability to propagate wild plants in a nursery environment. Superior accessions were selected based primarily on red fall color. Aerial digital images taken during peak fall color in 2007 and 2008 were synchronized with flight global positioning system (GPS) track files using digital image editor software and visually compared with corresponding satellite images to determine the exact latitude and longitude of selected trees on the ground. Trees were physically located using GPS technology then visually evaluated for initial selection. Criteria included fall color, habitat, relative disease and insect resistance, bud quality, and plant form. From 56 observed trees of interest, six were selected for propagation. Through time-course experiments using multistemmed, bigtooth maple seedling rootstocks in a <b>coppiced</b> <b>stoolbed,</b> the optimum time for chip budding scions of wild accessions in northern Utah was determined to be July through mid-August. Further evaluation of accessions for use in the landscape industry is required...|$|R
50|$|Ancient woods were {{valuable}} {{properties for}} their owners, {{as a source}} of wood fuel, timber (estovers and loppage) and forage for pigs (pannage). In southern England, hazel was particularly important for coppicing, the branches being used for wattle and daub in buildings, for example. Such old coppice stumps are easily recognised for their current overgrown state, now that the practice has largely disappeared. Large boles emerge from a common stump in such overgrown <b>coppice</b> <b>stools.</b> Originally, the term of 'forest' did not refer solely to woodland; it also included parkland, open heathland, upland fells, and any other territory, between or outside of manorial freehold, and was the exclusive hunting preserve of the monarch, or granted to nobility. The ancient woods that were within forests, were frequently Royal Parks, enjoying special protection against poachers and other interlopers, and subject to tolls and fines where trackways passed through them or when firewood was permitted to be collected or other licence granted. The forest law was very strictly enforced, by a hierarchy of foresters, parkers and woodwards. In English land law, it was illegal to assart any part of a royal forest. This was the greatest trespass that could be committed in a forest, being more than a waste: for whereas waste of the forest involves felling trees, they can grow again; assarting involves completely rooting up trees within the woodland of the afforested area.|$|R
40|$|Numerous wild bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum Nutt.) {{specimens}} {{in northern}} Utah have potential {{for use in}} landscapes, but improvements in selection and propagation {{need to be developed}} before these specimens can be introduced to the green industry. Criteria-based evaluations centered on aesthetics, function, and fall color were performed to objectively select superior bigtooth maple specimens. Out of 56 trees initially selected for red fall color, six were selected for propagation based on all three criteria. Five of the six selected trees yielded viable bud take via chip budding. Optimum time for chip budding propagation was determined by four experiments. Coppiced seedling rootstocks were used with the 2 ̆ 2 return budding 2 ̆ 2 of excised buds as scions to parent stock (2006) and grafting buds from wild trees as scions (2007 and 2009). A fourth experiment examined chip budding of wild scions on 2 -year-old, containerized, seedling rootstocks. The general time period identified as the optimum time for budding bigtooth maple was July through mid-August. Propagation by cuttings was also explored as an alternative production method among bigtooth maple selections. Softwood cuttings were taken from six selections of wild bigtooth maples grafted on seedling rootstocks growing in a <b>coppiced</b> <b>stool</b> bed environment. Open-ended, black, velour, drawstring bags were placed over the end of pruned shoots at bud swell to initiate etiolation of the cuttings. The bags were left in place during shoot elongation to insure etiolation of the shoot base. Cuttings were harvested after 3 to 4 weeks, wounded, dipped in auxin, and placed on heating mats under an intermittent mist system. Rooting was evaluated on the cuttings after four weeks. Results showed the effects of etiolation to significantly increase the percentage of rooted cuttings and the number of roots per cutting...|$|R
40|$|In coppice-with-standards, once {{a common}} type of {{management}} in Central European lowland forests, selected trees (standards) were left to grow mature among the regularly harvested <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> to obtain construction wood. After the underwood was harvested, the forest canopy opened rapidly, giving standard trees an opportunity to benefit from reduced competition. Although this silvicultural system virtually disappeared after WWII, historical management cycles can still be traced in the tree-rings of remaining standards. Our research aims at answering the question whether tree-ring series of standard trees {{can be used to}} reconstruct past management practices. The study was carried out on 117 oak standard trees from five sites situated in formerly coppiced calcareous oak-hornbeam and acidophilous oak forests in the Bohemian Karst Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic. The evaluation was based on the analysis of growth releases representing the response of the standards to coppicing events, and comparison to the archival records of coppice events. Our results showed that coppicing events can be successfully detected by tree-ring analysis, although there are some limitations. Altogether 241 releases were identified (49 % of major releases). Large number of releases could be related to historical records, with the major ones giving better results. The overall probability of correct detection (positive predictive power) was 58 %, ranging from 50 to 67 %, probability for major releases was 78 %, ranging from 63 to 100 % for different sites. The ability of individual trees to mirror past coppice events was significantly affected by competition from neighboring trees (their number and the sum of distance-weighted basal areas). A dendro-ecological approach to the study of forest management history can serve as an input for current attempts of coppice reintroduction and for conservation purposes...|$|R
5000|$|Coppicing is a {{traditional}} method of woodland management which {{takes advantage of the}} fact that many trees make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down. In a [...] wood, which is called a copse, young tree stems are repeatedly cut down to near ground level. In subsequent growth years, many new shoots will emerge, and, after a number of years the <b>coppiced</b> tree, or <b>stool,</b> is ready to be harvested, and the cycle begins again. Pollarding is a similar process carried out at a higher level on the tree.|$|R
50|$|Westridge Wood (unit 1) and Conygre Wood (unit 3) are the {{two main}} areas of ancient {{woodland}}, which are mostly beech. Ash and pedunculate oak are widespread, and other trees include field maple and locally small-leaved lime. Historically the woods were managed as <b>coppice</b> and old <b>stools</b> remain present. The woodland is now high forest with an understorey, and a rich flora which is characteristic of beech woods. Ground flora includes nettle-leaved bellflower, goldenrod, spurge laurel and tutsan. stinking hellebore and wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) may also be found. The site {{is one of only}} two United Kingdom sites for the nationally rare limestone woundwort which is found and monitored in Old London Road reserve (unit 2). It is also now reported present in Westridge Wood and Conygre Wood.|$|R
40|$|Miombo is dry {{deciduous}} woodland {{dominated by}} leguminous tree species, covering a significant area of Africa {{south of the}} equator, including large parts of Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This woodland type reaches its driest, most species-poor limit in Zimbabwe. Brachystegia spiciformis Julbernardia globiflora are the two main dominants of the drier form of miombo. Miombo woodland represents a rich and diverse resource base for small-scale farmers throughout the region, the importance {{of which has been}} ignored in the past by managers and policy-makers. The development of sustainable management strategies for this resource has therefore been hampered by a lack of knowledge. For this reason, the overall objective of this research was to define the basis for sustainable management of these woodlands, firstly by developing techniques for measuring biomass and monitoring woody growth; secondly, by examining the effect of site conditions on productivity; and thirdly, by investigating biological and social aspects of the management of these woodlands. This research has found that good estimations of standing wood biomass of these two species can be derived from diameter and stem length measurements, thus providing woodland managers with a means of assessing the standing stock. The finding that B. spiciformis forms annual rings can be used in ageing the trees, projecting future yields more accurately, as well as monitoring the effects of management on growth. In the investigation of the effects of climatic and edaphic conditions on tree growth, soil depth was found to have the greatest influence, followed by mean annual rainfall and clay content. Dominant height was found to be the best morphological variable to estimate site potential, in the absence of detailed studies of soil characteristics. The experimental findings from silvicultural trials have important implications for management. Regrowth from <b>coppice</b> <b>stools</b> was vigorous even in dry years, and greatest from medium to large stools. Productivity in general was extremely variable, both of coppiced and uncoppiced trees, due to site effects. The most productive sites are also potentially the best for agriculture and are therefore unlikely to be left exclusively for woodland management. The silvicultural techniques of coppice reduction and water harvesting were not found to enhance coppice regrowth. Browsing by livestock was found to severely reduce coppice regrowth, particularly of J. globiflora</em, at least in the initial stages, so that protection from browsing in the first year or two after felling is recommended if maximum regrowth is desired. An assessment of the use and management of the indigenous wood resources in a resettlement area in central Zimbabwe suggests that the present harvesting of wood products is unsustainable, due largely to the lack of any woodland management policy for these areas. Local villagers feel powerless to exclude outsiders from their resource, and thus the incentives to manage it sustainably are low. Major changes in government legislation are necessary to alter this situation. In the interim, resource-sharing schemes are suggested as a method of improving the sustainability of use. Some of the results reported here have a direct application in miombo management; these are summarised {{at the end of this}} work in the form of guidelines for management. Others identify the need for further work to expand these initial findings. One of the outcomes of this research has been the reminder of how little is known of the appropriate management of this important vegetation type. </p...|$|R
