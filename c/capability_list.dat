40|$|In October 2007, {{a unified}} Commission on Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will begin {{operation}} in Britain. The Commission will have responsibility for monitoring and promoting {{human rights and}} equality {{on the grounds of}} gender, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, transgender status, and religion/belief. As a precursor to the Commission, the Prime Minister established the Equalities Review, an independent, high-level, investigation of the causes of persistent inequality and disadvantage in British society. Its final report, Fairness and Freedom, in February 2007 adopted the capability approach as its measurement framework and recommended that all public bodies use the framework to "agree priorities, set targets, and evaluate progress towards equality" (p. 110). In particular, the Review recommended that the framework be used by the CEHR to inform its regular 'state of the nation' report. This paper, and its companion, Definition of equality and framework for measurement: Final Recommendations of the Equalities Review Steering Group on Measurement (CASEpaper 120) were prepared as background papers to assist {{in the development of the}} measurement framework for the Equalities Review. The companion paper discusses the key challenges involved in translating capability theory into a practical measurement tool in the context of measuring inequality in Britain in the 21 st century. This includes the definition of equality, a procedure for generating and revising a list of central and valuable capabilities, a measurement framework for monitoring trends in inequality, exploring the causes of inequality, and identifying possible policy interventions, and, finally, the types of information and analysis which are required. The current paper focuses in more detail on the need for a list of central and valuable capabilities in terms of which inequality in Britain can be conceptualised and appraised (a 'capability list'). The paper sets out a methodological framework for developing a <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> involving (1) derivation of a core <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> from the international human rights framework; (2) supplementation and refinement of the core list through democratic deliberation and debate. As part of the process of developing a <b>capability</b> <b>list,</b> the Equalities Review commissioned Ipsos-MORI to undertake a deliberative consultation on the development of a <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> with the general public and individuals and groups at risk of discrimination and disadvantage. The paper discusses the results of the deliberative consultation and recommends a <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> based on ten domains of central and valuable capabilities.

40|$|Often, {{enforcing}} security incurs overhead, and as {{a result}} may degrade the performance of a system. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem in the context of enforcing access control policies in a mobile data object environment. There are a number of applications that call for fine-grained specification of security policies in guaranteeing the confidentiality of data or privacy of individuals in a mobile environment. In particular, the security policies state the rules for providing controlled access to the mobile user profiles, to their current location and movement trajectories, to mobile resources, and stationary resources based on the mobile user location. Either a subject or an object in an authorization specification can be a moving object. The access requests in such an environment can typically be based on past, present and future status of the moving objects. To effectively serve such access requests, one must efficiently organize the mobile objects as well as authorizations. Although implementation of authorizations as access control list, <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> or access matrix is suitable for traditional data, it is not suitable to search mobil...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{a fundamental}} {{problem that has}} to be faced if the general capability approach is to be developed {{in the direction of a}} theory of justice: the selection and justification of a <b>list</b> of <b>capabilities.</b> The democratic solution to this problem (defended by Amartya Sen) is to leave the selection of capabilities to a process of democratic deliberation, while the philosophical solution (defended by Martha Nussbaum) is to establish this <b>list</b> of <b>capabilities</b> as a matter of philosophical theory. The article investigates the debate between these two different positions and argues in favour of the philosophical solution. First, it distinguishes political from epistemological reasons for (not) making <b>capability</b> <b>lists.</b> Second, it shows that the democratic position must incorporate at least some philosophical theorising in general and a theory of democracy in particular. Third, the article argues that the democratic position presupposes that the philosophical position will bypass the democratic process while actually it does not. The philosophical position is actually more respectful of democracy than the democratic position. Fourth, while philosophers may exercise caution and connect their <b>capability</b> <b>lists</b> to actual democratic debates and other empirical sources, this kind of epistemological virtue ironically may heighten the chance of receiving reproaches on the political level...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} the {{development}} of effective business curricula that meets the needs of the marketplace has created an increase in the adoption of core competencies lists identifying appropriate graduate skills. Many organisations and tertiary institutions have individual graduate <b>capabilities</b> <b>lists</b> including skills deemed essential for success. Skills recognised as ‘critical thinking’ are popular inclusions on core competencies and graduate <b>capability</b> <b>lists.</b> While there is literature outlining ‘critical thinking’ frameworks, methods of teaching it and calls for its integration into business curricula, few studies actually identify quantifiable improvements achieved in this area. This project sought to address the development of ‘critical thinking’ skills in a management degree program by embedding a process for critical thinking within a theory unit undertaken by students early in the program. Focus groups and a student survey were used to identify issues of both content and implementation and to develop a student perspective on their needs in thinking critically. A process utilising a framework of critical thinking was integrated through a workbook of weekly case studies for group analysis, discussions and experiential exercises. The experience included formative and summative assessment. Initial results indicate a greater valuation by students of their experience in the organisation theory unit; better marks for mid semester essay assignments and higher evaluations on the university administered survey of students’ satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Inequality has {{acquired}} a newfound prominence in academic and political debate. While scholars working with the capability approach (CA) have succeeded in influencing the conceptualisation and measurement of poverty, which is increasingly understood in multidimensional terms, recent scholarship on inequality focusses overwhelmingly on economic forms of inequality, and especially on inequalities in income and wealth. In this paper we outline how the conceptual framework of the CA (focusing on ends rather than means, multidimensionality, and recognising the value of freedoms as well as attained functionings) {{has the potential to}} enrich the study of distributional inequality through offering a rationale for why inequality matters, exploring the association between different forms of inequality, and providing an analysis of power. But applying the CA in the context of advantage exacerbates some existing challenges to the approach (defining a <b>capability</b> <b>list,</b> and the non-observability of capabilities) and brings some fresh ones (especially insensitivity {{at the top of the}} distribution). We recommend a stronger and clearer distinction between concepts and measures. Capability inequality is a more appropriate and potentially revealing conceptual apparatus, but economic resources are likely to remain a crucial metric for understanding distributional inequality for the forseeable future...|$|E

Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the server supports it. However, a few extensions require the server to know whether a client supports that extension. The ENABLE extension allows an IMAP client to say which extensions it supports. 1. Overview Several IMAP extensions allow the server to return unsolicited responses specific to these extensions in certain circumstances. However, servers cannot send those unsolicited responses until {{they know that the}} clients support such extensions and thus won’t choke on the extension response data. Up until now, extensions have typically stated that a server cannot send the unsolicited responses until after the client has used a command with the extension data (i. e., at that point the server knows the client is aware of the extension). CONDSTORE ([RFC 4551]), ANNOTATE ([ANNOTATE]), and some extensions under consideration at the moment use various commands to enable server extensions. For example, CONDSTORE uses a SELECT or FETCH parameter, and ANNOTATE uses a side effect of FETCH. The ENABLE extension provides an explicit indication from the client that it supports particular extensions. This is done using a new ENABLE command. An IMAP server that supports ENABLE advertises this by including the word ENABLE in its <b>capability</b> <b>list.</b> Gulbrandsen & Melnikov Standards Track [Page 1] RFC 5161 The IMAP ENABLE Extension March 2008 Most IMAP extensions do not require the client to enable the extension in any way...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma thesis was to {{implement}} a service, which allows users to save and share data at a remote location. In the implementation, we focused on user experience. For a good user experience, {{it is very important}} that user can manage files in the same way as he is accustomed to dealing with local files. 	If a whole system allowing a service is not fully connected, unavailability and/or inconsistency may appear. That problem is further discussed in the context of CAP theorem, which says, that it is impossible to reach high availability together with atomic consistency in the presence of network partitions. 	 	We discuss two ways of file access control. Rights for file access are stored together with a user as a <b>capability</b> <b>list</b> and with files as an access control list. Access control mechanisms on local devices don't cause many problems. However, problems may appear, when different devices using different implementations of access control mechanisms connect among themselves. In such cases it is difficult to assure effective access control that would be compatible with both devices. 	 	We describe some examples of service implementation solution, but none of them is ideal. Problems mainly occur in access control mechanisms. In the NFS solution, client with root access can get arbitrary UID, which makes it capable to access any file. Other three solutions use their own implementation of access control mechanism with the exception of Git. The latter in final implementation also uses its own implementation of access control mechanism. Discussed systems using their own implementation of access control mechanism only allow management through a web interface. 	 	We present two examples of service implementation. In both, we succeed meeting all suitability criteria as we defined them. Services that we implemented are useful. We have chosen clients that maintain local copies of files, since they don't always have internet connectivity. This way we made files available even during network partition. However, we had to accept a possibility for some degree of inconsistency, which may appear while using service. In case of full connectivity, we can also achieve good consistency of files. At the end there still remains one important question, how to manage access rights from the file system of user device and not indirectly, using separate mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{what can}} be learnt about the ‘valuation’ of freedoms and opportunities (or capabilities) using a general population social survey data source on values. On the assumption that rights {{can be understood as}} protecting underlying critical freedoms and opportunities, social survey data on public attitudes towards the rights that people “should have” is interpreted as providing empirical evidence on the ‘valuation’ of freedoms and opportunities by individuals and groups. The paper addresses the extent to which data of this type provides empirical evidence of the ‘valuation’ of the 10 domains of freedom and opportunity that are specified in the <b>capability</b> <b>lists</b> for adults and children that have been developed and applied in previous projects (namely, Life; Health; Physical security; Legal security; Standard of living; Education and learning; Productive and valued activities; Individual, family and social life; Identity and self-respect; Participation, influence and voice). Particular emphasis is put on moving beyond the ‘legalistic’ methodology for deriving a ‘human rights-based capability list’ applied in previous projects, and examining whether empirical research on values provides an alternative, overlapping or supplementary informational base for deriving a list of this type. The research findings can be interpreted as providing broad empirical underpinnings for the ‘valuation’ of nine out of the ten domains of freedom and opportunity specified in the <b>capability</b> <b>lists</b> that have been developed and applied in previous projects. The Life domain was effectively not covered by the research exercise, since the underlying social survey data did not include questions on public attitudes towards the right to life...|$|R
40|$|Cybercrime is {{becoming}} a bigger threat each year. Each new piece of software(update) and hardware potentially introduces a new vulnerability which can be exploited by people with malicious intent. These technical threats should be and are fixed by technical solutions. However, in recent years another threat has evolved within cybercrime: Social Engineering. The difference between Social Engineering and ‘ordinary’ cybercrime is that Social Engineering also uses human weaknesses {{in order to gain}} access to information systems or information. Social Engineering is increasingly used by cybercriminals and the economic damage as well as damage to individuals and companies increases every year. In this thesis, first an overview of current Social Engineering practices by criminals as well as countermeasures and strategies by organizations is created by performing a Structured Literature Review (SLR). From the results of this literature study, three preliminary deliverables are created: (1) a definition of Social Engineering, (2) a Legal Social Engineering process model to be used by penetration testers and (3) a <b>list</b> of organizational <b>capabilities</b> to counter Social Engineering. Following, these preliminary deliverables are validated by performing a case study and seven expert interviews. The case study is an engagement at one of EY’s clients where a Social Engineering penetration test is performed and based on this, the preliminary Legal Social Engineering process model is refined. In addition, seven cybercrime experts are interviewed in order to refine the Social Engineering definition as well as the <b>capabilities</b> <b>list</b> and also the Legal Social Engineering process model is validated. Together, these final deliverables are called the Social Engineering Assessment Framework (SEAF). Both the Legal Social Engineering process model and the <b>capabilities</b> <b>list</b> were received well by the experts. The changes include mainly clarifications and modifications of individual capabilities but the overall model was perceived to be very complete and effective. In addition, The expert interviews also uncover that countering cybercrime (and Social Engineering) is moving from purely prevention to a prevention-detection-repression strategy and a risk management approach is widely used. To manage Social Engineering threats effectively, organizational, technical, physical and human resources aspects should be taken into account and be managed as a pipeline. Here, especially the physical security aspect is often disconnected {{from the rest of the}} organization as this is often outsourced to a specialized security company. Future research should focus on validating the SEAF as well as exploring the creation of a Maturity Matrix from the <b>capabilities</b> <b>list.</b> Since this thesis mainly addressed what should be done to counter Social Engineering, future research should also focus on how to implement this...|$|R
