5|$|A nocturnal animal, the Bengal slow loris has {{excellent}} night vision, {{enhanced by}} a tapetum lucidumâ€”a layer of {{tissue in the}} eye that reflects visible light back through the retina. It sleeps during the day <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> in a ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes. Males and females mark their territory with urine. The species is known to live in small family groups. Animals may practice social grooming.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail <b>curled</b> <b>up.</b> Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E

5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise unreachable areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' Morph Ball, a mode in which she curls up into a ball to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature the Spider Ball and Spring Ball. The Spider Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> into a ball in the Morph Ball form.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E

5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E

25|$|Starspots are {{regions of}} intense {{magnetic}} {{activity on the}} surface of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible component of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the differential rotation of the star, the tube becomes <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often form above starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that stretch out into the corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is {{a common}} snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In {{southern}} parts of Thailand, they are reported {{to hide in the}} thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be certain to be relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> in a potted plant. When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms. Snakes are often indiscriminately killed, as many locals incorrectly assume all snakes are venomous. C. ornata is sometimes cooked for food.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The plank {{exercise}} {{is a popular}} and widely used exercise to increase core strength. We previously established normative values for the plank exercise {{that may be used}} for fitness classification to identify gaps in core muscular strength and endurance. Whether the plank exercise can be confidently added to current fitness appraisal protocols will depend on its reliability and validity in the fitness testing environment. This study sought to examine test-retest reliability of the plank exercise and to compare plank performance with established normative values for the <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> test. The role of verbal encouragement cues during plank performance testing was also assessed. Methods: Collegiate male (n= 14) and female participants (n= 19) performed the plank exercise in two separate sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hr. Participants maintained the plank position until complete fatigue was reached. Verbal cues were given to half of the participants in one of the two sessions. Performance on the <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> exercise was measured in a third, separate session. Results: Intraclass correlation showed that mean time held in the plank position was not significantly different between the two plank testing sessions (108. 15 + 49. 38 versus 111. 39 + 56. 87 seconds, p= 0. 556). Verbal encouragement cues did not improve performance time (between group effect, p= 0. 940). The <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> test was not significantly correlated with either plank session (r= 0. 410 and 0. 276 for plank session one and two, respectively). Surprisingly, the <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> test was positively correlated with participant height (r= 0. 578). Conclusion: This study suggests that the plank {{exercise is}} a reliable test; plank performance was comparable across testing sessions and not influenced by verbal encouragement. Further testing is needed to confirm validity of the plank exercise as a measure of core muscular endurance. We show here that plank performance was not correlated with the standard <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> test. However, the <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> test may not adequately measure core strength, given that increased body height was associated with higher <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> completion scores...|$|R

25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him passed out on the floor of his apartment â€“ and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna <b>curled</b> <b>up</b> in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E
