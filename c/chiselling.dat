5|$|The 11-century temple-building boom {{continued}} in the 12th century {{with the addition of}} new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the sala roof (roof under the finial of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on pilasters are chiseled instead of moulded. The difference between the two temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe <b>chiselling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{finishes}} can {{be achieved}} with <b>chiselling,</b> or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials.|$|E
25|$|Weaving, carving, painting, or <b>chiselling</b> is {{considered}} to be the part of the life of Himachalis. Himachal is well known for designing shawls especially in Kullu. The architecture, objects, shops, museums, galleries and craftsmen charm with the variety perfected through time.|$|E
25|$|Photograph 4. – Nasal hump excision: The black {{delineation}} {{indicates the}} desired nose-reduction outcome: a straight nose. The nasal hump is bone (red) above the scalloped grey line, and cartilage (blue) below the scalloped grey line. The surgeon cuts the cartilage {{portion of the}} hump with a scalpel, and chisels the bone portion with an osteotome (bone chisel). After <b>chiselling</b> away the main mass of the nasal hump with an osteotome, the surgeon then sculpts, refines, and smoothens the cut nasal bones with rasps (files).|$|E
25|$|After Ay's reign, {{which lasted}} {{for a little}} over four years, Horemheb managed to seize power, presumably thanks to his {{position}} as commander of the army, and to assume what he must have perceived to be his just reward for having ably served Egypt under Tutankhamun and Ay. Horemheb quickly removed Nakhtmin's rival claim to the throne and arranged to have Ay's WV23 tomb desecrated by smashing the latter's sarcophagus, systematically <b>chiselling</b> Ay's name and figure out of the tomb walls and probably destroying Ay's mummy. However, he spared Tutankhamun's tomb from vandalism presumably because it was Tutankhamun who had promoted his rise to power and chosen him to be his heir. Horemheb also usurped and enlarged Ay's mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use and erased Ay's titulary {{on the back of}} a 17-foot colossal statue by carving his own titulary in its place.|$|E
500|$|Soapstone {{was also}} used for carving, {{modelling}} and <b>chiselling</b> of components that {{could be described as}} [...] "chubby". However, the finish of the architectural components compared to the earlier sandstone temples is much finer, resulting in opulent shapes and creamy decorations. Stepped wells are another feature that some of the temples included.|$|E
500|$|The decayed parapet allows van Eyck {{to display}} his skill at {{mimicking}} stone <b>chiselling</b> and scarring, and shows {{the influence of}} classical Roman funerary art, particularly stone memorials. The parapet gives the work gravitas, the chips and cracks conveying {{a sense of the}} venerable, or, according to art historian Elisabeth Dhanens, a sense of the [...] "fragility of life or of memory itself".|$|E
500|$|Baradwaj Rangan {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "Kamal's latest solo attempt to bend, twist, shape-shift Tamil cinema into forms never-before seen." [...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu believed that [...] "well-defined characters, a strong storyline and intelligent screenplay" [...] were the film's [...] "vital ingredients". She further noted Kamal's treatment of the story, and that his [...] "diligence that has gone into the <b>chiselling</b> {{of the story and}} screenplay is only too evident", while calling the film [...] "a laudable effort".|$|E
500|$|Easily {{accessible}} {{items are}} picked off the tree surface or from fissures in the bark, but larvae are extracted by <b>chiselling</b> holes up to [...] deep and trapping the soft insect with the tongue, which can extend to [...] beyond the bill, and {{is covered with}} bristles and sticky saliva to trap the prey. The woodpecker is able to extend its tongue so far because the hyoid bone {{to which it is}} attached has long flexible [...] "horns" [...] that wind around the skull and can move forward when required.|$|E
500|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is {{sexually mature}} when aged one year, and starts its courtship behaviour in the following December. It has a fluttering flight display in which the male flies with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The [...] pair excavate a new hole at least [...] above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree {{may be used for}} nesting for several years. The nest cavity is [...] deep with an entrance hole [...] wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the <b>chiselling.</b> As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.|$|E
500|$|Lie {{had been}} {{personally}} {{shaken by the}} post-war Soviet suppression of the social-democratic parties in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He viewed Yugoslavia leader Josip Broz Tito as the [...] "Martin Luther of communism" [...] after Tito had openly defied the Soviet Union by <b>chiselling</b> out the Third Way. When the Soviets initiated a blockade of Yugoslavia following the Tito–Stalin split, Lie organized humanitarian aid-shipments from Norway. Another concern was that the Pro-Moscow Norwegian Communist Party (NKP) had was gaining support among leftist voters, with opinion polls showing an increase to 15.4%. As he put it :"It was voting based upon {{the myth of the}} Soviet Union as the land of peace and socialism - a myth which had to be broken down". It was during this period that Lie, with support from the trade union center set up significant and wide-ranging surveillance of Norwegian communists, (a practice later deemed illegal by a government committee, the Lund commission).|$|E
2500|$|Fillers can {{be removed}} {{physically}} by mechanical ways, depending on the filler material type. [...] Cement mortar can be chiselled away with a hammer and chisel gradually. Plaster is easily removed through mechanical methods such as <b>chiselling</b> and chipping away with sharp implements. Saws, drills, and other mechanical methods {{can be used to}} remove the bulk of protruding materials, however scratches, chips, and breaks can occur.|$|E
60|$|He expected, of course--like some grown {{people who}} ought to know better--to find her snipping, piecing, fitting, stitching, cobbling, basting, filing, planing, hammering, turning, polishing, moulding, measuring, <b>chiselling,</b> clipping, and so forth, as men do {{when they go to}} work to make anything.|$|E
60|$|The man had now regained full {{possession}} of his faculties, and was regarding us intently {{from where he}} lay bound upon the deck. He was a handsome fellow, clean limbed and powerful, with an intelligent face and features of such exquisite <b>chiselling</b> that Adonis himself might have envied him.|$|E
60|$|The last plate {{given in}} this volume {{contains}} the two lovely subjects of the Annunciation and Visitation, which, being higher from the ground, are better preserved than the groups represented in the other plates. They will be found to justify, in subtlety of <b>chiselling,</b> the title I gave to Giovanni, of the Canova of the thirteenth century.|$|E
60|$|Tolly Trevor {{clenched his}} teeth and screwed himself up {{internally}} to keep down the laughter that all but burst him, for he saw through the device at once. As for Leaping Buck, he did more than credit to his sire, because he kept as grave as Michael Angelo himself could have desired while <b>chiselling</b> his features.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have a care, Lucas," [...] he {{presently}} said; [...] "I fear me you are <b>chiselling</b> {{away too}} much. It {{must be a}} softer, more rounded face than mine has become; and, above all, let it not catch any saddened look. Keep that air of solemn waiting in glad hope, as though he saw the dawn through his closed eyelids, and were about to take up his song again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XLVIII. This design, then, is, rudely {{and with}} {{imperfect}} <b>chiselling,</b> imitated by {{the fifteenth century}} workmen: the Virtues have lost their hard features and living expression; they have now all got Roman noses, and have had their hair curled. Their actions and emblems are, however, preserved until we come to Hope: she is still praying, but she is praying to the sun only: The hand of God is gone.|$|E
60|$|A middle-aged gentleman, well dressed, {{comes in}} with a {{friendly}} but propitiatory air, not quite sure of his reception. His combination of soft manners and responsive kindliness, with a certain unseizable reserve and a familiar yet foreign <b>chiselling</b> of feature, reveal the Jew: in this instance the handsome gentlemanly Jew, gone a little pigeon-breasted and stale after thirty, as handsome young Jews often do, but still decidedly good-looking.|$|E
60|$|SECTION XLVIII. This design, then, is, rudely {{and with}} {{imperfect}} <b>chiselling,</b> imitated by {{the fifteenth century}} workmen: the Virtues have lost their hard features and living expression; they have now all got Roman noses, and have had their hair curled. Their actions and emblems are, however, preserved until we come to Hope: she is still praying, but she is praying to the sun only: The hand of God is gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I remember," [...] said Niccolo Ridolfi, {{a middle-aged}} man, with that negligent ease of manner which, seeming to claim nothing, is really {{based on the}} lifelong {{consciousness}} of commanding rank--"I remember our Antonio getting bitter about his <b>chiselling</b> and enamelling of these metal things, and taking in a fury to painting, because, said he, `the artist who puts his work into gold and silver, puts his brains into the melting-pot.'" ...|$|E
60|$|People {{were at work}} <b>chiselling</b> several statues in marble {{from the}} plaster models,--a very {{interesting}} process, and which I should think a doubtful and hazardous one; but the artists {{say that there is}} no risk of mischief, and that the model is sure to be accurately repeated in the marble. These persons, who do what is considered the mechanical part of the business, are often themselves sculptors, and of higher reputation than those who employ them.|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet these}} grim old walls {{are not a}} dilettantism and dubiety; they are an earnest fact. It was a most real and serious purpose they were built for! Yes, another world it was, when these black ruins, white in their new mortar and fresh <b>chiselling,</b> first saw the sun as walls, long ago. Gauge not, with thy dilettante compasses, with that placid dilettante simper, the Heaven's-Watchtower of our Fathers, the fallen God's-Houses, the Golgotha of true Souls departed! ...|$|E
60|$|Farther: the midmost stone at f {{is likely}} to be {{troublesome}} chiefly by its weight, pushing down between the others; the more we lighten it the better: so we will cut it into exactly the same shape as the side ones, <b>chiselling</b> away the shaded parts, as at h. We shall then have all the three stones k, l, m, of the same shape; and now putting them together, we have, at C, what the reader, I doubt not, will perceive at once to be a much more satisfactory arrangement than that at f.|$|E
60|$|My {{baptismal name}} is Egaeus; that {{of my family}} I will not mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray, {{hereditary}} halls. Our line {{has been called a}} race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars--in the character of the family mansion--in the frescos of the chief saloon--in the tapestries of the dormitories--in the <b>chiselling</b> of some buttresses in the armory--but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings--in the fashion of the library chamber--and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library's contents--there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.|$|E
60|$|Pure Greek it is, {{with the}} grave low forehead, the exquisitely arched brow; the noble <b>chiselling</b> of the mouth, shaped {{as if it}} were the {{mouthpiece}} of an instrument of music; the supreme and splendid curve of the cheek; the augustly pillared throat which bears it all: it is Greek, because the lines which compose it are so definite and so strong, and yet so exquisitely harmonised that the effect is one of simple loveliness purely: Greek, because its essence and its quality, as is the quality of music and of architecture, is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical laws.|$|E
60|$|Deringham {{rose with}} him, and strolling along the {{verandah}} together they stopped {{a moment at}} the door, close by where Alice Deringham sat at an open window. It was growing dark now, but {{the last of the}} afterglow was flung down into their faces by the snow, and it seemed to the girl that the resemblance between them had grown stronger. Her father's appeared a trifle less refined in its <b>chiselling</b> than it had been, and there was a look which did not please her in his eyes. It suggested cupidity and cunning in place of intellectuality.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sue, {{you seem}} {{when you are}} like this {{to be one of}} the women of some grand old civilization, whom I used to read about in my bygone, wasted, {{classical}} days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian country. I almost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra, about the latest news of Octavia or Livia; or have been listening to Aspasia's eloquence, or have been watching Praxiteles <b>chiselling</b> away at his latest Venus, while Phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing." ...|$|E
60|$|PLATE I.--A {{small portion}} of a {{photograph}} of Nicolo Pisano's Adoration of the Magi, on the pulpit of the Pisan Baptistery. The intensely Greek character of the heads, and the severely impetuous <b>chiselling</b> (learned from Late Roman rapid work), which drives {{the lines of the}} drapery nearly straight, may be seen better in a fragment of this limited measure than in the crowded massing of the entire subject. But it may be observed also that there is both a thoughtfulness and a tenderness in the features, whether of the Virgin or the attendant angel, which already indicate an aim beyond that of Greek art.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a fellow}} {{in a curious}} place!" [...] said Oliver, peering up through an {{irregular}} hole, in which a man was seen at work standing on a plank supported by a ladder. He was <b>chiselling</b> with great vigour at the rock over his head, and immediately beyond him another man stood on a plank supported by a beam of timber, and busily engaged in a similar occupation. Both men were stripped to the waist, and panted at their toil. The little chamber or cavern in which they worked was brilliantly illuminated by their two candles, and their athletic figures stood out, dark and picturesque, against the light glistering walls.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXV. Another point I {{wish the}} reader to observe is, the {{importance}} attached to color {{in the mind of}} the designer. Note especially--for it is of the highest importance to see how the great principles of art are carried out through the whole building--that, as only the white capitals are sculptured below, only the white triangles are sculptured above. No colored triangle is touched with sculpture; note also, that in the two principal groups of the apse, given in Plate III., the centre of the group is color, not sculpture, and the eye is evidently intended to be drawn as much to the chequers of the stone, as to the intricacies of the <b>chiselling.</b> It will be noticed also how much more precious the lower series, which is central in the apse, is rendered, than the one above it in the plate, which flanks it: there is no brick in the lower one, and three kinds of variegated marble are used in it, whereas the upper is composed of brick, with black and white marble only; and lastly--for this is especially delightful--see how the workman made his <b>chiselling</b> finer where it was to go with the variegated marbles, and used a bolder pattern with the coarser brick and dark stone. The subtlety and perfection of artistical feeling in all this are so redundant, that in the building itself the eye can rest upon this colored chain with the same kind of delight that it has in a piece of the embroidery of Paul Veronese.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXV. The reader {{has been}} told repeatedly[89] that there are two, and only two, real orders of capitals, {{originally}} represented by the Corinthian and the Doric; and distinguished by the concave or convex contours of their bells, {{as shown by the}} dotted lines at e, Fig. V., p. 65. And hitherto, respecting the capital, we have been exclusively concerned with the methods in which these two families of simple contours have gathered themselves together, and obtained reconciliation to the abacus above, and the shaft below. But the last paragraph introduces us to the surface ornament disposed upon these, in the <b>chiselling</b> of which the characters described above, § XXVIII., which are but feebly marked in the cornice, boldly distinguish and divide the families of the capital.|$|E
60|$|He lay silent {{almost too}} long, {{watching}} {{her with a}} vague longing in his gaze, for her head was partly turned from him. He could see her face in profile, which accentuated its clean <b>chiselling,</b> while her pose displayed the firm white neck and fine lines of the figure the thin white dress flowed away from. He had also guessed enough of her character {{to realize that it}} was not to any approach to physical perfection she owed most of her attractiveness, for {{it seemed to him that}} she brought with her an atmosphere of refinement and tranquillity which nothing that was sordid or ignoble could breathe in. Perhaps she felt his eyes upon her, for she turned at last and glanced at him.|$|E
60|$|I {{have added}} a plate to this volume (Plate XII.), {{which should have}} {{appeared}} in illustration of the fifth chapter of Vol. II., but was not finished in time. It represents the central capital {{and two of the}} lateral ones of the Fondaco de' Turchi, the central one drawn very large, in order to show the excessive simplicity of its <b>chiselling,</b> together with the care and sharpness of it, each leaf being expressed by a series of sharp furrows and ridges. Some slight errors in the large tracings from which the engraving was made have, however, occasioned a loss of spring in the curves, and the little fig. 4 of Plate X. Vol. II. gives a truer idea of the distant effect of the capital.|$|E
60|$|And {{now what}} remains {{for me to}} tell? Her nose was Grecian, but perhaps a little too wide at the nostril to be {{considered}} perfect in its <b>chiselling.</b> Her hair was soft and brown,--that dark brown which by some lights is almost black; {{but she was not}} a girl whose loveliness depended much upon her hair. With some women it is their great charm,--Neæras who love to sit half sleeping in the shade,--but it is a charm that possesses no powerful eloquence. All beauty of a high order should speak, and Madeline's beauty was ever speaking. And now that I have said that, I believe that I have told all that may be necessary to place her outward form before the inward eyes of my readers.|$|E
60|$|At {{our next}} meeting I found him <b>chiselling</b> {{an open book}} upon a marble headstone, and {{concluded}} that {{it was meant to}} express the erudition of some black-letter clergyman of the Cotton Mather school. It turned out, however, to be emblematical of the scriptural knowledge of an old woman who had never read anything but her Bible, and the monument was a tribute to her piety and good works from the orthodox church of which she had been a member. In strange contrast with this Christian woman's memorial was that of an infidel whose gravestone, by his own direction, bore an avowal of his belief that the spirit within him would be extinguished like a flame, and that the nothingness whence he sprang would receive him again.|$|E
