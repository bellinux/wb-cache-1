5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same <b>colour.</b> Thus, he observed that <b>colour</b> {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the <b>colour</b> themselves.

A proper total <b>colouring</b> of a graph is a <b>colouring</b> of both vertices and edges so that every pair of adjacent vertices receive different <b>colours,</b> every pair of adjacent edges receive different <b>colours</b> and every vertex and incident edge receive different <b>colours.</b> This paper considers a strengthening of this condition and examines the minimum number of <b>colours</b> required for a total <b>colouring</b> with the additional property that for any adjacent vertices u and v, the sets of <b>colours</b> incident to u is different from the set of <b>colours</b> incident to v.

In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
