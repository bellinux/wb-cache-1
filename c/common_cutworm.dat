40|$|An insecticidal protein {{produced}} by Bacillus sphaericus A 3 - 2 was purified to elucidate its structure and mode of action. The active principle purified from the culture broth of A 3 - 2 was a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa that rapidly intoxicated German cockroaches (Blattela germanica) at {{a dose of}} about 100 ng when injected. The insecticidal protein sphaericolysin possessed the undecapeptide motif of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins and had a unique N-terminal sequence. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli was equally as potent as the native protein. Sphaericolysin-induced hemolysis resulted from the protein's pore-forming action. This activity {{as well as the}} insecticidal activity was markedly reduced by a Y 159 A mutation. Also, coapplication of sphaericolysin with cholesterol abolished the insecticidal action, suggesting that cholesterol binding {{plays an important role in}} insecticidal activity. Sphaericolysin-lysed neurons dissociated from the thoracic ganglia of the German cockroaches. In addition, sphaericolysin's activity in ganglia was suppressed by the Y 159 A mutation. The sphaericolysin-induced damage to the cockroach ganglia was greater than the damage to the ganglia of <b>common</b> <b>cutworms</b> (Spodoptera litura), which accounts, at least in part, for the higher sensitivity to sphaericolysin displayed by the cockroaches than that displayed by cutworms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) {{catalyze}} the oxidation of phenolics to quinones, {{the secondary}} reactions of {{which lead to}} oxidative browning and postharvest losses of many fruits and vegetables. PPOs are ubiquitous in angiosperms, are inducible by both biotic and abiotic stresses, and have been implicated in several physiological processes including plant defense against pathogens and insects, the Mehler reaction, photoreduction of molecular oxygen by PSI, regulation of plastidic oxygen levels, aurone biosynthesis and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Here we review experiments in which the roles of PPO in disease and insect resistance {{as well as in}} the Mehler reaction were investigated using transgenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants with modified PPO expression levels (suppressed PPO and overexpressing PPO). These transgenic plants showed normal growth, development and reproduction under laboratory, growth chamber and greenhouse conditions.

The aglycon of (Z) - 3 -hexenyl vicianoside is derived from airborne (Z) - 3 -hexenol emitted from infested plants. The ability to incorporate and convert (Z) - 3 -hexenol to its corresponding glycoside is widely conserved in an array of plant species. However, the specificity of this ability to discriminate between the chemical structures of different volatile alcohols remains unknown. In this study, we investigated glycosylation of several volatile alcohols in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).

With a changing climate, there is the potential for this in-sect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suit-ability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both con-stant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15 – 38 °C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change pro-jections from SRES A 1 B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visu-alized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions.

Intensities of ant defences were estimated by measuring ant aggressiveness {{in the presence of}} artificial damage inflicted on plants. As part of our examination of non-ant defences, we measured leaf toughness (punch strength, by penetrometry), and the contents of total phenols and condensed tannin. We demonstrated interspecific variation in intensities of both ant and non-ant defences amongst ten Macaranga species and showed that the rank order of ant defence intensity was negatively correlated with the intensity of non-ant defence. We also found that the balance between ant and non-ant defence intensity was correlated with the rates of leaf turnover and shoot growth. Species investing more in ant defence tended to have higher leaf turnover rates. Macaranga species that occur preferentially in shadier microhabitats had lower leaf turnover rates, suggesting that non-ant defences are more cost-effective in more shade-tolerant species.

Although the orchestrated relationship between the venom and LO components necessary for successful parasitism has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers in this field, the molecular natures of both factors remain ambiguous. We here showed that precipitation of the venom components by ultracentrifugation yielded a toxic fraction that was inactivated by ultraviolet light irradiation, boiling, and sonication, suggesting that it is a virus-like entity. Morphological observation of the precipitate after ultracentrifugation showed small spherical heterogeneous virus-like particles 20 - 40 nm in diameter. The venom's detrimental effect on D. melanogaster larvae was not directly neutralized by the LO components but blocked by a hemolymphal neutralizing factor activated by the LO factor. Furthermore, we found that A. japonica venom and LO components acted similarly on the larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm</b> Spodoptera litura: the venom injection caused mortality but coinjection of the LO factor protected S. litura larvae from the venom's toxicity. In contrast, D. ficusphila and D. bipectinata, which are closely related to D. melanogaster but non-habitual host species of A. japonica, were not negatively affected by A. japonica venom due to an intrinsic neutralizing activity in their hemolymph, indicating that these species must have acquired a neutralizer of A. japonica venom during evolution. These results give new insights into the characteristics of both the venom and LO components: A. japonica females have utilized the virus-like toxic venom factor to exploit a wider range of host species after the evolutionary process enabled them to use the LO factor for activation of the host hemolymph neutralizer precursor, although the non-habitual host Drosophila species possess an active intrinsic neutralizer in their hemolymph...|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{production}} and {{movement from the}} fused testes into the male reproductive tract of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm</b> Spodoptera litura were studied in insects maintained in a 12 h: 12 h light dark (LD) regime. Two types of sperm bundles, eupyrene (nucleated) and apyrene (anucleate) {{were present in the}} adult testes. Eupyrene bundles constituted about 25 % of the total. Descent of spermatozoa from the testes into the upper vas deferens (UVD) first occurred about 24 - 30 h before adult eclosion. On entering the reproductive tract, eupyrene spermatozoa remained in bundles while apyrene bundles became dissociated before they reached the UVD. Downward movement of both eupyrene and apyrene spermatozoa within the male tract occurred in a daily rhythm. Sperm descent from the testes into the UVD occurred during the early scotophase, followed by their further descent into the seminal vesicle (SV) during the photophase. Spermatozoa remained in the SV for only a short duration, whence sperm quickly passed through the lower vas deferens into the duplex, which acted as the main sperm storage organ until mating was initiated. During mating 80 % of sperm left the duplex, but mating did not influence the number of sperm bundles that subsequently descended into the duplex or the rate of their descent. There was no evidence of sperm reflux. Rearing in constant light (LL) and in constant dark (DD) reduced the number of eupyrene sperm present in the testes of adults that emerged in LL and DD compared to controls (LD), although there was no significant effect on the number of apyrene sperm in the testes. The rhythmic pattern of sperm descent was suppressed in both LL and DD regimes, and the number of sperm in the duplex was adversely affected, with a marked impact in LL reared insects. Male longevity, mating behaviour, oviposition and fertility were found to be more severely affected in LL than in DD. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Similarly, PPO-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an increase in resistance to various insects, including <b>common</b> <b>cutworm</b> (Spodoptera litura (F.)), cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera (HÃƒÂ¼bner)) and beet army worm (Spodoptera exigua (HÃƒÂ¼bner)), whereas larvae feeding on plants with suppressed PPO activity had higher larval growth rates and consumed more foliage. Similar increases in weight gain, foliage consumption, and survival were also observed with Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) feeding on antisense PPO transgenic tomatoes. The putative defensive mechanisms conferred by PPO and its interaction with other defense proteins are discussed. In addition, transgenic plants with suppressed PPO exhibited more favorable water relations and decreased photoinhibition compared to nontransformed controls and transgenic plants overexpressing PPO, suggesting that PPO may have a role in the development of plant water stress and potential for photoinhibition and photooxidative damage that may be unrelated to any effects on the Mehler reaction. These results substantiate the defensive role of PPO and suggest that manipulation of PPO activity in specific tissues has the potential to provide broad-spectrum resistance simultaneously to both disease and insect pests, however, effects of PPO on postharvest quality as well as water stress physiology should also be considered. In addition to the functional analysis of tomato PPO, the application of antisense/sense technology to decipher the functions of PPO in other plant species as well as for commercial uses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sterol carrier protein- 2 / 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCPx) gene {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be involved in}} absorption and transport of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a membrane component and is a precursor of ecdysteroids, but cannot be synthesized de novo in insects. However, a direct association between SCPx gene expression, cholesterol absorption and development in lepidopteran insects remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Results An SCPx cDNA (Sl SCPx) cloned from the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura, was characterized. The Sl SCPx cDNA encoded a 535 -amino acid protein consisting of a 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCPx-t) domain and a SCP- 2 (SCPx- 2) domain. Sl SCPx mRNA was expressed predominately in the midgut, while Sl SCPx- 2 mRNA was detected in the midgut, fat body and epidermis and no Sl SCPx-t mRNA was detected. A 58 -kDa full-length SCPx protein and a 44 -kDa SCPx-t protein were detected in the midgut of sixth instar larvae when the anti- Sl SCPx-t antibody was used in western blotting analysis; a 16 -kDa SCP- 2 protein was detected when anti- Sl SCPx- 2 antibody was used. Sl SCPx protein was post-translationally cleaved into two smaller proteins, SCPx-t and SCPx- 2. The gene appeared to be expressed into two forms of mRNA transcripts, which were translated into the two proteins, respectively. Sl SCPx-t and Sl SCPx- 2 proteins have distinct and different locations in the midgut of sixth instar larvae. Sl SCPx and Sl SCPx-t proteins were detected predominately in the cytoplasm, whereas Sl SCPx- 2 protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei in the Spli- 221 cells. Over-expression of Sl SCPx and Sl SCPx- 2 proteins enhanced cholesterol uptake into the Spli- 221 cells. Knocking-down Sl SCPx transcripts by dsRNA interference resulted in a decrease in cholesterol level in the hemolymph and delayed the larval to pupal transition. Conclusion Spatial and temporal expression pattern of this Sl SCPx gene during the larval developmental stages of S. litura showed its specific association with the midgut at the feeding stage. Over-expression of this gene increased cholesterol uptake and interference of its transcript decreased cholesterol uptake and delayed the larval to pupal metamorphosis. All of these results taken together suggest that this midgut-specific Sl SCPx gene is important for cholesterol uptake and normal development in S. litura. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{isolates}} of the entomopathogenic fungus, Nomuraea rileyi, were bioassayed by spraying against 5 th-instar larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura. Among these isolates, IPL-TC 1 isolate {{was most}} virulent, resulting in 83. 3 % larval mortality, whereas IPL-WF 1 isolate caused only 8. 3 %. To investigate the genetic variability of these isolates, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) {{was used to}} analyze 10 N. rileyi isolates. The optimal RAPD conditions amplified in PCR machine were 200 ng template DNA, 200 M dNTP, 1 x PCR buffer, 0. 2 M primer and 2. 5 U Taq polymerase, with 40 cycles. Fifteen reproducibility primers were screened from 80 random primers. RAPD analysis of 10 N. rileyi isolates with fifteen 10 -mer oligonucleotide primers of arbitrary sequence showed 187 scorable characters, the amplified DNA fragments ranged from 0. 5 to 5. 4 kb. Cluster analysis of RAPD characters showed that most of N. rielyi isolates were {{in one of three}} phenetic groups. The phenetic groups were not correlated with virulence, geographical origin, or host species. One RAPD fragment was cloned to prepare DNA probe, pA 7. The results indicated that specific hybridization of this probe with N. rileyi isolates was observed. In addition, extra nucleic acid bands were detected from 10 N. rileyi isolates during purification of genomic DNA. On the basis of digestion of nuclease using different salt concentrations, the extra bands proved to be dsRNA. Through 20 - 70 % linear sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation, dsRNA and virus-like particle were recovered in the same gradient. Therefore, it is indicated that these isolates of N. rileyi were infected with mycoviruses. 測定 10 株綠殭菌 (Nomuraea rileyi) 分離株對五齡初斜紋夜蛾 (Spodoptera litura) 之致病力，所得之死亡率以 IPL-TC 1 最高為 83. 3 %，而 IPL-WF 1 最低為 8. 3 %。並利用隨機增幅核酸多型性技術 (random amplified polymorphic DNA; RAPD) 分析此 10 分離株，測得之 RAPD 最佳增幅條件為每 50 µl 樣本中，包含 200 ng 模板 DNA、 200 µM dNTP、 1 x PCR buffer、 0. 2 µM引子及 2. 5 U Taq聚合酵素，於聚合酵素連鎖反應儀中增幅 40 個循環。並由測試之 80 個引子中得到 15 個增幅效果良好且具重現性 (reproducibility) 之引子。以 15 個篩選之引子，對 10 株綠殭菌進行 RAPD 增幅反應，共得增幅條帶數 187 條，其 DNA 片段大小約為 3. 5 — 5. 4 kb。利用 UPGMA 歸群方法分析此 15 個引子所得之增幅片段，可將此等分離株分為 3 群，而其中 8 株菌歸為一群。歸群結果與致病力、寄主來源及採集地之間並無相關聯。利用 RAPD 之增幅產物，進行核酸探針之製備，發現所得之探針 pA 7 對綠殭菌具有專一性。而純化綠殭菌基因體核酸 (genomic nucleic acid) 之過程中，在 10 株綠殭菌內皆發現若干額外之核酸片段。以核酸水解酵素 (nuclease) 於不同鹽離子濃度下測試後發現此核酸片段為雙股核糖核酸 (dsRNA) ，經 20 - 70 % 之蔗糖梯度 (sucrose gradient) 離心純化後可在純化後，可得到此雙股核糖核酸。利用電子顯微鏡亦可在同一梯度中觀察到似病毒顆粒 (virus-like particle) ，由以上結果可證實本地分離之綠殭菌均受到真菌病毒 (mycoviruses) 所感染。目 次 前言………………………………………………………………… [...] 1 文獻摘述…………………………………………………………… [...] 3 材料方法………………………………………………………… [...] . 14 結果……………………………………………………………… [...] . 29 討論……………………………………………………………… [...] . 36 參考文獻………………………………………………………… [...] . 43 圖與表…………………………………………………………… [...] . 51 附錄……………………………………………………………… [...] . 6...|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura, {{has become}} a major pest of soybean (Glycine max) {{throughout}} its Indian range. With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15 - 38 °C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A 1 B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34 - 36 °C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38 °C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15 °C) and high (> 35 °C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95 % of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura...|$|E
40|$|Induction of {{virulence}} {{variants of}} the entomopathogenic fungus, Nomuraea rileyi, against the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura Hwei-Jan Lin Summary Nine fungal isolates were collected and purified from the infected larvae {{found in the}} field, and identified to be Nomuraea rileyi. Growth of these nine isolates at different temperatures was examined. Conidia of all isolates failed to germinate at 35 ℃and only few isolates could germinate at 15 ℃. However, they were capable of germinating at 20 - 30 ℃, although their germination rate was different. The TC isolate took 60, 36, and 48 hr to reach 100 % germination at 20, 25, and 30 ℃, respectively. In the same condition, the TC isolate was superior to others in germination. No mycelial growth was found in all isolates at 15 or 35 ℃. But 9 isolates grew well and sporulated at 20 - 25 ℃. The optimum temperatures for mycelial growth and sporulation {{were found to be}} at 20 - 25 ℃. None could sporulate at 30 ℃ except the WF isolate. This isolate was though to be most adaptive to high temperatures comparing with other isolates. Different larval stages of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura, varied with susceptibility to N. rileyi. Mortalities of 2 nd/ 3 rd, 4 th, and 5 th instars of S. litura were 70, 40, and 20 %, respectively, when inoculated with 1 ´ 106 conidia/ml of TC isolate. However 1 st and 6 th instars were not susceptible to this fungus, indicating that 2 nd and 3 rd instars were most susceptible to N. rileyi. Among 9 isolates, TC and WF isolates were most pathogenic to insect host as assayed with S. litura larvae. Exposure of WF and TC isolates to UV light at 254 nm induced 19 and 36 variants, respectively. Variants of TC isolate were more tolerable to UV light than WF isolate’s variants. Bioassay showed that the variants, TC- 171, TC 3, WF 144, WF 151, WF 167, and WF 133, had lower LC 50 values than other isolates, and have the potential for microbial control. Seventeen chemicals were tested for their inhibition to mycelial growth of different variants. All of herbicides and insecticides tested were not inhibitory to isolates of N. rileyi. However, three fungicides including maneb, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride + mancozeb showed inhibition to mycelial growth of TC and WF isolates. The variants, TC- 168 、WF- 61 、WF- 245 and WF- 424, TC- 17 、TC- 68 、TC- 83 、TC- 159 、TC- 168 、TC- 169 and WF- 245, TC- 10 、TC- 19 、TC- 21 、TC- 32 、TC- 45 、TC- 68 、TC- 77 、TC- 83 、TC- 94 、TC- 112 、TC- 138 、TC- 159 、TC- 162 、TC- 164 、TC- 169 、TC- 182 、WF- 61 、WF- 245 、WF- 413 、WF- 424 and WF- 650, could grow upon treatments with mancozeb, maneb, and copper oxychloride + mancozeb. 中 文 摘 要 自田間採集的九株真菌，在實驗室分離及純粹培養後，經對照檢索表鑑定為綠殭菌 (Nomuraea rileyi) 。在此九菌株中，只有少數菌株之孢子可在 15 ℃的低溫下發芽，但除TC株外，發芽率皆不高，培養 5 天之發芽率僅達 50 %。在 20 - 30 ℃培養各菌株，其發芽率皆可達 100 %，但所需之培養時間不同；TC株在溫度為 20 、 25 及 30 ℃之下，孢子 100 %發芽所需之培養時間，分別為 60 、 36 及 48 小時；在 35 ℃高溫時，則會抑制發芽。相同培養條件下，以TC株之發芽率最高，且孢子發芽所需時間也較其他菌株短。在 15 ℃下，只有少數菌株可行菌絲生長，但生長狀況不佳。以高溫 35 ℃培養時，所有菌株均無生長現象。在 20 - 25 ℃溫度範圍內，所有菌株均可行菌絲生長，且培養兩週後有產孢現象，顯示最適綠殭菌之生長溫度為 20 - 25 ℃。所有菌株均可在 30 ℃行菌絲生長，但只有WF株可在 30 ℃產孢，故以WF品系具有較廣的溫度適應性。 斜紋夜蛾(Spodoptera litura) 不同齡期幼蟲對本菌之感受性各異；接種TC株菌液之濃度為 1 ´ 106 conidia/ml時，可造成二及三齡蟲 70 %之死亡率，而四齡蟲之死亡率為 40 %，五齡蟲之死亡率僅有 20 %，而一及六齡幼蟲之死亡率更低，幾乎不受感染，顯示斜紋夜蛾幼蟲以二、三齡蟲對綠殭菌最具感受性，而一齡與六齡幼蟲均無感受性。以S. litura檢定九個綠殭菌菌株的致病性，結果以TC與WF株之致病力最佳。 以UV (254 nm) 光照射所誘發有效之WF及TC株，各得 19 及 36 個變異株，其中WF株對UV光之忍受力較TC株高，但培養時則以TC變異株之生長狀況較WF變異株佳。此 55 個變異株比親本之WF及TC株增加耐UV光照射之特性。變異株之致病力以TC- 171 、TC- 3 、WF- 144 、WF- 154 、WF- 167 與WF- 133 最高，其LC 50 值較其他株低，故較具使用於微生物防治之潛力。 田間常用之 17 種農藥，除大生類三種殺菌劑外，其他十四種藥劑，包括殺蟲劑及殺草劑，均不會抑制菌的生長；大生類殺菌劑對各變異株之抑制作用不同，其中以鋅錳乃浦之抑菌力最強。所有變異株中，以TC- 168 、WF- 61 、WF- 245 與WF- 424 株之生長最不受鋅錳乃浦限制；以TC- 17 、TC- 68 、TC- 83 、TC- 159 、TC- 168 、TC- 169 株與WF- 245 株對錳乃浦之耐藥性最高，WF- 245 株之生長完全不受錳乃浦抑制；而TC- 10 、TC- 19 、TC- 21 、TC- 32 、TC- 45 、TC- 68 、TC- 77 、TC- 83 、TC- 94 、TC- 112 、TC- 138 、TC- 159 、TC- 162 、TC- 164 、TC- 169 、TC- 182 株與WF- 61 、WF- 245 、 WF- 413 、WF- 424 與WF- 650 株對銅錳鋅乃浦之忍受度較其他株高。目 錄 中文摘要 [...] I 英文摘要 [...] III 誌謝 [...] V 目錄 [...] VI 圖次索引 [...] IX 表次索引 [...] X壹、前言 [...] 1 貳、文獻摘述 [...] 3 一、斜紋夜蛾 [...] 3 二、綠殭菌 [...] - 3 三、綠殭菌對不同寄主之致病力 [...] 4 四、寄主對不同品系綠殭菌之感受性 [...] 5 五、寄主齡期對綠殭菌致病力之影響 [...] 6 六、病原之接種方式 [...] - 6 七、接種之病原形態 [...] - 7 八、變異株之誘發 [...] 8 九、農藥對綠殭菌之影響 [...] - 8 參、材料與方法 [...] 10 一、 供試昆蟲之飼育 [...] 10 二、 菌種之採集與培養 [...] - 10 三、 綠殭菌發芽率之測試 [...] 11 四、 綠殭菌之溫度適應性 [...] 12 五、 不同齡期幼蟲對綠殭菌之感受性 [...] - 12 六、 綠殭菌不同菌株致病力之比較 [...] 13 七、 變異株之誘發與篩選 [...] 13 八、 變異株之致病力 [...] 14 九、 綠殭菌各變異株對農藥相容性之測試 [...] - 14 肆、結果 [...] - 16 一、 菌種之採集與培養 [...] - 16 二、 綠殭菌發芽率之測試 [...] 16 三、 綠殭菌之溫度適應性 [...] 19 四、 不同齡期幼蟲對綠殭菌之感受性 [...] - 21 五、 綠殭菌不同菌株致病力之比較 [...] 21 六、 變異株之誘發與篩選 [...] 24 七、 變異株之致病力 [...] 24 八、 綠殭菌各變異株對農藥相容性之測試 [...] - 26 伍、討論 [...] - 31 一、菌種之採集與培養 [...] - 31 二、綠殭菌發芽率之測試 [...] 31 三、綠殭菌之溫度適應性 [...] 34 四、不同齡期幼蟲對綠殭菌之感受性 [...] - 35 五、綠殭菌不同菌株致病力之比較 [...] 36 六、變異株之誘發與篩選 [...] 37 七、變異株之致病力 [...] 38 八、綠殭菌各變異株對農藥相容性之測試 [...] - 39 九、 結論 [...] - 41 陸、參考文獻 [...] - 43 圖 次 索 引 圖一、不同溫度培養九個綠殭菌菌株之累積發芽率 [...] - 18 圖二、不同濃度綠殭菌(TC株) 對斜紋夜蛾各齡幼蟲之致死率 [...] 22 圖三、斜紋夜蛾三齡蟲對九個綠殭菌菌株之感受性 [...] - 23 圖四、綠殭菌突變株對斜紋夜蛾三齡蟲致病力之比較 [...] 25 表 次 索 引 表一、菌種採集地及其感染寄主 [...] - 17 表二、九個綠殭菌菌株於不同溫度下培養兩週之生長情形 [...] 20 表三、十七種農藥對綠殭菌(TC與WF株) 的抑制效果 [...] 27 表四、大生類殺菌劑對TC突變株之抑制效果 [...] 29 表五、大生類殺菌劑對WF突變株之抑制效果 [...] - 3...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of female}} sex {{pheromone}} gland extracts of the turnip moth (or <b>common</b> <b>cutworm),</b> Agrotis segetum, from Zimbabwe revealed three compounds previously identified as sex pheromone {{components in the}} Swedish population, namely (Z) - 5 -decenyl acetate (Z 5 - 10 :OAc), (Z) - 7 -dodecenyl acetate (Z 7 - 12 :OAc), and (Z) - 9 -tetradecenyl acetate (Z 9 - 14 :OAc). However, the proportions from the Zimbabwean population (1 : 0. 25 : 0. 03) differ {{from those in the}} Swedish population(1 : 5 : 2. 5). In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the Zimbabwean female gland extracts revealed a trace of (Z) - 5 -dodecenyl acetate (Z 5 - 12 :OAc). This compound has recently been identified as a fourth sex pheromone component for the Swedish population. Single-sensillum recordings from both Zimbabwean and Swedish populations showed the presence of two types of antennal receptors responding to either Z 5 - 10 :OAc or Z 7 - 12 :OAc. In Zimbabwean males the Z 7 - 12 :OAc receptor neuron appeared to be confined to the basal and medial thirds of the antennal branches, while in Swedish males it was distributed along the entire antennal branch. Dose-response curves of Z 5 - 10 :OAc or Z 7 - 12 :OAc specific receptor neurons from males of both populations showed similar response profiles, but the neurons of the Zimbabwean population showed higher maximal responses. In Eight tunnel tests with Zimbabwean males, the three-component Zimbabwean blend of Z 5 - 10 :OAc, Z 7 - 12 :OAc and Z 9 - 14 :OAc elicited significantly greater responses than the Swedish blend, but not significantly greater than pheromone glands from calling Zimbabwean females. (Z) - 5 -decenol (Z 5 - 10 :OH), a constituent of gland extracts, exerted an antagonistic effect in the flight tunnel. In field tests conducted in Sweden, local males were preferentially attracted to local females, while in Zimbabwe preferential attraction to local females was less pronounced. Local response to the Swedish and Zimbabwean synthetic four-component blends mirrored the responses to the local females. Zimbabwean males are much more strongly attracted to Z 5 - 10 :OAc alone than are Swedish males and the high concentrations of Z 7 - 12 :OAc and/or Z 9 - 14 :OAc present in the Swedish blend reduced attraction of Zimbabwean males. This reduced attraction appears to be counteracted by the trace amounts of Z 5 - 12 :OAc found in the Swedish four-component blend. Addition of Z 5 - 12 :OAc to the three-component Zimbabwean blend did not. however. significantly increase the trap catches of Zimbabwean males...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to explore the {{influence}} and mechanism of different host plants on the growth, development and fecundity of the reproductive system of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm</b> S. litura to understand host suitability of plant infesting insect species to make progress in efficient strategies to control this economic pest. The influence of different host plants on larval, pupal developmental duration, adult life (longevity) and fecundity of the Spodoptera litura were investigated in the laboratory. The results revealed that the larval development was significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased to (15. 55) days when larvae fed on cabbage while it was significantly (p< 0. 05) prolonged to (19. 55), (20. 18) days when larvae fed on cowpea and alligator weed. Pupal duration was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced to (7. 54) days and increased to (9. 13) days when larvae fed on cabbage and alligator weed respectively. When larvae fed on different host plants adult duration (longevity) was not significantly different, only when S. litura larvae fed on sweet potato and cowpea the adult longevity was significantly (p< 0. 05) different {{and it was about}} (6. 92), (5. 64) days when larvae fed on sweet potato and cowpea respectively, Pupal weight was significantly (p< 0. 05) increased to (0. 28) g when the larvae fed on cabbage while it was significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased to (0. 16) g when larvae fed on cowpea. Our results found when both 1 st and 3 rd day age of adult female dissected ovarian length was significantly (p< 0. 05) increased when larvae fed on cabbage, cotton, sweet potato, while it was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced when larvae fed on soybean and cowpea and alligator weed respectively. Ovarian weight was also significantly (p< 0. 05) influenced by the different host plants at both 1 st and 3 rd day age. As well as the male accessory gland length for both age was significantly (p< 0. 05) increased to (5. 45), (5. 62) cm when larvae fed on cabbage while it was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced to (3. 20), (3. 73) when larvae fed on cowpea. the results also showed that the 3 rd day age mating insects its accessory gland length was shorter. Similarly we found that the ovarian weight has the same trend for both age where the weight was significantly (p< 0. 05) influenced by different host plants however at the paired of 3 rd day age insects the weight was lower. In addition spermary fresh weight for both age was also significantly increased to (3. 23), (2. 83) mg while it was reduced (2. 17), (1. 63) mg when larvae fed on cabbage and alligator weed respectively. Similarly the spermary weight was more reduced at the mated of 3 rd day age adult. We conclude that cabbage and cotton and sweet potato were found to be more preferred for S. litura life than soybean and cowpea and alligator weed however; the implications for these findings need to be more discussed to control S. litura...|$|E

It {{was the first}} specie of Steinernematidae discorverd and recorded in Taiwan. Its life cycle similar to other species of Steinernema includes egg, four larval stages and adult. Inoculation of 4 th, 5 thand 6 th instar larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura, with 10, 50, and 100 infective juveniles (IJs) per larva caused 73. 3 to 100 % of larval mortality, LT 50 between 24. 4 hr (100 IJs/ 4 th larva) and 39. 8 hr (10 IJs/ 6 th larva). The survival rate of S. abbasi remained 100 % at 10, 20, and 25 ℃ but lowered to 94. 8 % after storage at 30 ℃ for 30 days. Bioassay with S. litura larvae inoculated with 10 IJs/larva showed that the nematodes stored at 15 and 20 ℃ for 25 days could cause 95 % or higher of larval mortality. LT 50 values were 26. 2 and 23. 1 hr, respectively. Mortality of S. litura 5 th instar larvae was highest (99 %) by incubating at 30 and 35 ℃ for 48 hr over a range from 15 to 35 ℃. The infective juveniles before storage were best for infection of 5 th instar larvae of S. litura, causing 93 % larval mortality, and an LT 50 value of 29. 1 hr; however, the mortality declined to 36. 7 % as prolonged the storage time up to 90 days at room temperature. Incubation of IJs in a solution over a pH values ranging from 2 to 12 showed that the nematode survival was only 44 % at pH 2 for 12 hr, and lowered to 1. 8 % after incubating for 14 days. However, the survival maintained 100 % at pH 7 - 12. Assay on compatibility of S. abbasi with 14 chemicals including insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, acaricides, and nematocides did not show any adverse effect on its survival after incubating for 48 hr. 中文摘要…………………………………………………………… 1 英文摘要…………………………………………………………… 3 前言…………………………………………………………………. 5 文獻摘述……………………………………………………………. 7 材料與方法………………………………………………………… 16 結果與討論………………………………………………………… 22 一、 蟲生線蟲的採集………………………………………. 22 二、 蟲生線蟲的鑑定………………………………………. 22 三、 S. abbasi於斜紋夜蛾體內之生活史………………. 23 四、 S. abbasi之致病力測試……………………………… 24 五、 不同溫度下感染斜紋夜蛾之致死率……………… [...] 25 六、 不同溫度下儲存之線蟲對寄主之致死效力………. 26 七、 在 25 ℃下不同儲存時間之IJs對寄主之致死率…………………………………………………… [...] … [...] 27 八、 不同pH對線蟲存活率之影響………………………. 27 九、 不同化學藥劑對線蟲存活率之影響……………… [...] 28 參考文獻…………………………………………………………… [...] 31 圖……………………………………………………………………… 47 表……………………………………………………………………… 52 附件…………………………………………………………………… 5...|$|E
