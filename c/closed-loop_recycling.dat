5000|$|In the 1950s, Coors Porcelain’s {{parent company}} {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} replacing steel beverage cans with aluminum ones, {{as part of a}} <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> system. The effort was the brainchild of W.K. [...] "Bill" [...] Coors, the second son of Adolph II. [...] A Porcelain warehouse at the corner of Ninth St and Washington Ave in Golden was selected to house the pilot plant for the aluminum can line. [...] The first aluminum beer can was produced at the site in January, 1959. The <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> program was initially started in 1960, but the overwhelming public response and lack of recycling infrastructure delayed its complete implementation. In 1970, Coors resumed their ambitious and aggressive program called [...] "Cash for Cans", which operated throughout Coors' 11-state marketing area offering a penny a can. Coors success with the aluminum industry was a critical breakthrough in the development of America's recycling market and collection infrastructure. B.L. [...] "Bob" [...] Mornin, a ceramic engineer at Coors Porcelain since 1954, was appointed manager of can production in 1963, and led it to profitability. [...] The can operation eventually outgrew the Porcelain building and moved into its present location east of the brewery in 1966. [...] Coors Brewing Company reorganized its can operations into a joint venture with the Ball Corporation in 2002, known as Rocky Mountain Metal Container LLC. CoorsTek began developing hot-pressed SiC-whisker-reinforced Al2O3 ceramic tooling for beverage can machinery in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2016, the California State Water Resources Control Board {{published}} a report for public comment entitled, [...] "Investigation on the Feasibility of Developing Uniform Water Recycling Criteria for Direct Potable Reuse". Among many other points, this report clearly states {{that there is}} no established and reliable technology to even measure these 'constituents of emerging concern' collectively, as opposed to one by one with expensive techniques, and they cannot be effectively monitored via Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), or Total Organic Carbon (TOC).A better alternative to preemptively highly treating all water in case of contaminants for use in the drinking water supply may be to have a dual piping system, in which gray and black water are kept separate from the initial point of disposal to the treatment phase and the treated blackwater is used for non-potable reuses, as it is more likely to have higher concentrations of the potentially more harmful contaminants, while the treated graywater can be used for more sensitive purposes. For example, the blackwater from toilets can be kept separate, be treated {{to the point that it}} no longer has odor, color or pathogens, and be reused to flush the same toilets indefinitely, in a closed-loop system, remembering that no one touches or consumes the water in the toilet bowl. Other <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> systems would also be entirely feasible, for example in laundries and car washes. This requires costly new infrastructure, but it will pay for itself via savings in water and health. The general consensus is that new infrastructure will be required regardless moving into the next few decades.|$|E

40|$|Disinfection is a {{component}} of an ALS <b>closed-loop</b> water <b>recycling</b> and purification system for long-term space missions. A proposed means of disinfection involves primary disinfection by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and residual (secondary) disinfection by iodine. The effectiveness of UV disinfection is governed by the UV dose to which microorganisms are exposed. The UV dose {{is defined as the}} product of UV radiation intensity and exposure time (I?t). In a continuous-flow system, microorganisms will experience a broad range of local radiation intensities and exposure times; therefore, these systems will deliver a distribution of doses. The ability to accurately estimate the dose distribution delivered by an operating UV system is a critical aspect of its design. For this research, the flow field and particle trajectories in a UV reactor were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The UV radiation intensity field was computed using a numerical method known as line-source integration (LSI).

The modified method comprised of a resin dispensing unit, static mixer and resin impregnation unit; these were incorporated to replace the practice of commonly used resin baths.

We provide a first estimate of the global impact of light-weighting by material substitution on GHG emissions from {{passenger cars}} and the steel and aluminum industries until 2050. We develop a dynamic stock model of the global car fleet and combine it with a dynamic MFA of the associated steel, aluminum, and energy supply industries. We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at different rates over the period 2010 − 2050. We show that light-weighting of passenger cars can become a “gigaton solution”: Between 2010 and 2050, persistent light-weighting of passenger cars can, under optimal conditions, lead to cumulative GHG emissions savings of 9 − 18 gigatons CO 2 -eq compared to development business-as-usual. Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: <b>closed-loop</b> metal <b>recycling</b> in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4 − 6 gigatons CO 2 -eq.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of protecting solar system objects from harmful contamination {{resulting from the}} activities of interplanetary spacecraft, and of similarly protecting the Earth from uncontrolled release of a putative extra-terrestrial organism from returned extra-terrestrial samples, is called planetary protection. Planetary protection requirements for robotic exploration of Mars have been refined over time as more became understood {{about the nature of}} the Martian environment as a potential habitat.

The emergy balance is written under {{the form of a}} discrete-time equation following a comparable approach to the Lagrangian particle tracking in fluid mechanics. Two material losses were taken into consideration, the first one at the level of treatment (collection, dismantling, recycling etc.) and the second one at the transformation level. As expected, the emergy of a product increases with the number of cycles (after the transformation processes). To assess the environmental stress at each recycling stage, relative emergy of the product Delta E-p(n) was used after discussing the limitation of others solutions like the environmental loading ratio (ELR) or the recycle benefit ratio (RBR) which are not suitable for use in the cases of multiple recycling analysis. The values obtained showed that the Delta E-p(n) has an increasing trend for successive recycles. Additionally, this approach allowed the study of different cases of theoretical <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> and an application on aluminum. The results indicated that the several cycles in the first stage of recycling have a significant impact, and an asymptotic behavior of Delta E-p(n) can be noted. In any cases recycling remains a better option compared to raw material use to compensate the material losses. Furthermore, the presented equations illustrate the impact of the material recycle rate and the percentage of losses during the both recycling and transformation processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractSubstantial {{amounts of}} {{post-consumer}} scrap are exported to other regions or lost during recovery and remelting, and both export and losses pose a constraint to desires for having regionally closed material cycles. To quantify {{the challenges and}} trade-offs associated with <b>closed-loop</b> metal <b>recycling,</b> {{we looked at the}} material cycles {{from the perspective of a}} single material unit and trace a unit of material through several product life cycles. Focusing on steel, we used current process parameters, loss rates, and trade patterns of the steel cycle to study how steel that was originally contained in high quality applications such as machinery or vehicles with stringent purity requirements gets subsequently distributed across different regions and product groups such as building and construction with less stringent purity requirements. We applied MaTrace Global, a supply-driven multiregional model of steel flows coupled to a dynamic stock model of steel use. We found that, depending on region and product group, up to 95 % of the steel consumed today will leave the use phase of that region until 2100, and that up to 50 % can get lost in obsolete stocks, landfills, or slag piles until 2100. The high losses resulting from business-as-usual scrap recovery and recycling can be reduced, both by diverting postconsumer scrap into long-lived applications such as buildings and by improving the recovery rates in the waste management and remelting industries. Because the lifetimes of high-quality (cold-rolled) steel applications are shorter and remelting occurs more often than for buildings and infrastructure, we found and quantified a tradeoff between low losses and high-quality applications in the steel cycle. Furthermore, we found that with current trade patterns, reduced overall losses will lead to higher fractions of secondary steel being exported to other regions. Current loss rates, product lifetimes, and trade patterns impede the closure of the steel cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} and posterior reuse of organic solvents {{is a very}} important aspect {{to be taken into account}} during the production processes by chemical, petrochemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Organic solvent nanofiltration is becoming more relevant and appears as a very promising way to carry out solute fractionation, concentration and purification, which can be considered exigent separation operations in organic media. Under optimal design conditions, organic solvent nanofiltration can be also an effective unit process to reduce organic solvent consumption by incorporation of <b>closed-loop</b> solvent <b>recycling</b> systems. Usually, single stage organic solvent nanofiltration processes can only be applied to relatively easy separations, so, most of the times, multiple membrane processes have to be integrated to carry out more complex separations. This research group has previous experience with the design of counter current membrane cascades to purify chemicals and has decided to make use of the acquired knowledge to advance in the design of continuous OSN membrane cascades with solvent {{recovery and}} reuse. The purification of an intermediate API precursor in methanol medium has been selected as case study. After the formulation of a valid simulation model for the membrane cascade, the design of the process has been pointed to find the best cascade configuration in terms of sustainable solvent consumption.

Biodegradable trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is innovatively developed to dissolve LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 from the cathode scraps. Operational parameters are optimized {{to obtain a}} lower Al dissolution rate, {{but not at the}} expense of sacrificing other metals. Under the optimal leaching condition of 3. 0 M TCA, 4 vol. % H 2 O 2, a solid to liquid (S/L) ratio of 50 g/L at 60 degrees C for 30 min, the leaching rates of Ni, Co, Mn and Li are 93. 0 %, 91. 8 %, 89. 8 % and 99. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the potential use of recycled glass fibre composite materials as a replacement for virgin reinforcing materials in new thermoset composites. Specifically the <b>closed-loop</b> mechanical <b>recycling</b> of composites used heavily in the automotive sector known as dough and sheet moulding composites, DMC and SMC respectively, are investigated. The recycling of glass reinforced thermoset polymer composite materials has been an area of investigation for many years and composites used in the automotive industry are of particular interest due to legislative and social pressures on the industry. The mechanical recycling process and then collection of useful fibrous grades of recycled materials, recyclate, by a novel air separation technique were investigated first. The properties of these recyclate fibres were characterised and compared directly with the properties of virgin glass fibres they were to be used to replace. Single fibre tensile tests were employed to compare the strengths of the fibres and single fibre pull-out tests were used to investigate the strength of the interface between the fibres and a polyester matrix. These tests showed the recyclate fibres to be weaker and have a poorer interface with the polyester matrix than the virgin glass fibres. Understanding the properties of the recyclate materials meant their reformulation into new composites could be carefully considered for the production of new high performance materials. Two grades of the collected recyclate materials were then reformulated in to new DMC and SMC composites, replacing percentages of the virgin glass fibre reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured composites were characterised throughout for direct comparison against one another and an unmodified control material, using both three-point flexural tests and Charpy impact tests. Through the modification of existing manufacturing techniques and the development of novel production equipment it has been possible to successfully manufacture both DMC and SMC composites with the recyclate materials used to replace virgin glass fibres. Virgin glass fibres have successfully been replaced by recyclate materials without disrupting standard production techniques and with minimal reduction of the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. As the loadings of recyclate materials used were greatly increased both the flexural and impact strengths were significantly degraded and it was found that chemical modification of the composite could be used to improve these formulations. It has been shown that the recyclate materials should be considered and treated as a distinct reinforcing ingredient, separately from the remaining virgin glass fibres.

40|$|A {{survey of}} very {{small-scale}} homestead gardens in three Javanese provinces {{was conducted to}} analyze the potential beneficial effects on household’s quality of life. Aspects included: (1) diet and nutrition, (2) income, (3) level of goods and material assets, (4) family status, (5) credit access, and (6) {{the role of women}} in managing production and marketing. The survey encompassed sites on West, Central and East Java, representing a range of agro-ecological zones, watersheds (6), elevations, socio-cultural conditions and development stages. The plot sizes evaluated ranged from < 120 m 2 with no other agricultural land (OAL) to 120 - 400 m 2 with < 1, 000 m 2 OAL. The average household plot size was about 240 m 2 (with open space of at least 140 m 2) and OAL of 500 m 2. Around 5. 7 % of the sample villages were, by national standards, considered to be at an advanced development state, with 82. 9 % at a medium state, and with the rest least developed. On average, very small homestead plots reduced food expenses by 9. 9 %. Nutritional benefits are primarily in the form of vitamin A and C – providing 2. 4 % and 23. 6 % of recommended dietary allowance (RDA), respectively and only 1. 9 % of either carbohydrates or protein. As contribution to total household income, average homestead output provides about 11 % of total farm income, about 80 % of which was derived from animal products such as chicken, eggs, fish and meat. As expected, plot size and value of household assets appear closely correlated and increase based on access to other agricultural land. About 55 % of the households feel that social status would decline if the household lost access to their homestead land. The need for credit access is especially critical for the smallest lot owners. Women play the most important role in plot maintenance and plant-, animal- and fish production, and also manage family expenses for food, clothes, child health care and education. It appears that their role is less significant in managing family debt, and the purchase of agricultural inputs or other family expenditures. Overall, homestead gardens also perform an important social function. They help establish family and territorial identity, and facilitate neighborhood cohesion and beneficial communal interaction. It is suggested that agrarian reform programs that includes the distribution of land to landless people and small-scale homestead farms should be carried out in relation to the prevailing agro-ecological conditions and associated land carrying capacity and productivity ratings. Overall, such initiative should be within the framework of sustainable community development projects and well-defined regional economic development strategies. A minimum household plot size (e. g. 400 m 2) should be defined to accommodate an acceptable, future standard of living. This may be accomplished uniquely at the individual household level based on household ownership of plots, or possibly in combination with larger-scale communal garden systems with shared titles, individual plots and with associated benefits of economies of scale by reducing costs of capital-, material- and mechanized inputs, and value chain development that includes post-harvest storage, processing, packaging and marketing. Experience indicates that there is significant benefit in integrating diverse production system, such as food and cash crops, animal and fish production, especially in a <b>closed-loop</b> nutrient <b>recycling</b> system in combination with organic farming. Coupling agricultural with non-farm activities, including value-added enterprises, would provide for increased economic stability and potentially, and higher household revenues. In this approach, micro credit access assistance and the role of adaptive species selection, cooperative input acquisition, processing and marketing should be considered together with access to effective rural extension services. Research findings also show that some pekarangan owners have access to additional land cultivated to support household needs, and that this may be an important factor in land use intensification and the provision of sustainable income levels...|$|R

In order to stimulate and push for the green transitioning in the construction industry in Europe, the European Commission issued the Green Public Procurement policy to motivate manufacturers of building products to develop green products and technologies. As a gesture of support, many member states quickly issued their own GPP policies which are more tailored for their specific situations. However, many challenges stand in the way toward fully implementation, and one of which is the shortage of qualified suppliers. Many existing literatures elaborate on the possibility of solving this challenge from the perspective of public authorities. This research, however, looks at this challenge from a different angle, the perspective of manufacturers of building products. This research studies into the flooring industry and intends to develop some suggestions for manufacturers who plan to develop green products based on the successful experiences of some frontrunners. To realize this objective, research questions are developed in this study: 1) What are the GPP requirements for flooring products in public construction projects and how are they evaluated? 2) What are the enablers and barriers during the development of green products? How do these factors get influenced by GPP policy? 3) Given the enablers and barriers, how can manufacturers of building products adjust their product development strategies to meet GPP criteria? What green attributes should be emphasized on during green product development? A literature review was conducted to find answers for the first research question. The EU GPP criteria are made for general terms of building products with no specification for each category. Two sets of criteria are contained in the EU GPP criteria, the core criteria and the comprehensive criteria which are built on the former. The main requirements of the core criteria are that products compete for public tenders should either be eco-labeled or provide detailed LCA reports to prove their environmental performance during life cycles, and if the products are wooden based, then the wooden materials are supposed to be responsibly sourced. The comprehensive criteria, based on the core criteria, add two more requirements regarding the recyclability of the products and the amount of recycled materials that should be contained in the products. In public tenders, the core criteria work as selection criteria for the qualification of suppliers, while the comprehensive criteria act as award criteria. Apart from the general EU GPP criteria, eco-label criteria can also be used as evaluation references. The eco-label criteria, comparing to the EU GPP criteria, are more detailed and specified. Three subgroups for the flooring products are made by the eco-label criteria, namely hard flooring, textile flooring, and wooden flooring. These criteria consider every stage and aspect in the life cycle of products, and only products fulfill all of them get to wear the labels. Case studies were conducted to research into question 2 and 3. Three frontrunner companies in the flooring industry who have successful experiences in marketing green products were interviewed, in order to identify the enabler and barriers of green product development process as well as some recognizable green product attributes. Main findings on enablers and barriers are listed Table A. As for the influence of the GPP policy, interviewees claimed it to be limited, mostly because they developed green products before or along with the development of the GPP policy. Enablers: 1) Motivations: concern for the sustainable development of the company; concern for the competitiveness of products; concern for the image of the company; market requirement. 2) Success factors: partnership; in-house knowledge base; government subsidies. Barriers: 1) worries about future uncertainty: high price perception of customers; low functional performance perception of customers; future uncertainty (policy change, market requirement change, etc.). 2) Practical difficulties: difficult to sell at competitive prices; development cost; need for extra knowledge and expertise; loss of government subsidies; stringent public scrutiny. Some of the most mentioned green product attributes by the interviewees are: - Toxin-free raw materials - Containment of recycled contents in products - Recyclability of products - Reduction of production wastes - Use of renewable energies - <b>Closed-loop</b> water <b>recycling</b> systems. Based on these findings, some recommendations are given for manufacturers of flooring products who plan to develop their own green products in the near future: For enablers: - Bring the plan of developing green products up to schedule to meet future market demand. - Build stable and cooperative relationships with main raw material suppliers and lead clients. - Start to cultivate in-house knowledge base for green product development. - Look out for government subsidy plans, and build project based on that. For barriers: - Consider long tern return on investment when setting prices for green products. - Try various ways to gather the initial investment, such as loan, partner investment, government subsidies, etc. - When choosing what green certificates to apply, consider the zone of influence of the certificates and the market area and supplying sector of the focal company. For green attributes: - Use toxin-free materials in the products. If greener alternative is not available yet, then keeping the toxic materials below safe limits is necessary. - Contain certain amount of recycled materials in the products. - The design of the products should enable recycling. - LCA assessment report shall be provided. - Use green packaging. - Use renewable energy in production. If not possible, then energy saving plans shall be applied. - Consider using water in closed loops. If not possible, then waste water should be processed before discharging to keep certain materials below required limits. - Consider reutilizing production wastes and by products.

Very few such materials are reconstituted and applied in new products at the same material inherent quality level as in their first lifetime – {{a process known as}} “closed-loop recycling”. In general, industrial society maintains an extract, expend, expel modus operandi despite demonstrated “loop closure” feasibility for a significant number of materials. This thesis builds from a foundation in Industrial Ecology, a field prescribing to an ecological metaphor for how paradigmatic change might take place towards closure of material-energy cycles. It utilises three detailed case studies of loop closure work to develop a conceptual framework describing behaviour of industrial actors when faced with the opportunity, or need, to innovate for material cycle closure. This work helps answer questions about why work towards closure for “promising” material cycles may not be progressing, where key barriers lie, and how measures might be implemented to encourage the evolution of industrial conduct towards more widespread <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper aims to {{establish}} a technique for recycling concrete easily {{in view of the}} essential solution toward establishing <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> society. In establishing recycle-oriented concrete industry, the current recycle process, requiring a high-level modification technique such as heating and rubbing, still includes many problems, e. g., energy-reduction cost-saving and fine powder treatment. The recycling system of concrete structure is being significantly improved under the emphasis on more enhanced environmental consciousness. Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) have been developed to put recycled concrete aggregate into practical use. The technique introduced in this study enables the improvement of recovery rate of original aggregate by enhancing a peeling-off effect of aggregate without damaging any mechanical properties. The enhanced peeling-off effect is realized by applying a surface improving agent to aggregate. In addition, high water absorption of recycled aggregate is also reduced. In this paper, material tests were conducted on recycled aggregates with low quality and middle quality. In the test, two types of surface improving agent, oil-type and silane-type, were used. The test results have shown that the recycled aggregate finished with silane-type improving agen...|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom {{collects}} more {{container glass}} through its recycling program {{than can be}} returned to <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling.</b> This imbalance is particularly acute for pubglass (wine and beer bottles). Commingled glass (mixed clear, green and brown container glass) needs sorting by colour, and this limits its applicability. There {{is a need to}} find secondary uses for commingled waste glass on a large scale. A novel material, TinGlass Concrete (TGC), is proposed for partial replacement of concrete by waste glass cullet of any colour, impurity and granules’ size, by using the concept of Tin Glass Construction Unit (TGCU). The TGCU is an innovative product patented at the University of Brighton comprising mixed glass cullet fused in a tin-plated steel can. The steel can forms a permanent fused-on mould; it can be sourced from waste stream. It is proposed to use TGCUs in precast concrete by embedding them into concrete elements, cubes and beams, during casting. To establish how well TGC could reproduce properties of conventional concrete, a series of tests in compression and flexure have been performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the reactive extrusion technique was investigated for poly(ethylene terephthalate) to promote the concept of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling,</b> that is, the reuse of waste material in the initial application. More specifically, a chain-extender system, consisting of pyromellitic dianhydride, polyol, and a catalyst, was employed, and its efficiency regarding {{the improvement of the}} recyclate quality was evaluated. Accordingly, rheological and thermal characterizations were performed and used as criteria of the modification induced in the polymer molecular structure during processing due to the counteracting degradation and chain-extension reactions. In particular, the molecular weight, related to intrinsic viscosity and melt flow rate measurements, of modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) samples was found to increase with the additive content. Simultaneously, a decrease in the crystallinity was observed, attributed to the branching effect of the chain extender, which restricted the ability of the macromolecules to organize in the crystal structure. Beyond a critical concentration of the additive system, the molecular weight of the treated samples started to decrease again, and this was accompanied by a small increase in the crystallinity.

40|$|The ISO {{standard}} 14044 specifies {{some general}} rules {{to deal with}} end of life recovery processes and related secondary material and energy production in LCA studies. However, different competing approaches have been adopted by existing guidelines and methods for environmental assessment of products. This paper aims at analysing and comparing different formulae prescribed in recent technical standards: ISO/TS 14067, Recommendation 2013 / 179 /EU, and International EPD System. Additionally, the “Integrated formula” advanced by Wolf and Chomkhamsri (2014) has been evaluated. In order {{to carry out a}} systematic comparison between these selected modelling approaches, equations from the original sources have been re-expressed using a common terminology defined in the Materials and methods section. Then, all of these methods are judged based on a set of ten criteria, such as applicability in case of open-loop and <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> situations, intuitiveness, practicability. According to this analysis, the ISO technical standard 14067 seems to be the most appropriate to handle recycling/re-use and energy recovery processes, as well the “Integrated formula” proposed by Wolf and Chomkhamsri...|$|E
40|$|The {{steering}} of wastes {{into the}} separate collection systems, {{the achievement of}} quantitative and qualitative recycling targets, and the fulfilment of producer responsibility obligations are the three key monitoring objectives {{with respect to the}} recycling of long-lived technical products. Concerning end-of-life vehicles, individual registration of cars by a vehicle registration number (VIN) provides an optimum potential for a thorough monitoring of numbers which is utilised in some parts of Europe already today. The necessary data required for the monitoring of quantitative recycling targets are routinely generated by various actors, but in Germany a framework for their central registration and evaluation will have to be established. Whether or not the quantitative recycling targets are achieved depends largely on the definition of system boundaries which are still subject to debate. Some first proposals are made for a monitoring of the fulfilment of producer responsibility obligations, focussing on indicators for improved design and material <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling.</b> (orig.)

40|$|In many {{countries}} {{a large part}} of the building stock will have to be maintained, renovated, rehabilitated or even removed in the next few decades. Although profitability will be one of the major requirements to be met when these works are carried out, there will be more and more emphasis on the environmental requirements to be respected. To make the modernization of the building stock more efficient, dismantling with the aim of producing high quality recycling materials at reasonable costs is a promising approach. This paper presents an integrated approach to deconstruction site management that focuses on both economic and environmental goals. As a first step, material flow management aims at the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> of various construction materials. In a second step, resource constrained project planning models are used to evaluate strategies for optimized deconstruction site management. The approach offers high flexibility and can be adapted readily to different conditions. Results show that time and cost for deconstruction can be reduced by more than 50 %, together with recycling quotas of more than 90 %. Even when resources are strictly limited or when strong budget and time restrictions have to be respected, tremendous improvements in deconstruction site management can be achieved.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, waste {{management}} strategies are shifting from waste disposal to recycling andrecovery and are considering waste as a potential new resource. To monitor the progress in these waste management strategies, governmental policies have developed {{a wide range of}} indicators. In this study, we analyzed the concept of the recyclability benefit rate indicator, which expresses the potential environmental savings that can be achieved from recycling the product over the environmental burdens of virgin production followed by disposal. This indicator is therefore, based on estimated environmental impact values obtained through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practices. We quantify the environmental impact in terms of resource consumption using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment method. This research applied this indicator to two cases of plastic waste recycling in Flanders: <b>closed-loop</b> <b>recycling</b> (case A) and open-loop recycling (case B). Each case is compared to an inciner-ation scenario and a landfilling scenario. The considered plastic waste originates from small domestic appliances and household waste other than plastic bottles. However, the existing recyclability benefit rate indicator does not consider the potential substitution of different materials occurring in open-loop recycling. To address this issue, we further developed the indicator for open-loop recycling and cascaded use. Overall, the results show that both closed-loop and open-loop recycling are more resource efficient than landfilling and incineration with energy recovery. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
