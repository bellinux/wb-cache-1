40|$|Composites of wind speeds, {{equivalent}} potential temperature, mean {{sea level}} pressure, vertical velocity, and relative humidity have been produced for the 100 most intense extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere winter for the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) and the high resolution global environment model (HiGEM). Features of conceptual models of cyclone structure—the warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> and <b>dry</b> intrusion—have been identified in the composites from ERA- 40 and compared to HiGEM. Such features can be identified in the composite fields despite the smoothing that occurs in the compositing process. The surface features and the three-dimensional structure of the cyclones in HiGEM compare very well with those from ERA- 40. The warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> is identified in the temperature and wind fields as a mass of warm air undergoing moist isentropic uplift and is very similar in ERA- 40 and HiGEM. The rate of ascent is lower in HiGEM, associated with a shallower slope of the moist isentropes in the warm sector. There are also differences in the relative humidity fields in the warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> In ERA- 40, the high values of relative humidity are strongly associated with the moist isentropic uplift, whereas in HiGEM these are not so strongly associated. The cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> is identified as rearward flowing air that undercuts the warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> and produces a low-level jet, and is very similar in HiGEM and ERA- 40. The dry intrusion is identified in the 500 -hPa vertical velocity and relative humidity. The structure of the dry intrusion compares well between HiGEM and ERA- 40 but the descent is weaker in HiGEM because of weaker along-isentrope flow behind the composite cyclone. HiGEM’s ability to represent the key features of extratropical cyclone structure can give confidence in future predictions from this model. ...|$|R

In this system, purees or juices prepared from fruits, vegetables, or herbs dry in short times, typically 3 – 5 min, resulting in products with excellent color, vitamin, and antioxidant retention. The RW drying systems are simple and relatively inexpensive when compared with freeze drying, which usually needs large installations to be economical. In RW drying systems thermal energy is transferred from hot water to a film of puree or juice spread thinly on a plastic <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> These <b>drying</b> systems operate at atmospheric pressure and are used for com-mercial production of scrambled egg mix, avocado powder, high carotenoid-containing algae, herbal extracts and human nutrition supplements, and food ingredients, as well as dried fruits and vege-tables.

40|$|Extratropical cyclone lifecycles {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{with the aim of}} understanding the dynamical mechanisms involved in their development. Previous work has often been based on subjective analysis of individual case studies. Such case studies have contributed heavily to the generation of conceptual models of extratropical cyclones that provide a framework for understanding the dynamical evolution of cyclones. These conceptual models are widely used in educational meteorology courses throughout the world to illustrate the basic structure and evolution of extratropical cyclones. This article presents a database of extratropical cyclone composites which highlight the average structure and evolution of 20 years of extratropical cyclones, as opposed to individual case studies. The composite fields are achieved by combining a database containing cyclone tracks from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1989 - 2009, 6 hourly) with the full 3 D ERA-Interim reanalysis fields. Vertical and horizontal composites of cyclone structure for cyclones generated in the Atlantic and Pacific regions identifying features such as the relative positions of cold, warm and occluded fronts and their associated wind and cloud patterns are shown. In addition the evolution of cyclonic flows such as the warm and cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> and <b>dry</b> intrusion are illustrated.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and analyzes the three-dimensional dynamical structure of intense Mediterranean cyclones. The analysis {{is based on}} a composite approach of the 200 most intense cyclones during the period 1989 - 2008 that have been identified and tracked using the output of a coupled ocean-atmosphere regional simulation with 20 km horizontal grid spacing and 3 -hourly output. It is shown that the most intense Mediterranean cyclones have a common baroclinic life cycle with a potential vorticity (PV) streamer associated with an upper-level cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which precedes cyclogenesis in the region and triggers baroclinic instability. It is argued that this common baroclinic life cycle is due to the strongly horizontally sheared environment in the Mediterranean basin, on the poleward flank of the quasi-persistent subtropical jet. The composite life cycle of the cyclones is further analyzed considering the evolution of key atmospheric elements as potential temperature and PV, as well as the cyclones' thermodynamic profiles and rainfall. It is shown that most intense Mediterranean cyclones are associated with warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> and <b>dry</b> air intrusions, similar to those of other strong extratropical cyclones, but of rather small scale. Before cyclones reach their mature stage, the streamer's role is crucial to advect moist and warm air towards the cyclones center. These dynamical characteristics, typical for very intense extratropical cyclones in the main storm track regions, are also valid for these Mediterranean cases that have features that are visually similar to tropical cyclones...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} a clear impact of aerosol {{particles}} on the radiation balance, whether and how aerosol particles influence precipitation is controversial. Here we use the ECHAM 6 -HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i. e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> have been identified separately in 10 -year ECHAM 6 -HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are strongly polluted (i. e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. However, all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories...|$|R
