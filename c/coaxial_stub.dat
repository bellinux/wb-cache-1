50|$|Allison {{adopted a}} reverse-airflow engine {{configuration}} for the Model 250: although air enters the intake/compression {{system in the}} conventional fashion, the compressed air leaving the centrifugal compressor diffuser is ducted rearwards around the turbine system, before being turned through 180 degrees at entry to the combustor. The combustion products expand through the two-stage (single-stage on early engines) high-pressure turbine section, which {{is connected to the}} compressor via the HP shaft. The combustion products continue to expand through the two-stage power turbine which generates shaft horsepower for the aircraft. A <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> shaft connects the power turbine to a compact reduction gearbox, located inboard, between the centrifugal compressor and the exhaust/power turbine system. The exhaust stream then turn through 90 degrees to exit the engine in a radial direction through twin exhaust ducts, which form a V-shape in elevation. An important design feature of the Model 250 engine is its modular construction which greatly simplifies maintenance and repair activity. Also the unique reverse-flow design provides for ease of hot section maintenance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{straightforward}} method of extensive modeling of a lossy stub resonator system for online fingerprinting of fluids {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed model solves the telegrapher's equations including the skin effect and dielectric losses and describes the amplitude versus frequency response of lossy <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> resonators with a fluid under investigation as dielectric. The adequacy of the method is demonstrated by comparing simulations with experimentally obtained data. Even though we applied the model to a <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> resonator for the online fingerprinting of fluids (e. g., for water quality monitoring), the potential applicability of the method reaches further. Indeed, the method introduced here may be useful for different types of sensors based on lossy transmission line theory...|$|E

This radio-frequency spectroscopy method is based on <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> technology and comprises quarter wave length open-ended resonators that are filled with a liquid sample as dielectric between inner and outer conductor. Changes in the dielectric properties of the liquid sample result in changes in the electric properties of the resonator, e. g., its resonance frequency and quality factor. In addition to a batch resonator, results obtained with a flow-through resonator indicate that the concept can be further developed into a cost-efficient and low-maintenance sensor for the on-line fingerprinting of the dielectric properties of fluids, such as drinking or waste water. ethanol and glycerol...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an application of}} a unique antenna reconfiguration mechanism that exploits the bi-directional, pressure-driven flow of electromagnetically functionalized colloidal dispersions (EFCDs) through a <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> microfluidic impedance transformer (COSMIX). The COSMIX used in this work has one coaxial RF port that connects to the antenna and two fluid ports (inlet and outlet); the coaxial structure is electrically capped {{at the end and}} terminated by an open circuit (recessed inner conductor). The COSMIX provides a wide range of reactive tuning by adjusting the volume fraction of colloidal material in the EFCD. As an integrated mechanism in a microstrip patch reflectarray element, this translates to more than a full cycle of phase shift with nominal losses. Simulated and measured results of a COSMIX using an EFCD composed of 400 nm colloidal barium strontium titanate dispersed in low-loss silicon oil, and its integrated performance with reconfigurable-phase reflectarray element, are presented for a 3 GHz design of microstrip patch reflectarray element. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHere we {{demonstrate}} the proof-of-principle that a <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> resonator {{can be used}} to detect early stages of biofilm formation. After promising field tests using a stub resonator with a stainless steel inner conductor as sensitive element, the sensitivity of the system was improved by using a resonator of shorter physical length, implying higher resonance frequencies (and by that a higher frequency range of operation) and improved sensitivity towards dispersion. In addition, the space between inner and outer conductor was filled up with glass beads, thereby exploiting the larger surface area available for biofilm formation. Analysis of the biofilm and the stub resonator signal, both as function of time, indicates that the sensor allows detection of early stages of biofilm formation. In addition, the sensor signal clearly discriminates between the first stages of biofilm formation (characterized by separated, individual spots of bacterial growth on the glass beads) and the presence of a nearly homogeneous biofilm later on in time. Model simulations based on the transmission line theory predict a shift of the sensor response in the same direction and order of magnitude as observed in the biofouling experiments, thereby confirming the operating principle of the sensor...|$|E
40|$|Stub {{resonators}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the dielectric properties of fluids. The resonance frequencies, determined from the amplitude versus frequency (AF) response of such resonators, are mainly determined by the permittivity of the fluid while damping arises from dielectric losses. Even though this methodology has been extensively reported in the literature, without almost any exception these studies refer to (near) ideal behavior regarding for example, geometry and negligibly low conductivity of the fluid studied. Online stub resonator-based sensors (i. e., flow-through) in use for industrial applications, however, quite often suffer from high dielectric losses, non-ideal material choice of the conductors from an electrical point of view and unconventional resonator geometry. Therefore, in order to ensure correct data interpretation, a straightforward model accounting for the effects of dielectric losses, conductor losses (skin effect) and impedance mismatches on the AF response is highly desirable. In addition, such a model can help to optimize future sensor designs. Here, we present a lumped parameter model, essentially based on telegrapher's equations, that accounts for the skin effect, dielectric losses and impedance mismatches between the transmission lines to the resonator and the resonator respectively. The adequacy of the method, even in the case of impedance mismatch, is demonstrated by comparing these model simulations with experimentally obtained AF curves for both flow-through <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> resonators and microstrip resonators immersed in the fluid under investigatio...|$|E
40|$|Communication and {{reconnaissance}} {{systems are}} requiring increasing flexibility concerning functionality and efficiency for multiband and broadband frequency applications. Circuit-based reconfiguration mechanisms continue to promote radio frequency (RF) application flexibility; however, increasing limitations {{have resulted in}} hindering performance. Therefore, {{the implementation of a}} "wireless" reconfiguration mechanism provides the required agility and amicability for microwave circuits and antennas without local overhead. The wireless reconfiguration mechanism in this thesis integrates dynamic, fluidic-based material systems to achieve electromagnetic agility and reduce the need for "wired" reconfiguration technologies. The dynamic material system component has become known as electromagnetically functionalized colloidal dispersions (EFCDs). In a microfluidic reconfiguration system, they provide electromagnetic agility by altering the colloidal volume fraction of EFCDs - their name highlights the special considerations we give to material systems in applied electromagnetics towards lowering loss and reducing system complexity. Utilizing EFCDs at the RF device-level produced the first circuit-type integration of this reconfiguration system; this is identified as the <b>coaxial</b> <b>stub</b> microfluidic impedance transformer (COSMIX). The COSMIX is a small hollowed segment of transmission line with results showing a full reactive loop (capacitive to inductive tuning) around the Smith chart over a 1. 2 GHz bandwidth. A second microfluidic application demonstrates a novel antenna reconfiguration mechanism for a 3 GHz microstrip patch antenna. Results showed a 300 MHz downward frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Magnetic material produced a 40 MHz frequency shift. The final application demonstrates the dynamically altering microfluidic system for a 3 GHz 1 x 2 array of linearly polarized microstrip patch antennas. The parallel microfluidic capillaries were imbedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Both E- and H-plane designs showed a 250 MHz frequency shift by dielectric colloidal dispersions. Results showed a strong correlation between decreasing electrical length of the elements and an increase of the volume fraction, causing frequency to decrease and mutual coupling to increase. Measured, modeled, and analytical results for impedance, voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), and radiation behavior (where applicable) are provided...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the design, theory, and measurement of a phase-reconfigurable reflectarray (RA) element for beamforming applications enabled by fluidic networks and colloidal dispersions. The element is a linearly polarized microstrip patch antenna loaded with a <b>Coaxial</b> <b>Stub</b> Microfluidic Impedance Transformer (COSMIX). Specifically, adjusting {{the concentration of}} highly dielectric particulate in the dispersion provides localized permittivity manipulation within the COSMIX. This results in variable impedance load on the patch and ultimately continuous, low-loss phase control of a signal reflected from the patch. Different aspects of design, modeling, and measurement are discussed for a proof-of-concept prototype and three further iterations. Initial measurements with manual injections of materials into a fabricated proof-of-concept demonstrate up to 200 degrees of phase shift and a return loss of less than 1. 2 dB at the operating frequency of 3 GHz. The next design iteration addresses fabrication challenges as well the general cumbersomeness of the proof-of-concept by replacing the static material delivery system with a dynamic closed-loop fluidic network. It also makes use of a design procedure to maximize the phase sensitivity. Measurements demonstrate progressive phase shifts through dilution of the system reservoir; however, the initial measurements with this system are not in line with simulated predictions. Investigations suggest the primary culprit to be inaccurate material data. The dielectric constant of the particulate (colloidal BSTO) was overrated and the loss tangent of the fluid medium (a silicone-based oil) was underrated. After accounting for these issues the measurement a second measurement with the system demonstrates 270 degrees of phase shift with return loss of 9 dB. The next design iteration examines a trade-off between phase sensitivity and reduced losses. The design also features modifications to the fluidic system to allow for layered fabrication in the GND plane as well integration with a 2 -port coaxial measurement cell. Attempted measurements discover the fluidic system cannot flow the higher concentrations of nanoparticles necessary for phase shifting. A final design iteration addresses this challenge by expanding and repositioning inlets to the fluidic system. Free space reflection measurements with this element initially demonstrate phase shifting until a buildup of nanoparticles form within the COSMIX...|$|E
