40|$|The {{need for}} {{specialized}} individuals to manage picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) {{has been recognized}} {{with the creation of}} a new professional title: PACS administrator. This position requires skill sets that bridge the current domains of radiology technologists (RTs), information systems analysts, and radiology administrators. Health care organizations, however, have reported difficfiulty in defining the functions that a PACS administrator should perform—a challenge compounded when the tries to combine this complex set of capabilities into one individual. As part of a larger effort to define the PACS professional, we developed an extensive but not exclusive consensus list of business, technical, and behavioral competencies desirable in the dedicated PACS professional. Through an on-line survey, radiologists, RTs, <b>information</b> technology specialists, <b>corporate</b> <b>information</b> <b>officers,</b> and radiology administrators rated the importance of these competencies. The results of this survey are presented, and the implications for implementation in training and certification efforts are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Governments across Canada face {{a number}} of complex {{challenges}} in supporting the primary or core businesses of government while promoting service delivery transformation through new technologies. Ontario has committed to a customer-centric approach to service delivery, which requires the integration of electronic services across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. A critical part of this service transformation concerns the development and introduction of policies, procedures and technologies that ensure the authentication of all relevant components of an electronic service transaction. The task does not involve just finding and implementing technology to address a need. It also requires a coherent policy framework that is mapped to business processes.

40|$|This draft {{strategy}} provides {{advice on}} the future management and use of information and communications technology by government and how the Victorian Government can design and use information and technology to deliver better services. In June 2012, the Assistant Treasurer established the Victorian Information and Communications Technology Advisory Committee (VICTAC) and tasked it with overseeing {{the development of a}} Victorian Government ICT strategy. The committee is led by an independent chair and includes representatives from the Victorian Government, the ICT industry, and <b>corporate</b> Chief <b>Information</b> <b>Officers</b> (CIOs). In the development of this draft, VICTAC has sought feedback from within Government and from external advisors, industry stakeholders, and now the public. The strategy is a work in progress. The proposed actions, in particular will be further refined. Following the public consultation period, feedback will be reviewed and incorporated. The strategy will be presented to Government by December 2012. The finalisation of the strategy is {{the first in a series}} of steps to improve ICT management and use. An implementation phase will follow and be supported by a more detailed implementation plan, necessary governance and organisational structures, funding and ongoing measurement and reporting. VICTAC and Government are well aware of the implementation challenges, and will be considering these over the coming months. The strategy will be reviewed annually in a cycle of continuous improvement...|$|R

40|$|In 1971, {{scientist}} Ray Tomlinson sent what is {{now considered}} the first email message. It was considered as “nothing short of revolutionary … deserv[ing] {{a spot in the}} list of great communication inventions such as the printing press, telegraph and telephone” (Festa, 2001). Whereas email was first used exclusively in the military (Arpanet) and in academic circles, it has now become almost ubiquitous, used widely for private, as well as for business correspondence. According to a Berkeley study (Berkeley, 2000), there were approximately 440 million corporate and personal [e-] mailboxes worldwide in 2001, of which more than a third was corporate mailboxes. As a result of the extensive use of email in the <b>corporate</b> environment, <b>Information</b> <b>Officers</b> have to ensure that the use of email adds business value. In an “always on” market place, the efficiency, immediacy and cost effectiveness of email communication are immediately evident. A study by Ferris Research, quoted by Nchor (2001), shows that there is “an overall productivity gain of US$ 9000 per employee as they send and receive emails to get projects done. ” However, the use of email in the corporate envi-ronment also poses business risks that need to be uniquely addressed. Among these “key business risks” (Surfcontrol, 2001) are security risks, viruses, legal liability, pro-ductivity loss and bandwidth abuse. To address the risks mentioned above and to protect the business value of email, spe-cific policies have to be implemented that address email usage. Information Security Policies are defined in most corporate environments. In a study done by Elron Soft-ware (2001), 83 % of respondents who have abused email have company policies regu-lating email usage. There appears to be a gap between policy conception and policy implementation. Various factors inhibit effective policy implementation – ethical, legal and cultural. The implementation of corporate policy becomes especially complex in multinational environments where differing information law Email usage is ubiquitous in the modern business environment, but few companies adequately manage the risks associated with email...|$|R
