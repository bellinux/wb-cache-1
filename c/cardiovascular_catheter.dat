Because of continuing chest pain despite therapy, over a year later she again underwent selective coronary arteriography; a Softip <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>catheter</b> (Angiomedics Inc., Minneapolis) was used without complication. This {{may be the first}} report of use of this catheter after previous iatrogenic coronary artery dissection caused by a more conventional type. It is also the first time that this catheter was employed in the RSA.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] directly related to selective coronary arteriography in 5 patients {{with a history of}} unstable angina pectoris during the period 1975 - 1985 is reported. Four different cardiologists were involved. A feature common to all the cases was the presence of significant ostial stenosis of the left mainstem coronary artery (LMCA); 2 patients had haemodynamically important obstruction of a dominant right coronary artery (RCA) ostium, while 2 others had total occlusion in the proximal part of a dominant RCA. The RCA in the last case was angiographically normal and non-dominant. Collateral coronary blood flow was fairly sparse in most cases and in 4 left ventricular dysfunction of varying degree was present. All patients developed severe hypotension and electromechanical dissociation after arteriography while still in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Resuscitation efforts were uniformly unsuccessful. Autopsy on 1 patient demonstrated extensive obstructive coronary atherosclerosis with a massive acute anterior myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization poses an extremely high risk for this subgroup of patients with LMCA disease, as does selective coronary arteriography. The possible role of catheter-provoked coronary vasospasm of the LMCA is suggested; a recently introduced soft-tipped <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>catheter</b> may be more appropriate in this setting.

40|$|The {{development}} of a one-piece braided model catheter with the same rigidities as the combined medical catheter-guidewire system presently employed during cardiovascular catheterization procedures is the principal goal of this research. This {{will result in a}} significant reduction in the time required to insert a <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>catheter.</b> This is also the first and fundamental step in the {{development of}} optimal rigidity cardiovascular catheters. To begin, the axial, torsional and flexural rigidities of existing medical catheters were reviewed and measured. A model to predict the longitudinal tensile and in-plane shear moduli of 2 D braided structures, needed for the calculations of the axial, torsional and flexural rigidities of braided tubes, was developed. The sensitivity of the model to key constituent and laminar properties was analysed. It was concluded that accurate values of Efl 1, E m and Gm are required for the micromechanical model; the model is not sensitive to the remaining elastic constants (nuf 12, nu f 23, Gfl 2, G 23). Oversized braided (Kevlar 49 fibre and thermoset matrix) engineering model composite structures [...] -or model catheters [...] -have been used to verify the model. These model catheters have been produced on an existing braiding machine. Kevlar 49 fibre and epoxy resin have been used primarily because the laminar mechanical properties have been measured in a previous experimental study by Flanagan and Munro [72]. There was good agreement (approximately 6 %) between the predicted and measured values of the longitudinal elastic modulus of braided tubes which provided confidence in the model. Shear modulus predictions and the range of experimental results also showed reasonable agreement. The results also show that micromechanical models in which accurate values for important elastic constants (Ef 11, Em and G m) are used can accurately predict the experimental results. The preceding experimental work was carried out for full coverage rigid thermoset matrix braided fibre composites. Actual medical catheters require flexible matrix and an open fibre mesh rather than full fibre coverage; therefore, it was necessary to select the appropriate matrix and reinforcement for an actual medical catheter. The proposed CLPT model was used to select the appropriate fibre and resin to obtain rigidities {{similar to those of the}} existing medical catheter-guidewire systems. Laminar elastic constants were estimated using micromechanical models. The proposed CLPT model reasonably predicted the longitudinal elastic and shear moduli of model catheters produced with one of the selected elastomeric resins. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{determined}} {{the incidence of}} and identified risk factors for 48 hour (h) and 30 day (d) postoperative mortality after inpatient operations. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Anesthesiology’s Quality Indicator database as the main data source. The database was queried for data related to the surgical procedure, anesthetic care, perioperative adverse events, and birth/death/operation dates. The 48 h and 30 d cumulative incidence of postoperative mortality was calculated and {{data were analyzed using}} Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test and generalized estimating equations. Results: The 48 h and 30 d incidence of postoperative mortality was 0. 57 % and 2. 1 %, respectively. Higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status scores, extremes of age, emergencies, perioperative adverse events and postoperative Intensive Care Unit admission were identified as risk factors. The use of monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia versus regional or combined anesthesia was a risk factor for 30 d postoperative mortality only.

40|$|There {{are only}} a few risk factors known for primary patency loss in {{patients}} with an arteriovenous graft or fistula. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have investigated the association between arteriovenous access modality and primary patency loss and mortality. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate risk factors for patency loss and to investigate the association between graft versus fistula use and outcomes (patency loss and mortality). We prospectively followed 919 incident hemodialysis patients and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for putative risk factors of primary patency loss using Cox regression. Furthermore, HRs were calculated to study the association between graft versus fistula use and two-year primary patency loss and two-year mortality. <b>Cardiovascular</b> disease, prior <b>catheter</b> use, lowest tertile of albumin, highest tertile of hsCRP, and lowest tertile of fetuin-A were associated with primary patency loss in both patients with grafts and fistulas. Increased age, female sex, and diabetes mellitus were only associated with primary patency loss in patients with a fistula. We did not observe an association between primary patency loss and BMI, residual GFR, levels of calcium, phosphorus, and total cholesterol. Furthermore, graft use as compared with fistula use was associated with an 1. 4 -fold (95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 9) increased risk of primary patency loss and with an 1. 5 -fold(95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 2) increased mortality risk. <b>Cardiovascular</b> disease, prior <b>catheter</b> use, albumin, hsCRP, and fetuin-A are risk factors for patency loss.

40|$|Women with {{important}} cyanotic or uncyanotic, operated or unoperated {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) {{have been shown to}} carry an inherent risk during pregnancy for themselves and for their fetus. Obstetrical and fetal echocardiography has recently been upgraded by new technical developments in ultrasound machines. These improvements have increased the detection rate of congenital malformations and cardiac anomalies which ranged in the past between 4 and 60 % for significant anomalies. Obesity or an unfavourable position of the fetus may, however, obscure the imaging quality and cause limitations to visualise the fetal heart from different angles and thus prevent the detection of anomalies. In addition, several cardiac anomalies develop throughout pregnancy and may not yet be present at an early date of screening. While the risk for a congenital cardiac malformation (CCM) in a normal population is 0. 8 - 1 %, the recurrence rate for CCM increases to 2 to 3 % when a previous child has been affected but will become significantly higher when genetically determined anomalies have affected a family member or when the pregnant woman (5. 8 %) has CHD. The aim of fetal screening in women with CCM is to ascertain normal intrauterine growth, to exclude fetal CHD and/or to ascertain a malformation or arrhythmia which has been suspected during an obstetrical screening. The acquired detailed echocardiographic knowledge of the malformation or arrhythmia allows the explanation of a CCM to the future parents, to present therapeutic options during pregnancy or after birth and to plan delivery in a tertiary center that provides early <b>cardiovascular</b> and/or <b>catheter</b> interventions and disposes of intensive care facilities for affected newborns. Under certain conditions, termination can be discussed in early pregnancy. Very recent publications have shown how important a prenatal diagnosis can become in a new-born with transposition of the great arteries and a very restrictive foramen ovale (Circulation 1999). Therapeutic measures in the fetus have been attempted with very limited success so far; successful life saving treatment does, however, exist for fetal arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Research for new {{biocompatible}} {{and easily}} implantable materials continuously proposes new molecules and new substances with biological, chemical and physical characteristics, {{that are more}} and more adapted to aesthetic and reconstructive surgery and to the development of biomedical devices such as cardiovascular prostheses. Two classes of polymeric biomaterials seem to meet better these requirements: “hydrogels”, which includes polyalkylimide (PAI) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and “elastomers”, which includes polyurethanes (PUs). The first ones in the last decade have had a great application for soft tissue augmentation, due to their similarity to this tissue for their high water content, elasticity and oxygen permeability (Dini et al., 2005). The second ones, on the contrary, are widely used in <b>cardiovascular</b> applications (<b>catheters,</b> vascular grafts, ventricular assist devices, total artificial hearts) due to their good mechanical properties and hemocompatibility (Zdrahala R. J. and Zdrahala I. J., 1999). In the biocompatibility evaluation of these synthetic polymers, that is important for its potential use in clinical applications, a fundamental aspect is the knowledge of the polymers cytotoxicity and the effect of their interaction with cells, in particular with the cell populations involved in the inflammatory responses, i. e. monocyte/macrophages. In consideration of what above said, the aim of this study is the comprehension of the in vitro effect of PAI, PVA and PU on three cell lines that represent three different stages of macrophagic differentiation: U 937 pro-monocytes, THP- 1 monocytes and RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the rate of viability with MTT, Neutral Red and morphological analysis at light microscope in time-course dependent experiments. The influence of these polymers on monocyte/macrophage activation in terms of cells adhesion, monocyte differentiation in macrophages, antigens distribution, aspecific phagocytosis, fluid-phase endocitosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6) and nitric oxide (NO) release was evaluated. In conclusion, our studies have indicated that the three different polymeric biomaterials are highly biocompatible, since they scarcely affected viability of U 937, THP- 1 and RAW 264. 7 cells. Moreover, we have found that even though hydrogels and polyurethane influences monocyte/macrophage differentiation (depending on the particular type of cell and polymer), they are immunocompatible since they not induced significantly high cytokine release. For these reasons their clinical applications are strongly encouraged...|$|R

Human gamma globulin was thiolated for conjugation to the liposomes with N-succinimidyl 3 -(2 -pyridyldithio) propionate. Following reaction, the unbound antibody was removed by separation on a Sepharose 4 B column.

40|$|T he {{drug-eluting}} balloon is {{a promising}} device {{to address the}} unmet needs of the current treatment of <b>cardiovascular</b> disease through <b>catheters.</b> In Europe, drug-eluting balloons from several manufacturers have been approved for use in clinical practice, and abundant evidence on the treatment of both peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease has been published. 1, 2 See page 133 There are three important components in drug-eluting balloon technology. One is the drug, {{the other is the}} balloon catheter, and the last is the excipient that binds the drug to the balloon catheter surface and releases it to the vessel wall. It is a surprising fact that all drug-eluting balloons currently approved in Europe use the same drug (paclitaxel), unlike the situation with drug-eluting stents, as most stents use drugs from the ‘limus family’. Paclitaxel is an antiproliferative and lipo-philic drug, and it is believed that these features allow for rapid infiltration and cell proliferation suppres sion. 3 Considering that sirolimus in drug-eluting stents has a more potent antiproliferative effect than paclitaxel, 4 sirolimus may be beneficially used for local release of the drug in association with the balloon catheter. Both drugs are hydrophobic, and it is natural to expect them to have similar release patterns. Furthermore, it is expected that the excipient will be further improved. This component, perhaps, is the key component of drug-eluting balloons, as the other two components are the same in all balloons, and it may differentiate them regarding their efficiency.
