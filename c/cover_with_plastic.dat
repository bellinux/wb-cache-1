40|$|Hot climate {{concreting}} {{requires that}} some practices {{are used to}} reduce the undesirable effects caused by excessive water evaporation from the concrete surface, which tends to induce plastic shrinkage cracking and thereby reduce durability. This research highlights the effectiveness of different solutions to reduce plastic shrinkage: curing agent, cold water and <b>cover</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> sheet. Two levels fractional factorial array experimental design was used {{to reduce the number}} of tests, and allowed studying both the effect of different factors and interaction between factors. The measured parameters include: plastic shrinkage crack in 10 x 10 x 40 cm specimens, and compressive strength and rate of evaporation. A climatic chamber was used to simulate the hot climate. The results indicate that to minimize the plastic shrinkage the most adequate solution is the application of curing compound followed by the use of a plastic sheet cover. The most effective solution to decrease the evaporation is a plastic film sheet cover...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of different plastic covers on microclimate and cherry tomato yield in greenhouses. The experiments were carried out in Piracicaba, state of São Paulo (Brazil), during three growing periods (2008 / 2009 / 2010). A greenhouse was divided in: Environment I (EI) - <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> film anti-UV and thermo-reflective shading screen, and Environment II (EII) - <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> diffusive <b>plastic</b> film; monitored <b>with</b> automatic weather sensors; and cultivated with cherry tomato (‘Sweet Grape’ and ‘Sweet Million’). Use of diffusive plastic in greenhouses provides a better inside distribution of solar energy without causing major changes in air temperature and relative humidity, resulting in higher yield (kg plant- 1), fruits quantity (number plant- 1) and fruits average weight than those obtained under thermo-reflective shading screen...|$|R
