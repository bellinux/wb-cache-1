Furthermore, lost and delayed ACKs in the reverse route may also cause the source not to receive ACKs in time, which is also regarded as congestive losses on the forward route by the source node.|$|E

It is a significant burden worldwide due to its growing prevalence, comorbidities, and mortality. Complication by bronchial-pulmonary infection causes 50 %– 90 % of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), which may lead to the aggregation of COPD symptoms and the development of acute respiratory failure. Non-invasive or invasive ventilation (IV) is usually implemented to treat acute respiratory failure. However, ventilatory support (mainly IV) should be discarded as soon as possible to prevent the onset of time-dependent complications. To withdraw IV, an optimum timing has to be selected based on weaning assessment and spontaneous breathing trial or replacement of IV by non-IV at pulmonary infection <b>control</b> <b>window.</b> The former method is more suitable for patients with AECOPD without significant bronchial-pulmonary infection while the latter method is more suitable for patients with AECOPD with acute significant bronchial-pulmonary infection.

The geostationary control will only implement in-plane maneuvers (East/West). This means that only the longitude and the radial direction will be controlled, ignoring changes in inclination...|$|E
30|$|The coordinated {{operation}} of controllable loads, such as air-conditioning load, and distributed generation sources in a smart grid environment has drawn significant attention in recent years. To improve the wind power utilization {{level in the}} distribution network and minimize the total system operation costs, this paper proposes a MILP (mixed integer linear programming) based approach to schedule the interruptible air-conditioning loads. In order to mitigate the uncertainties of the stochastic variables including wind power generation, ambient temperature change, and electricity retail price, the rolling horizon optimization (RHO) strategy is employed to continuously update the real-time information and proceed the <b>control</b> <b>window.</b> Moreover, to ensure the thermal comfort of customers, a novel two-parameter thermal model is introduced to calculate the indoor temperature variation more precisely.

In order to show the cost effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, we compare the system operation cost in our system with the situation that all the electricity is bought from external grid. By consuming the local power generation from wind turbines instead of buying electricity from external grid, the cost savings for one day in our system is $ 765.89, which accounts for 31.4 % of original system cost $ 2436.6 (i.e., all the electricity is bought from external grid).|$|E

40|$|The basic {{building}} block of on-chip nanophotonic interconnects is the microring resonator [14], and these resonators change their resonant wavelengths due to variations in temperature- a problem that can be addressed using a technique called ”trimming”, which involves correcting the drift via heating and/or current injection. Thus far system researchers have modeled trimming as a per ring fixed cost. In this work we show that at the system level using a fixed cost model is inappropriate- our simulations demonstrate {{that the cost of}} heating has a non-linear relationship with the number of rings, and also that current injection can lead to thermal runaway. We show that a very narrow Temperature <b>Control</b> <b>Window</b> (TCW) must be maintained in order for the network to work as desired. However, by exploiting the group drift property of co-located rings, it is possible to create a sliding window scheme which can increase the TCW. We also show that partially athermal rings can alleviate but not eliminate the problem. ...|$|E
