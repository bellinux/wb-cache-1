However, with a surplus of income over expenditure, a <b>cy-près</b> <b>scheme</b> was adopted in that year to allow any surplus income {{to be used for}} other charitable purposes benefiting Greater London. These grants are made though the City Bridge Trust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appellate court}} also {{endorsed}} the non zero-sum approach {{adopted by the}} English Court in Varsani v Jesani 1999 Ch 219 (“Varsani”) in exercising its power under s 13(1)(e)(iii) of the Charities Act 1993 (UK / England and Wales) to resolve a religious dispute between two groups of followers of a Hindu sect, each claiming to be adhering to the true faith, {{and it was not}} possible to determine which group had departed from the fundamental tenets of the faith. A <b>cy-pres</b> <b>scheme</b> was settled in Varsani so that the sect’s property was not appropriated to one group to the exclusion of the other as this would be contrary to the spirit in which the gift was made. As s13(1)(e)(iii) of the English Charities Act 1993 is in pari materia with s21(1)(e)(iii) of the Singapore Charities Act, the Judges of Appeal affirmed that it is within the power of the Singapore court to adopt the approach advanced in Varsani to settle a <b>cy-pres</b> <b>scheme</b> without inquiring into whether there has been a departure from the fundamental tenets of the faith where the original purposes of the gift had ‘ceased in any other way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the appropriate considerations.’ ...|$|E
50|$|The Fund {{administered}} by the Bridge House Estates is solely responsible for the five City Bridges. There is no financial support from the Government or any other fund. If one of the bridges happened to collapse, the Charity would have to rebuild {{it out of the}} endowment. The good stewardship of the property and investments of the Estates by the City has led to the accumulation of surplus funds over any such demand on its resources. Therefore, the City sought from the Charity Commission to implement a <b>Cy-près</b> <b>scheme</b> to extend its objects (purposes) since September 1995 to make charitable grants within the Greater London area.|$|E
