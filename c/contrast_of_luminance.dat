40|$|Luminance ratios along shadow edges {{remain the}} same even when they cross {{reflectance}} borders. According to Gilchrist (1988, Perception & Psychophysics 43 415 - 424) this so-called ratio-invariance property is a crucial factor {{in the perception of}} shadows. However, Soranzo and Agostini (2004, Perception 33 1359 - 1368) suggested that in some conditions (named 'impossible shadows'), a luminance pattern might still be perceived as a shadow even if the ratio-invariance property along its edge is violated. This can occur when an edge is collinear with another edge (contextual edge) which incorporates it, shares the same polarity, and generates a larger ratio. The hypothesis that impossible shadows are actually perceived as shadows is here tested by comparing the perceptual contrast of a luminance edge {{in the absence of a}} contextual edge (control condition) to that of both possible shadow edges (where the contextual and mediating edge share the same ratio) and impossible shadow edges (where the ratio of the contextual edge is larger rather than that at the mediating edge). We found that the perceived <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> edges shrinks in both possible and impossible shadow conditions rather than in the control condition. This evidence supports the hypothesis that a luminance pattern might be perceived as a shadow even when the ratio-invariance property is violated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Dyslexia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{learning}} disabilities affecting millions of people worldwide. Although exact causes of dyslexia are not well-known, a deficit in the magnocellular pathway may play a role. We examined possible deficiency of magnocellular, as compared to parvocellular and koniocellular pathway function by measuring luminance and color perception. Methods: Visual stimuli consisted of a series of natural images, divided into layers of luminance, red-green and blue-yellow, which probed magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular pathways, respectively. Thirteen children with dyslexia and 13 sex- and age- matched controls performed three psychophysical tasks. In the first task, subjects were instructed to match the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> (magno) and red-green (parvo) images to that of the blue-yellow (konio) images. In the second task, subjects detected the isoluminant point of red-green images to probe parvocellular pathway. In the third task, temporal processing was assessed by measuring reaction time and percentage of correct responses in an identification task using four categories of images, activating all three pathways. Results: The dyslexic group had significantly elevated luminance and color contrast thresholds and higher isoluminant point ratio in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, they had significantly less correct responses than the control group for the blue-yellow images. Conclusion: We may suggest that dyslexic subjects might suffer from both magnocellular and parvocellular deficits. Moreover, our results show partial impairment of the koniocellular pathway. Thus, dyslexia might be associated with deficits in all three visual pathways...|$|E
40|$|When {{bounded by}} {{a line of}} {{sufficient}} contrast, the desaturated hue of a colored line will spread over an enclosed area, an effect known as the watercolor illusion. The contrast of the two lines can be in luminance, chromaticity, {{or a combination of}} both. The effect is most salient when the enclosing line has greater contrast with the background than the line that induces the spreading color. In most prior experiments with watercolor spreading, the luminance of both lines has been lower than the background. An achromatic version of the illusion exists where a dark line will spread while being bounded by either a darker or brighter line. In a previous study we measured the strength of the watercolor effect in which the colored inducing line was isoluminant to the background, and found an illusion for both brighter and darker achromatic outer contours. We also found the strength of spreading is stronger for bluish (+S cone input) colors compared to yellowish (-S cone input) ones, when bounded by a dark line. The current study set out to measure the hue dependence of the watercolor illusion when inducing colors are flanked with brighter (increment) as opposed to darker outer lines. The asymmetry in the watercolor effect with S cone input was enhanced when the inducing contrast was an increment rather than a decrement. Further experiments explored the relationship between the perceived contrast of these chromatic lines when paired with luminance increments and decrements and revealed that the perceived <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> increments and decrements is dependent on which isoluminant color they are paired with. In addition to known hue asymmetries in the watercolor illusion there are asymmetries between luminance increments and decrements that are also hue dependent.

40|$|Open Access JournalThis journal {{issue is}} the VSS 2009 Meeting abstractsConscious {{perception}} of a visual stimulus can be impaired both by decreasing the signal strength in the stimulus {{as well as by}} distracting attention from the stimulus. In the present study, we report a method that allows us to classify different types of psychophysical techniques for rendering visual stimuli invisible. In experiment 1, we varied the visibility for a luminance blob by varying its contrast. Subjects were asked to report {{the presence or absence of}} the luminance blob together with their confidence rating: high/mid/low. In experiment 2, we maintain the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> blob well above threshold but varied its visibility by manipulating the difficulty of a concurrent central visual search task. Observers detect the presence of blob with confidence rating (high/mid/low) as in experiment 1 in addition to their search result. In both experiments, the target blob was presented only half of the trials. Between the two experiments, we identified conditions yielding a comparable d' and analyzed the confidence in “miss” trials in which subjects reported absence when the target was present. We found that subjects reported absence with high confidence when they missed a target due to low contrast, whereas they reported absence with little confidence when their attention was distracted. In the case of low-contrast stimuli, the confidence in reporting absence was as high as reporting absence in “correct rejection” trials in which no stimulus was presented. The distinct patterns in the confidence rating between the two types of blindness implies that blindness at a perceptual stage and attentional stage can be distinguished by objective measures based on a second-level signal detection framework. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 9 th Annual Meeting of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS 2009), Naples, FL., 8 - 13 May 2009.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigated}} {{how human}} vision processes colour and luminance information to enable perception of our environment. I first tested how colour {{can alter the}} perception of depth from shading. A luminance variation {{can be interpreted as}} either variation of reflectance (patterning) or variation of shape. The process of shape-from-shading interprets luminance variation as changes {{in the shape of the}} object (e. g. the shading on an object might elicit the perception of curvature). The addition of colour variation is known to modify this shape-from-shading processing. In the experiments presented here I tested how luminance driven percepts can be modified by colour. My first series of experiments confirmed that depth is modulated by colour. I explored a larger number of participants than previously tested. Contrary to previous studies, a wide repertoire of behaviour was found; participants experienced variously more depth, or less depth, or no difference. I hypothesised that the colour modulation effect might be due to a low-level contrast modulation of luminance by colour, rather than a higher-level depth effect. In a second series of experiments, I therefore tested how the perceived contrast of a luminance target can be affected by the presence of an orthogonal mask. I found that colour had a range of effects on the perception of luminance, again dependant on the participants. Luminance also had a similar wide range of effects on the perceived <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> targets. This showed that, at supra-threshold levels, a luminance target’s contrast can be modulated by a component of another orientation (colour or luminance defined). The effects of luminance and colour were not following a particular rule. In a third series of experiments, I explored this interaction at detection levels of contrast. I showed cross-interaction between luminance target and mask but no effects of a colour mask...|$|E
40|$|Much {{is known}} about visual {{processing}} of chromatic and luminance information. However, less {{is known about}} how these two signals are combined. This thesis has three aims to investigate how colour and luminance are combined in edge detection. 1) To determine whether presenting colour and luminance information together improves performance in tasks such as edge localisation and blur detection. 2) To investigate how the visual system resolves conflicts between colour and luminance edge information. 3) To explore whether colour and luminance edge information is always combined in the same way. It {{is well known that}} the perception of chromatic blur can be constrained by sharp luminance information in natural scenes. The first set of experiments (Chapter 3) quantifies this effect and demonstrates that it cannot be explained by poorer acuity in processing chromatic information, higher <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> information or differences in the statistical structure of colour and luminance information in natural scenes. It is therefore proposed that there is a neural mechanism that actively promotes luminance information. Chapter 4 and Experiments 5. 1 and 5. 3 aimed to investigate whether the presence of both chromatic and luminance information improves edge localisation performance. Participant performance in a Vernier acuity (alignment) task was compared to predictions from three models; ‘winner takes all’, unweighted averaging and maximum likelihood estimation (a form of weighted averaging). Despite several attempts to differentiate the models we failed to increase the differences in model predictions sufficiently and {{it was not possible to}} determine whether edge localisation was enhanced by the presence of both cues. In Experiment 5. 4 we investigated how edges are localised when colour and luminance cues conflict, using the method of adjustment. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to make predictions based on measurements of each cue in isolation. These predictions were then compared to observed data. It was found that, whilst maximum likelihood estimation captured the pattern of the data, it consistently over-estimated the weight of the luminance component. It is suggested that chromatic information may be weighted more heavily than predicted as it is more useful for detecting object boundaries in natural scenes. In Chapter 6 a novel approach, perturbation discrimination, was used to investigate how the spatial arrangement of chromatic and luminance cues, and the type of chromatic and luminance information, can affect cue combination. Perturbation discrimination requires participants to select the grating stimulus that contains spatial perturbation. If one cue dominated over the other it was expected that this would be reflected by masking and increased perturbation detection thresholds. We compared perturbation thresholds for chromatic and luminance defined line and square-wave gratings in isolation and when presented with a mask of the other channel and other grating type. For example, the perturbation threshold for a luminance line target alone was compared to the threshold for a luminance line target presented with a chromatic square-wave target. The introduction of line masks caused masking for both combinations. Introduction of an achromatic square-wave mask had no effect on perturbation thresholds for chromatic line targets. However, the introduction of a chromatic square-wave mask to luminance line targets improved perturbation discrimination performance. This suggests that the perceived location of the chromatic edges is determined by the location of the luminance lines. Finally, in Chapter 7, we investigated whether chromatic blur is constrained by luminance information in bipartite edges. Earlier in the thesis we demonstrated that luminance information constrains chromatic blur in natural scenes, but also that chromatic information has more influence than expected when colour and luminance edges conflict. This difference may be due to differences in the stimuli or due to differences in the task. The luminance masking effect found using natural scenes was replicated using bipartite edges. Therefore, the finding that luminance constrains chromatic blur is not limited to natural scene stimuli. This suggests that colour and luminance are combined differently for blur discrimination tasks and edge localisation tasks. Overall we can see that luminance often dominates in edge perception tasks. For blur discrimination this seems to be because the mechanisms differ. For edge localisation it might be simply that luminance cues are often higher contrast and, when this is equated, chromatic cues are actually a good indicator of edge location...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the accuracy of orientation and spatial-frequency discrimination for sine-wave gratings that vary in either luminance or color. The equiluminant chromatic gratings were modulated along either a tritanopic confusion axis (so that they were detectable {{on the basis of}} activity in only the short-wavelength-sensitive cones) or an axis of constant short-wavelength-sensitive cone excitation (so that they could be detected on the basis of opposing activity in only the long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive cones). Grating contrasts ranged from the detection threshold to the highest levels that we could produce; the <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>luminance</b> and color patterns were equated for equal multiples of their respective detection thresholds. Discrimination thresholds for all patterns showed a similar dependence on stimulus contrast, rising sharply at low contrasts and becoming nearly asymptotic at moderate contrasts. However, even at threshold contrasts, observers could still reliably discriminate sufficiently large differences in the orientation or spatial frequency of all patterns, and they could also reliably identify the type <b>of</b> variation (<b>luminance</b> or which color) defining the grating. For most conditions the discrimina-tion thresholds did not differ from the two types of color grating and reached values as low as 1 deg (orientation) or 4 % (spatial frequency). Thus observers were able to make accurate spatial judgments on the basis of either type of chromatic information. However, these thresholds were slightly but consistently higher than the thresholds for comparable luminance gratings. This difference in the color and luminance discrimination thresholds may reflect somewhat coarser orientation and spatial-frequency selectivity in the mechanisms encoding the chromatic patterns...|$|R

The correlation in contrast and the correlation in luminance diminish rapidly with distance, and the typical correlation between luminance and contrast within patches is small (e. g., − 0. 2 compared to − 0. 8 for 1 /f noise). We show that eye movements are frequently large enough that there will be little correlation in the contrast or luminance on a receptive field from one fixation to the next, and thus rapid contrast and luminance gain control are essential.

Within the typical image, the 95 % range (2. 5 – 97. 5 percentile) for both local luminance and local contrast is somewhat greater than a factor of 10. The correlation in contrast and the correlation in luminance diminish rapidly with distance, and the typical correlation between luminance and contrast within patches is small (e. g., 0. 2 compared to 0. 8 for 1 /f noise). We show that eye movements are frequently large enough that there will be little correlation in the contrast or luminance on a receptive field from one fixation to the next, and thus rapid contrast and luminance gain control are essential. The low correlation between local luminance and contrast implies that efficient contrast gain control mechanisms can operate largely independently <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> gain control mechanisms.

First, we tested alignment <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> and chromatic gratings matched or mismatched in contrast polarity or grating type. Thresholds with matched gratings were low while all mismatched pairs were elevated. Second, we determined alignment acuity {{as a function}} <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> or chromatic <b>contrast</b> alone or in the presence <b>of</b> constant <b>contrast</b> components <b>of</b> the other type. For in-phase components, performance followed the envelope of the more sensitive mechanism. However, polarity reversals revealed an asymmetric effect for luminance and chromatic conditions, which suggested that luminance can override chromatic mechanisms in hyperacuity; we interpret these findings {{in the context of}} spatial mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|New {{imaging and}} {{rendering}} systems commonly use physically accurate lighting {{information in the}} form of highdynamic range (HDR) images and video. HDR images contain actual colorimetric or physical values, which can span 14 orders of magnitude, instead of 8 -bit renderings, found in standard images. The additional precision and quality retained in HDR visual data is necessary to display images on advanced HDR display devices, capable <b>of</b> showing <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> 50, 000 : 1, as compared to the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> 700 : 1 for LCD displays. With the development of high-dynamic range visual techniques comes a need for an automatic visual quality assessment of the resulting images. In this paper we propose several modifications to the Visual Difference Predicator (VDP). The modifications improve the prediction of perceivable differences in the full visible range <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> and under the adaptation conditions corresponding to real scene observation. The proposed metric takes into account the aspects <b>of</b> high <b>contrast</b> vision, like scattering of the light in the optics (OTF), nonlinear response to light for the full range <b>of</b> <b>luminance,</b> and local adaptation. To calibrate our HDR VDP we perform experiments using an advanced HDR display, capable of displaying the range <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> that is close to that found in real scenes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} perceived velocity as {{a function}} <b>of</b> <b>contrast</b> for <b>luminance</b> and isoluminant sinusoidal gratings, luminance and isoluminant plaids, and second-order, amplitude-modulated, drift-balanced stimuli. For all types of stimuli perceived velocity was contrast-invariant for fast moving patterns at or above 4 deg/sec. For slowly moving stimuli the log of perceived velocity was a linear function of the log <b>of</b> the <b>contrast.</b> The slope <b>of</b> this perceived velocity-vs-contrast line (velocity gain) was relatively shallow for luminance gratings and luminance plaids, but was steep for isoluminant gratings and isoluminant plaids, {{as well as for}} drift-balanced stimuli. Independent variation of spatial and temporal frequency showed that these variables, and not velocity alone, determine the velocity gain. Overall, the results indicate that slow moving stimuli defined by chromaticity or by second-order statistics are processed in a different manner from luminance defined stimuli. We propose {{that there are a number}} of independent mechanisms processing motion targets and it is the interplay of these mechanisms that is responsible for the final percept...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} in three separate experiments the perceived achromatic colour, transparency, and phenomenal attributes of concentric-circle neon-brightness-spreading displays. Stimuli {{were obtained by}} varying the <b>luminances</b> <b>of</b> the outer arc (OA) and inner arc (IA) of circle, while keeping the background luminance constant. In the first experiment, observers modified the <b>luminance</b> <b>of</b> an adjustable region to match the achromatic colour of the central area of the displays; additional adjustments were performed on sets of control figures without IA (subjective figures) and without OA. In the second experiment, observers judged the transparency of the central area of the displays using either numerical ratings or dichotomous judgments. In the third experiment, they used four possible categories (light, shadow, filter, opaque) to describe {{the appearance of the}} displays. Only displays with intermediate background luminance were perceived as non-transparent. Displays with intermediate IA luminance were seen as transparent filters, whereas those with intermediate OA luminance were categorised as either lights or shadows, depending on luminance polarity. Adjustment data show that a simple contrast rule accounts well for induction effects in OA-only and IA-only figures. Data concerning complete figures show an interaction between OA and IA luminances in determining the percept; in particular, the <b>contrast</b> effect <b>of</b> OA <b>luminance</b> appears modulated by IA luminance in a nonmonotonic fashion. We discuss the implications of these findings on our current understanding of the mechanisms of neon brightness and colour spreading...|$|R
