50|$|Aonidiella aurantii or {{red scale}} is an armored scale insect {{and a major}} pest of citrus.

50|$|Aphytis melinus is an {{internal}} parasite of the <b>California</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii, {{which is a}} pest of citrus in California and elsewhere. This chalcid wasp drums its antennae against the scale insect {{to find out if}} it is healthy, if it is already parasitized, how large it is, etc., to decide how to use this prey. It has four choices (from worst to best): leave the scale to keep searching, feed directly on the scale, use the scale as a host for a male A. melinus, or use the scale for a female A. melinus.|$|E
50|$|Murdoch's main {{research}} studies focus on understanding what regulates populations in abundance. He {{is interested in}} the mechanisms that maintain the stability of interacting consumer and resource populations when the consumer keeps the resource population far below the level set by its resources. His research objective is to develop models of particular systems, do experiments to understand these systems and test these models, as well as to develop more general theory. Two experimental systems are used in Murdoch's research: the Aphytis-California Red Scale and daphnia-algae systems. Murdoch's work in biological control has been instrumental in demonstrating that stability of parasitoid-host interactions in pest control can be achieved by non-equilibrium mechanisms. For example, his examination of the parasitoid-host relationship between Aphytis and the <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> has elucidated that stability does not arise from metapopulation dynamics and that the regulating mechanism may, instead, lie in size-related interactions, in small-scale spatial heterogeneity, or mixtures of these mechanisms.|$|E

Armored scale resistance is found on an estimated 40 % of 163, 000 acres of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley. Citrus growers have responded by either increasing their use of natural enemies, especially the parasitoid wasp Aphytis melinus, or by applying newly registered insect growth regulator or neonicotinoid insecticides.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{refuge from}} the parasitoid, Aphytis melinus, is provided to the <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii, by the interior bark substrates of citrus trees, even though scale have lower fitness on bark {{in the absence of}} A. melinus. How bark-reared scale escape parasitism was unclear because A. melinus searches the interior of trees as effectively as the exterior. Host identification in A. melinus is mediated by a kairomone, O-caffeoyltyrosine, in scale covers. O-caffeoyltyrosine concentration varies with scale age and rearing conditions. We hypothesized that the reduced acceptance of bark-reared scale may be due, in part, to reduced quantities of O-caffeoyltyrosine in their covers. We reared scales on bark, leaves, and fruit of lemon and orange trees in the field at monthly intervals then collected the scales and measured them. We bioassayed covers for their acceptability to A. melinus in the laboratory then determined their O-caffeoyltyrosine content. Even after adjusting for the differences in scale body size, O-caffeoyltyrosine content in bark-reared scale covers was 45 – 85 % less than that in covers of leaf- or fruit-reared scales, depending upon cultivar and rearing date. Covers of bark-reared scales were selected for probing only 40 – 45 % of the time when compared to leaf-reared scales. Covers with the relatively highest levels of O-caffeoyltyrosine were most likely to be selected for probing. We conclude that part of the mechanism by which <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> on bark avoids discovery is through reduced O-caffeoyltyrosine content in their covers. This reduction is probably a consequence of the reduced nutritional quality of bark as a substrate for scale survival and growt...|$|E
40|$|Armored scales (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) are {{important}} pests in citrus orchards worldwide. Augmentative releases of Aphelinidae wasps (Hymenoptera) {{have been performed}} in Corsica, France to control the <b>California</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Scale</b> (Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell, 1879)) and the arrowhead scale (Unaspis yanonensis (Kuwana, 1923)), but biological control of armored scales requires the identification of their parasitoids to evaluate their potential as biological control agents. In order to circumvent this issue, parasitoids emerging from four armored scale species were characterized through DNA barcoding. All the parasitoids identified belong to the Aphelinidae (Hymenoptera) and included {{a total of five}} Aphytis (including A. melinus), four Encarsia (including cryptic species) and one Ablerus (hyperparasitoid) species. Host-specificity was found to be strong among primary parasitoids, with Encarsia inquirenda Silvestri, 1930 and an unidentified Encarsia being the sole taxa able to parasitize the two subfamilies (Aspidiotinae and Diaspidinae) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> (CRS), Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), one of {{the most}} {{important}} pests of citrus worldwide, began to cause damages in eastern Spain in 1986. The main biological control agents of A. aurantii in this zone are the native parasitoid A. chrysomphali (Mercet) and the introduced A. melinus DeBach (both Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). Nevertheless, the control they exert is insufficient. In order to improve the biological control of A. aurantii we studied several biotic factors that may affect the efficiency of A. chrysomphali and A. melinus in the field. More concretely, we studied the spatial and temporal variation in the scale size, the host sizes used by A. chrysomphali and A. melinus as well as the influence of host size on various parasitoid traits. Moreover, we studied the foraging ecology and the effect of the ants native to the Mediterranean on the populations of the scale and, finally, the nutritional state and food sources used by adult A. melinus in the field. In the field, the body size of A. aurantii varied with plant substrate, locality, time of the year, and probably, with the nutritional state of the host plant. Plant substrate was found to substantially influence the body size of A. aurantii with scales being significantly larger on fruits that on leaves or twigs. Another important source of variation for A. aurantii size was geographic location since significant differences were found among orchards. Moreover, significant seasonal variation in the body size of A. aurantii was observed; body sizes were smaller during summer and autumn, apparently due to the effect of temperature. Finally, a positive relationship between the content of potassium in leaves and scale size was observed. From all the above factors, temperature related seasonal variation had the most profound effect on A. aurantii size. Aphytis chrysomphali and A. melinus used different sizes of A. aurantii in the field. Pekas, A. (2011).

40|$|Parasitoids are {{the main}} natural enemies of the <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) and on {{occasion}} can regulate their populations. To increase their effectiveness, inoculative or augmentative releases of parasitoids are promoted. Previous {{to the implementation of}} any release strategy an important and necessary step is to acquire knowledge on the parasitoid fauna associated with this key phytophagous pest. Parasitoids were surveyed and quantified in Spanish citrus orchards between 2005 and 2009. Aphytis melinus DeBach (87. 1 %) resulted as the dominant species, followed by Aphytis chrysomphali (Mercet) (15. 9 %), Encarsia perniciosi (Tower) (2. 4 %) and Aphycus hederaceus (Westwood) (0. 004 %). Overall, higher levels of parasitism were recorded in fruit than in twigs. Scales in fruit were parasitized at similar levels by the different parasitoid species whereas E. perniciosi was more active in twigs. Data eventually reveal the recent displacement of A. chrysomphali by A. melinus. The implications of these results on the biological control of A. aurantii are discussed and this information will be useful in the decision of IPM strategies for this pest...|$|E
40|$|The <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell), {{was first}} {{detected}} in citrus groves in Catalonia, Northern Spain, in 2000, {{and has since}} spread slowly and irregularly. New foci of infestation are currently found in citrus-growing areas of south-ern Tarragona. As Catalonia is the northernmost citrus growing area in Spain, between 2002 and 2009, A. aurantii population dynamics and seasonal trends were studied in two citrus groves and compared with other regions and countries. The popula-tion dynamics showed that there were four male flights (including that of the overwintering generation) : in May, mid June-mid July, August and October, the most abundant being that of August (over 60 % of the males captured during the year). The ther-mal constant estimated between male flights, using 11. 7 °C as the lower threshold temperature, was 611. 8 ± 35. 5 degree-days.

40|$|Methyl bromide (MB) is a {{universal}} fumigant of choice for postharvest disinfestation of quarantine insects until recently when {{it has become a}} prime target compound slated for phase-out because it is a stratospheric ozone depletor. Methyl halides such as MB and methyl iodide (MI) occur naturally in the atmosphere especially in coastal regions where certain flora favor their production (Li et al., 2001). Among the halides, MI is rapidly photo-decomposed by UV-light and persists only a few days in the environment. In contrast, MB persists with a lifetime of 0. 7 to 1. 0 year. Therefore, although MI is highly reactive and possesses similar lethality for organisms, it lacks the undesirable property of stratospheric ozone destruction caused by MB. Claypool and Vines (1956) tested MI on a number of fresh fruit commodities grown in California. They showed that MI used at a rate of 16 g/m 3 for 2 -h did not have a phytotoxic effect on most fresh fruit tested, but MI dosage of 32 g/m 3 for 4 -h caused severe injuries. Aung et al.

40|$|Abstract. 1. Most of what {{is known}} about {{parasitoid}} behaviour comes from laboratory observations: field quantitative observations on searching parasitoids are extremely difficult to do and are rare. The basic components of Aphytis melinus’s response to <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> (Aonidiella aurantii) were studied in the laboratory: encounter, rejection, drumming, probing, oviposition, and hostfeeding. It was then asked whether these observations provided a reliable guide to behaviour in the field in a situation that was very different from the laboratory. 2. Field observations were carried out on bark on the trunk and interior branches of trees where live scale density is extremely high in patches, dead scale make up 90 % of all scale, and could be expected to interfere with Aphytis search. 3. The laboratory observations predicted well the time taken in the field for each basic event (drumming or probing) and average times spent on a scale. Also well predicted were the distributions of times spent on drumming, probing, and total time on a scale. Rejection rates were much higher in the field. Thus, the laboratory studies predicted foraging behaviour in the field with variable success; potential explanations for observed mismatch between laboratory and field and its possible larger implications are discussed.

A total of 250 dispensers of Red Scale DownTM per hectare were installed in four 1 - 2 ha sweet orange orchards, in two applications (March and ca. 3 months later). Each dispenser contains 0. 4 mg of the active ingredients, i. e., (3 S, 6 R) - 3 -methyl- 6 -isopropenyl- 9 -decen- 1 -yl acetate (0. 041 %) and (3 S, 6 S) - 3 -methyl- 6 -isopropenyl- 9 -decen- 1 -yl acetate (0. 025 %). Three modalities of CRS management were compared in each orchard: A) MD; B) MD + one insecticide application (chlorpyriphos); C) MD + two or three insecticide applications (chlorpyriphos, mineral oil). Male captures in pheromone traps were monitored every two weeks. The level of fruit infestation by CRS was estimated before the experiment {{and in the end}} of season in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each management modality.

40|$|An optimum technic {{has been}} {{developed}} for extracting volatile organic compounds which contribute to the aroma of lime fruit (Citrus aurantifolia). The volatile organic compounds of healthy and infested lime fruit with <b>California</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale</b> Aonidiella aurantii were characterized using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC) coupled flame ionization detection (FID) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as a very simple, efficient and nondestructive extraction method. A three-phase 50 / 30 μm PDV/DVB/CAR fibre {{was used for the}} extraction process. The optimal sealing and fibre exposure time for volatiles reaching equilibrium from whole lime fruit in the headspace of the chamber was 16 and 4 hours respectively. 5 min was selected as desorption time of the three-phase fibre. Herbivorous activity induces indirect plant defenses, as the emission of herbivorous-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), which could be used by natural enemies for host location. GC-MS analysis showed qualitative differences among volatiles emitted by infested and healthy lime fruit. The GC-MS analysis allowed the initial identification of 18 compounds, with similarities higher than 85 %, in accordance with the NIST mass spectral library. One of these were increased by A. aurantii infestation, D-limonene, and three were decreased, Undecane, α-Farnesene and 7 -epi-α-selinene. From an applied point of view, the application of the above-mentioned VOCs may help boost the efficiency of biocontrol programs and natural enemies’ production techniques...|$|E
