40|$|Since {{the late}} fifties, wages and working {{conditions}} for all major groups of employees in the socialized economy were determined by means of collective labour contracts.

In the present conditions of the economic reform both contents and methods of concluding <b>collective</b> <b>bargains</b> will undergo changes. <b>Collective</b> <b>bargains</b> will be concluded between direct employers and employees or their representatives within the framework of particular enterprises.

The <b>collective</b> <b>bargain</b> has many features of a fundamental organizing statute, whose broad provisions control, in some degree, the activities of many individuals who may have {{had little or no}} part in its drafting and who may even have been bitterly opposed to the draftsmen.

On the one hand, wages are lowered and unemployment decreases, {{on the other}} hand, the individual labour supply decision is distorted at the hours-of-work margin. The optimal level of tax progressivity within this trade-off is determined using a numerical general equilibrium model with imperfect competition on the goods market, <b>collective</b> wage <b>bargaining</b> and a labour-supply module calibrated to empirically plausible elasticity values. The model is calibrated to macroeconomic and institutional parameters of both the OECD average {{and a number of}} individual OECD countries.
