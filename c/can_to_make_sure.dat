However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E

The plaintiffs opposed allowing the groups or the City to intervene. On August 19, Judge Walker denied the legal groups' motions to intervene but granted the City's, albeit in a limited capacity. Despite the other groups' failed attempt {{to intervene in}} the lawsuit, they offered support to the legal team litigating the case, with James Esseks of the ACLU saying: [...] "e are interested in doing whatever we <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their case is as successful as possible".|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{wisdom of}} removing the dam has been frequently questioned. Some observers, such as Carl Pope (Director of the Sierra Club), stated that Hodel had political motives [...] in proposing the study. The imputed motive was {{to divide the}} environmental movement: to see residents of the strongly Democratic city of San Francisco coming out against an environmental issue. Dianne Feinstein, the mayor of San Francisco at the time, said in a Los Angeles Times story in 1987: [...] "All this is for an expanded campground?... It's dumb, dumb, dumb." [...] Hodel, now retired, is still a strong proponent of restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley and now-Senator Feinstein is still strongly against restoration. The George W.

Dianne Feinstein opposed this allocation, saying, [...] "I will do all I <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it isn't included in the final bill.

On March 23, 2012, Rowland confirmed via Twitter that she was working with rapper T-Pain. Sean Garrett revealed in an interview with Rap-Up on May 9, 2012 that he also contributed to the album. He stated, [...] "Her swag is dope and I'm just so happy to see her get her shot. I'ma do what I <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Kelly right."

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} the season behind Rosberg, Hamilton had won the four preceding rounds of the season, converting a 29-point deficit into a 17-point lead over his teammate heading into the Austin race. With three races left in the season, Hamilton said he would prioritise not allowing any negative thoughts concerning double-points in the season-closing event in Abu Dhabi bother him and would take any opportunities he was presented with: [...] "We've just got to do our due diligence and work as hard as we <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we don't have any problems." [...] Hamilton hoped to achieve his fifth consecutive victory of the year: [...] "A lot of the American side of my family come to the race, plus I won the first F1 GP at the circuit back in 2012 - it's a special one for me. I really enjoy going there and I'm looking forward to another great race." [...] Rosberg was aiming to improve on his best finish in Austin (ninth in 2013) and to further reduce Hamilton's advantage in the Driver's Championship. He said Mercedes were targeting [...] "a big finish" [...] to their season, while also declaring he would not concede defeat until the final round of the season, and hoped to maintain the level of entertainment for the sport's fan base: [...] "The first step comes in Austin, which is a really cool city and a great race track. I haven't had the best races there so far, but I'm determined to change that this year." ...|$|E
