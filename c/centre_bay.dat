25|$|Ceely House {{is one of}} Aylesbury's larger houses. Of medieval origin it was {{the brotherhood}} house of the Fraternity of the Virgin Mary. In the mid-18th century it was {{converted}} to a private house and given a new classical front, by the Aylesbury lawyer Hugh Barker Bell. Constructed of red brick, its main facade is five bays. The <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> projects slightly to accentuate the main entrance, which is protected by a porch in a loose palladian style of two unfluted Corinthean columns supporting a pediment. The pitched roof is hidden by an unusual parapet masquerading as an undecorated entablature. As {{in the case of}} the Friarage however Ceely House is another example of a much older building with a new front: medieval wall paintings may be found in the upper storeys of the house, which is now part of the Buckinghamshire County Museum.|$|E
500|$|In {{its present}} form, the Royal Albion Hotel is in three linked sections, all stylistically similar. [...] The {{original}} (eastern) wing is four storeys tall and has five extremely large Corinthian and Composite columns {{on the north}} face. [...] These are flanked on both sides by large pilasters, which also run all round the east face. [...] The top floor is an attic storey displaying Wilds's characteristic motif: shell designs set in blank rounded tympana. [...] Above this is a mansard roof, now mostly obscured. [...] The centre section, dating from about 1847, has three full storeys and two attic floors above, and is therefore taller. [...] The façade has three bays. [...] The theme of large pilasters and columns continues, but different styles are used: {{the left and right}} bays project slightly and have paired Tuscan pilasters, and a pair of tapering Ionic columns in the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> form a distyle in antis composition. [...] The centre section also has a mansard roof—apparently a later addition. [...] The western wing (the former Lion Mansions) has a Tuscan-columned porch on the south (seafront) side and a Doric-style equivalent facing north to Old Steine, four Composite pilasters extending for three of the four storeys, small cast-iron balconies and some aedicula-style window surrounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{repository}} {{has been}} described as a [...] "fine work" [...] by the prolific Thomas Lainson. [...] It was designed distinctively [...] in the French Second Empire style with some Queen Anne elements. [...] Lainson made lavish use of terracotta to decorate the building, which is mostly of red brick with slate mansard roofs. [...] The design is U-shaped and encloses a gated courtyard. [...] Apart from the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> on the Holland Road (western) elevation, which rises to four storeys with an attic storey above, the building is three-storey with attics. [...] The Holland Road façade has nine bays in a 1:3:1:3:1 formation, the three-bay sections being slightly recessed. [...] The outermost bays are topped by elaborate gables which hide the attic space; the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> also has an ornately treated gable at roof level, containing round porthole-style timber-framed windows. [...] Some of the other windows have prominent transoms and mullions of terracotta; they vary between round-headed and flat-arched. [...] The doorway is also arched, this time in the segmental style. [...] The roofs are steep and are topped with parapets of wrought iron.|$|E

2500|$|The {{frontage}} {{is divided}} into three parts by tall grey pilasters. [...] The left and right bays are further forward than the wider central bay, and have matching entrance: each has a lintel featuring a triglyph and metope pattern, smaller white pilasters and a pediment. [...] Above the left (west) entrance is Mackintosh's crown monogram; above the right is a monogram of an eagle, the symbol of John the Evangelist. [...] A large grey entablature, with prominent triglyph and metope work, sits above the three bays. [...] Over the recessed <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> is another pediment embedded with a blue clock and topped by a cross.|$|E
2500|$|In 1808–09 Soane {{constructed}} {{his drawing}} office and [...] "museum" [...] {{on the site}} of the former stable block at the back, using primarily top lighting. In 1812 he rebuilt the front part of the site, adding a projecting Portland Stone facade to the basement, ground and first floor levels and the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> of the second floor. Originally this formed three open loggias, but Soane glazed the arches during his lifetime. Once he had moved into No. 13, Soane rented out his former home at No. 12 (on his death it was left to the nation along with No. 13, the intention being that the rental income would fund the running of the Museum).|$|E
2500|$|The {{church has}} an ornate, {{decorative}} façade which combines Classical elements with Thomas Elworthy's preferred Renaissance Revival style and some Italianate features. [...] It is built of red brick, {{laid in the}} Flemish bond pattern, with terracotta window surrounds and dressings designed by the architectural firm of Stiff and Sons. [...] The roof has been renewed with concrete tiles. [...] Steps with terracotta-dressed cement walls and piers lead to three identical round-arched entrance doors with wood panelling, flanked by terracotta columns and set below a balustrade. [...] This is supported on brackets with foliage decoration, and has four decorative terracotta urns corresponding with {{the top of each}} column. [...] This forms the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> of a three-bay façade; the outer bays have paired round-arched windows. [...] The balustrade spans the width of the façade between ground- and first-floor level, forming a kind of porch or portico. [...] At first-floor level, Classical motifs include Composite/Corinthian pilasters and an intricately decorated pediment. [...] The tall pilasters are arranged in pairs flanking the central bay and singly at the outer bays. [...] The pediment is topped by another terracotta urn and is flanked by a stone balustrade on both sides. [...] There are three arched windows to the <b>centre</b> <b>bay,</b> the centre one taller and wider and all featuring engaged columns (columns which are partially sunk into the wall to which they are attached). [...] Paired round-arched windows light the outer bays. [...] The side walls have five arched windows set below a cornice of moulded terracotta. [...] The hall beneath the church includes a full-height single-bay brick extension with an arched window. [...] An elaborate wooden gallery supported on iron columns survives inside.|$|E

2500|$|The exterior, {{which was}} {{executed}} in pale Sussex brick by the builders George Cheesman and son, is [...] in an eclectic blend of Italian Renaissance and Neo-Byzantine Revival styles. [...] The west-facing elevation to Middle Street uses yellow bricks in an English bond pattern, {{while the other}} walls are of brown brick. [...] The arched windows are surmounted by contrasting red and blue tiles, and are flanked by red coloured columns. [...] There is a large rose window in the west-facing frontage. [...] The façade consists of five bays, alternately projecting and recessed; {{on the ground floor}} the layout of windows (protected since the 1960s with translucent safety panels) is two in each end bay and one each in the two recessed bays, with the wooden entrance door on the <b>centre</b> <b>bay</b> (between two pink columns with ornamented capitals). [...] On the first floor, the eight windows are arranged in pairs on the three projecting bays, with one in each of the recesses.|$|E
2500|$|Gambier Island is {{the largest}} of the Howe Sound islands, to the {{northwest}} of Bowen, near the Langdale ferry landing. Gambier has a small resident population, plus hundreds more who enjoy the SW peninsula community in the summer months. This area has a year-round foot ferry, the Stormaway IV, run by BC Ferries, and a community centre. Until recently, the only commercial location on the island, the General Store, was located here, near New Brighton, where the ferry lands. The store is now closed. This area of Gambier has landline power and telephone. There also are numerous seasonal homes line the shores of the southern bays (West Bay, <b>Centre</b> <b>Bay,</b> Port Graves, and Halkett Bay) along with several local yacht club outstations in both the southern and northern parts of the island. Beyond the SW peninsula, seasonal visitors rely on solar, wind and generator power. The northwestern shore of Gambier, with adjacent Thornborough Channel, is still dominated by the forest industry. The [...] "pond" [...] at Andy's Bay is one of North America's largest logsorts. A resident-operated woodlot on provincial land (WL039) is located near Andy's Bay, with active logging and reforestation. The northeast quadrant of Gambier also is Crown land, with two more major woodlots proposed by the provincial Ministry of Forests, but not pursued as yet due to the opposition of many local residents, members of the Squamish Nation, whose territory this includes, and concerned supporters of a less-industrial Howe Sound. The island has excellent hiking in the provincial Crown land that dominates its north sector.|$|E
