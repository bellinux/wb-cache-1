25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, salvation, and God. Salvation, for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as finding your way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says everything that we <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> salvation and so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different metaphors for salvation and so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|E
500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now {{know for a fact}} that you wrote [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E

He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. Quite apart from that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E

British publication Kerrang! gave the album a [...] "Excellent" [...] {{four out of}} five [...] "K"s describing the EP as [...] "The snarling rebirth of the UKs best punk band." [...] Vincent Danger when writing for Thrash Hits gave the album a 5 out of 6 stars giving the album a positive review praising their choice of front man to replace Carter. [...] "there’s only so much one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> 459 seconds of music. There’s enough here to prove that Lags Barnard’s songwriting skills aren’t on the wane and that Wade MacNeil is a more than able replacement for Carter." [...] Alternative Press writer Jason Pettigrew appreciated the album's short but violent writing in his 4 out of 5 star review; saying [...] "the EP is steeped in impenetrable, relentless nihilism and thrashing madness that’s one part noise weapon (“True Colours”), one part circle-pit centrifuge (“Hate Hate Hate”) and two parts hateful hardcore (“Mondo Chaos” and the title track)." [...] Dan Issitt, a writer for Alter The Press! gave the album a score of 4/5 in an otherwise positive review did see fault in the change of front man. [...] "Some fans will undoubtedly find it hard to get past the fact that he isn’t Frank Carter, but a little scratch at the surface will reveal the same aggression and similar bile-filled lyrics you’d expect from one of Britain’s most hateful bands." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the game world, the team initially created a [...] "hybrid city", which producer Dan Houser describes as [...] "a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic" [...] city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design {{on a real}} location meant [...] "you {{have a lot of}} things you <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it". As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to [...] "start out feeling poor and work to being richer". Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a [...] "hybrid of a generic American city", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda series (1986–present) and the film Goodfellas (1990), describing Grand Theft Auto III as [...] "a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG". Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.|$|E

Then after the GOTJ, Shaggy 2 Dope will embark on the F.T.F.O.M.F. Tour to promote his third solo album F.T.F.O.M.F. While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will start putting the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life". He also stated that ICP will also go on a 20th Anniversary: The Great Milenko Tour, after the Juggalo March On Washington (September 16 – 17, 2017) which will lead up to their 24th Annual Hallowicked Show, and then they will tour England mid to late November (13–20). In late April/early May Necro announced that he will not take part in the Juggalo March On Washington nor would he take part in The Parental Advisory Tour stating in part [...] "It's all good between us, just business. They were wanting me to tour for a month basically for free". On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now my number 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show. [...] "Fearless Fred Fury" [...] was revealed as the name of the next Joker Card at their Hallowicked show.|$|E
