2500|$|The first French {{synchronizer}} {{was developed}} by Sergeant-Mecanicien Robert Alkan and l'Ingenieur du Maritime Hamy. It was based closely on the definitive Fokker Stangensteuerung gear: the main difference being that the push rod was installed within the Vickers gun, using a redundant steam tube in the <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> This mitigated a major drawback of other push rod gears in that the rod, being supported for its whole length, was much less liable to distortion or breakage. Vickers guns modified to take this gear can be distinguished by the housing for the push rod's spring, projecting {{from the front of}} the gun like a second barrel. This gear was first installed and air-tested in a Nieuport 12, on 2 May 1916, and other pre-production gears were fitted to contemporary Morane-Saulnier and Nieuport fighters. The Alkan-Hamy gear was standardised as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type I (moteurs rotatifs), becoming available in numbers in time for the arrival of the Nieuport 17 at the front in mid 1916, and synchronizing the forward-firing guns of all rotary-engined French aircraft. The exception was the Nieuport 28, which used a different gear – now known only through American documentation, where it is described as the [...] "Nieuport Synchronizing gear" [...] or the [...] "Gnome gear". A spinning drive shaft, driven by the rotating crankcase of the Nieuport's 160 CV Gnome 9N Monosoupape rotary engine, drove two separately adjustible trigger motors – each imparting firing impulses to its gun by means of its own short rod.|$|E

50|$|The {{single jacket}} is {{probably}} the oldest design of external <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> Despite being a tried and tested solution, it has some limitations. On large vessels, it can take many minutes to adjust {{the temperature of the}} fluid in the <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket.</b> This results in sluggish temperature control. The distribution of heat transfer fluid is also far from ideal and the heating or cooling tends to vary between the side walls and bottom dish. Another issue to consider is the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid which can oscillate (in response to the temperature control valve) over a wide temperature range to cause hot or cold spots at the jacket inlet points.|$|E

50|$|Extra heat is {{contributed by}} the intense {{pressure}} and friction taking place inside the barrel.

50|$|The {{constant}} flux <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> is {{a relatively}} recent development. It {{is not a single}} jacket but has a series of 20 or more small jacket elements.

50|$|A {{different}} beadbeater configuration, {{suitable for}} larger sample volumes, uses a fluorocarbon rotor inside a 15, 50 or 200 ml chamber to agitate the beads.

50|$|A {{variation}} of the 'heat flow' technique is called 'power compensation' calorimetry. This method uses a <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> operating at constant flow and temperature. The process temperature is regulated by adjusting {{the power of the}} electrical heater. When the experiment is started, the electrical heat and the cooling power (of the <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket)</b> are in balance. As the process heat load changes, the electrical power is varied {{in order to maintain the}} desired process temperature. The heat liberated or absorbed by the process is determined from the difference between the initial electrical power and the demand for electrical power at the time of measurement. The power compensation method is easier to set up than heat flow calorimetry but it suffers from the similar limitations since any change in product composition, liquid level, process temperature, agitation rate or viscosity will upset the calibration. The presence of an electrical heating element is also undesirable for process operations. The method is further limited by the fact that the largest heat it can measure is equal to the initial electrical power applied to the heater.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that heat {{transfer}} coefficient is also an important parameter. It has to be recognized however that large batch reactors with external <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets</b> have severe heat transfer constraints by virtue of design.
