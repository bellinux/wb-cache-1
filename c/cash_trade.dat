40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} contribution of cash market price manipulation to an option's value. When the underlying's transaction price follows an exogeneous fundamental process plus a price impact component influenced by trade, {{both sides of}} an option position may try to move the underlying cash price. Optimal <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> strategies consist of a manipulation component and a liquidity provision for the other traders in the market. When the price impact is transitory, the optimal cash strategy may involve ``pre-liquidation'' of manipulative <b>cash</b> <b>trades</b> to reduce trading costs. We find that cash market manipulation can represent {{a significant portion of}} an option's value. The price impact of manipulation can be non-monotonic and the optimal <b>cash</b> <b>trading</b> strategy can be discontinuous in the number of longs and shorts. ...|$|R

50|$|Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) was {{established}} in 1967 as a premier International Trading House fully owned by the Government of Pakistan. The Corporation has gone through substantial change in its role from Barter to Commodity Exchange Arrangement and to <b>cash</b> <b>trade</b> in line with free market economy approach adopted by the Government of Pakistan. It has remained engaged mainly in commodities trade with a modest beginning of trade of Rs. 115.763 million in 1967-68 and has registered turn over of Rs. 45,161.248 million in 2009-10. TCP’s current role of import of essential commodities is for improving supplies to ensure availability of commodities to consumers at affordable prices and market intervention for ensuring fair price to farmers. TCP being government organization, strictly follows Public Procurement Rules, 2004 to ensure transparency in all its procurement and has been focusing on decartelisation in all business activities like stevedoring, transportation, clearing and survey.

40|$|Firms depend {{heavily on}} trade credit. This paper {{introduces}} a trade credit network into a structural {{model of the}} economy. In an empirical analysis of the model, we find that trade credit is an elusive insurance: {{as long as a}} firm is financially unconstrained and times are good, more trade credit enhances sales stability and insures against shocks to the firm’s suppliers. However, if a firm becomes financially constrained or times are bad, trade credit fails to insure against supplier shocks. Moreover, if the firm is low on <b>cash,</b> <b>trade</b> credit propagates shocks from a supplier to its customer...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{explores the}} {{ecological}} and economic dimensions of sustainable resource {{use in the}} Bangweulu Swamps, Zambia, based on analysis of data accumulated over a ten year period. Analysis focuses on the four main commercial fishing methods, and reveals a transition of fish species and catch amount varied between 1983 and 1993 for each fishing method. The localized fish trading system has also changed over the decade. Due to the eco-nomic degradation of the nation, barter system has become more dominant than <b>cash</b> <b>trade</b> among the fishermen and the fish traders in the swamps. The author fears that a WWF-pro-moted project begun in 1990 has disregarded the indigenous management of the resources, and advocates {{taking into account the}} indigenous way of use...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the author}} has lived in Laos {{for less than a}} year, this paper is more a general survey than an {{analysis}} in depth. If anything, it should emphasize the large gaps existing in our knowledge of this area, {{from the point of view}} of economic, social and cultural anthropology. As is the case with countless other societies throughout the world, the people of Laos are going through a period of change. Culture change is, of course, an ever-present phenomenon, but few will doubt that its rate has increased greatly in recent years - as an outgrowth of closer contacts among people, directly and indirectly resulting from wars and the aspirations of new nations as well as by planned development and aid programs. In northern Laos there are a number of different peoples whose positions range from that of an almost entirely subsistence economy to that based primarily on barter and <b>cash</b> <b>trade.</b> It is the trade relations and economic interdependencies among these peoples which I wish to present here...|$|E
40|$|As an {{integrated}} {{part of a}} supply contract, trade credit has intrinsic connections with supply chain con-tracting and inventory management. Using a stylized model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms’ operations decisions and financial risks, this paper attempts to develop {{a deeper understanding of}} trade credit from an operational perspective. Revolving around the question of what role trade credit plays in channel coordination and inventory financing, * we demonstrate that with demand uncertainty, trade credit enhances supply chain efficiency by serving as a risk-sharing mechanism. Two forces determine the optimal trade credit terms: the sales motive (increasing sales through risk-sharing) and the financing motive (minimizing costs of financial distress through financial diversification, that is, employing multiple financing sources). Facing a trade credit contract, the retailer finances his inventory using a portfolio of <b>cash,</b> <b>trade</b> credit, and short-term debt, and the structure of this inventory financing portfolio depends on the retailer’s leverage† and bargaining power. Additionally, our model suggests that financial diversification provides an alternative explanation for the decentralization of some supply chains and the use of factoring in accounts receivable management. Finally, using a sample of firm-level data from Compustat, we find that the inventory financing pattern our model predicts exists {{in a wide range of}} firms.

40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{financing}} for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are equity (internally generated <b>cash),</b> <b>trade</b> credit paid on time, long and short term bank credits, delayed payment on trade credit and other debt. The marginal costs of each financing instrument are driven by asymmetric information (cost of gathering and analysing information) and transactions costs associated with non-payment (costs of collecting and selling collateral). According to the Pecking Order Theory, firms will choose the cheapest source in terms of cost. In {{the case of the}} static trade-off theory, firms choose finance so that the marginal costs across financing sources are all equal, thus an additional Euro of financing is obtained from all the sources whereas under the Pecking Order Theory the source is determined by how far down the Pecking Order the firm is presently located. In this paper, we argue that both of these theories miss the point that the marginal costs are dependent of the use of the funds, and the asset side of the balance sheet primarily determines the financing source for an additional Euro. An empirical analysis on a unique dataset of Portuguese SME’s confirms that the composition of the asset side of the balance sheet has an impact of the type of financing used and the Pecking Order Theory and the traditional Static Trade-off theory are rejected...|$|E
