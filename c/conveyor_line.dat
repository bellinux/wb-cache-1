40|$|Abstract — Conveyor based {{assembly}} {{production lines}} were first introduced by Ford H. in the 19 th Century, in {{a need for}} responding to the increasing market capacity then. Today, many challenges are imposed by <b>conveyor</b> <b>lines</b> including unbalanced station workloads, line inflexibility in coping with changes in demand. This paper describes the implementation of discrete event simulation in the improvement of <b>conveyor</b> based assembly <b>line</b> in a local manufacturer of home appliances.

40|$|The {{division}} of process in short-cycle tasks performed along belt conveyors became a widely sought organizational pattern in manufacturing operations following {{the emergence of}} mass production. Later on, when manufacturers had to face thechallenge to fulfi ll more diversifi ed demands, the derivation of &ldquo;mixed-model assembly lines&rdquo; extended the potential utilization of belt conveyors. However, more recently, a number of organizations are abandoning their utilization and switching {{to the adoption of}} work-cell based assembly systems. This article investigates such shift in operations strategy from an international perspective. Firstly, it discusses the experience ofelectric and electronics industries in Japan, where this trend became a major trend in the late 1990 s. To support the understanding of its underpinning rationality, a conceptual review on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} belt <b>conveyor</b> assembly <b>lines</b> is included. Next, it presents an in-depth longitudinal case study of a consumer electric products manufacturer in Brazil that embarked on a program to migrate from the utilization of <b>conveyor</b> <b>lines</b> to the work-cell based assembly system in one of itsplants. The implementation of a pilot work-cell in a kick-off project is analyzed and the prospects of the ongoing efforts to deploy similar maneuver in other facilities is presented...|$|R

50|$|Processing {{contaminants}} {{are generated}} during {{the processing of}} foods (e.g., heating, fermentation). They are absent in the raw materials, and are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided. Technological processes can be adjusted and/or optimized, however, {{in order to reduce}} the levels of formation of processing contaminants. Examples are: nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heterocyclic amines, histamine, acrylamide, furan, benzene, trans fat, 3-MCPD, semicarbazide, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and ethyl carbamate. There is also the possibility of metal chips from the processing equipment contaminating food. These can be identified using metal detection equipment. In many <b>conveyor</b> <b>lines,</b> the line will be stopped, or when weighing the product with a Check weigher, the item can be rejected for being over- or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{focuses on}} optimal design of block layouts when using {{more than one}} {{distance}} metric within a single facility. Previous work in block layout has assumed a single distance metric, usually the shortest rectilinear distance between department centroids, during the design step. However, most facilities {{have more than one}} method of material handling and alternative material handling systems can imply alternative distance metrics and cost structures. Specifically, up to three distance metrics within a single facility are considered – the shortest rectilinear distance between centroids (appropriate for automated guided vehicles and forklift trucks), the Tchebychev (maximum) distance (appropriate for overhead cranes) and the shortest Euclidean distance between centroids (appropriate for <b>conveyor</b> <b>lines).</b> Optimal block layouts using each of these distance metrics individually and then collectively are compared and contrasted. This approach {{can also be used to}} compare layouts when the choice of material handling system is not clear. It is argued that incorporating the distance metric that best reflects the planned material handling device is more realistic than previous formulations, avoids block layouts that are sub-optimal for the material handling systems installed, and is quite workable within a heuristic optimization framework. 1...|$|R
