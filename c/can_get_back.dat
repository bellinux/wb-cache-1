5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) gets a {{surprise}} {{phone call from}} her ex-boyfriend, Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), who says he will be coming to New York and wants {{to have dinner with}} her. She begins to hope that the two <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together, however, while watching The Today Show she discovers that he is getting married to a woman named Kaitlin (Kristin McGee). Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), warns her not to attempt revenge; nevertheless, Liz invites Floyd to a seafood restaurant where she had food poisoning on three separate occasions. He does not get food poisoning, but instead, Floyd, a recovering alcoholic, gets drunk off of the whiskey-based fish sauce. The two get into an argument, and after Floyd insults her, Liz leaves the restaurant. The next day, Floyd appears on The Today Show, but still drunk from the night before, refuses to leave the 30 Rock building. Liz apologizes to both Floyd and Kaitlin for getting him drunk. They accept the apology, and Kaitlin asks Liz to be a participant in their wedding, to which she agrees.|$|E

Jack hinted at a possible White Stripes reunion in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair.

500|$|Signalling {{systems are}} shaped by mutual {{interests}} between signallers and receivers. [...] An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay warning off a stalking predator is communicating something useful to the predator: {{that it has been}} detected by the prey; it might as well quit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey, which it is unlikely to catch. [...] When the predator gives up, the signaller <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to other tasks such as feeding. [...] Once the stalking predator is detected, the signalling prey and receiving predator thus have a mutual interest in terminating the hunt.|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear {{to be focused on}} the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{liked the}} episode {{because of its}} [...] "non-stop one liners and great guest cameos." [...] Sassone's only {{complaint}} was that the Jack, Nancy, and Avery love triangle be over, pointing {{out that he was}} sick of seeing Jack running around trying to keep Avery and Nancy from seeing each other. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that [...] "we got one of the best episode titles of any show this year", and was favorable to the guest spots from Jon Hamm, Dean Winters, and Michael Sheen, observing [...] "he episode joyfully gave us three great pairings for Liz to deal with, each presenting their own unique set of laughs." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating. Linda Holmes for National Public Radio said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was [...] "very funny", and commented that her favorite scene was when Liz visited Drew in hopes that the two <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together.|$|E
500|$|Cortana is {{constructed}} from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, {{the creator of}} the SPARTAN Project; Halsey's synaptic networks became the basis for Cortana's processors. According to the Halo novels, Cortana is classified as a [...] "smart" [...] AI, meaning that her creative matrix is allowed to expand, in contrast to the limited matrix of other [...] "dumb" [...] AI characters in the stories. This ability allows Cortana to learn and adapt beyond her basic parameters, but at the cost of a limited [...] "lifespan" [...] of only seven years; eventually, she will fall to rampancy, a terminal state of being for Artificial intelligence constructs, in which the AI [...] "develops delusions of godlike power", as well as utter contempt for its mentally inferior makers. Rampant AI normally cannot return to their previous state and must be destroyed before they harm themselves and others around them, but Cortana could be saved if she and the Master Chief <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Dr. Halsey on Earth; because she was created using the living tissue of Dr. Halsey.|$|E

Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> that shine." [...] However, the lyrics [...] "Super natural love conquers all" [...] could also be interpreted as feeling God's love. Adam Holz of Plugged In thought that the lyrics were [...] "depressing," [...] while Lauren Murphy of Entertainment IE felt that the lyrics [...] "When you and I say goodbye, I felt the angels cry" [...] were too sentimental. Although Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that the song had a [...] "sad" [...] tone, she praised its production. Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Angels Cry" [...] in his list of the album's best tracks. Michael Cragg of musicOMH was critical of the song, writing {{that it is a}} [...] "limp ballad" [...] which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of Carey's previous material, and concluded by writing that it [...] "ultimately ends up making you want to hear the original version more than anything". A reviewer for DJ Booth commented that the song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|Time James Poniewozik {{wrote that}} with [...] "Journey to Regionals", Glee [...] "returned to its roots, {{balancing}} its weirdness, snark and bombast with intimate stories of small-town high school life. And it, too, by showing {{what it can}} be at its best, made its case for staying around another year." [...] IGN's Eric Goldman rated [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] 8.5/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. He felt that while it did not match {{the standards of the}} mid–season finale episode [...] "Sectionals", it was [...] "still a very satisfying wrap up to the first year of Glee." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that he [...] "went into the finale peeved at how incredibly messy last week's episode was", but overall he deemed the finale a success. Vanity Fair Brett Berk found [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] a fulfilling, albeit [...] "pretty mediocre" [...] episode, describing it as having [...] "a sense of narrative cohesion that went beyond the writers’ usual throwing-flatware-down-the-garburator modality". Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping for a little more excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for so many of our characters we've come to know and love. Here's to hoping Glee <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> its stellar momentum in season two." ...|$|E
