40|$|Abstract. Rail steel at {{crossing}} areas bears much higher loads over any other {{section of a}} regular railway. Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> is normally used for its high load-carrying capability and reduced wear rate. However, since Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> tends to have casting defects, the cost of manufacturing defect-free Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> becomes quite expensive. Therefore, {{through the use of}} welding, this study investigates the possibility of resurfacing Mn-containing rail steel using a CH- 90 electrode as an alternative to completely replacing it. In this study, a series of experimental build up weldings was made and their microstructures, chemical compositions, work-hardening index and friction coefficients were investigated. The results showed that both microstructures and chemical compositions from the build up weld section were similar to that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel,</b> showing an austenitic microstructure with approximately 13 % Mn. The friction coefficients measured closely to one another as well (mu of Mn-containing steel = 0. 847 and mu of the resurfaced weld metal = 0. 831). The work-hardening index of the build up weld metal was 30 % higher than that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel.</b> This difference could be attributed to the residual stresses in the build up weld metal which indicates that the hardening speed of the build up weld metal is faster than that of Mn-containing <b>casting</b> <b>steel</b> by impact. Therefore, build up welding, using a Mn-alloyed steel electrode on rail steel, could be a safe and economic alternative to the high cost of Mn-containing casting rail steel replacement. 1...|$|E

Both the steels exhibited considerable secondary and tertiary stages in the creep tests conducted in the temperature range between 813 and 873 K (540 °C and 600 °C). The primary stage, though present, was rather negligible in higher temperature ranges. <b>Casting</b> <b>steel</b> showed wedge type cavities which grew as cracks along the grain boundaries.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments {{carried out on}} industrial melts. There has been tested the REM influence on carbon properties (0. 20 %C) as well as austenitic <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> Cr-Ni 18 / 8 +Ti type. It was found that REM cause an essential improvement of <b>cast</b> <b>steels</b> impact strength and in case of austenitic <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> – also the corrosion resistance improvement in boiling 65 %HNO 3 (Huey test) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> are primarily {{a function of}} chemical composition and solidification conditions i. e. primary structure, however, them can be change in a limited extent, by heat treatment. In the article the influence parameters of quenching on {{mechanical properties}} of low-alloy structural <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> modeled in terms of chemical composition, on the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> L 20 HGSNM, are presented. An attempt to quantify this relationship was made...|$|R
40|$|Non {{magnetic}} {{foundry materials}} such as the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> had not been used for abrasion resistant materials, because their hardnesses were very low. Usually, ceramics, cermets and cemented carbides are used for the abrasion resistant materials {{even though they are}} expensive compared with foundry materials. In this study, WC powder were inserted by using the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> (JIS SCS 13 A) and the austenitic cast iron (JIS FCA-NiCr 202) for producing surface hardened non magnetic materials. The melting temperature (pouring temperature) is lower in the austenitic cast iron than in the austenitic stainless <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> while the fluidity of the melts is superior in the austenitic cast iron. For the WC powder inserted specimens, the hardness, the abrasion resistance and the magnetic property were examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was much higher than that of base metals of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> and the <b>cast</b> iron, and that the magnetic permeability did not change by the inserting. Especially, a lot of WC powder was found to dissolve into the base metal in the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> than in the cast iron. In the case of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> Fe 3 W 3 C compound phase having high hardness of HV 800 was formed in the region of inserted WC powder. The hardness in the region of inserted WC powder was higher in the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> than in the cast iron, because the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> contained a lot of chromium compared with the cast iron...|$|R
