40|$|Being {{born with}} {{low birth weight}} (LBW) is {{recognized}} as a disadvantage due to risk of early growth retardation, fast catch up growth, infectious disease, developmental delay, and death during infancy and childhood, as well as development of obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) later in life. LBW is an indicator of fetal response to a limiting intrauterine environment, which may imply developmental changes in organs and tissue. Numerous studies have explored the effect of maternal intake of various nutrients and specific food items on birth weight (BW). Taking into account that people have diets consisting of many different food items, extraction of dietary patterns {{has emerged as a}} common way to describe diets and explore the effects on health outcomes. The present article aims to review studies investigating the associations between dietary patterns derived from a posteriori analysis and BW, or being small for gestational age (SGA). A PubMed search was conducted with the Mesh terms “pregnancy” OR “fetal growth retardation” OR “fetal development” OR “infant, small for gestational age” OR “birth weight” OR “infant, birth weight, low” AND “diet” OR “food habits”. Final number of articles included was seven, all which assessed diet by use of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Five studies explored dietary patterns using principal component analyses (PCA), while one study used cluster analyses and one study logistic regression. The studies reported between one and seven dietary patterns. Those patterns positively associated with BW were labeled “nutrient dense”, “protein rich”, “health conscious”, and “Mediterranean”. Those negatively associated with BW were labeled “Western”, “processed”, “vegetarian”, “transitional”, and “wheat products”. The dietary patterns “Western” and “wheat products” were also associated with higher risk of SGA babies, whereas a “traditional” pattern in New Zealand was inversely associated with having a SGA baby. The dietary patterns associated with higher BW or lower risk of having babies born SGA were named differently, but had similar <b>characteristics</b> <b>across</b> <b>studies,</b> most importantly high intakes of fruits, vegetables and dairy foods. Dietary patterns associated with lower BW or higher risk for giving birth to a SGA baby were characterized by high intakes of processed and high fat meat products, sugar, confectionaries, sweets, soft drinks, and unspecified or refined grains. All studies in this review were performed in high-income countries. More research is warranted to explore such associations in low and middle income countries, where underweight babies are a major health challenge many places. Furthermore, results from studies on associations between diet and BW need to be translated into practical advice for pregnant women, especially women at high risk of giving birth to babies with LBW...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{cost-effectiveness}} methodology in the context of a simultaneous modeling framework that provides consistent point and interval estimates. MethodsA simultaneous model of cost and effectiveness functions was developed to measure the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for competing medical interventions. A feasible nonlinear least-squares method was suggested to estimate the simultaneous model. Using a series of hypothetical data, a simulation analysis was performed to show the superior performance of the proposed model, relative to the average-effect model, a widely used approach to cost-effectiveness estimation. ResultsThe traditional average-effect approach has two shortcomings. First, it assumes two strong conditions: truly random distributions of all the significant nontreatment variables (both observed and unobserved) <b>across</b> <b>study</b> groups, and the independence of cost and effectiveness variables. Second, it does not give the confidence interval, an important measure to assess the stochastic nature and robustness of point estimates. In contrast, the simultaneous modeling approach provides marginal-effect estimates, imposing no restrictions on the random distributions of the individual <b>characteristics</b> <b>across</b> <b>study</b> groups. Furthermore, it takes into account the simultaneity of cost and effectiveness functions being estimated. The simulation analysis showed that the simultaneous modeling approach is significantly more unbiased and efficient in predicting the true cost-effectiveness ratio. ConclusionThe simultaneous modeling approach is superior to the average-effect approach in the estimation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using data with significant nontreatment confounding factors. The advantages of the simultaneous modeling approach are particularly appealing for evaluative studies dealing with large-scale retrospective data at the patient level...|$|R

The secondary aim was to study incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injuries in subgroups defined by risk factors for OASIS. Design Population-based cohort study. Setting University hospital setting in Oslo, Norway. Participants Two cohorts of all delivering women in the largest hospital in Norway during two time periods (2003 – 2005 and 2008 – 2010) were studied. After excluding caesarean sections and preterm deliveries (< week 32), the study population consisted of 31   709 deliveries, among which 907 women were identified with obstetric anal sphincter injury. Primary and secondary outcome measures Incidence of OASIS in two time periods. Maternal, obstetrical and foetal risk factors for OASIS were collected from the hospital obstetric database. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses, presenting adjusted ODs for OASIS, were performed. Results The OASIS incidence was significantly reduced by 50 %, from 4 % (591 / 14787) in the first time period to 1. 9 % (316 / 16   922) in the second. This reduction could not be explained by changes in population characteristics or OASIS risk factors during the study years. The reduction of incidence of OASIS between the two study periods was consistent across subgroups of women; regardless of parity, delivery method and infant birth weight.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Obstetric {{hemorrhage}} is {{the leading}} cause of maternal mortality, particularly in low-resource settings where women face significant delays in accessing definitive treatment. The Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) is a first-aid device to stabilize women in hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage. Prior studies on the effectiveness of the NASG have suffered from small sample sizes and insufficient statistical power. We sought to generate a summary effect estimate of this intervention by combining data from all previous quasi-experimental studies. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Five quasi-experimental studies that tested the NASG as treatment for hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage at the tertiary care facility level were included in the analysis. We evaluated heterogeneity of effect <b>across</b> <b>studies</b> and calculated pooled odds ratios. We also conducted a subgroup analysis among women in the most severe condition. 				 				 					 						Results 					Participant <b>characteristics</b> were similar <b>across</b> <b>studies</b> with some variation in hemorrhage etiology. Median blood loss was at least 50 % lower in the intervention group than the control group. The pooled odds ratio suggested that NASG intervention was associated with a 38 % significantly reduced odds of mortality among the overall sample, and a 59 % significantly reduced odds of mortality among the most severe women. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The results from this combined analysis suggest that NASG intervention is associated with a reduced odds of death for women with hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage.

40|$|International audienceContext; Our {{understanding}} of the star formation process has traditionally been confined to certain mass or luminosity boundaries because most studies focus only on low-, intermediate- or high-mass star-forming regions. As part of the "Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel" (WISH) key program, water and other important molecules, such as CO and OH, have been observed in 51 embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). The studied sample covers a range of luminosities from 10 ^ 5 L_sol. Aims; We analyse the CO line emission towards a large sample of protostars {{in terms of both}} line intensities and profiles. Methods; Herschel-HIFI spectra of the 12 CO 10 - 9, 13 CO 10 - 9 and C 18 O 5 - 4, 9 - 8 and 10 - 9 lines are analysed for a sample of 51 YSOs. In addition, JCMT spectra of 12 CO 3 - 2 and C 18 O 3 - 2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. Results; All observed CO and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation between the logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders of magnitude on both axes. This suggests that the high-J CO lines primarily trace the amount of dense gas associated with YSOs. This relation can be extended to larger (extragalactic) scales. The majority of the detected 12 CO line profiles can be decomposed into a broad and a narrow Gaussian component, while the C 18 O spectra are mainly fitted with a single Gaussian. A broadening of the line profile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, which is due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). The widths of the broad 12 CO 3 - 2 and 10 - 9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrow C 18 O 9 - 8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelope motions are related independent of the mass of the protostar.

In {{the region of}} the mouth of the Chasma Boreale re-entrant, the Rupes Tenuis unit is likely to extend further south-wards into the northern plains. This is suggested by the occurrence of isolated remnants that have been interpreted as basaltic shield volcanoes, maar craters or mud volcanoes in the past. As key elements of this study, we assessed the quantitative characteristics of this unit using layer attitudes derived from high-resolution images and terrain-model data, and by performing cross-correlations of prominent layers whose outcrops are observed at eight cone-like remnants. The identification and unambiguous correlation of <b>characteristic</b> layers <b>across</b> the <b>study</b> area pro-vided a reasonable basis for introducing at least three additional stratigraphical subunits of the Rupes Tenuis unit. Extrapolation of altitude data indicates a gentle southward dip of remnant layers, suggesting that the unit had a much larger areal extent in Martian history. The palaeo-layer contact between two subunits of the Rupes Tenuis unit correlates well with elevation values of the Hyperborea Lingula surface. Both results disagree with an interpretation of a volcanic origin for isolated mesas but underpin that they are erosional relicts of the Rupes Tenuis unit. Averag...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin {{in patients}} with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who have received autologous stem cell transplantation, from a Scottish healthcare payer perspective. Methods: A Microsoft Excel-based partitioned survival model comprising three health states (progression-free survival [PFS], post-progression survival, and death) was developed. Relevant comparators were chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (C/R) and C/R with intent to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Data {{were obtained from the}} pivotal phase II single-arm trial in 102 patients (SG 035 - 0003; NCT 00848926), a systematic literature review and clinical expert opinions (where empirical evidence was unavailable). PFS and overall survival for brentuximab vedotin were estimated using 5 -year follow-up data from SG 035 - 0003, and extrapolated using event rates observed for comparator treatments from published survival data. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration; alloSCT; treatment of adverse events; and long-term follow-up. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of uncertainty. Results: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for brentuximab vedotin was £ 38, 769 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) vs C/R, whereas C/R with intent to alloSCT was dominated by brentuximab vedotin. ICERs for brentuximab vedotin generated by the deterministic sensitivity analysis ranged between £ 32, 000 –£ 54, 000 per QALY. Including productivity benefits reduced the ICER to £ 28, 881 per QALY. Limitations: Limitations include lack of comparative data from this single arm study and the heterogeneous population. Inconsistent baseline <b>characteristic</b> reporting <b>across</b> <b>studies</b> prevented complete assessment of heterogeneity and the extent of potential bias in clinical and cost-effectiveness estimates. Conclusions: Although the base case ICER is above the threshold usually applied in Scotland, it is relatively low compared with other orphan drugs, and lower than the ICER generated using a previous data cut of SG 035 - 0003 that informed a positive recommendation from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, under its decision-making framework for assessment of ultra-orphan medicines...|$|R

Unsupervised clustering offers the promise of 'unbiased' data-driven assessment of COPD heterogeneity. Multiple groups have identified COPD subtypes using cluster analysis, but there has been no systematic assessment of the reproducibility of these subtypes. Objective We performed clustering analyses across 10 cohorts in North America and Europe in order to assess the reproducibility of (1) correlation patterns of key COPD-related clinical characteristics and (2) clustering results. Methods We studied 17 146 individuals with COPD using identical methods and common COPD-related <b>characteristics</b> <b>across</b> cohorts (FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, FVC, body mass index, Modified Medical Research Council score, asthma and cardiovascular comorbid disease). Correlation patterns between these clinical characteristics were assessed by principal components analysis (PCA).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The "managed care" {{model of}} health care refers to {{organizational}} techniques intended to reduce health care provision costs while improving quality of care. One technique this model necessitates is "team care" as opposed to single-clinician care for patients. Status characteristics theory suggests that relative differences in social status among mental health care providers can affect team building and decision making processes, and that these interrelated social processes may, in turn, affect team outcomes including patient health. Implications of status characteristics, team building, and decision making processes for patient health outcomes have not been examined empirically. In three interrelated studies, this dissertation explores contexts, processes, and consequences {{that are associated with}} status characteristics in "collaborative care," an innovative, evidence-based form of team care for mental health developed and tested at the University of Washington Department Of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Collaborative care teams vary in size and composition in accordance with the expectation that resources (e. g. referrals to psychiatrists) are allocated according to patient need (i. e. patients' clinical characteristics do drive resource allocation). However, findings also suggest that team processes (such as amount of deliberation in teams), care outcomes (such as screening for posttraumatic stress disorder), and even patient health (improvement in symptoms of mental health disorder) are influenced by status <b>characteristics.</b> <b>Across</b> the three <b>studies,</b> provider gender was consistently associated with differences in health and care outcomes for patients, and these effects were magnified for tasks that are plausibly associated traditional gender roles. Effects of team-level factors such as gender balance, gender heterogeneity, tenure diversity, and diversity in expertise varied according to tasks and outcomes. Of the team-level factors examined in these studies, amount of deliberation among care providers appeared most consistently as both an effect of status characteristics and as a potentially helpful mediator of patients' health and care outcomes...|$|R

All 238 Shigella strains isolated between 2003 and 2009 were compared to 618 isolates from the period 1987 – 1994 and 218 Shigella strains isolated during 1995 – 2002 with regard to antimicrobial resistance patterns and patient clinical characteristics. ResultsThe predominant species during all periods was Shigella sonnei, with an increasing predominance across the periods (64. 0 %, 71. 5 %, and 87. 8 %, respectively; p< 0. 001). Neither the prevalence of bloody diarrhea nor other clinical <b>characteristics</b> changed <b>across</b> the <b>study</b> periods, except for the prevalence of dehydration, which increased (11. 0 %, 20. 6 %, and 28. 6 %, respectively; p< 0. 001). During the period 2003 – 2009, 69. 9 % of Shigella were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 35. 8 % to ampicillin, and 4. 7 % to nalidixic acid. No case resistant to ciprofloxacin was detected. Multidrug resistance was also found to be similar in the last two periods (24. 0 % vs. 28. 1 %, respectively). ConclusionsThere was both a microbiological and a clinical change in childhood Shigella gastroenteritis cases over the 22 years. The antibiotic resistance pattern appears to have remained stable over the last two periods. There is a need to re-examine the criteria and clinical management guidelines for suspected shigellosis cases...|$|R
