40|$|Abstract. Worm cam {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} indexing mechanism which is widely used in automatic machinery. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the mechanism has high demands on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>cam.</b> The machining methods of <b>cylinder</b> <b>cam</b> are unique and the methods of special machine tool and NC machining are the two methods that general adopted in the machining of it. In this paper, the method of CNC Programming which is used for machining <b>cylinder</b> <b>cam</b> in 5 -axeses high speed DMU 70 eVolution Machining Center is introduced. The machining principle of <b>cylinder</b> <b>cam</b> has been studied, and the mathematical model for CNC Programming has also been worked out. The automated compensation of cutting tool’s radius is used in this field for the first time. Worm {{cam mechanism}} <b>Cylinder</b> <b>cam</b> mechanism is widely used in automatic machinery. Fig. 1 shows one kind of <b>cylinder</b> <b>cam</b> mechanism. When the camshaft rotates, the groove and the convex ridge in the cam make the rollers revolve round {{the center of the}} indexing plate, so the cyclical movement of indexing plate is realized. This mechanism is mainly used in the occasions of more indexing workstations, larger load and lower speed. The speed and acceleration rules of its cam follower can be chosen according to the predetermined motion demands, and then realize the precise transmission. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the special and complex shape, the machining methods of this mechanism are unique. The common machining methods of worm cam have the following two: The method of special machine tool: Because the indexing curves of cam have a high transmission precision requirement and complex shape, and also, they are space curved face, so we could take advantage of copying machine to machine the cam curves by model or use the special machine tool to machine them...|$|E

40|$|During {{some tests}} of a one-cylinder engine, using gas oil (diesel engine oil, {{specific}} gravity 0. 86 at 60 F) with solid injection and compression ignition, {{it was found}} to be necessary to increase either the jacket water temperature or the compression pressure in order to start the engine. It was found that a sufficient increase in compression pressure could be obtained simply by attaching a long pipe to the inlet flange of the cylinder. However, since no data were available giving the values of the increase in compression pressure that might be expected from such a step-up, an investigation was made covering some engine speeds between 500 r. p. m. and 1800 r. p. m. The data obtained are included here in the form of curves. Although this data is not strictly applicable to another engine, it should give indications of what might be expected with such a set-up on an engine operating at similar speeds. The engine used was a single cylinder Liberty, 5 -inch bore and 7 -inch stroke, having standard <b>cylinder,</b> <b>cams,</b> valves, and valve timing and operating on a four-stroke cycle...|$|R

The methods {{are based on the}} measurement of the electrical resistance and/or capacitance, and are used to determine the thickness of lubricating films as well as to detect asperity contact in the mixed lubrication regime. The experimental works are introduced in which these methods are used in conventional sliding and rolling/sliding tests and machine component tests including piston ring and <b>cylinder</b> liner, <b>cam</b> and follower, and gears. Also some works on the effect of electric field upon lubrication phenomena are introduced. Advantages and disadvantages of the electrical methods are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{cylindrical}} cam or barrel cam is a cam {{in which the}} follower rides {{on the surface of}} a cylinder. In the most common type, the follower rides in a groove cut into the surface of a <b>cylinder.</b> These <b>cams</b> are principally used to convert rotational motion to linear motion parallel to the rotational axis of the cylinder. A cylinder may have several grooves cut into the surface and drive several followers. Cylindrical cams can provide motions that involve more than a single rotation of the cylinder and generally provide positive positioning, removing the need for a spring or other provision to keep the follower in contact with the control surface.|$|R

50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock key is {{commonly}} found on homes. When held upright, {{as if to}} open a door, a series of grooves {{on either side of}} the key (the key's blade) limits the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the grooves on the blade of the key align with the wards in the keyway allowing or denying entry to the cylinder. Then a series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade called bittings allow pins or wafers to move up and down until they align with the shear line of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the <b>cylinder</b> or <b>cam</b> to rotate freely inside the lock, which opens the lock.|$|R

50|$|The single gear-driven {{camshaft}} {{is arranged}} {{so that each}} lobe operates the exhaust valves {{on a pair of}} <b>cylinders.</b> Roller <b>cam</b> followers are used. In the middle of the camshaft is a speed governor. The governor causes lengthwise movement of the camshaft, and the cam-lobes are slightly widened to allow for this. The speed-regulation caused by the governor is set by a lever on the steering column and the same mechanism advances the spark with increased engine speed. The operation of the governor is overridden by the foot throttle (either slower or faster - the pedal is of a type allowing it to be raised or depressed), but for normal running the governor offers an early form of cruise control.|$|R
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the {{intake and exhaust}} {{camshaft}} along with the oil and water pumps. The cam journal is supported on 5 points between the valve lifters of each cylinder and {{on the front of}} the <b>cylinder</b> head. The <b>cam</b> journals are lubricated by oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft. To adjust the valve clearance in the first two generations, a shim over bucket system is employed. In the following generations a shim under bucket system is used.|$|R

The Twin <b>Cam</b> <b>cylinder</b> head had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with hydraulic tappets and roller cams replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.|$|R

The cylinder head was similar in design but different in appearance to the Lotus one; in particular the cam carriers on the Vauxhall engine were angled upwards so that the covers were both horizontal (those on the Lotus engine were equal about the cylinder centreline).|$|R
5000|$|The IMP was {{a genuine}} {{mechanical}} computer. From the sole solenoid actuator's incremental motion, the horological mechanism derived irregular oscillating functions which in turn rotated the globe and varied its axis, and also moved its two cylindrical indicators for longitude and latitude.

50|$|Nissan {{leveraged}} the Austin patents {{to further}} {{develop their own}} modern engine designs past what the Austin's A- and B-family designs offered. The apex of the Austin-derived engines was the new design A series engine in 1966.

This engine powered the new Datsun 510, which gained Nissan respect in the worldwide sedan market. Then, in 1969 Nissan introduced the Datsun 240Z sports car which used a six-cylinder variation of the L series engine, developed under Nissan Machinery (Nissan Koki Co., Ltd. 日産工機) in 1964, a former remnant of another auto manufacturer Kurogane.
