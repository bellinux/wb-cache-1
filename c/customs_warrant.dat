The {{statistics}} {{offices in}} the region utilize {{state of the art}} technology for processing their trade data, and report producing statistics on a regular basis. The periods of publications are monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, annually, and semi-annually, but vary amongst countries. 2. The warrants presented by importers and exporters to the customs departments for the clearance of goods is the main source of trade data in each country. After checking and processing, a copy of the warrants is placed in batches and forwarded to the statistics office, usually on a monthly basis. In some countries, the data is also forwarded on electronic medium. 3. At the statistics offices, the data is verified and input to their computerized systems. The systems carry out several validity checks on the data, prior to addition to the databases. 4. The nomenclature used by almost all the customs departments is the 1996 Harmonized System (HS);. At the statistics offices, the HS codes are mapped to their equivalent SITC Rev. 3 codes for the production of trade reports. 5. Two systems, currently implemented by many countries in the region, can make valuable contributions to this project. These are the ASYCUDA customs system (used by fourteen member states); and the Eurotrace National statistics system (used by eight);. 6. There are approximately One Hundred and Forty One (141); Officers working on trade statistics. Of these, One Hundred and Two (102); are occupied in the capturing of trade data and Thirty-Nine (39); in the production of trade statistics. 7. All countries analyze their trade data by country of origin and country of destination. 8. Most countries record transport data in their databases such as country of origin/consignment/destination, net weight, means of transport (air, ship etc.);, and country of registration of the carrier. The name of the carrier is not stored but is available on the <b>customs</b> <b>warrant.</b> 9. All countries use in-house computers for the processing of their trade statistics. In most cases, the computer/s is/are dedicated to this application. Except for two (2); countries, no additional hardware should be required to meet the additional need for providing trade data to this project. 10. Provided the additional tasks to be carried out for the extraction of data at the national statistical offices are kept to a minimum, it is likely that no additional staff would be required for the purpose of extracting and forwarding data to ECLAC for the proposed system. 11. Except for the Country and Currency codes, the many codes used in the countries are not standardized. This is a drawback which the project will have to address. It is recommended that the UN international codes should be adopted, and that data from the national statistics offices be mapped to these codes. 12. The study suggests that the best source for obtaining trade data for the regional databases is the national statistics office in each country. The statistics offices collect data for the entire country's trade and carries out extensive checking on the accuracy of the data. 13. Tables which would be needed in the proposed system such as Correlation tables (HS-SITC Rev. 3);, Currency codes, and Country codes can be taken from the Eurotrace system, instead of repeating the lengthy and costly tasks of re-keying and checking. 14. Member States provide their trade statistics to international and regional organizations such as the UN Statistics Division, ECLAC, International Monetary Fund, CARICOM, Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, and the Organization for Eastern Caribbean States. 15. A risk factor to the sustenance of this system would be the failure of countries to forward their trade data on a timely basis to ECLAC for updating its databases and preparing statistical reports. 16. The Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA); and the Economic Committee of West African States (ECOWAS); communities have developed regional databases and produce regional trade data, accessible on the Internet. The project is urged to research these developments...|$|E

6000|$|Should {{a member}} of the {{legislature}} be bound by the instructions of his constituents? Should he be the organ of their sentiments, or of his own? their ambassador to a congress, or their professional agent, empowered not only to act for them, but to judge for them what ought to be done? These two theories of the duty of a legislator in a representative government have each its supporters, and each is the recognized doctrine of some representative governments. In the Dutch United Provinces, the members of the States-General were mere delegates; and to such a length was the doctrine carried, that when any important question arose which had not been provided for in their instructions, they had to refer back to their constituents, exactly as an ambassador does to the government from which he is accredited. In this and most other countries which possess representative constitutions, law and <b>custom</b> <b>warrant</b> {{a member of}} Parliament in voting according to his opinion of right, however different from that of his constituents; but there is a floating notion of the opposite kind, which has considerable practical operation on many minds, even of members of Parliament, and often makes them, independently of desire for popularity or concern for their re-election, feel bound in conscience to let their conduct on questions on which their constituents have a decided opinion be the expression of that opinion rather than of their own. Abstractedly from positive law, and from the historical traditions of any particular people, which of these notions of the duty of a representative is the true one? ...|$|R
25|$|Newly hired ICE law {{enforcement}} personnel receive their {{training at the}} Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia. To meet division specific academic and practical instruction, the ICE Academy varies in length from 4 to 6 months depending on the position. Furthermore, following graduation, all ICE {{law enforcement}} personnel undergo additional post academy training, as well as career-continuous training. Specific course curriculum is kept confidential, but both ERO and HSI new hires undergo training related to basic law enforcement tactics, immigration law, firearms training, emergency response driving, and Constitutional law. HSI agents also receive training regarding U.S. <b>customs</b> law, <b>warrant</b> service, advanced tactics, undercover operations, criminal interrogation, weapons of mass destruction, and other subjects routinely encountered by HSI agents in the field. ERO deportation officers undergo several weeks of intensive Spanish language training prior to graduating.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{structured}} knowledge representations-ontologies and terminologies-has become {{standard in}} biomedicine. Definitions of ontologies vary widely, {{as do the}} values and philosophies that underlie them. In seeking to make these views explicit, we conducted and summarized interviews with a dozen leading ontologists. Their views clustered into three broad perspectives that we summarize as mathematics, computer code, and Esperanto. Ontology as mathematics puts the ultimate premium on rigor and logic, symmetry and consistency of representation across scientific subfields, and the inclusion of only established, non-contradictory knowledge. Ontology as computer code focuses on utility and cultivates diversity, fitting ontologies to their purpose. Like computer languages C++, Prolog, and HTML, the code perspective holds that diverse applications <b>warrant</b> <b>custom</b> designed ontologies. Ontology as Esperanto focuses on facilitating cross-disciplinary communication, knowledge cross-referencing, and computation across datasets from diverse communities. We show how these views align with classical divides in science and suggest how a synthesis of their concerns could strengthen {{the next generation of}} biomedical ontologies...|$|R
6000|$|Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon, Casting to South his eye {{across the}} bourne Of his {{dominion}} (where the Palmiped, With leathers 'twixt his toes, paddles his marsh, Amphibious) saw a rising cloud of hats, And heard a faint, far sound of distant cheers Below the swell of the horizon. [...] "Lo," [...] Cried one, [...] "the President! the President!" [...] All footed webwise then {{took up the}} word-- The hill tribes and the tribes lacustrine and The folk riparian and littoral, Cried with one voice: [...] "The President! He comes!" [...] And some there were who flung their headgear up In emulation of the Southern mob; While some, more soberly disposed, stood still And silently had fits; and others made Such reverent genuflexions as they could, Having that climate in their bones. Then spake The Court Dunce, humbly, as became him: [...] "Sire, If thou, as heretofore thou hast, wilt deign To reap advantage of a fool's advice By action ordered after nature's way, As in thy people manifest (for still Stupidity's the only wisdom) thou Wilt get thee straight unto to the border land To mark the President's approach with such Due, decent courtesy as it shall seem We have in <b>custom</b> the best <b>warrant</b> for." ...|$|R
