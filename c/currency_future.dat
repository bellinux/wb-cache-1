50|$|A <b>currency</b> <b>future,</b> {{also known}} as an FX future or a foreign {{exchange}} future, is a futures contract to exchange one currency for another at a specified date in the future at a price (exchange rate) that is fixed on the purchase date; see Foreign exchange derivative. Typically, one of the currencies is the US dollar. The price of a future is then in terms of US dollars per unit of other currency. This can {{be different from the}} standard way of quoting in the spot foreign exchange markets. The trade unit of each contract is then a certain amount of other currency, for instance €125,000. Most contracts have physical delivery, so for those held {{at the end of the}} last trading day, actual payments are made in each currency. However, most contracts are closed out before that. Investors can close out the contract at any time prior to the contract's delivery date.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:   The {{last decade}} {{currency}} carry trade {{has gained a}} lot of popularity because of their apparent profitability. It is a strategy that has been developed to exploit violations of the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity. In particular, an investor must take a short position in a low-yielding currency to fund a long position in a high-yielding currency. In this research, we tried to contribute in the previous literature for the currency carry trade and its characteristics by using a different approach. Most of the researches that have been conducted in this area concern the risk agents associated with this strategy. However, in our research we investigated the relationship between currency carry trade and two equity indexes, one from the European market (DAX) and one from the American (DJIA). In order to do that, we estimated the returns of the DAX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) {{as well as the}} returns of a carry trade index created by the Deutsche Bank, the Deutsche Bank’s G 10 <b>Currency</b> <b>Future</b> Harvest index. The returns were estimated for a time period of twenty years (1995 - 2014). More specific, we examined whether there is granger causality between the returns of carry trade and of DAX/DJIA, whether there is leverage effect on the returns of the same index and finally whether changes in the returns of one of those indexes can affect the subsequent volatility of the other two. For being able to do this examination, we used two different statistical models, the Vector Autoregression (VAR) and the EGARCH [1, 1] model.        The first empirical finding suggests that there is granger causal effect from the two equity markets to carry trade, however the carry trade granger cause only to DJIA index. The second finding indicates that there no leverage effect form the past returns to the future volatility for all the three indexes. Finally, the last finding suggests that the volatility process on the returns of one index cannot be determined by changes in the returns of the other two indexes.

40|$|Currency {{carry trade}} is an {{investment}} strategy that recently started gaining {{a lot of interest}} not only among investors and financial institutions but also academically. One of the underlying theoretical assumptions regarding the mechanisms of the foreign exchange market, the Uncovered Interest Parity has frequently been disproved in practice which has led to the conclusion that carry trade is profitable in practice. The function of a carry trade strategy is that a short position is taken in a low interest rate currency to finance a long position in another currency offering higher yields. This thesis is adding to the existing literature that is explaining the characteristics of currency carry trade but is adopting a different approach than most other recent researches that has focused on identifying especially risk factors. Gold as a financial asset has also received much attention largely due to its, contrarily to other asset classes, low dependence on macroeconomic factors. This makes gold desirable to diversify portfolios and decreasing overall risks. By investigating how the returns of currency carry trades and gold relates to each other an increased understanding in how carry trades can be beneficially included in managing portfolios are developed. Looking at a currency carry trade index, Deutsche Bank’s G 10 <b>Currency</b> <b>Future</b> Harvest index, and the development of the gold price at the London bullion market for the 20 year period of 1993 - 2013 this research is exploring correlation, mean and volatility spillover effects. Spearman’s correlation, Vector Autoregression and a diagonal BEKK GARCH model are employed to test these effects. It also investigates if gold possesses hedge, diversifier and safe haven characteristics when combined with carry trades as it has been found to do with stock markets. This is determined by a regression analysis and supplemented by a portfolio simulation. This thesis found that there is a low positive correlation between the returns of gold and currency carry trades and that there is spillover effects as well between the two in both returns and volatility. This in addition to the regression analysis and portfolio analysis determined that there are diversification benefits by adding gold to a portfolio consisting of currency carry trade in the form of higher risk adjusted returns. However special caution has to be taken to the spillover effects as these complicate the relationship between the returns of the two variables and especially the volatility spillover effects slightly decreases the potential diversification benefit. The regression analysis concluded that gold work as a diversifier for carry trade but could not determine if it also exhibited hedge or safe haven characteristics. These findings pushes the existing understanding of carry trades forward and adds to focus of matching carry trades within a portfolio which could have implications to more efficiently match risks and returns by combining several asset classes in portfolio management...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} tested the efficiency, weak form {{according}} to EMH, of the <b>currency</b> <b>future</b> market. The efficiency test has been {{incorporated in the}} research question since the market has to be efficient {{in order for the}} future to work as predictor of the future spot rate - Can currency futures be used as a tool for predicting futures spot exchange rate? The two sub questions are - Is the prediction power of currency futures stable over time and is the prediction power of currency futures similar for different currencies?   The main theory in the research is the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Random Walk Hypothesis. The research was conducted with a positivistic philosophy in conjunction with a realistic approach. Since the research question has been deducted from the theoretical framework the research has a deductive approach, a quantitative technique was adapted when the data at hand was mainly future and spot rate data.   Data on 13 currencies ranging from 2005 to 2010 was used. The prices were available in weekly intervals for all currencies except for the Brazilian real, Swiss frank and the Mexican peso. The statistical test that was used is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Phillips-Ouliaris cointegration test. The test was conducted on the whole timeframe. After that, the data was divided into three sub periods to show if the efficiency where different in the period before the crises (2005 - 2007), during the crises (2008 - 2009) and after the crises (2010). The test has also been done on annual and quarterly data to show if the length of the time period tested has an effect on efficiency. The PO test has been conducted on all data and the ADF test has been conducted on the whole timeframe and the sub periods.   The results show that, ten of the currencies which we had weakly data, the future is a good predictor of the future spot exchange rate. This is true when the tests are done on an interval of one year and more. For the three currencies that we had monthly data, the results showed cointegration on the whole timeframe. When shorter time periods were tested the currencies that consisted of monthly data showed no cointegration sooner than the weakly data. When test is done on quarterly data, only one test is cointegrated. It cannot concluded that, the future was not a good predictor for the future spot exchange rate during this time, merely that this particular test might be the true one and that the tests where not able to capture it. Several reasons for this are presented in the analysis chapter, where the statistical tests and their design are mentioned among other reasons. ...|$|E

The weak sense of market efficiency is tested, with the random walk model being used as the benchmark for comparing univariate models fitted to the three major <b>currency</b> <b>futures,</b> namely deutschmark. Japanese yen and British pound. In weak-form tests of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), security prices reflect fully all available information based on past values of price data. This means that the weak form tests whether all information contained in the historical prices is fully reflected in current prices. A restrictive version of the weak form of the EMH is the random walk model, which assumes that successive returns are independent and identically distributed over time. Thus, evidence supporting the random walk model is evidence supporting the weak form efficiency of the EMH. Univariate modelling of the data involves fitting several moving average, autoregressive and autoregressive moving average specifications. Using the mean absolute error (MAE), the performances of the estimated models are compared against the random walk model.
