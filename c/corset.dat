5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel <b>corset</b> instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new <b>corset</b> as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel <b>corset.</b> A form of metal <b>corset</b> or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{are found}} {{in a number of}} museum {{collections}} around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron <b>corset</b> (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron <b>corset</b> in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have {{occasionally}} {{been made}} for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal <b>corset</b> made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight-lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced <b>corset.</b> Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other services in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, fashion changed again, {{with the}} {{waistline}} lowered back to almost the natural position. <b>Corsets</b> {{began to be}} made with some padding and more boning. Some women made their own, while others bought their <b>corsets.</b> <b>Corsets</b> {{were one of the}} first mass-produced garments for women. <b>Corsets</b> began to be more heavily boned in the 1840s. By 1850, steel boning became popular.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{hourglass}} <b>corsets</b> {{were not}} laced {{as tightly as}} the straight-fronted <b>corsets</b> fashionable {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. <b>Corsets</b> were still the norm, but they no longer had the exaggerated wide-narrow-wide silhouette of the hourglass shape.|$|R
30|$|The <b>corsets</b> are {{the small}} {{set of points}} that {{represent}} the larger population of data and maintain the actual properties of overall population. These properties vary by nature of knowledge discovery algorithms. For example, the <b>corsets</b> representing first k-components maps with first k-components in the big data. Similarly, the <b>corsets</b> containing k-clusters with radius r approximate the big data and obtain the k-clusters with same r. In this way, the authors [11] applied <b>corsets</b> to reduce the big data into small and manageable size, which reduces the overall data complexity. The authors mapped <b>corsets</b> with k-means, principal component analysis (PCA) and projective clustering algorithms deployed with massively parallel streaming data [69, 70]. The big data is reduced {{in such a way}} that high dimensions of input space do not affect the cardinalities of <b>corsets.</b> In addition, the <b>corsets</b> are merged by maintaining the property that union of two <b>corsets</b> represents the reduced set of union of two big datasets. The experimental results showed that <b>corsets</b> are suitable to address NP-hard problems in massively parallel and streaming data environments where big data complexity is reduced by application of data processing algorithms on small datasets that are approximated from big data. In addition, the <b>corsets</b> are paradigm shift in big data analysis where the focus of research remains on big data reduction instead of improving the computational efficiency of existing algorithms.|$|R
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Sue Blane was not keen {{on working}} for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of The Maids, where Curry had worn a woman's <b>corset</b> in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the <b>corset</b> from the other production for Rocky Horror. Blane admits {{that she did not}} conduct research for her designing, had never seen a science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Eight years later, Norrington is {{promoted}} to Commodore and proposes to Elizabeth, but her <b>corset</b> makes her faint {{and fall into}} the sea and activate the medallion. Captain Jack Sparrow comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues her. Norrington identifies Jack, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks have {{a complex}} dermal <b>corset</b> made of {{flexible}} collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This {{works as an}} outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.|$|E

2500|$|Flappers did {{away with}} <b>corsets</b> and pantaloons in favor of [...] "step-in" [...] panties. Without the old {{restrictive}} <b>corsets,</b> flappers wore simple bust bodices to restrain their chest when dancing. They also wore new, softer and suppler <b>corsets</b> that reached to their hips, smoothing the whole frame, giving women a straight up and down appearance, {{as opposed to the}} old <b>corsets</b> which slenderized the waist and accented the hips and bust.|$|R
40|$|Between 1820 and 1850, {{an active}} and robust {{movement}} to eradicate women’s <b>corsets</b> {{and the practice of}} tight-lacing became popular in the press. Primarily male reformers responding to forces of modernization attacked women’s <b>corsets</b> in newspapers with a series of arguments designed to shame, scare, and blame women. Female authors, however, challenged male reformers’ knowledge of <b>corsets</b> and thus their authority to speak about the garment. Without overtly challenging the prevailing gender hierarchy and through articulation of their own logic about <b>corsets,</b> women instead asserted their own sex’s authority to speak publicly about <b>corsets</b> and women’s bodies...|$|R
5|$|A steel <b>corset</b> in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new <b>corset,</b> as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch <b>corset</b> covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic <b>corset</b> declined, which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to designing and making <b>corsets,</b> Mr Pearl is notable for wearing <b>corsets</b> himself. At {{the age of}} 30, he was inspired to start doing so after seeing an image of Fakir Musafar with a tightly <b>corseted</b> waist. The designer subsequently became a dedicated wearer of waist-training <b>corsets,</b> removing them only for bathing. Over 22 years he gradually reduced his waist measurement to eighteen inches. In 2013, Pearl noted that he enjoyed the physical experience of wearing <b>corsets,</b> particularly the effects on his breathing, circulation and the pressure on his organs, and that these {{had an effect on}} both his physical and mental awareness. Other commentators have noted that Pearl, as a highly private, publicity-shy individual, uses <b>corsets</b> and tight-lacing to embody his true self and personal identity, rather than imposing his theories and appearance on others for publicity and self-promotion purposes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Corsets</b> that {{enhanced}} cleavage {{were introduced}} in the mid-16th century. By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing <b>corsets</b> grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward. The tight lacing of <b>corsets</b> worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage {{and the size of}} the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.|$|R
50|$|Some neck <b>corsets</b> and posture collars are {{designed}} to also cover the mouth. These devices, often called mouth <b>corsets,</b> are primarily used in BDSM {{because they can be}} used as a gag.|$|R
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium <b>corset</b> coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a <b>corset,</b> remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady <b>Corset</b> Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5000|$|The 1900s: At the time, women’s {{figures are}} still tightly <b>corseted</b> in dresses with a train. Maurice Kretz, François Auguste Gamichon’s nephew, begins to {{manufacture}} <b>corsets</b> made of elastic fabrics in 1902.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Corsets</b> are {{typically}} constructed of a flexible material (like cloth, particularly coutil, or leather) stiffened with boning (also called ribs or stays) inserted into channels in the cloth or leather. In the 18th and early 19th century, thin strips of baleen, also called whalebone, were favoured for the boning.Plastic {{is now the}} most commonly used material for lightweight, faux <b>corsets</b> and the majority of poor-quality <b>corsets.</b> Spring and/or spiral steel is preferred for stronger and generally better quality <b>corsets.</b> Other materials used for boning have included ivory, wood, and cane. (By contrast, a girdle is usually made of elasticized fabric, without boning.) ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Corsets</b> were {{originally}} quilted waistcoats, which French women wore {{as an alternative}} to stiff <b>corsets.</b> They were only quilted linen, laced in the front, and un-boned. This garment was meant to be worn on informal occasions, while stays were worn for court dress. In the 1790s, stays began to fall out of fashion. This development coincided with the French Revolution and the adoption of neoclassical styles of dress. Interestingly, it was the men, Dandies, who began to wear <b>corsets.</b> The fashion persisted through the 1840s, though after 1850 men who wore <b>corsets</b> claimed they needed them for [...] "back pain".|$|R
5|$|Portsmouth was {{affected}} by the British Empire's decline {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century. Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46% of workforce in 1951 to 14% in 1966, drastically reducing the manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. Traditional industries such as brewing and <b>corset</b> making disappeared during this time, though electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks made to traditional sectors, Portsmouth still remained an attractive place for industry. In 1968, Zurich Insurance Group moved their UK headquarters to the city, with IBM relocating their European headquarters in 1979. The population of the city had dropped from approximately 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s. In the early 1980s, then Defence Secretary John Nott concluded that of the four home dockyards, both Portsmouth and Chatham would be closed. However, Portsmouth City Council won a concession, and rather than face closure, the dockyard was downgraded to a naval base.|$|E
5|$|The car {{stops in}} front of the club Crazy Horse. The {{following}} scenes show the singer emerging in a different set with a black background, as well as dancing atop a grand piano. Later, she is seen with female hands on her body as she dances seductively. Other scenes show her wearing lingerie and performing a pole dance with several other female dancers. Shortly afterwards, Beyoncé performs a choreographed chair dance across a purple background as Jay-Z is seen in the audience watching her while smoking a cigar. The end of the video shows the singer dancing with another woman next to her to a projected cheetah print. The last seconds cut to the breakfast table where Beyoncé is seen. For the video, the singer wears an archival <b>corset</b> by Christian Lacroix, lace gloves by Chanel, and a crystal mask by Atelier Swarovski.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy <b>corset</b> and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black <b>corset.</b> Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a <b>corset</b> and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a <b>corset</b> and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
5000|$|Tight, leather <b>corsets</b> {{are another}} staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long opera gloves or fingerless gloves, {{are often a}} further {{accessory}} to emphasize the feminine role. Neck <b>corsets</b> may also be worn.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>corsets</b> of the 16th through 18th centuries (called [...] "stays", [...] "bodies" [...] or [...] "corps") were {{intended}} to mold the upper torso into a rigid cone like shape. The earliest <b>corsets</b> had a wooden busk placed down the center fronts of the <b>corsets.</b> (These early busks were different from the newer, steel busks which have clasps to open and close.) <b>Corsets</b> of the 17th and 18th centuries were most often heavily boned {{with little or no}} space between the bone channels. This was necessary to force the body to conform to the desired shape of the era. At the time, the most popular materials used for the boning were Giant reeds or whalebone.|$|R
