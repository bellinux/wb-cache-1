A second treaty, between France and Sardinia, saw France cede Lombardy to Sardinia. The third treaty, signed by all three powers, re-established a state of peace between Austria and Sardinia.|$|R

40|$|As {{one of the}} few {{countries}} in the Council of Europe, Belgium has not ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as well as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The reason for this {{can be found in the}} fact that both major language groups – i. e. French- and Dutch-speakers – do not reach agreement on the (necessary) interpretation of the concept of “minority”. Of course, minorities are being protected. Firstly, the Constitution guarantees in general the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination. Secondly, last four decades Belgium is evolved from a unitary to a federal State. The three (language) communities are each, on their territory, organically responsible for Cultural Affairs (including language protection measures, radio and television in the (minority) language, …), education including the choice of the language of instruction and second/third language teaching, creation and management of welfare institutions; this autonomy even implies that each community – on the aforementioned policy domains – can <b>close</b> <b>treaties</b> with other States. However, mechanisms must be developed within each community for the protection of philosophical and religious minorities, in particular in education (by means of teaching in a minority language and education of a recognized religion) or in the area of governance (insured representation of philosophical minorities in the Administration, but no quota system). Thirdly, at the federal level (national) linguistic minorities are double protected. At the institutional level the Federal Council of Ministers must include seven and seven French-speaking Flemish ministers and in the Federal Parliament a guaranteed presence of each language group is constitutionally assured. The federal Legislative can only adopt language laws (for legal procedures and the army) as well as the basic laws on the Federal State structure than with a qualified majority in each language group; for approving other laws a language group can temporarily suspend the legislative process...|$|R

Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe—the British signatory of the Mudros Armistice—stated the Triple Entente′s public position that they had no intention to dismantle the government of the Ottoman Empire or place it under military occupation by [...] "occupying Constantinople".

6000|$|Friedrich, abundantly {{contemptuous of}} Reich's-thunder in the rusted kind, and well able to {{distinguish}} sound from substance in the Reich or elsewhere, recognizes in all this sufficiently portentous prophecies of fact withal; and understands, none better, what a perilous position he has got into.

Continual, ubiquitous {{and at the top}} of his bent, one fancies his effort must have been,--though he makes no noise on the subject. Considerable work he has with Hanover, this Winter; with the poor English Government, and their [...] "Army of Observation," [...] which is to appear in the Hanover parts, VERSUS those 100,000 French, next Spring. To Hanover he has sent Schmettau (the Younger Schmettau, Elder is now dead) in regard to said Army; has made a new and <b>closer</b> <b>Treaty</b> with England (impossible to be fulfilled on poor England's part);--and laments, as Mitchell often does, the tragically embroiled condition of that Country, struggling so vehemently, to no purpose, to get out of bed, and not unlike strangling or smothering itself in its own blankets, at present! With and in regard to Saxony, his work is of course extremely considerable; and in regard to his own Army, and its coming Business, considerablest of all. Counter-Manifesto work, to state his case in a distinct manner, and leave it with the Populations if the Diplomacies are deaf: this too, is copiously proceeding; under Artists who probably do not require much supervision. In fact, no King living has such servants, in the Civil or the Military part, to execute his will. And no King so little wastes himself in noises; a King who has good command of himself, first of all; not to be thrown off his balance by any terror, any provocation even, though his temper is very sharp.|$|R
