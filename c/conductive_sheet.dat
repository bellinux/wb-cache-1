40|$|The thesis {{presents}} resistivity {{characteristics of}} <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills for robotic hand tactile sensing application. These materials are suitable {{to be used}} as transducer in tactile sensing applications. Therefore, the thesis highlights the potential of these two materials as a tactile sensing transducer and later describes the best design parameters for them to be applied as a tactile sensor. In the thesis, the tactile sensing mechanism that includes the operating principle and hardware architecture of the sensor are explained. The experimental setup to determine the fundamental properties of <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is presented. Resistivity behavior is of the major factors in choosing <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over the other materials. These materials resistivity need to be tested to ascertain its viability as a tactile sensor. The parameters are voltage supply, the separation gap and sensor construction. The results show the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is better in term of reproducibility and stability of the resistance values as compared to the <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS). However in terms of the sensitivity, <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) is better in comparison with the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills whereby it can cover lower loading range when compared to QTC Pills. However, since the reproducibility of <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS); 5. 05 Q standard deviation is lower than the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills; 2. 110. standard deviation, it is more preferable to choose the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over <b>Conductive</b> Rubber <b>Sheet</b> (CRS). Furthermore with 5 V supply voltage and 0. 5 mm separation gap, the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills can perform well similar to the 25 V supply voltage.

40|$|The {{application}} of conductive polymers, e. g. PEDOT or PPy, for microwave applications {{has been researched}} recently due the advantages of these materials in mechanical flexibility, processability and low cost. A crucial aspect of antenna design is to obtain reliable simulation results. This is particularly challenging for materials with moderate conductivity such as conductive polymers, since the conductivity is {{in the order of}} thousands to hundreds of thousands S/m - too low to be a “good conductor”. In this study, a comparison of different modeling techniques generally available in commercial field solvers is conducted. The polymers are either modeled as fully discretized lossy dielectrics, as thin <b>conductive</b> <b>sheets</b> or as impedance boundaries. On the example of an ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna built from samples of PEDOT and PPy, the three modeling techniques are compared in terms of accuracy and computational expenditure in commercial finite-difference time-domain and finite-element codes. The influence of the (often unknown) permittivity of the conductor on the simulation results is investigated. It is shown that for thick conductors, i. e. with thicknesses in the range of the skin depth or above, all three models yield very similar results. For much thinner conductive polymers, a fully-discretized lossy dielectric model shows a good agreement with measured data. Thomas Kaufmann, Roderick Shepherd and Christophe Fumeaux[URL]...|$|R
