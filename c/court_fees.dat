25|$|The modern law of {{contract}} is primarily {{a creature of the}} industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. Access to the courts, in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and <b>court</b> <b>fees.</b> In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislation}} {{provided for}} {{two levels of}} courts: a number of Local Courts to established in each of Malawi's 27 districts, mainly in rural areas and District Appeals Local Courts, one in each district, to hear appeals from the Local Courts.

Each local court and District Appeals Local Court would be headed by chairperson, who need not be a lawyer, but with a reasonable standard of education, proficiency in English and adequate knowledge of the customary law and language of the area that the court serves. Local Courts also have assessors to advise on local customary law. Assessor must be at least 50 years old. The Local Courts would have no jurisdiction over civil cases involving title to or ownership of customary land, property inheritance involving the guardianship of infants, issues of witchcraft or about a chief's title. This is to help limit possible corruption. Complaints have been made that the Local Courts, popularly called Traditional Courts are charging excessive <b>court</b> <b>fees</b> to settle disputes.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2010, McDonnell {{proposed}} 96 budget {{amendments to}} the two-year 2010â€“2012 budget resulting in $42.1 million in spending increases and $51 million in additional budget cuts, tax increases, and <b>court</b> <b>fees</b> for criminals. He proposed to increase spending by $15 million to give incentives for SRI International and Bank of America to keep offices in Virginia. To boost revenue, McDonnell proposed raising $7.2 million by increasing the fines on motorists who exceed the speed limit. He proposed to cut an additional $9.9 million from state funded programs for at-risk and troubled children and proposed cutting $600,000 from state grants to public radio and television stations. McDonnell also issued amendatory vetoes on non-budget legislation. For example, although Virginia has provided free electronic filing of tax returns for years, his veto outsourced electronic filing to firms that charge a fee for that service. McDonnell also amended a bill to prohibit Planned Parenthood from spending funds raised from its affinity license plates on abortions. The Legislature met {{to vote on the}} Governor's amendments on April 21. A bipartisan majority accepted some of McDonnell's proposed cuts while rejecting others including those to public broadcasting, the funding for at-risk and troubled children, and the shifting of Virginia Medicaid mental health program to a managed-care plan.|$|E

500|$|One of John's {{principal}} challenges was {{acquiring the}} {{large sums of}} money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy. The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, <b>court</b> <b>fees</b> and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, {{to the extent that he}} has been described as [...] "avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded". John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.|$|E
500|$|Drug courts {{first started}} in 1989 and have spread since. 2140 drug courts were in {{operation}} May 2008, with another 284 being planned or developed. [...] They offer offenders charged with less-serious crimes of being under the influence, {{possession of a}} controlled substance, or even drug-using offenders charged with a non-drug-related crime the option of entering the drug court system instead of a conventional criminal court {{with the possibility of}} serving a jail sentence. To take advantage of this program, offenders have to plead guilty to the charge, agree to take part in treatment, regular drug screenings, and regular reporting to the drug court judge for a minimum of one year, as well as pay heavy fines and monthly drug <b>court</b> <b>fees.</b> Drug court systems in some areas utilize a color code system, whereas each offender is assigned a designated color, one of which is selected daily by the drug court for drug screening. Offenders must call the [...] "color code" [...] office each morning to see if their color has been selected for screening. Should the offender fail to comply with {{one or more of the}} requirements they may be removed from the drug court and incarcerated at the judge's discretion. If they complete the drug court program the charges brought against them are dropped or reduced.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, the Singapore courts {{undertook}} {{the enormous}} task of clearing their extremely large backlogs {{in order to}} facilitate Singapore's future development as an international business and finance centre. A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously, including, among other things, the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners, the use of information technology, electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution. Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases, both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. In particular, specialized courts such as small claims tribunals, the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce <b>court</b> <b>fees.</b> Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts, improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered. Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the [...] "best and brightest officers" [...] and in particular, the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence. For this purpose, the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance, training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary, and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts. Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>court</b> <b>fee</b> system for civil litigation in various aspects. We first survey the <b>court</b> <b>fee</b> system in Korea {{and compare it}} {{with those of other}} countries. A theoretical model is set up to analyze the effect of the fee system on peopleâ€™s decision making, especially on the incentive to overreport the value of litigation. Based on the survey and theoretical analyses, we obtain the following policy implications: First, simplifying the fee system has its own virtue but it is not advisable to introduce flat-fee elements {{just for the sake of}} simplification. Second, it is not feasible to construct a regressive fee system that deters overreporting of the litigation value and at the same time makes the deterrence effect not too excessive. Third, it is very hard to judge whether the current fee level is optimal; a better approach would be to first determine the nature of the <b>court</b> <b>fee</b> and then revise the fee system accordingly...|$|R

On September 16, a federal judge granted Libien Kaui a bond of MXN$16 million, {{and told him that}} he was allowed to leave the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as [...] "Altiplano"), a maximum-security prison, until the case was settled if the amount was paid. The amount posted was calculated based on the tax fraud scheme, the monetary penalties given, and additional <b>court</b> <b>fees.</b> The federal judge stated that his potential release was permitted by Mexican law because tax fraud charges in Mexico are not considered serious in nature.
