Our results unanimously show growing clusters of non-affine deformation percolating at yielding. In agreement with percolation theory, the spanning cluster is fractal with a fractal dimension d_f~ 2, and the correlation length diverges upon approaching the critical yield strain.

At low rates <b>colloidal</b> gels <b>yield</b> during start-up shear essentially in a single step, exhibiting a single stress overshoot due to creation of compact flowing clusters. With increasing shear rate a second stress overshoot, linked with further cluster breaking up to individual particles, is becoming more pronounced.

The formation of binary and, for the first time, ternary colloidal crystals through a simple and inexpensive confined-area evaporation-induced layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method is reported. The proposed method produces high quality multicomponent colloidal crystal films over a broad range of particle size-ratios and large surface areas (cm 2) from silica/polystyrene colloidal suspensions of low concentration. By adjusting the size-ratio and concentration of the colloidal particles, complex crystals of tunable stoichiometries are fabricated and their structural characteristics are further confirmed with reported crystal analogues.

It shows that increasing the GnP concentration results in the rise of viscosity at both low and high shear rates. The highest increment was recorded at two times the concentration of GO. This implies that the interaction between GO and GnP is the highest at this combination which also suggests that much of the hydrophilic sites on GO are occupied by GnP. Previous studies have also highlighted an optimum concentration range of <b>colloidal</b> mixtures to <b>yield</b> a stable hybrid system [84, 115, 116]. As the GnP concentration increases beyond this benchmark, the viscosity rapidly drops which may indicate the saturation of GnP on GO sheet and the remaining particles will strongly flocculate and form much bigger structures.

Fluid density and fluid flow-path sonication affect particle sedimentation and distribution. Coating microstructure, analyzed in terms of void space, does not vary significantly with relative humidity or suspended particle concentration.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{zeta potential}} characterises the flocculated–dispersed state transition of a colloidal dispersion. For many <b>colloidal</b> dispersions, <b>yield</b> stress displayed a linear {{relationship with the}} square of zeta potential indicating that they obeyed the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. From this relationship, critical zeta potential is obtained from the intercept at the zeta potential axis at a yield stress of zero. The critical zeta potential {{is a measure of}} the repulsive potential required to exactly counter the maximum attractive potential between particles in dispersion in the flocculated state. When the forces of interaction between particles in the dispersion are only the van der Waals and electrostatic forces, then the critical zeta potential is indirectly a measure of the van der Waals attractive potential and, hence, it may be used to determine the Hamaker constant of solids in water. This potential is proportional to the square root of the solids Hamaker constant in water. At present, only the ratio of Hamaker constant between two oxides was obtained and compared with that obtained by other techniques. These oxides were ultrapure anatase TiO 2 and γ-Al 2 O 3, and they displayed a linear relationship between yield stress and the square of zeta potential. At the conductivity (or ionic strength) of about 3000 μS/cm, the critical zeta potential for both TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 is ∼ 47 and ∼ 32 mV, respectively. These critical zeta potential data give a value of 2. 2 for the ratio of Hamaker constant of anatase TiO 2 /H 2 O/TiO 2 to γ-Al 2 O 3 /H 2 O/γ-Al 2 O 3. This ratio compares well with a value ranging from 1. 0 to 2. 18 for rutile TiO 2 /H 2 O/TiO 2 to α-Al 2 O 3 /H 2 O/α-Al 2 O 3 where their Hamaker constants were calculated from the Lifshitz theory using full optical spectral data. ...|$|R

In such materials a global connectivity is maintained at all times while a continuous breaking and reforming of individual physical bonds between particles is still possible. In many studies the origin of elasticity of colloidal gel has been studied and correlated with the microstructure of the stress-bearing networks. When subjected to a shear stress, the solid-like <b>colloidal</b> gel eventually <b>yields</b> and liquefies, accompanied by a rupture of the microstructure. While the mechanisms of yielding and flow of colloidal gels have been extensively investigated, several aspects are still ill understood. One problem resides in the difficulty of bridging the macroscopic mechanical response with the underlying microscopic kinetics and relaxation behavior of individual particles and clusters during flow. One possibility to probe the evolution of relaxation modes under flow is with the superposition of an oscillatory deformation onto a steady shear flow. In particular, the superposition in orthogonal direction results in only a weak coupling of the two flow fields, hence the corresponding moduli can be {{directly related to the}} microstructure under flow [1].

Two significant results have been found, and each has been submitted for publication. Both studies found non-DLVO behavior in simulant systems. These separate but related studies were performed concurrently. It was previously shown in Rassat et al. 's report Physical and Liquid Chemical Simulant Formulations for Transuranic Wastes in Hanford Single-Shell Tanks that colloidal clays behave similarly to transuranic waste sludge (PNNL- 14333, National Technical Information Service, U. S. Dept. of Commerce). Rassat et al. also discussed the pH and salt content of actual waste materials. It was shown that these materials exist at high pHs, generally above 10, and at high salt content, approximately 1. 5 M from a mixture of different salts. A type of clay commonly studied, due to its uniformity, is a synthetic hectorite, Laponite. Therefore the work performed {{over the course of the}} last year was done mainly using suspensions of Laponite at high pH and involving high salt concentrations. One study was titled ''Relating Clay Rheology to Colloidal Parameters''. It has been submitted to the Journal of Colloid and INterface Science and is currently in the review process. The idea was to gain the ability to use measurable quantities to predict the flow behavior of clay systems, which should be similar to transuranic waste sludge. Leong et al. had previously shown that the <b>yield</b> stress of <b>colloidal</b> slurries of titania and alumina could be predicted, given the measurement of the accessible parameter zeta potential (Leong YK et al.

Colloidal clays have a fundamentally different morphology and surface charge distribution than the spheroidal, uniformly charged colloids previously studied. This study was therefore performed in order to determine the applicability of the previous findings to the systems of interest. The yield stress of clay slurries was measured using the Physica MCR 300 purchased in year 1 of this project. The zeta potential of these systems was then measured using the Brookhaven Zeta PALS, also purchased in year 1. These two parameters were then plotted and compared with the Leong result. It was found that this system behaved in a non-DLVO manner. Leong found that <b>colloidal</b> slurry <b>yield</b> stress decreases with increased zeta potential which is consistent with the DLVO theory's assertion that particle attractions decrease as their electrostatic repulsion increases.

Nevertheless, the therapeutic exploitation of these macromolecules is often hurdled by their inadequate physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties. Chemical, physical or enzymatic inactivation during formulation, storage and delivery, poor membrane permeability and rapid elimination from the body dramatically reduce the protein transformation into drugs. Furthermore, long term daily injections required chronic treatments has obvious drawbacks. Therefore, the use of protein drugs relies {{on the development of}} suitable formulations, which can satisfactorily overcome their intrinsic limitations and ameliorate the patient compliance. Colloidal vectors such as bioconjugates, liposomes, nanoparticles and micelles have been successfully reshaped for protein delivery 2. With regard to chemical bioconjugation, PEGnology is actually considered a routinary technique for delivering poorly performing proteins 3. Typically, PEGylation prolongs the permanence in the blood stream, enhances the stability and solubility and reduces the immunogenicity of proteins. Throughout the last years, PEGnology has been rapidly evolving to provide new solutions to the demanding requisites for new therapeutics. Selective PEGylation strategies have been set up as alternatives to the random and extensive polymer conjugation used to obtain the first clinically approved therapeutics, PEG-asparaginase (Oncaspar) and PEG-adenosine deaminase (Adagen) 4. Physical protein/polymer associations are deemed a valuable alternative tool to the chemical bioconjugation. Soluble polymers, namely polysaccharides and synthetic polymers, can be properly designed to yield protein/polymer supramolecular structures, either by specific or unspecific interactions that can provide for protein protection from enzyme degradation and immunorecognition and slow release of the native drug 5. In conclusion, soluble polymers can be successfully exploited to <b>yield</b> <b>colloidal</b> soluble systems for protein delivery.

30|$|When {{considering}} the adsorbed amounts calculated, {{it is imperative}} that the surfaces areas were determined using B.E.T. gas (N 2) adsorption. Given the probability that surfaces accessible to this gas may not be accessible to proteins, makes it very difficult to accurately determine the amount adsorbed per unity surface area. Nevertheless, this strategy was adopted {{due to the fact that}} it is unknown how much of this surface area is accessible to the solvent and available for protein interactions. In general, when near the lower concentration limit of the DC assay (~ 0.2  mg/mL), both the DC and <b>colloidal</b> gold assays <b>yielded</b> similar concentrations. However, a large difference occurred when attempting to quantify protein concentrations lower than the suggested minimum for the DC assay. The DC assay showed, for the sol–gel prepared surfaces, a total protein concentration almost twice as large as the nanogold assay technique. It is thought that this difference was largely due to the inaccuracy of the DC assay at this concentration. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the cast amorphous and cast crystalline samples had similar amounts of protein removed from their surfaces and that these values were at least double that of the amount adsorbed to the sol–gel sample before {{considering the}} specific surface area of the samples. When the amount of surface area of each sample is taken into account, the relationship is then inverted and the sol–gel bioactive glass eluted more protein per unit mass than the cast samples. These results show that the devitrification of melt-cast 45 S 5 does not play a significant role in the adsorption of plasma proteins as both the cast amorphous and cast crystalline samples eluted similar quantities of protein. Data in Table  3 suggests the elution procedure may not have been 100  % complete as based on the atomic percentages of nitrogen and sulphur. Despite these values being only approximately 1  %, it is probable that they represent both retained protein (N and S) and/or SDS (S) on the material surface.

Gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) readily reacts with water to yield a hydrolysed silane that reacts readily with the silica surface. The epoxy functional groups were not affected during the hydrolysis but subsequent reaction with the silica surface opened the epoxy rings. The presence of silane groups on the particle surface was established by Si-NMR. About 1. 5 GPTMS groups per nm 2 silica surface were needed to affect significantly the properties of colloidal silica. Modification of conventional silica sols improves the stability toward gelling by electrolytes, allows the preparation of mixtures of various lattices with silica sols that are stable toward gelling, increases the hardness of latex coatings, and improves the properties of pigmented coatings. Methods were developed for making white composite pigments consisting of a silica core with a titania shell. A necessary step was the aluminate modification of the silica particles. With 1. 5 aluminosilicate sites per nm 2 of core surface, well-dispersed composite particles having cores of uniform size in the range of 300 to 500 nm with a titania coating, the thickness of which corresponded to from 150 to 400 wt-% of titania based on the weight of the core, were prepared.

It also concerns the use of colloidal TPA-silicalite- 1 for the preparation of zoned MFI films. A novel method, a two-stage varying-temperature procedure, involving starting a crystallization at a certain temperature, and then rapidly changing temperature {{at some point during the}} crystallization, was developed for the investigation of nucleation kinetics of colloidal zeolites. As the duration of the crystallization at the initial temperature was extended, the ultimate crystal size and crystal concentration varied until they were approximately equal to those obtained for a complete synthesis at the initial temperature. At this point, the nucleation stage during the crystallization was completed. For the synthesis of colloidal TPA-silicalite- 1, the nucleation process occurred over a substantial period of time, extending over the induction period, but was completed before crystal growth was detected, independent of aging time and silica source. For the synthesis of colloidal zeolite Y, the nucleation and crystal growth processes occurred simultaneously and the nucleation period was significantly longer than the induction period. The two-stage varying-temperature synthesis procedure was used to synthesize particularly small colloidal crystals of TPA-silicalite- 1 with a high yield for short synthesis time. In addition, midsynthesis addition of sodium after the nucleation of zeolite Y produced pure colloidal zeolite Y with slightly larger crystals (less than 110 nm) and a high <b>yield.</b> <b>Colloidal</b> TPA-silicalite- 1 crystals with a size of 60 nm were used as seeds to prepare different types of zoned MFI films on various substrates by a two- step crystallization method.

Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are a promising technological material because their size-dependent optical and electronic properties can be exploited for a {{diverse range of}} applications such as light-emitting diodes, bio-labels, transistors, and solar cells. For many of these applications, electrical current needs to be transported through the devices. However, while their solution processability makes these colloidal nanocrystals attractive candidates for device applications, the bulky surfactants that render these nanocrystals dispersible in common solvents block electrical current. Thus, in order to realize the full potential of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals in the next-generation of solid-state devices, methods must be devised to make conductive films from these nanocrystals. One way to achieve this would be to add minute amounts of foreign impurity atoms (dopants) to increase their conductivity. Electronic doping in nanocrystals {{is still very much}} in its infancy with limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the doping process. This thesis introduces an innovative synthesis of doped nanocrystals and aims at expanding the fundamental understanding of charge transport in these doped nanocrystal films. The list of semiconductor nanocrystals that can be doped is large, and if one combines that with available dopants, an even larger set of materials with interesting properties and applications can be generated. In addition to doping, another promising route to increase conductivity in nanocrystal films is to use nanocrystals with high ionic conductivities. This thesis also examines this possibility by studying new phases of mixed ionic and electronic conductors at the nanoscale. Such a versatile approach may open new pathways for interesting fundamental research, and also lay the foundation for the creation of novel materials with important applications. In addition to their size-dependence, the intentional incorporation of impurities (or doping) allows further control over the electrical and optical properties of nanocrystals. However, while impurity doping in bulk semiconductors is now routine, doping of nanocrystals remains challenging. In particular, evidence for electronic doping, in which additional electrical carriers are introduced into the nanocrystals, has been very limited. Here, we adopt a new approach to electronic doping of nanocrystals. We utilize a partial cation exchange to introduce silver impurities into cadmium selenide (CdSe) and lead selenide (PbSe) nanocrystals. Results indicate that the silver-doped CdSe nanocrystals show a significant increase in fluorescence intensity, as compared to pure CdSe nanocrystals. We also observe a switching from n - to p -type doping in the silver-doped CdSe nanocrystals with increased silver amounts. Moreover, the silver-doping results in a change in the conductance of both PbSe and CdSe nanocrystals and the magnitude of this change depends on the amount of silver incorporated into the nanocrystals. In the bulk, silver chalcogenides (Ag 2 E, E=S, Se, and Te) possess a wide array of intriguing properties, including superionic conductivity. In addition, they undergo a reversible temperature-dependent phase transition which induces significant changes in their electronic and ionic properties. While most of these properties have been examined extensively in bulk, very few studies have been conducted at the nanoscale. We have recently developed a versatile synthesis that <b>yields</b> <b>colloidal</b> silver chalcogenide nanocrystals. Here, we study the size dependence of their phase-transition temperatures. We utilize differential scanning calorimetry and in-situ X-ray diffraction analyses to observe the phase transition in nanocrystal assemblies. We observe a significant deviation from the bulk α (low-temperature) to β (high-temperature) phase-transition temperature when we reduce their size to a few nanometers. Hence, these nanocrystals provide great potential for devices to utilize the properties of both phases at a significantly lower temperature than that of the corresponding bulk material. Moreover, a wide range of properties of both phases that meet specific requirements can be obtained simply by tuning the crystal size...|$|R

Esta técnica proporciona un amplio rango de posibilidades para aumentar la eficiencia de los materiales termoeléctricos. Permite aumentar los valores de la figura de mérito ZT (parámetro que mide la eficiencia del material termoeléctrico), gracias al fino control del tamaño, la forma y la composición de los nanocristales (NCs) que se realiza en la síntesis en solución, donde los NCs se convierten en los componentes básicos del material nanoestructurado. Además la síntesis en solución permite combinar y/o sintetizar los NCs para obtener diferente tipo de nano-heteroestructuras con mejores propiedades electrónicas. En esta tesis se optimiza la síntesis coloidal para producir NCs con el tamaño, forma y composición deseada y a escala del gramo. Los materiales seleccionados fueron calcogenuros de Plata, Plomo, Bismuto y Cobre, {{debido a}} sus propiedades intrínsecas útiles para conseguir materiales termoeléctricos eficientes. EstÁ dividida en tres partes, la primera se relaciona con el desarrollo de nanocompositos o heteroestructuras, usando dos tipos de NCs coloidales. En esta, se demuestra la eficacia de este tipo de meta-materiales para incrementar el bloqueo fonónico, debido a la alta densidad de interfaces en los nano-granos y la diferencia de estructura cristalográfica que se obtiene al usar dos tipos diferentes de nanocristales. En la segunda parte se investiga el efecto de los ligandos orgánicos que quedan atados a los nanocristales, en la formación de materiales nanoestructurados en bloque o nanocompositos. Se propone un proceso simple, general y escalable, para realizar el intercambio de ligandos, con el cual se obtiene un gran aumento de la figura de Mérito (ZT) del material y además se abre la posibilidad de cambiar la concentración de portadores en el material. En la parte final se aborda el estudia la consolidación de los materiales nanoestructurados, mediante la utilización de la técnica de “spark plasma sintering” (SPS), para obtener nanomateriales altamente densos. Se demuestra la importancia de obtener un material altamente denso para producir materiales con altas eficiencias termoeléctricas. Estos resultados muestran que la producción de materiales nanoestructurados usando como unidades fundamentales los NCs obtenidos en solución, (estrategia del “Bottom-up”) es un método muy eficaz que permite obtener materiales altamente eficientes para usarlos en dispositivos termoeléctricos. This thesis aims to develop high efficiency thermoelectric nanostructured {{materials from the}} bottom-up assembly of NCs. To achieve this, I have developed different approaches with the purpose to enhance the transport properties of the materials and to overcome the limitations of solution processed NCs. First of all, I optimized colloidal synthesis routes to produce NCs with the desired size, shape and composition at the gram scale. The materials I used were silver, lead, bismuth and copper chalcogenides, due to their intrinsic useful properties to obtain efficient thermoelectric materials. This thesis is divided in three parts. Firstly, I explore the production of binary nano-heterostructured materials; the modular design of multicomponent solids allows enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency of current materials. The combination of different stoichiometry and crystallographic structure provides effective phonon blocking. PbTe and Ag 2 Te colloidal NCs were assembled into Ag 2 Te-PbTe nanocomposites with homogeneous phase distributions and adjustable composition. The evolution of their electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient is {{discussed in terms of}} the blend composition and the characteristics of the constituent materials. Undoped (Ag 2 Te) 0. 75 (PbTe) 0. 25 nanocomposites displayed best power factor (PF=S 2 σ) among the different nanocomposites tested and reached ZT values up to 0. 38 at 670 K. Since the presence of organic ligands (OL) on the surface of colloidal NCs strongly limits their performance in technological applications, where charge carrier transfer/transport plays an important role, I developed a strategy to replace the OL from the NCs surface. The first strategy was to use metal salts, matched with the NCs composition to eliminate the surface OL without introducing extrinsic impurities in the final nanomaterial. The potential of this simple, general and scalable process were demonstrated by characterizing the thermoelectric properties of nanostructured bulk Ag 2 Te produced by the bottom up assembly of Ag 2 Te NCs. A 6 -fold increase of the Ag 2 Te thermoelectric figure of merit was obtained when displacing organic ligands by AgNO 3. In a second approach, I used sodium salts to carry out the OL replacement, with PbSe NCs. I tested salts including sodium azide, sodium nitrate and sodium amide with the aim of tuning the carrier concentration of the NCs. The electrical conductivity of the bulk nanocrystalline material, treated with sodium amide, increased more than one order of magnitude, and the resultant figure of merit at 600 K was 0. 6. Additionally I discussed the effect that the scattering at the grain interfaces has in electronic transport using a model that takes into account the energy barrier at the NCs boundaries. The results of this work have been submitted for publication. Another challenge in the preparation of bulk nanostructured materials is to obtain a dense solid. The process of consolidation of the NCs into a dense solid is crucial to obtain a bulk nanomaterial with high thermoelectric properties, because the porosity strongly affects the transport properties. In order to obtain the dense solids, I started using cold press (CP) technique. Later, I was able to use hot press (HP) technique, and carried out the adjustment of the parameters like temperature and time, in order to avoid a highly increasing of the grain size. Another technique that has shown outstanding results in the thermoelectric fields is spark plasma sintering (SPS). Thus I analyzed the transport properties of the nanomaterials obtained by the consolidation of a colloids NCs-based powder into dense pellets by SPS. Using Cu 2 SnSe 3 NCs, obtained by a novel and high <b>yield</b> <b>colloidal</b> synthesis route. These results show the bottom-up production of nanocrystalline materials from solution-processed NCs to be a potentially advantageous alternative to conventional methods in the production of efficient thermoelectric materials. At the same time the progress achieved here allows to overcome some of the main difficulties in the production of bulk nanomaterials with high thermoelectric efficiency from the bottom-up assembly of colloidal NCs...|$|R
