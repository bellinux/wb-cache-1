25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Floyd Collins spent ten years {{exploring}} the Flint Ridge Cave System (the most important legacy of these explorations was {{the discovery of}} Floyd Collins' Crystal Cave and exploration in Salts Cave) before dying at Sand Cave, Kentucky, in 1925. While exploring Sand Cave, he dislodged a rock onto his leg while in a tight <b>crawlway</b> {{and was unable to}} be rescued before dying of starvation. Attempts to rescue Collins created a media sensation: The resulting publicity would draw prominent Kentuckians to initiate a movement which would soon result in the formation of Mammoth Cave National Park.|$|E

2500|$|William Floyd Collins (July 20, 1887 – c. February 13, 1925), {{better known}} as Floyd Collins, was an American cave explorer, principally in a region of Central Kentucky that houses {{hundreds}} of miles of interconnected, underground caverns within Mammoth Cave National Park, the longest cave system in the world. In the early 20th century, in an era known as the Kentucky Cave Wars, commercial cave owners and explorers in Kentucky entered into a bitter competition to exploit the bounty of caves for commercial profit from tourists, who paid to see the caves. [...] On January 30, 1925, while trying to find a new entrance to Crystal Cave (also known as [...] "Sand Cave" [...] by the media), Collins became trapped in a narrow <b>crawlway,</b> [...] below ground. The rescue operation to save Collins became a national newspaper sensation {{and one of the first}} major news stories to be reported using the new technology of broadcast radio. The rescue attempt grew to become the third-biggest media event between the world wars.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{species of}} bat inhabit Tongue River Cave, though their {{sighting}} has diminished in recent years. Townsend's Big-eared Bat (Plecotus Townsendii) and the Fringed Myotis (Myotis thysanodes) occupy the canyon, and have most likely relocated to less travelled habitats [...] A band of reclusive cave rats occupies the lower <b>crawlways</b> below the cave's entrance chamber.|$|R
50|$|Cadomin Cave {{is located}} within Leyland Mountain at an {{elevation}} of 1890m, and was formed within the thickly-bedded limestones of the Palliser Formation. The cave consists of an upper series of spacious phreatic and keyhole-type passages underlain by somewhat smaller passages connected by tight <b>crawlways.</b> There is only one known entrance. Cadomin Cave is named after the town of Cadomin, an acronym for the Canada Dominion Mining company.|$|R
50|$|Ted Raimi (Lieutenant O'Neill), Marco Sanchez (Chief Miguel Ortiz), and Stephanie Beacham (Dr. Kristin Westphalen) do {{not appear}} in this episode. Though not {{appearing}} in the aired version of the episode, Beacham filmed a scene that was ultimately cut where Dr. Westphalen finds Lucas on the sea deck after the ship has been saved where {{she gives him a}} hug and tells him that she was concerned for his safety, to which Lucas offers his thanks. This deleted scene is available on the first season DVD release. Another short deleted scene depicts Chief Crocker crawling through the service <b>crawlways,</b> trying to keep himself from giving up and accomplishing his mission to sabotage the seaQuest.|$|R

50|$|The stoopway {{entrance}} that is 4.5 ft {{high and}} 2.5 ft wide {{leads to a}} forty-foot passage into a fairly normal limestone <b>crawlway</b> conduit cave. It is the only known habitat for Louisville cave beetles, that is listed as a Candidate for endangered species status.|$|E
50|$|Digby Ellis and Dave Land added 290 m to Cango III {{when they}} {{discovered}} a <b>crawlway</b> in December 1977. A further 90 m was added in June 1978. All these extensions were surveyed in August 1978 by Dave Land, Charles Maxwell, Brian Russell and Dave Crombie.|$|E
5000|$|Crystal Grottoes is {{an example}} of a solutional cave, formed in a karst {{environment}} within a synclinal occurrence of Tomstown Dolomite. The cave is essentially horizontal throughout its extent and the passages are typically high and narrow. A great deal of brown and red clay fills most of the cave to a considerable extent; the commercial tour routes involved the removal of up to 4-6 ft of this clay in 900 ft of the passages. Sediment fills many of the undeveloped passages to within a foot or two of the ceiling, thereby making many <b>crawlways.</b> No streams exist in the cave, although a small [...] "lake" [...] or pool is maintained by drip water.|$|R
5000|$|... "Manhunt" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series to be filmed in Texas after {{the cast and crew}} {{relocated}} due to the more suitable locations for the impending storyline. The cemetery scene and the following town scene are supposedly set in Oswego, Illinois in the episode. These scenes were actually filmed in McKinney, Texas. While the cemetery scene was filmed at Pecan Grove Cemetery in McKinney, the scene which followed as the fugitives escape into a neighbouring town, was filmed in downtown McKinney. Starting with this episode, the blue-tinted graphic used in the first season's commercial bumper which were shots of prison <b>crawlways,</b> is replaced by a sepia-tinted graphic of racing through fields and streets, reflecting the fact that the convicts have become fugitives.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} has two batteries, each comprising 224 2V cells (type D7420) {{giving a}} nominal 440-V output. One battery is located underneath the crew accommodation compartment, {{and the other}} under the control compartment. Each battery has a switch circuit in the middle {{so it can be}} split into two banks of 112 cells. The cells are designed to deliver 7420 Ah over a period of 5 hours. All steelwork within the battery compartments is lined with rubber to protect the metal from attack by acid, and also all conducting material is insulated to prevent risks of electric shock. Waxed timber is used to make framing and <b>crawlways</b> to access the batteries and support them because of its resistance to acid. The battery compartment has a sump to collect any spilled liquids. Each cell weighs 1,120 lb, measures about 4 ft × 16 in × 12 in, and contains 18.5 gallons of electrolyte. Cells are held tightly in place with wooden wedges to prevent movement with the boat. Each cell has four connector bolts to each electrode and an agitator pipe which bubbles air through the cell to ensure the electrolyte remains mixed and uniform. Cooling water is fed through pipes attached to the electrode connectors to prevent overheating and the battery temperature is monitored.|$|R
5000|$|Installation of a 160-gallon {{collapsible}} neoprene {{auxiliary fuel}} tank {{fixed to the}} top of the bomb bay, and support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, <b>crawlway</b> and lower turret area to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 U.S. gallons (538-950 imperial gallons; 2,445-4,319 L) ...|$|E
50|$|The aircraft's immense size allowed flight {{engineers}} {{to enter the}} wing through a <b>crawlway</b> and make minor repairs in flight. A 5000 mi flight took 33 hours at its 152 mph cruising speed; the crew {{was made up of}} several shifts, and bunks allowed them to sleep when off duty.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the next}} cave upslope was Ola'a Cave which was nearly {{connected}} to Sexton but was sealed off by more black lava rock. The cave {{would later be}} connected to Kazumura by Kevin and Shambaugh in 1995. Smaller caves near Old Kazamura were also connected, including Hawaiian Acres # 1, Fern's, and Doc Bellou Caves. The latter two are connected by a tight <b>crawlway.</b>|$|E
50|$|A second, {{artificial}} {{entrance to}} the cave was excavated in 2001. This new entrance is named the Carr Entrance, {{in honor of the}} family that owns the land on which it is located. This new entrance makes it possible to enter directly into Johnson Avenue and bypass the tight <b>crawlway</b> that connects the historical front 500 feet of the cave to the new discoveries. This entrance is securely gated, and entrance is by permission only.|$|E
5000|$|A small <b>crawlway</b> {{known as}} [...] "Blowing Bat Crawl" [...] was finally broken through on June 14, 1992 {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of the stream level of Marengo Cave. Approximately 3.5 miles were added to the cave's length with this discovery. The largest room of any cave in Indiana was also discovered in the stream level. There is almost 5 miles of known passageway to date at Marengo Cave, {{making it one of the}} longest caves in Indiana.|$|E

50|$|Between August 1943 and March 1944, another B-17E (41-2595) was {{converted}} to a cargo aircraft and designated XC-108A. Hoping to convert obsolete bombers into cargo aircraft, the United States Army Air Forces initiated a remanufacturing station at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The plane was stripped of armament, armor, and other military equipment. Crew locations were shifted, and the nose was modified to provide space for cargo and/or personnel. The cockpit was accessed via the <b>crawlway</b> under it or through the hinged solid nose cone that had replaced the original glazed bombardier station. To increase cargo space, several bulkheads were removed and the bomb bay doors were sealed closed. This allowed much of the fuselage volume {{to be used to}} carry cargo or personnel.|$|E
50|$|Dennis Jerz, {{among other}} cavers, has {{explored}} the Mammoth Cave system against Crowther's original layout for the game, {{and believe that}} much of Crowther's map and descriptions in the game matched well with the natural Colossal Cave {{as it had been}} in the 1970s at the time that Crowther would have surveyed it. Many of the rooms are named based on caving jargon used for marking survey points which Crowther would have used in his surveys. In-game elements such as the small house at the start of the game and grates separating some rooms represented features that had been in place by the Park Service but since removed. Other natural elements such as a narrow cobble-strewn <b>crawlway</b> leading from the Bedquilt Cave to the Colossal Cave also matched consistency with the in-game locations. Woods' expansion would add new features that were not part of the natural caves, as he had never visited the park.|$|E

40|$|In early 1960, explorers {{accessed}} {{a significant}} underground river through a crawlspace beneath a ledge in Swinnerton Avenue {{southeast of the}} Duck-Under. However, later expeditions failed to find this crawlspace. Instead, the level of sediment in the passage is now generally {{at or above the}} rock ledge, leaving no openings to lower level passages other than the Duck-Under itself. Apparently recent organic material (leaves, twigs, etc.) observed in passages just below the Duck-Under may be related to open channel fl ow from storm events which could theoretically provide local sediment transport. Therefore we have used in-cave spontaneous potential (SP), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and acoustic profiling, as well as surface mise-a-la-masse resistivity profiling, in an attempt to locate the river itself rather than the missing <b>crawlway.</b> Incave dye studies and additional geophysical profiling are needed to work out the detailed 3 -D hydraulics of this region of the cave system...|$|E
