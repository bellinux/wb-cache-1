Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm diameter.

The large panel size equals a typical PCB manufacturing full format and is selected to achieve process compatibility with cost efficient PCB processes.

A novel method named the three-point experimental extrapolation was executed to analyze the necessary extrusion pressure in relation to the extrusion velocity. This new approach presented a higher analytical accuracy as compared to previous methods. The optimum layout of the 3 D printer was obtained by the comparative analysis of four typical topological constructions. On this basis, three main factors affecting the extrusion pressure of bioceramics materials, namely paste formulation (solvent content), nozzle length-to-diameter ratio, and the extrusion velocity, were selected as the control factors, and a series of experiments were performed using the L 27 (313) orthogonal array.

Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm size. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Following the wafer level approach then the next step will be a reconfigured wafer diameter of 450 mm. An alternative option would be leaving the wafer shape and moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 18 "× 24 " or even larger. For reconfigured mold embedding, <b>compression</b> <b>mold</b> processes are used in combination with liquid or granular compound. As an alternative process, lamination can be considered where also sheet compounds can be used. Using maskless laser direct imaging technologies (LDI) instead of photolithography has a high potential for further cost reduction with intrinsic process advantages. The LDI cost advantage is backed by LDI availability for large panel sizes, also including 450 mm wafer form factors. Already today PCB technologies offer the potential for large area panel packaging up to 24 "× 18 "/ 610 × 457 mm 2 and can be applied to form a redistribution layer [RDL] for large area reconfigured wafers or panels, replacing thin film redistribution. For PCB based RDLs a resin coated copper sheet (RCC) is laminated on the reconfigured wafer or panel, respectively. Micro vias are drilled through the RCC layer to the die pads and electrically connected by Cu plating. Final process step is the etching of Cu lines using LDI techniques for maskless patterning. State of the art equipment and materials allow the manufacturing of structures down to 20 μm lines and spaces with a clear development trend to 10 μm lines and spaces and hence getting close to photolithography thin film structure sizes. Based on the technology described above the Fan [...] ut Panel Level Packaging approach will be demonstrated on full 24 "× 18 "/ 610 × 457 mm 2 format including large area embedding and redistribution. Related technology challenges as die shift, warpage, panel handling or yield will be discussed in detail. Using maskless LDI technology real die positions can be automatically adapted to the redistribution and hence less accurate die placement can be compensated and higher die shift could be tolerated which is a big advantage when moving towards large area with acceptable yield. In summary this paper describes the technological path from wafer level embedding to 24 "× 18 " fan-out panel level packaging technology in combination with low cost PCB based RDL processes.

40|$|Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{packaging}} trends in microelectronics. The technology offers not only solutions for single chip packaging but also approaches for 3 D system integration or RF suitable packaging. Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm size. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Besides increasing wafer sizes up to 450 mm an alternative option would be moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 18 "x 24 " or even larger. Increasing the embedding size does not only mean an upscaling of the existing technologies but may lead to a change from using wafer processing infrastructure to the ones used for panels. This is especially true when moving from round wafer sizes to larger rectangular panel formats. Here also new materials and processes have to be taken into account. Materials for reconfigured mold embedding as well as dielectric materials for electrical wiring redistribution are key factors for reliable packaging and proven functionality as required e. g. for RF packaging. For reconfigured mold embedding, <b>compression</b> <b>mold</b> processes are used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet compound. Within this paper the evaluation of panel level compression molding with a target form factor of 24 "x 18 " / 610 x 457 mm² is described for different materials. As basis for the redistribution on top of the mold embedded wafer typically a liquid photo-patternable dielectric polymer material is used and applied by spin coating. For large panel sizes photo-patternable materials are still of interest, these will most likely be used as dry films. These are expected to have advantages concerning processing and cost compared to liquid dielectric materials. Hence, a dry film dielectric material has been selected and evaluated for Fan-out Wafer/Panel Level Packaging. The main criterion for the selection of the thin film polymers is the curing temperature {{due to the fact that}} the final polymerization has to be done after the deposition on the molded wafer. Standard PIs and PBOs can therefore not be used because temperatures above 250 °C would damage the molding material. BCB-type materials are below this temperature limit, with cure temperatures as low as 200 °C, making them ideal candidates for FOWLP. In addition the electrical properties are paving the way to RF applications. However, regarding the RF performance the inhomogeneous material mix of the package can be a critical issue, because of complex wave propagation phenomena. In order to obtain a proper design an assessment of the RF properties is therefore essential. For material and process evaluation a test vehicle has been designed with focus on material and process evaluation as well as reliability testing. In addition test structures for basic RF characterization have been designed and integrated. The test structures comprise interconnect elements such as transmission lines (TML) and vias to assess the electrical performance of FOWLP packaged ICs. Single ended coplanar and differential ended transmission lines embedded into the BCB-based dry film dielectric are connected by vias with a specifically designed silicon IC. The design was done using 3 D full-wave simulations. An analysis of the RF characteristics shows low insertion loss and good return loss characteristics up to frequencies of 40 GHz.

The bioadhesive strength of four different molecular weight (MW) polyoxyethylene polymers was measured by Instronâ tensile tester using glass plate and bovine sublingual tissue as substrate surfaces. Several BBD device formulations containing polyoxyethylene polymer (MW 7, 000, 000) were prepared by direct <b>compression</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> processes.

The bioadhesive strength of polyoxyethylene polymers appeared to be directly related to their molecular weights. When bovine sublingual mucosa or a glass plate was used as model mucosal substrate surface, the rank order of bioadhesive strength of different molecular weight polyoxyethylene polymers was similar. The bioadhesive strength of devices prepared by the <b>compression</b> <b>molding</b> process was greater than those prepared by direct compression, but the kinetics of drug release were independent of the process used for {{the preparation of the}} devices.
