The information about duration of endocarp lignification {{is important for}} timing of management practices, irrigation and pest control in oil cultivars, and fruit thinning in table cultivars to obtain uniform fruit weight and size. In this study, fruit length, width and weight of four Istrian autochthonous olive cultivars (‘Buža’, ‘Puntoža’, ‘Rošinjola’ and ‘Istarska bjelica’) were measured. Samples were taken from olive <b>collection</b> <b>orchard</b> of the Institute of Agriculture and Tourism in Poreč in equal growing conditions. The {{aim of the research}} was to define an olive fruit growth dynamics during pit hardening. Fruit weight in all cultivars was increasing during endocarp lignification (from 7 th to 28 th July). The highest percentage in the weight growth in the first week had cultivars ‘Buža’ (48. 5 %) and ‘Rošinjola’ (44. 6 %) while in the second week maximum was reached by cultivars ‘Puntoža’ (44. 2 %) and ‘Istarska bjelica’ (42 %). The highest increase in total fruit mass was detected in ‘Puntoža’ (1. 30 g) and the least at ‘Rošinjola’ (0. 56 g). Maximum increase in length (L) and width (W) had ‘Puntoža’ (L: 7. 13 mm; W: 4. 23 mm) and the least ‘Istarska bjelica’ (L: 2. 48 mm; W: 2. 70 mm) ...|$|E

Gene frequency at the Tpi locus varied seasonally and was associated positively with total monthly rainfall measured both immediately prior to and concurrent with the month of collection. Temporal heterogeneity, not associated with the environmental parameters, {{was present at the}} Adh locus. Gpdh-F frequency was negatively associated with mean monthly maximum temperature measured prior to the time of <b>collection.</b> Within the <b>orchard</b> site, spatial heterogeneity in gene frequency at the Tpi locus was observed within collections. A deficiency of Gpdh heterozygotes was observed in individual trap samples and among collections with traps pooled. Overall, this variation is interpreted as being due to sampling from a population of partially isolated subgroups, founded by few individuals, and dependent upon transient pockets of fruit resources...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus nitens is an {{important}} forestry species grown for pulp and paper production in the temperate, summer-rainfall regions of South Africa. A tree improvement programme has been ongoing at the Institute for Commercial Forestry Research for two decades, but genetic improvement in the species has been slow due to delayed and infrequent flowering and seed production. Three trials were established, firstly, to quantify the gains {{that have been made}} in the first generation of improvement in the breeding programme and, secondly, to establish whether a number of seed source and orchard variables influence the performance of the progeny. These variables were the amount of flowering trees in the seed orchard, year of seed <b>collection,</b> seed <b>orchard</b> origin and composition of seed orchard bulks. Diameter at breast height and tree heights were measured in the trials at between 87 and 97 months after establishment, and timber volumes and survival were calculated. Improved seed orchard bulks performed significantly better (p< 0. 01) than unimproved controls in the field trials. Genetic gains ranging from 23. 2 to 164. 8 m 3 ha− 1 were observed over the unimproved commercial seed. There were significant differences (p< 0. 01) in progeny growth between the levels of seed orchard flowering, with higher levels of flowering (≥ 40 %) producing substantially greater progeny growth than lower flowering levels (≤ 20 %). The seed orchard had no effect on progeny growth in this trial series. This suggests that seed collected from any of the four seed orchards tested will produce trees with significant improvement in growth. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In avocado, {{very little}} is known about {{rootstock}} characteristics, their suitability to various soil conditions, and their influence on tree growth and productivity. This lack of knowledge applies also to differences in traits between various sources of graftwood. The problem has been discussed extensively in previous articles in this series (1, 2). In the first of these (1), a field experiment was described which was initiated in 1968 and today (1975) comprises over 220 different trials to test various rootstock/scion combinations under different cultivation conditions. In the second article of the series (2) we presented data collected from mature, fruit-bearing orchards, not designed as experimental <b>orchards.</b> Data <b>collection</b> in these <b>orchards</b> has now been completed and the present article is intended to summarize the material and to draw the relevant conclusions. The limitations of the orchards under discussion lie in the lack of control over the various stages of the foundation of the plots, lack of the correct design in the distribution of the plants in the experimental plots — as required by principles of experimental design, as well as lack of design—in accordance with rootstock/scion combinations...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The Sleep <b>Orchard</b> is a <b>collection</b> {{of poetry}} written in {{response}} to the life and artwork of Arshile Gorky. By mapping the differences as well as the deepening intersections between Gorky and the author, these poems highlight the complexities inherent in attempting to understand another?s life and art within the frame of one?s own consciousness. In addition to meditating on various paintings and the subsequent thoughts they inspire, the text shifts between reflection, recollection, description, confessionalism, and collage, ultimately carving an intimate trajectory through history, memory, vibrancy, and loss. The Invisible Foxglove Spine is a collection of ekphrastic poems in which personal and historical resonances often strive to transcend the purely visual realm of the paintings that initially inspired them. Notions of religion, gender, family, as well as avenues of human connectivity are addressed. The critical commentary explores notions of truth in biographical writing, the relation of this to my poetry <b>collection</b> The Sleep <b>Orchard,</b> as well as voice appropriation in connection with my manuscript on Arshile Gorky. Also investigated are notions of ekphrasis and gender in my shadow collection The Invisible Foxglove Spine, as well as the relationship between ekphrasis and the confessional as considered through the work of contemporary poets Pascal Petit and Deryn Rees-Jones.

40|$|Orin Martin {{manages the}} Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz, {{where he is}} widely admired for his skills as a master orchardist, horticulturalist, and teacher. Martin grew up an {{athletic}} and outdoors-oriented child in Massachusetts, Florida, New York State, and Ohio—without any interest in gardening, which struck him as “an onerous chore, and kind of sissy stuff, actually. ” While he was in Washington, D. C. in the late 1960 s, {{as a student at}} American University, he “got politicized” by current events: some 100, 000 citizens marched on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam war; Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. In 1969, exhausted and alienated after a lonely struggle to avoid the military draft, Martin followed some friends to Santa Cruz, where he heard about “this place called ‘The Garden’”—the one being cultivated by Alan Chadwick and his protégés on the UCSC campus. “I wandered up there one morning,” said Martin in this interview, “and I was just bowled over, {{and fell in love with}} it, and felt, I have to do this. ” Martin had no training as a gardener. His unfinished undergraduate studies were in English; his interests leaned toward writing and literature. Suddenly infatuated with the Chadwick garden nonetheless, he attended public lectures given by Alan Chadwick on the campus and in town. In 1972, shortly after Chadwick had left Santa Cruz and the UCSC Farm had been launched, Martin began volunteering several days a week at the Farm and Garden. When the apprenticeship program there became formalized under Chadwick successor Stephen Kaffka, Martin applied; after completing the apprenticeship in 1975, he received a grant to start a community gardening program in various locations around Santa Cruz County. In 1977, UCSC hired Martin and a colleague named “Big” Jim Nelson (not to be confused with the Jim Nelson interviewed in this series) to oversee the Farm and Garden. More than thirty years later, countless productive garden beds, fruit trees, and former apprentices bear vital testimony to the effectiveness of Martin’s ministrations. In this interview—conducted on July 11 th and August 29 th, 2008, at UCSC’s Science and Engineering Library—Orin Martin spoke with Sarah Rabkin about his work with the Farm and Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, his cultivation of an organic rose <b>collection</b> and <b>orchards</b> of citrus and deciduous fruit tree varieties especially suited to the local climate, and his mentorship of Farm and Garden apprentices...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{effects of}} clonal variability, crown {{position}} of cones, and top-pruning of ramets to reduce height growth, on 1) {{the proportion of}} viable self-fertilized progeny (s) and 2) the proportion of filled seeds (PF), were investigated in a 20 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. 1 Franco) seed orchard. Cones were collected from the upper one-third and lower one-third crown positons of pruned and nonpruned raiets (three each) from six clones. Estimates of s were derived from a maximum likelihood procedure using data from 10 allozyme loci (PGII, LAP 1, LAP 2, GOT 2, GOT 3, GLYDH, CAT, 6 PGD, IDH, and DIA). The six clones sampled varied significantly (P < 0. 05) both in s and PF, but estimates of PF and s were not significantly correlated among clones. On the average, seeds from the upper portion of the crown were lower in s (0. 055) and higher in PF (0. 512) than seeds from the lower crown (s = 0. 190, PF = 0. 381). Combined over crown positions, pruning appeared to have little effect on s, while pruned ramets (PF = 0. 432) had only a slightly lower filled seed proportion than nonpruned ramets (PF = 0. 461). A total crown estimate of the proportion of viable progeny due to selffertilization from the six sampled clones was about 10 percent. These results show that crown position of cones, top-pruning, and clonal variation are all factors which could influence orchard management practices and the utilization of orchard seeds. Although the average proportion of viable progeny resulting from selffertilization in the seed orchard appeared to be no greater than that found in natural populations, information on clonal variation {{may be useful in}} roguing decisions. It may be desirable to remove clones which are consistently high selfers and low seed producers; or perhaps seed from these clones should be excluded from commercial <b>collections.</b> In addition, <b>orchard</b> managers may consider not collecting lower crown cones because of the lower seed yields and greater proportions of self seed found in the lower crown. In this study, the effects of top-pruning orchard ramets on seed set or self ing appeared to be minimal, but {{it remains to be seen}} whether there is a relationship between severity of top-pruning and seed quality or quantity...|$|R
40|$|The first {{experiments}} on cryopreservation at CNR-IVALSA in Florence {{date back to}} 1998. They were {{a response to the}} necessity to explore new and innovative systems for the ex situ conservation of woody plant germplasm, complementary to the traditional approach of in-field <b>collection</b> (clonal <b>orchards).</b> In Italy, the IVALSA Institute has one of the largest germplasm collections of fruit species (over 1800 accessions of peach, olive, plum, pear, persimmon, cherry, apple and quince) spread over the 60 ha of its experimental farm. Year by year, the maintenance costs of the collections are becoming heavier to bear. Furthermore, {{in the middle of the}} 90 s the Sharka disease (Plum Pox Virus) spread through the large plum collection, obliging the burning of a clonal orchard of over 150 accessions of Prunus domestica and Prunus salicina. Hence, cryopreservation technology was regarded as a possible complementary strategy for the future, reducing to a minimum the risks of germplasm loss. Taking advantage of the considerable expertise in plant tissue culture, a small cryolaboratory was soon established to begin with. The first experiments were with poplar (Populus spp.) and olive (Olea europaea), two species of great importance in Italy in terms of germplasm preservation. Since then, various cryopreservation techniques, numerous species (mainly, but not exclusively, woody plants) and various kinds of explants have been tested, mostly with the practical aim of developing effective and reproducible protocols for long-term conservation. Among the cryoprotocols which were satisfactorily developed (thanks also to National and International collaborations), the following are particularly worthy of mention: the cryopreservation of shoot tips from white poplar (Populus alba), plum (Prunus domestica) and a non-woody species (Cichorium intybus), of embryogenic lines from olive and horsechestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), and of seeds from Pistacia and Citrus spp. However, it has not been ten years of only successes, not at all! On the contrary, enthusiasm over some very good results has often been followed by deep frustration deriving from disappointing experiments. One example: after ten years of trials, testing all the different cryotechniques today available (included slow cooling), the cryopreservation of olive shoot tips is still unreliable, a long way from being proposable as a complementary approach to the conservation in field. Other failures have been the shoot-tip cryopreservation of a grape rootstock (Kober 5 BB) and of redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum), as well as the cryopreservation of an embryogenic line of ash (Fraxinus excelsior). What have we learnt from our ten-year experience in cryopreservation? What are the possible reasons for species adapting extraordinarily well to - 196 °C (e. g., white poplar, red chicory), and others being highly reacalcitrant (e. g., olive) ? Do we know all the potentialities, as well as all the limits, of the technology? First reflection: before working with plant cryopreservation, I had many years of experience in the field of somatic embryogenesis of woody plants. In my opinion, the two techniques share a practical similarity when approaching the study of a new species, i. e., for both, if after the first preliminary experiments you get nil (i. e., no explant producing an embryogenic callus, as well as no explant surviving to - 196 °C), there is little hope that it will be possible to develop a succesful protocol, whatever you change in the methodology. If you get at least one positive (i. e., a fully-developed plantlet), it is worthy to go on! That means much more than only a glimmer of hope! Second reflection: working with woody plants, species having structural difficulties in the initial stages of micropropagation (e. g., big problems with the in vitro establishment, low proliferation rates, very slow shoot elongation) will be, with most probability, also difficult in the development of an effective cryopreservation protocol. One example: olive is very difficult and slow during the introduction and the establishment in vitro. So, is the difficulty in developing an effective shoot-tip cryopreservation protocol strictly due to its low tolerance to ultra-rapid freezing? Or, rather, is it due to the accentuation of a basic problem when a sort of second establishment in vitro is required (i. e., the shoot-tip development after thawing and plating) ? Third reflection: a big mistake was made in the 80 s in the field of micropropagation, i. e., private users were given to believe that every species could be, soon or later, successfully micropropagated, it just required experiments and tests of different medium/growth regulator combinations. In Italy, that idea led to the proliferation of commercial laboratories in the early 90 s, which soon found themselves fighting to produce and offer the same relatively-few species which could be actually produced in vitro. The majority of them went broke in a few years! Of course, cryopreservation is a totally different story (first, it is a non-profit activity). However, we must be very careful to avoid the same mistake when promoting cryopreservation. Last but not least: a warm welcome to projects like Crymcept and CryoPlanet !! Certainly, we are all convinced that plant cryopreservation still needs much experimentation and, more important, a continuous confrontation between scientists with different experiences, made with different species and in different scientific and national contexts. vokMyynti MTT, Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
