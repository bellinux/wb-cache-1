25|$|Knitted {{textiles}} survive {{from early}} periods, {{but the first}} substantive evidence of <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> relates to its appearance in Europe during the 19th century. Earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a separate looped yarn technique.|$|E
25|$|Freeform crochet is a {{technique}} that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece. It is generally accomplished by building shapes or structural elements onto existing <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> at any place the crafter desires.|$|E
2500|$|Basic {{materials}} {{required for}} crochet are a hook and {{some type of}} material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread. [...] Yarn, {{one of the most}} commonly used materials for crocheting has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric,</b> or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which {{can be used to make}} tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.|$|E
50|$|Tapestry crochet is {{sometimes}} called jacquard crochet, intarsia, mosaic, fair isle, and colorwork, but today these terms usually describe different techniques. Since the yarns are switched {{back and forth to}} create motifs, tapestry <b>crochet</b> <b>fabric</b> looks more like it was woven on a loom than crocheted with a hook.|$|R
5000|$|Bead crochet is a crochet {{technique}} that incorporates beads into a <b>crochet</b> <b>fabric.</b> The technique {{is used to}} produce decorative effects in women's fashion accessories. The word [...] "crochet" [...] {{is derived from the}} French [...] "croche" [...] or [...] "croc" [...] meaning [...] "to hook". Published descriptions of bead crochet date from around 1824 although it was probably common before then. [...] At one time, bead crochet was thought by some people to be appropriate only for rich people.|$|R
50|$|Crochet thread is {{specially}} formulated thread {{usually made}} from mercerized cotton for crafting decorative crochet {{items such as}} doilies or filet crochet. <b>Crochet</b> thread produces <b>fabric</b> of fine gauge that may be stiffened with starch.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> is {{begun by}} placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a {{suitable}} length. The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined {{to the beginning of}} the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain. At any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time. [...] Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat or in the round.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Since {{the beads}} {{fall to the}} back of the stitches, {{tapestry}} <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> can have beads on one side and colorful motifs on the other. A hook with a handle makes it easier to crochet tight stitches.|$|E

5000|$|Bailey's technique, {{of mostly}} {{circular}} rows of single <b>crochet,</b> forms a <b>fabric</b> classified as tapestry crochet in flat, geometric, highly-colored designs influenced by African, Chinese, and Native American and Eastern philosophies, with undertones of 1970s [...] "Funk" [...] aesthetic. Her signature stitch is a flowy line, {{as if it}} is dripping. She calls it the [...] "liquid stitch". [...] Bailey has a hat shop on Etsy.com featuring her crown-like creations. Her hats have been featured in United Colors of Benetton ads, on The Cosby Show, and in the Spike Lee film Do The Right Thing (worn by Samuel L. Jackson as DJ Mister Se ñor Love Daddy). She credits her shift from hats to walls, to Chicago artist Nick Cave. [...] In 2000 Bailey received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Visual Arts.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at CalArts, Kelley started {{to work on a}} series of {{projects}} in which he explored works with loose poetic themes, such as The Sublime, Monkey Island and Plato's Cave, Rothko's Chapel, Lincoln's Profile, using a variety of different media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, video, and writing. In the 1980s he became known for working with another type of material: <b>crocheted</b> blankets, <b>fabric</b> dolls and other rag toys found at thrift stores and yard sales. Perhaps the most famous work in this vein, More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin from 1987, featured a mess of used rag dolls, animals and blankets strewn across a canvas, a way of investing a fictional childhood scene with some visceral pathos which was first shown at Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1988, Kelley created an installation called Pay for Your Pleasure, which featured a gallery of portraits of men of genius — poets, philosophers and artists included — subverted at the end by a painting created by a convicted criminal. In From My Institution to Yours (1988) and Proposal for the Decoration of an Island of Conference Rooms (1992), Kelly appropriated photocopied drawings and other ephemera of vernacular office humor and moved it into more formalized environments where such crude materials are normally not seen.|$|R
5000|$|Gschwandtner uses film, video, photography, and {{textiles}} as her mediums. She sews together filmstrips {{to create a}} quilt-like textile. She then installs them with led lights behind them so the viewer can see through the filmstrips when looking up close. She began sewing filmstrips together in 2009 when {{a friend of hers}} gave her 16 mm films from Anthology Film Archives that were no longer of use to the Fashion Institute of Technology. Gschwandtner uses documentaries about “art, craft, fashion, decoration, vocation, military camouflage, feminist expression, and scientific metaphor” in her artworks, mostly from the 1950s-80s. Many of the short documentary films recognized and admired women’s role in craft making, such as knitting, <b>crocheting,</b> and <b>fabric</b> dyeing. After she watches the films, she cuts and sews them together in patterns that resemble popular American quilt motifs. She has made several works in a [...] "crazy quilt" [...] pattern. [...] Leah Ollman of the LA Times wrote in a 2017 review: [...] "Gschwandtner unites the strips in traditional quilt patterns — interlocking triangles and diamonds set within squares, energetic designs that play surface against depth, control against abandon. She makes astute use of color, mixing vivid stretches of jade, yellow and cerulean with the faded hues of old footage, all accented with black countdown leader and lengths of toned emptiness." [...] Gschwandtner uses quilts because they symbolize and celebrate [...] "the undervalued work of female laborers and artisans, largely overlooked." [...] Film Archivist Andrew Lampert says that her work is able to [...] "greatly expand our notion of film editing, narrative and the moving image." ...|$|R

5000|$|Filet crochet {{is a type}} of <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric.</b> This type of {{crocheted lace}} is gridlike because it uses only two crochet stitches: the chain stitch and the double crochet stitch (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than double crochet stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet crochet forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double crochet stitches. [...] Filet crochet is usually constructed from monotone crochet thread made of Mercerised cotton in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet crochet is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in <b>crochet</b> and knitting. <b>Fabric</b> also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|R
50|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{alternatives to}} using tampons are the menstrual cup, reusable sanitary pads, menstrual sponges and reusable tampons. Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are worn inside the vagina {{to collect the}} fluid. Reusable sanitary pads are similar to disposable sanitary pads, but differ {{in the sense that}} they can be washed and used as many times as needed by the owner. For women who cannot or don't want to use a menstrual cup, but like internal products, sea sponges inserted like tampons may be a good option. These can also be washed out and reused and when they lose their absorbency can be composted. Some women have also made reusable tampons, often pieces of knit or <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> that are rolled up and inserted into the vagina, and later washed, dried and reused. These alternatives are environmentally friendly because they are reusable, and in some cases compostable, so they contribute less waste to landfills.|$|E

40|$|The intension of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the industrial highlights and strengths of the East Midlands region, both at the regional and local administrative area level. In addition, representative companies of each highlighted industry were identified. The purpose of this information was to help inform and assist a regional Venture Capital Fund (East Midlands Early Growth Fund) in their deal generation and assessment activities. This cross-sectional survey used three sources of data: 1. 	Employment data statistics were used to identify industrial highlights. 2. 	A company report database was used to generate a list of companies present within each industrial highlight. 3. 	A survey of local economic development professionals cross referenced secondary sources as well as provided additional information. Industrial highlights or strengths were identified for the East Midlands Region and all 40 constituent areas along with a number of exemplar companies. Analysis of the geographical distribution of these strengths identified some agglomerations of industries that may be indicative of the presence of clusters: 1. 	Agricultural cluster centred in Lincolnshire with specific strengths in poultry and Fruit & Vegetable production and processing. 2. 	Food processing, located across the region 3. 	Plastics manufacture around Nottingham and Corby/ Rutland. 4. 	Textiles, with specific strengths in footwear manufacture in Northamptonshire, and kitted and <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> around Leicester and Ashfield/ Amber Valley. 5. 	Furniture manufacture, particularly production of seats and chairs to the west of the City of Nottingham (Erewash). 6. 	Construction, with highlights in concrete manufacture. 7. 	Light engineering, specifically with highlights in engine manufacture, including both electrical motors and non-electrical engines, as well as the transport equipment sector, with specific loci around Derby in the rail (or tram) and aerospace industries...|$|E
