5000|$|Traditionally, {{a type of}} kobold, {{called a}} Klabautermann, lives aboard ships and helps sailors and {{fishermen}} on the Baltic and North Sea in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the Low German verb klabastern meaning [...] "rumble" [...] or [...] "make a noise". An etymology deriving the name from the verb kalfatern ("to caulk") has also been suggested. [...] A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in yellow with a tobacco pipe and woollen sailor's cap, often carrying a <b>caulking</b> <b>hammer,</b> {{is attached to the}} mast as a symbol of good luck. However, despite the positive attributes, there is one omen associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship. [...] The belief in Klabauterm√§nner dates to at least the 1770s.|$|E
50|$|The Malays have {{developed}} an indigenous technique to build wooden boats. They build without plans, hull first, frames later. The planks are fire bent and joined edge on edge using basok (wooden dowels) made from Penaga-ironwood (Mesua ferrea). There is no European style <b>caulking</b> <b>hammered</b> into a groove between the planks: Before the new plank is hammered home, a strip of paperbarks skin (kulit gelam) of the Melaleuca species is placed over the dowels. This 1 - 2 mm layer of a natural material has sealing properties. It is an ancient and unique building technique, the origins of which might {{date back to the}} Proto-Malay migrations that colonised the archipelago thousands of years ago.|$|R
