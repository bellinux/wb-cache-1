All five organisms were highly active on degraded ground cellulose powder and dissolved 72 - 90 yo, but only one organism, B. succinogenes strain s- 85, was equally effective on cellulose powder (Whatman) or on undegraded <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres.</b> R. jlavefaciens strain FD- 1 was somewhat less potent on the latter substrates, achieving 40 and 60 yo dissolution, respectively, of cellulose powder (Whatman) and <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres.</b> R. albus strain 7 and R.

The euro notes contain many complex security features such as watermarks, invisible ink, holograms and microprinting that document their authenticity.

In June 1998, the Bank of Canada prepared to use Luminus as the substrate for the Canadian Journey Series, but in December 1999 the manufacturer withdrew its supply bid because it could not produce the substrate at the scale required by the Bank of Canada for printing banknotes. The bank printed the Canadian Journey Series on a <b>cotton</b> <b>fibre</b> substrate with similar surface characteristics to Luminus {{so that it could}} transition production to using the polymer substrate when scale production issues were resolved.

40|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> develop {{over four}} stages: initiation, elongation, secondary-wall thickening, and maturation. They develop a {{significant}} crystalline structure during the elongation stage of its development. Dyeing these fibres {{was used as}} a new method to see cellulose development. From all measured properties it was concluded that the most significant changes in crystallinity of developing <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> occur between 17 and 24 days after flowering. When native cellulose (Celluose I) is treated with certain alkali concentrations. cellulose II is formed. The aim of this research is to observe and assign qualitative crystallinity changes in <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> using X-ray diffraction and ATR FT-IR spectroscopy subsequent to sodium hydroxide treatment and to compare these observations with immunoassay labelling techniques; such biological techniques have never been used to quantify molecular changes in polymers. It was demonstrated that the use of molecular probes attached to carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) provided molecular recognition for cellulose with differences in crystallinity, and enabled visual representation of the presence of crystalline and amorphous cellulose. Cellulose and chitin are the most abundant polysaccharides found in nature. Cotton is modified using genetic or chemic methods to incorporate chitin or chitosan residues into the fibre. Objective of this work is to create a reproducible technique to test genetically modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> {{to see if there are}} any detectable differences between control and modified fibres. Sorption of dyes was studied to understand the mechanism of adsorption for dyes on cotton. Genetically and chemically modified <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> were typical of a Freundlich isotherm at both pH 4 and pH 7. Obtained data from the study of the effect of temperature on sorption isotherms showed the highest overall exhaustion (qe) at lower temperatures (20 - 40 °C), probably due to the exothermic process.

40|$|Treatment of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> {{has been}} studied in air and oxygen plasma and the treat-ment time, nature and flow rate of the gas, and plasma power have been varied. Inorder to {{establish}} the chemical effect of plasma treatment on <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> the fol-lowing tests have been performed: Cuprammonium fluidity test, weight loss measure-ment, determination of carboxyl groups, carbonyl group identification, FTIR analysis and measurement of the ASTM yellowness of the untreated and plasma treated cotton fab-rics. In addition, vertical wicking studies {{and the effect of}} ageing of the plasma treated samples on the rate and the amount of dye uptake have been investigated. The plasma treatments lead to surface erosion of the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> which generates a weight loss, accompanied by an increase in the fibre carboxyl group and carbonyl group contents. The increase in fibre carboxyl group content leads to a more wettable fibre and the rate of fabric vertical wicking is increased. The direct dye (chloramine Fast Red K) uptake of treated samples increases almost linearly with the increase in fibre carboxyl group con-tent caused by plasma treatment, but progressively decreases with increase in the age-ing time after oxygen plasma treatment. Ageing after plasma treatment also increases the fabric yellowness...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper demonstrates that the capacity of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> to adsorb cationic surfactants {{as well as the}} rate of the adsorption process can be increased by adsorbing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto the fibre surfacesin addition, the adsorption can be restricted to the fibre surface. CMC was deposited by means of adsorption from an aqueous solution. The adsorption of N-cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) from an aqueous solution onto the CMC-modified fibres was measured using UVspectrometric determination of the surfactant concentration in the solution. Adsorption onto the <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> was studied in a weakly basic environment (pH 8. 5) where <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> are negatively charged and the CPC ion is positively charged. Modification of the fibres by adsorption of CMC introduces new carboxyl groups onto the fibre surfaces, thereby increasing the adsorption capacity of the fibres for CPC. The initial rate of adsorption of CPC increased proportionally with the amountof chargehowever, this rate slowed down at high degrees of coverage onfibres with a high charge. The adsorption of cationic surfactant to the anionic surface groups was stoichiometric, with no indication of multilayer oradmicelle formation. It was evident that the acidic group content of the fibres was the primary factor determining cationic surfactant adsorption to these fibres...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in the field of chemical modification of cotton to improve dyeing properties [1]. Recent advances in biotechnology, especially in genetic engineering, offer an alternative route to alter reactivity of <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> and thus to reduce the environmental impact and energy consumption of conventional cotton processing. However the success of this breakthrough approach is dependent on the early selection of new fibre types with the best performance. This requires novel tests that use only small amounts of fibre sample due to the very limited availability of bioengineered lines. For this purpose, a semi industrial dyeing method is extensively studied. The method is validated by a well established technique for nitrogen analysis, the Kjehdahl method, using <b>cotton</b> <b>fibres</b> treated with a commercially available cationic agent at various concentrations...|$|R
