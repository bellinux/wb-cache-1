40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{describe}} {{the design and}} control of RHex, a power autonomous, untethered, compliant-legged hexapod robot. RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneu-verable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s sig-nificant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively con-trolled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward loco-motion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body <b>clearance.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS—legged locomotion, hexapod robot, clock driven, mobility, autonomy, biomimesis 1...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the pathology of equine influenza, necropsy of 7 horses experimentally infected with equine influenza A virus (EIV) subtype H 3 N 8 {{was conducted on}} post-infection days (PID) 2, 3, 7, and 14. Histopathologically, rhinitis or tracheitis including epithelial degeneration or necrosis with loss of ciliated epithelia {{and a reduction in}} goblet cell numbers, was observed in the respiratory tracts on PIDs 2 and 3. Epithe-lial hyperplasia or squamous metaplasia and suppurative bronchopneumonia with proliferation of type II pneumocytes were observed on PIDs 7 and 14. Viral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the epithelia of the nasal mucosa, trachea, and bronchi on PIDs 2 and 3. The sodA gene of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, a suspected cause of suppurative bronchopneumonia, was detected in paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections, but only on PIDs 7 and 14. These findings suggest that damage caused to ciliated epithelia and goblet cells by EIV infection results in secondary bacte-rial bronchopneumonia due to a reduction in mucociliary <b>clearance.</b> <b>Key</b> words: equine influenza A virus, equine respiratory disease, experimental infection [2, 13].

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} {{alveolar proteinosis}} (I-PAP) is a rare disease of unknown etiology in which the alveoli fill with lipoproteinaceous material. We report here that I-PAP is an autoimmune disease with neutralizing antibody of immunoglobulin G isotype against granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The antibody {{was found to be}} present in all specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from 11 I-PAP patients but not in samples from 2 secondary PAP patients, 53 normal subjects, and 14 patients with other lung diseases. It specifically bound GM-CSF and neutralized bioactivity of the cytokine in vitro. The antibody was also found in sera from all I-PAP patients examined but not in sera from a secondary PAP patient or normal subjects, indicating that it exists systemically in I-PAP patients. As lack of GM-CSF signaling causes PAP in congenital cases and PAP-like disease in murine models, our findings strongly suggest that neutralization of GM-CSF bioactivity by the antibody causes dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, which results in reduced surfactant <b>clearance.</b> <b>Key</b> words: autoantibody • granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor • {{pulmonary alveolar proteinosis}} • alveolar macrophage • surfactant protein Downloaded from jem. rupress. or...|$|E

Specifically, it was evaluated if there are differences in the space-temporal parameters between male and female in the clearance of and dynamic obstacles moving at both slow and fast speeds. Basic procedures. Five young male adults and five young female adults took part in this study. The task was performed in three conditions: static obstacle and dynamic obstacle – clearance perpendicular to the participant’s trajectory at slow speed (1. 07 m/s) and at fast speed (1. 71 m/s). The trials were recorded by two digital cameras and spatial-temporal information was obtained. Main findings. The dynamic obstacle conditions required more visual inspection. The results showed different adaptive locomotion between the sexes. The distinct gait patterns were evidenced for the spatial and temporal variables and cadence in the three conditions. Conclusions.

40|$|Deficiency of serum {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) M {{is associated with}} the development of a lupus-like disease in mice. Recent studies suggest that classical complement components facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cells and that failure to do so predisposes mice to lupus. Since IgM is a potent activator of the classical complement pathway, we examined IgM binding to dying cells. IgM, but not IgG, bound to apoptotic T cells through the Fab � portion of the antibody. Exposure of apoptotic cell membranes to phospholipase (PL) A 2 increased, whereas PLD reduced, IgM binding and complement activation. Absorption studies combined with direct plate binding assays, revealed that IgM antibodies failed to bind to phosphatidyl lipids, but did recognize lysophosphatidylcholine and the phosphorylcholine head group. Both iPLA 2 and cPLA 2 are activated during apoptosis. Since inhibition of iPLA 2, but not cPLA 2, attenuated IgM binding to apoptotic cells, these results strongly suggest that the endogenous calcium independent PLA 2, iPLA 2, is involved in the hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids and exposure of the epitope(s) recognized by IgM.

40|$|SummaryAutophagy is a {{fundamental}} biological process of the eukaryotic cell contributing to diverse cellular and physiological functions including cell-autonomous defense against intracellular pathogens. Here, we screened the Rab family of membrane trafficking regulators for effects on autophagic elimination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis BCG and found that Rab 8 b and its downstream interacting partner, innate immunity regulator TBK- 1, are required for autophagic elimination of mycobacteria in macrophages. TBK- 1 was necessary for autophagic maturation.

A correlation between the intensity of the symptom and the severity of esophageal dysfunction, either motility (manometry) or bolus transit (impedance) has not been clearly demonstrated. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the correlation between objective esophageal function assessment (with manometry and impedance) and perception of bolus passage in healthy volunteers (HV) with normal and pharmacologically-induced esophageal hypocontractility, and in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) with and without ineffective esophageal motility (IEM). Methods Combined manometry-impedance was performed in 10 HV, 19 GERD patients without IEM and nine patients with IEM. Additionally, nine HV were studied after 50 mg sildenafil, which induced esophageal peristaltic failure. Perception of each 5 mL viscous swallow was evaluated using a 5 -point scale. Manometry identified hypocontractility (contractions lower than 30 mmHg) and impedance identified incomplete bolus <b>clearance.</b> <b>Key</b> Results In HV and in GERD patients with and without IEM, there was no association between either manometry or impedance and perception on per swallow analysis (OR: 0. 842 and OR: 2. 017, respectively), as well as on per subject analysis (P = 0. 44 and P = 0. 16, respectively). Lack of correlation was also found in HV with esophageal hypocontractility induced by sildenafil. Conclusions & Inferences There is no agreement between objective measurements of esophageal function and subjective perception of bolus passage. These results suggest that increased bolus passage perception in patients without mechanical obstruction might be due to esophageal hypersensitivity. Sandhill Scientific US...|$|E

40|$|Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the {{principle}} intermediate filament (IF) protein in astrocytes.

All GFAP mutations cause the same histopathological defect, i. e. RFs, though little is known how the mutations affect protein accumulation as well as astrocyte function. In this study, we found that GFAP accumulation induces macroautophagy, a <b>key</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanism for prevention of aggregated proteins. This autophagic response is negatively regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The activation of p 38 MAPK by GFAP accumulation is in part responsible for the down-regulation of phosphorylated-mTOR and the subsequent activation of autophagy.

40|$|Vaccination is {{the most}} {{effective}} way to prevent disease associated with influenza infection. However in susceptible hosts, a major contributing factor to host mortality is aberrant immune responses. In determining the causes of influenza related pathology, it was observed that excessive cytokine production, significant lung pathology, and a lack of viral <b>clearance</b> were <b>key</b> contributors to survival after a lethal infection. Therefore, both viral and host factors contribute to influenza related illness. Moreover, current influenza vaccines are suboptimal and the mechanistic insights into T cell based influenza immunity have not been fully described. The studies in this dissertation highlight the role of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and antiviral transcription factors in the induction of effector and memory T cell responses to influenza. It was determined that toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) deficiency contributed to impaired virus-specific memory T cell formation in secondary lymphoid tissue. Additionally, a novel role for interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3) in the expression of effector and cytotoxic proteins following primary and secondary influenza infections was defined. These studies suggest that signaling through host factors classically defined as innate immune proteins can contribute to protective T cell based immunity. Finally, a mucosally administered vaccine adjuvanted by a TLR 9 agonist was developed, that induced vaccine-specific memory T cell responses and limited viral replication following a lethal influenza challenge. Together, these results suggest that signaling through PRRs is a viable vaccine strategy capable of inducing memory T cell responses to prevent against influenza related disease. ...|$|R

Understanding virus-host interactions that enable acute HCV <b>clearance</b> is <b>key</b> {{to the development}} of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Here, using a sensitive neutralization assay based on infectious HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), we have studied the kinetics of humoral responses in a cohort of acute-phase patients infected during a single nosocomial outbreak in a hemodialysis center. The 17 patients were monitored for the spontaneous outcome of HCV infection for 6 months before a treatment decision was made. Blood samples were taken frequently (15 ± 4 per patient). Phylogenetic analysis of the predominant virus(es) revealed infection by only one of two genotype 1 b strains. While all patients seroconverted, their sera induced two opposing effects in HCVpp infection assays: inhibition and facilitation. Furthermore, the ability of sera to facilitate or inhibit infection correlated with the presence of either infecting HCV strain and divided the patients into two groups. In group 1, the progressive emergence of a relatively strong neutralizing response correlated with a fluctuating decrease in high initial viremia, leading to control of viral replication. Patients in group 2 failed to reduce viremia within the acute phase, and no neutralizing responses were detected despite seroconversion. Strikingly, sera of group 2, as well as naïve sera, facilitated infection by HCVpp displaying HCV glycoproteins from different genotypes and strains, including those retrieved from patients.

40|$|Abstract]: Ethics and {{politics}} constitute core elements of educational research, yet they cannot be taught and learned {{in isolation from}} the conduct of that research. Increasingly postgraduate research training has augmented what has been learned from working with supervisors to produce theses. Coursework also has a vital {{role to play in}} facilitating an engagement with the conceptual and methodological issues framing educational research ethics {{and politics}}. This presentation traces the aims and pedagogical strategies that underpinned the design of EDU 8604 Educational Research Ethics and Data Management, an online Doctor of Education course in the Faculty of Education at the USQ, Australia. The aims included encouraging students to apply the questions “Unde venisti?”, “Quo vadis?” and “Cui bono?” to their aspirations and experiences as educational researchers, while the strategies centred on interrogating the ethical approaches of other researchers as a means of generating and justifying their own applications for ethical <b>clearance.</b> Two <b>key</b> concepts underlying these aims and strategies and informing the responses to these questions are situated ethics and negotiated interests. The author proposes that recognising the sociocultural contexts and constructions of ethical moves and judgments, and attending to the interaction among often competing claims and positions, are crucial processes in explicating and evaluating the ethical and political dimensions of contemporary educational research. These concepts can contribute also to the repertoire of knowledge and skills required to engage transformatively in the complex and demanding field of educational research. The author argues that such a repertoire is mandatory if researchers are to extend that field and to enable others and themselves to create new futures in educational provision. “Unde venisti?”, “Quo vadis?” and “Cui bono?” emerge as significant questions to pose about ethics and politics in the course under review, in educational research and in education at large...|$|R

This triggers phagocytosis and elimination of RBCs from the circulation by splenic macrophages.

We show here that clearance and phagocytosis of opsonized RBCs is also regulated by CD 47 -SIRP�. The inhibition generated by CD 47 -SIRP � interaction is strongly attenuated but not absent in mice with only residual activity of the phosphatase Src homology 2 domain–containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP) - 1, suggesting that most SIRP � signaling in this system is mediated by SHP- 1 phosphatase activity.

Likewise, ECM- and pathway-based predictions of total clearances from both data sets demonstrated a strong correlation with the observed clinical values with 26 out of 28 compounds within a three-fold deviation.

Based on prior and ongoing work, this statement addresses DOD's progress in (1) reducing the timeliness of initial personnel security clearances at DOD and (2) building quality into the processes used to investigate and adjudicate security clearances. GAO reviewed Performance Accountability Council timeliness data and has begun a preliminary analysis of available DOD data, examined <b>key</b> <b>clearance</b> reform documents, and conducted interviews with DOD and the Performance Accountability Council officials about timeliness and {{efforts to improve the}} quality of investigations and adjudications. GAO plans to continue examining the timeliness and quality of personnel security clearances in DOD. This work will help inform the Comptroller General's high risk update decision in January 2011. ...|$|R
40|$|Renal <b>clearance</b> is a <b>key</b> {{determinant}} of {{the elimination of}} drugs. To date, only few in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) approaches have been described to predict the renal organ clearance as the net result of glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption. In this study, we measured in LLC-PK 1 cells the transport of 20 compounds that cover all four classes of the Biopharmaceutical Drug Disposition System. These data were incorporated into a novel kidney model to predict all renal clearance processes in human. We showed that filtration and secretion were main contributors to the renal organ clearance for all compounds, whereas reabsorption was predominant for compounds assigned to classes 1 and 2. Our results suggest that anionic drugs were not significantly secreted in LLC-PK 1 cells, resulting in under-predicted clearances. When all study compounds were included a high overall correlation between the reported and predicted renal organ clearances was obtained (R(2) = 0. 83). The prediction accuracy in terms of percentage within twofold and threefold error was 70 % and 95 %, respectively. In conclusion, our novel IVIVE method allowed to predict the human renal organ clearance and the contribution of each underlying process.

40|$|Recurrent airway {{obstruction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common airway diseases affecting mature horses. Increased bronchoalveolar mucus, neutrophil accumulation in airways, and airway obstruction are the main features of this disease. Mucociliary <b>clearance</b> is a <b>key</b> component of pulmonary defense mechanisms. Cilia are the motile part of this system and a complex linear array of dynein motors is responsible for their motility by moving along the microtubules in the axonemes of cilia and flagella. We previously detected a QTL for RAO on ECA 13 in a half-sib family of European Warmblood horses. The gene encoding DNAH 3 is located in the peak of the detected QTL and encodes a dynein subunit. Therefore, we analysed this gene as a positional and functional candidate gene for RAO. In a mutation analysis of all 62 exons we detected 53 new polymorphisms including 7 non-synonymous variants. We performed an association study using 38 polymorphisms in a cohort of 422 animals. However, after correction for multiple testing we did not detect a significant association of any of these polymorphisms with RAO (P > 0. 05). Therefore, it seems unlikely that variants at the DNAH 3 gene are responsible for the RAO QTL in European Warmblood horses...|$|R
40|$|Two general methodologies for dynamic {{modeling}} of joint clearances in multibody mechanical systems are presented throughout this work. In the first approach {{the elements that}} compose the joint clearance are considered as colliding bodies and contact-impact forces control {{the behavior of the}} joint. A continuous contact force model provides these intra-joint contact-impact forces. From the system configuration, a geometric condition defines whether or not the joint elements are in contact. In this model the <b>clearance</b> plays a <b>key</b> role in the joint performance. As far as the second model is concerned, it takes advantage of the analytical definition of the contacting surfaces within the joint clearance. The problem is regularized avoiding the use of the clearance as the primary variable, leading to a contact force formally similar to the Hertz model. This force is specifically formulated {{in the context of an}} energy-momentum time integration. The two different methodologies presented in this work are compared with the help of numerical simulations of an elementary mechanical system in which one of the revolute joints has a specified clearance.

40|$|Obesity and its {{comorbidities}} are an ever-expanding cost of affluent societies. Energy homeostasis {{is mediated}} by {{a network of}} hormonal signals that originates from many tissues, including white adipose tissue (WAT). Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a lipogenic hormone secreted by WAT that stimulates triglyceride (TG) storage (i. e. non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) trapping) by increasing glucose uptake and NEFA esterification. ASP deficient mice are characterized by reduced body weight and WAT mass and delayed postprandial TG and NEFA <b>clearance.</b> The <b>key</b> enzyme in the regulation of TG clearance is lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The overall objective of this thesis {{was to examine the}} mechanisms by which ASP deficiency leads to delayed postprandial TG clearance and altered body composition in KO mice and to regulate, in coordination with other hormones, energy balance and metabolic profile in morbidly obese subjects following weight loss. Novel findings in this thesis suggest that (1) in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, ASP increases hydrolysis, uptake and esterification of TG-rich lipoproteins (in situ LPL activity) by increasing NEFA trapping within the adipocytes thus decreasing NEFA inhibition of LPL activity, (2) In ex vivo study in mice, ASP deficiency was found not to result in any intrinsic tissue differences in glucose or NEFA oxidation or storage in WAT, skeletal muscle or liver, however, NEFA trapping was enhanced in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of KO mice. Moreover, ASP enhances in situ LPL activity, TG clearance and lipogenesis in WAT while in muscle ASP induces the opposite effects to those in WAT and increases lipolysis and (3) In in vivo study on morbidly obese subjects following gastric-bypass induced weight loss, the changes in ASP and adiponectin were predictive of weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and apolipoprotein B concentration. In addition, the orexigenic gastric hormone, ghrelin, remains below normal levels in all subjects following surgery, which may favors maintenance of weight loss. In conclusion, these findings underscore the central role of WAT and ASP pathway in the regulation of TG clearance and energy homeostasis and suggest that, in vivo, an effective ASP pathway favors NEFA trapping in the physiological depot, which would promote optimal insulin activity...|$|R
