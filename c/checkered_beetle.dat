25|$|Since clerids are predaceous in nature, {{they have}} been found feeding on fly larvae {{as well as the}} skin and bones of carrion. Most clerids are not useful in {{forensics}} because of their food choice, but some species such as the Necrobia rufipes can be useful. Necrobia rufipes is attracted towards carrion in the later stages of decomposition, so its arrival on carrion can help provide an estimate for the post-mortem interval or PMI.

Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of bark beetles. Some species of bark beetles such as the southern pine beetle and the mountain pine beetle can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible biological control agent for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used bark beetle aggreagation pheromones to attract the <b>checkered</b> <b>beetle</b> to specific trees.

40|$|The <b>checkered</b> <b>beetle</b> Aphelochroa sanguinalis (Westwood) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) {{is found}} in savanna and {{woodland}} ecosystems of southern and eastern Africa. During surveys for insect floral visitors in the Skukuza Ranger District of Kruger National Park, South Africa, we encountered adults of Aphelochroa sanguinalis on flowers of two tree species, Acacia grandicornuta Gerstner and Acacia tortilis (Forsskal) Hayne (Fabaceae). These two tree species flower in the early rainy season (November-December) and have small white flowers in small round ball-shaped clusters. Adults of Aphelochroa sanguinalis were not found on flowers of 14 other tree species with different floral structures which were flowering {{at the same time}} as Acacia grandicornuta and Acacia tortilis. Predatory, reproductive, and defensive behaviors (including the presence of a chemical defense) are described for Aphelochroa sanguinalis based on field and laboratory observations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>checkered</b> <b>beetle</b> genera Parvochaetus, n. gen. and Amboakis, n. gen. are {{described}} and the genus Ellipotoma Spinola is reviewed. Four new species plus P. linearis (Gorham), which represents a new combination, comprise Parvochaetus: P. albicornis, P. froeschneri, P. fucolatus, and P. sandaracus. Amboakis, a replacement {{name for the}} junior homonym Teutonia Opitz, involves four previously described species and 20 new species. The new species are A. anapsis, A. atra, A. barinas, A. binotonis, A. cauca, A. charis, A. epiomidia, A. erythrohapsis, A. funebris, A. incondita, A. katatonis, A. linitis, A. mica, A. micula, A. prolata, A. rudis, A. taruma, A. selva, A. stenosis, and A. vesca. Four previously described species now classified under Amboakis involve new combinations; they are Epiphloeus capitatus Gorham, Epiphloeus nitidus Gorham, Phlogistosternus flavicollis Zayas, and Teutonia nova Opitz. The bitypic Ellipotoma contains E. tenuiformis Spinola and E. turmalis, n. sp. Lectotypes are designated for Epiphloeus capitatus Gorham, Apolopha linearis Gorham, Epiphloeus nitidus Gorham, and Ellipotoma tenuiformis Spinola...|$|E

40|$|Bark beetles {{are major}} pests of pine forests in North America that can inflict {{considerable}} damage and cause severe economic loss. The <b>checkered</b> <b>beetle</b> Thanasimus dubius Fabricius (Coleoptera: Cleridae), an abundant predator in the Eastern USA and Canada, {{has been suggested}} to influence the dynamics of several bark beetles, including the economically important southern pine beetle (SPB), Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Because {{of the importance of}} T. dubius in pine forests, I studied several aspects of T. dubius biology including both its chemical and dispersal ecology. I first present an experiment that was conducted to improve the rearing system of T. dubius so that sufficient numbers of predators could be produced more efficiently for both behavioral and ecological studies. Improvements to the rearing method potentially could be achieved by adding a preservative to increase the shelf-life of the diet used to feed larval T. dubius thereby allowing feeding intervals to be extended. To evaluate this, I added sorbic acid, a preservative, to the larval diet at three different concentrations (0, 0. 1 and 0. 2...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{review the}} {{literature}} regarding the semiochemistry of bark and ambrosia beetles affecting native hardwood trees. I describe the host colonization behavior of bark and ambrosia beetles {{and discuss the}} role semiochemicals play in locating suitable hosts. Additionally, I briefly describe the natural enemies of scolytid beetles affecting hardwoods. In Chapter 2, I evaluate the response of two exotic invasive ambrosia beetles, Xylosandrus crassiusculus and X. germanus, to conophthorin, a common bark volatile of deciduous trees in mixed-hardwood forests in north central Indiana and {{determine the extent to}} which conophthorin enhances the attraction of these ambrosia beetles to ethanol-baited traps. I test the efficacy of verbenone alone as a repellent of these ambrosia beetles. Exotic invasive ambrosia beetles are among the most economically important pests of trees in nursery stock and managed and natural forest systems in the United States. I found that conophthorin enhances the response of X. crassiusculus and two <b>checkered</b> <b>beetle</b> predators, Madoniella dislocatus and Pyticeroides laticornis, to ethanol-baited traps. There were fewer X. germanus and X. crassiusculus beetles within the verbenone-baited traps, suggesting it acts as a repellent for these beetles. The use of a non-host semiochemical repellent, such as verbenone, in combination with an attractant, conophthorin and ethanol, could be used to deter unwanted infestations of already established ambrosia beetles from marketable trees in a push-pull strategy. In Chapter 3, I test the hypothesis that the host colonization behavior of Phloeotribus liminaris, an important pest of black cherry, is chemically mediated. Black cherry (Prunus serotina) is among the most marketable hardwood species in North America. Unfortunately, widespread infestations of the peach bark beetle, Phloeotribus liminaris (Harris), keep many of these trees from reaching veneer quality and significantly reduce the value. These beetles spend the majority of their life cycle concealed beneath the bark of trees, making them difficult to control with sprayed pesticides. To determine if the beetles are attracted to volatiles emanating from the larval host, we measured their walking response to bolts of black cherry in a glass olfactometer. We tested the attraction of adults to bolts infested with either males or females to determine whether a volatile pheromone mediates colonization behavior. In the field, we measured the response of beetles to baited Lindgren funnel traps. In these assays, males and females were significantly attracted to female-infested bolts, suggesting the presence of a female-produced aggregation pheromone. Information on the chemically-mediated colonization behavior of the peach bark beetle will aid in establishing effective management programs. ...|$|E
