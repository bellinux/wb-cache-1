Honey rich in polyphenols and proteins increased the cream to 2. 51 %.

5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and <b>cream</b> <b>in</b> colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of <b>Cream</b> <b>in</b> their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or <b>cream</b> <b>in</b> colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E
