50|$|Elham is {{situated}} {{deep in the}} heart of the North Downs and within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Whilst much of the countryside surrounding the village is arable farmland there are still patches of unimproved or semi-improved grassland where wildlife is allowed to flourish such as Baldock Downs and Hall Downs. These sites often support many typical chalk downland species such as <b>Common</b> <b>Milkwort</b> (Polygala vulgaris), Field Scabious (Knautia arvensis)and Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor) as well as orchids such as Fragrant (Gymnadenia conopsea), Common Spotted (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and Pyramidal (Anacamptis pyramidalis).|$|E
50|$|The area is {{important}} for its magnesian limestone grassland communities, which are largely confined to County Durham and increasingly scarce even there. The grasslands at Quarrington Hill are typical of the type, being characterised {{by the presence of}} blue moor-grass, Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria. Less common species include <b>common</b> <b>milkwort,</b> Polygala vulgaris, hairy violet, Viola hirta, and wild carrot, Daucus carota. The nationally scarce dark-red helleborine, Epipactis atrorubens, is found at the site, as is basil thyme, Clinopodium acinos, a southern species that is uncommon this far north.|$|E
50|$|The {{islands in}} the nature reserve are {{dominated}} by an open landscape with Calluna and grass heath with junipers. The area {{has been used as}} a pastureland for hundreds of years, and common species are catsfoot, wild thyme, <b>common</b> <b>milkwort,</b> Radiola linoides, and chaffweed. At Älmö, sea holly has been found. At Vendelsöarna, birds such as redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher, and ringed plover are breeding. At Älmö, there are large populations of gulls. In this area, there is a prohibition of access during the breeding period, from 1 April to 15 July. In the shallow waters surrounding the islands, there are invertebrates and small fish.|$|E
50|$|The limited {{areas of}} {{maritime}} grassland have {{an abundance of}} red fescue (Festuca rubra), also present within rock crevices and rocky ledges. Other areas of maintained grassland contain flora such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), common bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common cat's-ear (Hypochaeris radicata), common dog-violet (Viola riviniana), <b>common</b> <b>milkwort</b> (Polygala vulgaris), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), common restharrow (Ononis repens), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), sweet vernal-grass, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), woodrush (Luzula campestris), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Also present in the grassland and grassy embankments are the nationally scarce slender bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus angustissimus) and hairy bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus).|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as <b>common</b> <b>milkwort</b> (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
