40|$|The {{undefined}} microbial floras {{derived from}} the surface of ripe cheese which are used for the ripening of commercial red smear cheeses have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as single-strain starter cultures on model red smear cheeses to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ.

40|$|Due to {{practical}} and hygienic uses in storage and marketing, cheese maker {{preference for the}} use of vacuum packaging instead of the brining method has increased significantly in recent years. The objective of the paper was to study and compare the chemistry, biochemistry, and microstructure of Mihalic <b>cheeses</b> <b>ripened</b> in vacuum packaging or under brine over 360 days. Proteolysis in Mihalic cheese was quite low (e. g., pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen was lower than 15 %, {{as a percentage of the}} total nitrogen, and as 1 -casein was slower in comparison to other brined cheeses) due to its high salt-in-moisture and low moisture contents. Urea-PAGE patterns of the pH 4. 6 insoluble fractions of the cheeses showed different degradation patterns of as 1 -casein in cheeses of different ages. However, β-casein was relatively resistant to hydrolysis. Packaging the cheese in polyethylene bags significantly increased the levels of pH 4. 6 soluble nitrogen, 12 % trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen, and free amino acids compared to the <b>cheeses</b> <b>ripened</b> in brine. The total concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) in cheeses increased after 120 days of ripening, and Glu, Val, Leu, Lys, and Phe were the most abundant FAA in the cheeses. Higher levels of these AAs were found in the <b>cheeses</b> <b>ripened</b> in polyethylene bags. The peptide profiles by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of 70 % (v/v) ethanolsoluble and ethanol-insoluble fractions of the pH 4. 6 soluble fraction of the cheeses revealed that slight differences were found in the levels of some peptides between cheeses. Majority of the volatile compounds were present at higher concentrations in vacuum-packaged cheeses than in those ripened in brines. The images obtained by scanning electron microscopy of the <b>cheeses</b> <b>ripened</b> in polyethylene bags were clearly different (the protein matrix was more compact) from those of brine-ripened <b>cheeses.</b> The <b>cheese</b> <b>ripened</b> in vacuum packaging was completely different in terms of chemical composition, proteolysis, volatile composition, and microstructure.

5000|$|<b>Cheese</b> <b>ripening</b> was {{not always}} the highly industrialised process it is today; in the past, cellars and caves were used to ripen cheeses instead of the current highly {{regulated}} process involving machinery and biochemistry.

50|$|Geotrichum candidum {{can be used}} commercially to {{inoculate}} wash-rinds and bloomy rind cheeses. Cultures {{can be added to}} milk, brine or sprayed onto cheese surface. The optimum pH range for growth on cheese ranges from 4.4 to 6.7. The fungus colonizes nearly the entire surface of the cheese during the early stages of ripening. It is found on soft cheeses like Camembert cheese and semi-hard cheese Saint-Nectaire and Reblochon. For the Camembert cheese the fungi grows {{on the outside of the}} cheese forming a rind. The fungus is responsible for the uniform, white, velvety coat on Saint-Marcellin cheese. Lipases and proteases from G. candidum release fatty acids and peptides that provide the cheese with distinctive flavors. Geotrichum candidum reduces the bitterness in Camembert cheese through the activity of the aminopeptidases that hydrolyze low molecular weight hydrophobic peptides. Aminopeptidases also contributes an aroma in traditional Norman Camembert. The fungus also neutralize the curd by catabolizing lactic acid produced by bacteria. Geotrichum candidum prepares the cheese for colonization of other acid sensitive bacteria such as Brevibacterium. The fungus inhibits growth of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
