25|$|A tale {{explains}} {{her name}} Yamuna: Sanjna {{was unable to}} bear her husband, the sun's heat and light and <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> his presence. Surya felt insulted and said that their son will be known as Yama ("restraint"), due to the restraint she showed. Thereafter, Sanjna tried her best to keep her eyes open, however she flickered them angering Surya again who proclaimed that her daughter would be Yamuna. Since Sanjna had {{tried to keep the}} eyes open, Yamuna was blessed that she would worshipped as a goddess and remembered throughout time.|$|E

5000|$|... "I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes" [...] is {{a country}} ballad, in which the song's male narrator tells his lover {{that he wants to}} make <b>her</b> <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>in</b> other words, feel sexual arousal to the point that she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to savor it.|$|R
60|$|It is {{doubtful}} if aunt Dorcas {{would have taken}} the paper procured by such a questionable method, but for anxiety to read the advertisement which had made of Joe an exile. As a matter of fact, she did not take it until after considerable urging from both the boys, and, even then, only when Joe held it so near {{that it would have}} been necessary to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent herself from seeing the printed lines.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bagnet {{shows her}} white teeth cheerfully, {{but to the}} {{perception}} of her son, betrays so much uneasiness of spirit that he is impelled by the dictates of affection to ask <b>her,</b> with his <b>eyes,</b> what is the matter, thus standing, with his eyes wide open, more oblivious of the fowls than before, and not affording the least hope {{of a return to}} consciousness. Fortunately his elder sister perceives the cause of the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet's breast and with an admonitory poke recalls him. The stopped fowls going round again, Mrs. Bagnet <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the intensity of her relief.|$|R
60|$|She sank on {{the nearest}} chair, and <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a flutter of delicious confusion.|$|E
60|$|The {{feeling in}} his eyes was unmistakable. A {{delicate}} flush stole into her cheeks and she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> the strong light he noticed more clearly the fragility of her appearance. He rose hastily.|$|E
60|$|Her ladyship first <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> {{horror and}} then searched blindly on the counterpane for the smelling-bottle. Mrs. Glenarm {{gave it to}} her, and waited {{to see how the}} invalid bore it before she said any more.|$|E
50|$|Ana's {{fascination with}} the story {{increases}} when Isabel takes her to a desolate abandoned sheepfold, which she claims is the monster's house. Ana returns alone many times to look for him but finds only a large footprint. One day, Isabel screams from a distant part of the house, and when Ana comes to investigate, she lies perfectly still on the floor, pretending to be dead. That night, Ana sneaks out and while looking at the night sky, <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> the next scene, a fugitive republican soldier leaps from a passing train and limps to the sheepfold to hide.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but come, come, come!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "We are {{not talking}} about going on; we are {{considering}} what a fine parting I have made you down the middle, like two wings of a spread bird——" [...] she looked down, smiling playfully on him, just <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> slightly <b>in</b> petition.|$|R
60|$|An awful stillness pervaded the apartment: Venetia herself, {{with a face}} paler {{even than}} the hangings of the mysterious bed, stood {{motionless}} with suppressed breath, gazing on the distant curtain with a painful glance of agitated fascination. At length, summoning her energies {{as if for the}} achievement of some terrible yet inevitable enterprise, she crossed the room, and averting <b>her</b> face, and <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a paroxysm of nervous excitement, she stretched forth her arm, and with a rapid motion withdrew the curtain. The harsh sound of the brass rings drawn quickly over the rod, the only noise that had yet met her ear in this mystical chamber, made her start and tremble. She looked up, she beheld, in a broad and massy frame, the full-length portrait of a man.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> {{misery of}} body and soul. The outer door clicked, and Anna entered, very {{penitent}} that she had stayed so long at the chemist's. But it had been difficult to find the proper type of inhaler, and-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went to bed}} {{herself at}} last, and, after lying awake for nearly a couple of hours, <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> order to think better. She awoke with the sun pouring in {{at the window and}} the sounds of {{vigorous}} brushing in the yard beneath.|$|E
60|$|Susan {{was forced}} to submit to a second {{treatment}} of her wound, {{as soon as the}} meal had had come to an end, and Mistress Harding peremptorily insisted on her going to bed, since she had not <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> slumber during the night just passed.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as though <b>in</b> pain. Then she laughed, not perhaps very naturally. They were {{standing}} now by {{the door of the}} public house.|$|R
60|$|Madam Rachel then <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and, <b>in</b> a low, gentle voice, {{she spoke}} {{a few words}} of prayer; and then she told Caleb that he must always {{remember}} in all his prayers to confess his sins fully and freely, and never cover them up and conceal them, with an idea that his good deeds made him worthy. Then she put Caleb down, and he ran down stairs to play.|$|R
5000|$|Zeus {{then gave}} her the ability to remove <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The purpose of this ability is unclear in Diodorus, but other {{versions}} state Lamia's ability to remove <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> came with the gift of prophecy. Zeus did this to appease Lamia in her grief {{over the loss of}} her children and to let her rest since she could not <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Horace, <b>in</b> Ars Poetica (l.340), imagines the impossibility of retrieving the living children she has eaten: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fink {{sprang to}} his feet--Maggie caught him {{again on the}} jaw with a wide swing of her other hand. She <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> that fearful, blissful moment before his blow should come--she whispered his name to herself--she leaned to the {{expected}} shock, hungry for it.|$|E
60|$|To {{have given}} Kipps {{a pound of}} triumph over Sid seemed to her almost to justify Nunc Dimittis. She watched his face for a moment, then <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a kind of blissful {{exhaustion}} as the nurse, with something motherly in her manner, pushed Kipps out of the room.|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been useless to argue with the old woman about this matter. She {{considered}} Gilda's health to be under her own special charge, ever since good Mevrouw Beresteyn had placed her baby girl in Maria's strong, devoted arms ere she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the last long sleep.|$|E
60|$|They were {{watching}} {{her with a}} feeling of intense relief, thinking that they had now escaped from a great and terrible danger. Fan looked up into the face of the woman bent over her, and gazed at her in a dazed kind of way, not yet remembering where she was or what had befallen her. Then she glanced at the man's face, a little distance off, shivered and <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> stillness and extreme pallor seemed to have become insensible again, although her white lips twitched at intervals.|$|R
5000|$|They {{went to an}} {{ice rink}} on Thanksgiving Day where Rocky told her about his {{fighting}} career and his style. She {{asked him why he}} wanted to fight and he said that his father told him he had no brains and should develop his body. Adrian was surprised, as her mother said that she wasn't much of a body person and should develop her brain. As the two begin dating, she manages to give Rocky one of the pets in the shop; Butkus. On Christmas, an inebriated Paulie overhears her conversation with Rocky about Paulie's interferences. An enraged Paulie physically threatens her and Rocky with a sawed-off baseball bat, only for Adrian to stand up for herself. Then he reveals that she is not a virgin and he would let other people use her, which sends Adrian crying, running towards her room and Rocky stopping the tirade and offers her to stay at his apartment. Before the fight, Adrian decides to stay in Rocky's locker room. As the rounds went by, she eventually comes out during the 14th round. As she witnesses Rocky get knocked down by the hands of Apollo Creed, she briefly <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> silence. At the end of the fight, Rocky calls out for her and Adrian rushes toward the ring, losing her hat along the way. As Paulie is denied entrance into the ring by security, she manages to slip inside the ring when he pulls up the ropes. While Creed is announced the winner, she appears to Rocky, to which he asks where her hat was, only for her to express her love for him.|$|R
60|$|She was still. She {{listened to}} the passion in his voice. She was saying to herself that {{if she were to}} whisper the faintest yes, if she were but to sigh lightly her consent, he would do it. He was capable of doing it--without {{touching}} the earth. She <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and smiled <b>in</b> the dark, abandoning herself in a delightful giddiness, for an instant, to his encircling arm. But before he could be tempted to tighten his grasp she was out of it, a foot away from him and in full possession of herself.|$|R
60|$|Her arms {{dropped by}} her side, {{she looked up}} and met his eyes, ardent, burning with passion, fixed longingly upon her. He came close to her, quite close, his {{presence}} thrilled her; she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> order to shut out from her innermost soul everything from the outside world, save the exquisite feeling of her newly awakened love.|$|E
60|$|It {{appeared}} that a caterpillar {{had come from}} the fern and chosen the front of her bodice as his resting place. She saw the point glisten towards her bosom, and seemingly enter it. Bathsheba <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the full persuasion that she was killed at last. However, feeling just as usual, she opened them again.|$|E
60|$|That {{thought was}} so heavenly, that Marguerite <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> order {{to shut out}} {{everything}} but that. In a few minutes she would be alone with him; she would run down the ladder, and let him see her; then he would take her in his arms, and she would let him see that, after that, she would gladly die for him, and with him, for earth could hold no greater happiness than that.|$|E
50|$|On the {{remarriage}} of widows, Periyar {{states that}} among the atrocities perpetrated by the Hindu male population against women, here {{we have to consider}} the treatment meted out to widows alone. If a girl loses her husband, even before knowing anything of worldly pleasures, she is compelled to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to everything <b>in</b> the world and die broken-hearted. Even in Periyars community at the time, there were widowed girls below the age of 13 years. Periyar stated how it is a touching sight to see the parents of those widowed children treating them like untouchables.|$|R
6000|$|It {{led into}} forest again. And Carley soon {{became aware that}} they had at last left the cut and burned-over {{district}} of timberland behind. A cold wind moaned through the treetops and set the drops of water pattering down upon her. It lashed her wet face. Carley <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and sagged <b>in</b> <b>her</b> seat, mostly oblivious to the passing scenery. [...] "The girls will never believe this of me," [...] she soliloquized. And indeed she was amazed at herself. Then thought of Glenn strengthened her. It did not really matter what she suffered {{on the way to}} him. Only she was disgusted at her lack of stamina, and her appalling sensitiveness to discomfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] assented {{the woman}} with that deep frown which seemed to draw <b>closer</b> {{together}} <b>her</b> black <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a sinister fashion. No four-footed beast could stand the filth and wretchedness so many human beings were condemned to suffer from in Russia. The point of this discovery was that it proved Haldin to have been familiar with that horse-owning peasant--a reckless, independent, free-living fellow not much liked by the other inhabitants of the house. He was {{believed to have been}} the associate of a band of housebreakers. Some of these got captured. Not while he was driving them, however; but still there was a suspicion against the fellow of having given a hint to the police and...|$|R
6000|$|So she had slept! It {{seemed to}} her {{incredible}} {{that she should have}} <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> this small boat, with the knowledge of their desperate errand, on so disturbed a sea. The man by her side leaned forward, extended his arm, and the boat going off before the wind went on faster on an even keel. A motionless black bank resting on the sea stretched infinitely right in their way in ominous stillness. She called Lingard's attention to it. [...] "Look at this awful cloud." ...|$|E
60|$|So, {{without a}} tear on her cheeks, without a faltering tone in her voice, she {{repeated}} the lawyer's own words, {{exactly as he}} had spoken them. Miss Garth staggered back a step and caught at the bench to support herself. Her head swam; she <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a momentary faintness. When they opened again, Magdalen's arm was supporting her, Magdalen's breath fanned her cheek, Magdalen's cold lips kissed her. She drew back from the kiss; the touch of the girl's lips thrilled her with terror.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Madonna," [...] {{answered}} I, [...] "you were accounted dead." [...] And, with that, I {{told her}} the entire story of what had befallen, saving only that I left my own part unmentioned, nor sought to explain my opportune presence in the church. When I spoke of the coming of Ramiro and his knaves she shuddered and <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> very awe. At length, when I had done, she opened them again, and again she turned them full upon me. Their brightness seemed to increase a moment, and then I {{saw that she was}} quietly weeping.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She's <b>in</b> a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|R
60|$|The dimness of {{the light}} her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm; {{but there was no}} danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater {{difficulty}} in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion, she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. With a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated, repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful! She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it to be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate? By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had made herself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse it. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She shuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|Six {{years after}} Miss Milray parted with Clementina in Venice she found herself, towards {{the close of}} the summer, at Middlemount. She had {{definitely}} ceased to live in Florence, where she had meant to die, and had come home to <b>close</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She was <b>in</b> no haste to do this, and in the meantime she was now at Middlemount with her brother, who had expressed a wish to revisit the place in memory of Mrs. Milray. It was the second anniversary of her divorce, which had remained, after a married life of many vicissitudes, almost the only experience untried in that relation, and which had been happily accomplished in the courts of Dacotah, upon grounds that satisfied the facile justice of that State. Milray had dealt handsomely with his widow, as he unresentfully called her, and the money he assigned her was of a destiny perhaps as honored as its origin. She employed it in the negotiation of a second marriage, in which she redressed the balance of her first by taking a husband somewhat younger than herself.|$|R
