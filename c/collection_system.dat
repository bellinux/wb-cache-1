40|$|A {{technical}} and economic comparison is made between DC and AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> of offshore wind farms. DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> have {{the advantages of}} reduced weight {{and size of the}} DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50 / 60 Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the need for a high power DC–DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind power from the <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC–DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> are higher than in AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{wastewater}} <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> transport sewage from {{homes or}} other sources by gravity flow through buried piping systems {{to a central}} treatment facility. These systems are usually reliable and consume no power. However, the slope requirements to maintain adequate flow by gravity may require deep excavations in hilly or flat terrain, {{as well as the}} addition of sewage pump stations, which can significantly increase the cost of conventional <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> Manholes and other sewer appurtenances also add substantial costs to conventional <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> Alternative Alternative wastewater <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> can be cost effective for homes in areas where traditional <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> are too expensive to install and operate...|$|R

5|$|On 2 February 1996, {{the tunnel}} company had an {{agreement}} with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass automatic toll <b>collection</b> <b>system.</b> A manual <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> was estimated to cost NOK1.4 million per year, while an automated system was estimated at NOK0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, {{the same day the}} last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK44 for a single passing with a car on the ferry. The tolls were set to NOK120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets.|$|E
5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana toll plaza using an open toll collection system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed toll <b>collection</b> <b>system,</b> integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified toll <b>collection</b> <b>system.</b> As of October 2010, Bregana toll plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to semi-trailer trucks. The toll charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the distance travelled and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENCan electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll <b>collection</b> <b>system,</b> with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
