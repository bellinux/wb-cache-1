40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the practical value of a prototype <b>coil</b> <b>for</b> interventional procedures in the open MRI.

It was found that body-coils offer no alternative to surface <b>coils</b> <b>for</b> interventional imaging. At large angles between the static field and coil, corresponding to a prone position of the patient, the prototype achieved an equivalent or higher sequence-dependent signal quality compared to current models. In contrast to this, the susceptibility of the prototype for disturbance was increased...|$|R
40|$|Applications of low-field {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) systems (or = 1. 5 T). Therefore, the design of radiofrequency (RF) <b>coils</b> <b>for</b> low-field MRI requires careful consideration as significant gains in SNR can be achieved with {{the proper design of}} the RF coil. This article describes an analytical method for the optimization of solenoidal coils. Coil and sample losses are analyzed to provide maximum SNR and optimum B(1) field homogeneity. The calculations are performed <b>for</b> solenoidal <b>coils</b> optimized <b>for</b> the human head at 0. 2 T, but the method could also be applied to any solenoidal <b>coil</b> <b>for</b> imaging other anatomical regions at low field. Several coils were constructed to compare experimental and theoretical results. A head {{magnetic resonance}} image obtained at 0. 2 T with the optimum design is presented.
