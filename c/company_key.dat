500|$|In Spokane, {{wood and}} food processing, {{printing}} and publishing, primary metal refining and fabrication, electrical and computer equipment, and transportation equipment are {{leaders in the}} manufacturing sector. Gold mining company Gold Reserve, and Fortune 1000 company Potlatch Corporation– a forest products company that operates as a real estate investment trust– are headquartered in the city proper. Mining, forestry, and agribusiness remain important to the local and regional economy, but Spokane's economy has diversified to include other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors. Spokane is becoming a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of}} a less prominent manufacturing sector which declined in the 1980s, particularly as a medical and biotechnology center; Fortune 1000 technology company Itron, for instance, is headquartered in the area. Avista Corporation, the holding company of Avista Utilities, is the only company in Spokane that has been listed in the Fortune 500, ranked 299 on the list in 2002. Other companies with head offices in the Spokane area include technology <b>company</b> <b>Key</b> Tronic, vacation rental provider Stay Alfred, and microcar maker Commuter Cars. Despite diversification to new industries, Spokane's economy has struggled in recent decades. Spokane was ranked the #1 [...] "Worst City For Jobs" [...] in America in both 2012 and 2015, while also ranking #4 in 2014. Additionally, Forbes named Spokane the [...] "Scam Capital of America" [...] in 2009 due to widespread business fraud.
