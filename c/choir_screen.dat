5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> {{separating}} the <b>choir</b> from the ambulatory are recent reconstructions. The walls {{that had been}} built for this purpose in 1959 were removed in the 1990s. The brass bars of the <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> were mostly still intact, but the wooden parts had been almost completely destroyed by fire in 1942. The oak crown and frame were reconstructed {{on the basis of}} what remained of the original construction.|$|R

A {{brass plate}} commemorating Palmer's {{donations}} to the parish, including chancel <b>screen,</b> <b>choir</b> seats, <b>choir</b> <b>screens,</b> the lectern, and the pulpit, {{is located at the}} Parish Church of St. Mildred in Tenterden.|$|R
40|$|In their later medieval heyday, <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> were pivotal centerpieces and focalisers {{of their}} sacred environments. Embellished with figural imagery; {{outfitted}} with platforms, pulpits, and altars; and rendered visually porous {{by the presence}} of large doors and windows, screens at once defined liturgical zones and provided a unifying bridge between them. This presentation offers an analysis of two extant screens: the early thirteenth-century structure in the abbey church of St Maria in Vezzolano, and the late fifteenth-century example in the church of St Stephen in Breisach. Though very different in format and decoration, both screens act as mediators – physical, visual, and conceptual – between the functional spaces and pictorial programmes in the apses (eastern ends) and exterior thresholds (western ends) of their respective churches. This presentation seeks to reveal the dynamic, mutually reinforcing relations among <b>choir</b> <b>screens,</b> the spaces they inhabited, and the liturgical objects that animated those zones...|$|R
5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the <b>choir</b> <b>screen,</b> near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L. Smyth, The Monuments and Genii of St. Paul's Cathedral, and of Westminster Abbey (1826), ii, 703–4.|$|E
25|$|Francis Alfred Skidmore (1817 – 13 November 1896) was a British {{metalworker}} {{best known}} for high-profile commissions, including the glass and metal roof of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (1859), the Hereford Cathedral <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> (1862) and the Albert Memorial (1866–73) in London.|$|E
25|$|Sir George Gilbert Scott led the {{restoration}} of Salisbury Cathedral between 1863 – 1878. It was during this time that Skidmore created the cathedral's <b>choir</b> <b>screen.</b> In 1959, the screen was removed {{and most of it}} was destroyed. The chancel gates survived and are now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. As of September 2011, they are on display in the Ironwork gallery, room 114a.|$|E

They have received many awards, and high commendations from judges and critics. In 2008, they also appeared in Battle of the <b>Choirs,</b> <b>screened</b> on Channel 7. In 2010, a small chamber vocal ensemble was introduced with the aim of allowing some students a small ensemble experience.|$|R

50|$|Following the 1960s post-Vatican II liturgical reforms, the {{sanctuary}} underwent a major change. While remaining {{in place the}} three altars ceased {{to be used for}} the celebration of the Eucharist (Mass). The sanctuary railing and <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> were removed, as was the pulpit in the nave. The sanctuary floor was raised with four steps leading up from the nave to an altar facing the congregation. In 1980 this altar was replaced by a more permanent one dedicated to the memory of a parishioner, Colin P. O’Shea, was installed along with a matching ambo and commentator’s stand. In 1981, a small shrine of St. Basil was added in the vestibule to commemorate the parish’s 125th anniversary.|$|R
25|$|Protestant and Revolutionary iconoclasm, the war {{periods of}} 1681, 1870 and 1940–1944 {{as well as}} changes in taste and liturgy have taken a toll on some of Strasbourg Cathedral's most {{outstanding}} features such as the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> of 1252 and the successive high altars (ca. 1500 and 1682), but many treasures remain inside the building; others, or fragments of them, being displayed in the Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame.|$|E
25|$|In 1757, {{a number}} of changes {{were made to the}} {{interior}} to increase the visibility of the Mass, in accordance with changing religious customs. The jubé (<b>choir</b> <b>screen)</b> that separated the liturgical choir from the nave was torn down and the present stalls built (some of the magnificent sculpture from this screen was later found buried underneath the paving and preserved, though it is not on public display). At the same time, some of the stained glass in the clerestory was removed and replaced with grisaille windows, greatly increasing the illumination of the High Altar.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Basilica {{probably}} began around 1232, {{just one}} year after the death of St. Anthony. It was completed in 1310 although several structural modifications (including the falling of the ambulatory and {{the construction of a new}} <b>choir</b> <b>screen)</b> took place between the end of the 14th and the mid-15th century. The Saint, according to his will, had been buried in the small church of Santa Maria Mater Domini, probably dating from the late 12th century and near which a convent was founded by him in 1229. This church was incorporated into the present basilica as the Cappella della Madonna Mora (Chapel of the Dark Madonna).|$|E
50|$|Cedar pews are {{arranged}} in a semicircular pattern facing the pulpit, baptistery, organ and choir gallery that are located at {{the northern end of}} the space and feature timber panelling. A screen has been built behind the <b>choir.</b> This <b>screen</b> blocks the original view from the auditorium of the north wall with its rose and arched windows and the spiralling timber stairs.|$|R
40|$|The Hereford Screen {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex and {{intricate}} <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> of the Victorian era. Positioned in the gallery of the Victoria and Albert Museum’s main entrance, its glistening metalwork, brass, and terracotta effect surfaces, incrustations of wrought floral forms, Gothic Revival lettering, and semi-precious stones combine with delicate slivers of glinting glass that wink at each of the museum’s visitors, whether they journey up the stairs to gaze at this monument up close or regard it from afar on their way to the galleries beyond. The Hereford Screen is one of a family of screens produced by the architect George Gilbert Scott and the metalwork firm of Francis Skidmore for British cathedrals in the mid- to late nineteenth century. The Hereford Screen was perceived by many to be the pinnacle of Victorian Gothic Revival metalwork. Before its installation in Hereford Cathedral it was shown at the 1862 International Exhibition in London...|$|R
5000|$|When first constructed, it {{featured}} a shingle roof, a hand carved altar and a <b>choir</b> stall <b>screen</b> and was described {{at the time}} as [...] "a welcome advance in the church architecture of this district". The Anglican Church Chronicle reported that [...] "The treatment is original and effective and proves that the possibilities in connection with the architecture of wooden buildings are wider in extent than is commonly supposed".|$|R
25|$|The western mural <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> shows artistic {{quality in}} terms of architecture, {{ornamentation}} and figural sculptures: ″The mid-thirteenth-century west choir of Naumburg Cathedral has long been admired both for its unified architectural design″.″ The architecture has an organic character and provides information details such as historic local plants. The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the passion of Christ {{is one of the}} most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing. The Naumburg Master achieved a degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy that conveys the suffering of Christ and the deep grief of Mary and St. John. The statues of the mourning Mary and St. John catch the viewers attention and draw them close to Christ.|$|E
25|$|Pugin {{designed}} {{many of the}} fittings {{including the}} high altar under an elaborate baldachin, with riddel posts, and the <b>choir</b> <b>screen.</b> The Bishop's Chair, in oak upholstered in green velvet, backed with the diocesan shield of arms was also designed by Pugin. Other fittings, such the 16th century carved pulpit and the medieval canons' stalls were from churches in Belgium and Germany respectively and were collected and donated by John Talbot, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. The sanctuary windows are the work of William Warrington. Other windows, metalwork, fittings and vestments were provided by John Hardman of Birmingham, to the design or specifications of Pugin. Hardman was a parishioner of St Chad's, founding the Cathedral Choir in 1854. Four generations of his family are among those interred in the crypt.|$|E
25|$|At Lichfield Cathedral, the 18th {{century had}} been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the {{stonework}} covered with Roman cement. After some structural work early in the 19th century by James Wyatt, the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new metal screen by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott was installed, as was a Minton tile pavement stretching from <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the centuries}} the {{interior}} of the church underwent many changes. In the 17th century, the Gothic <b>choir</b> rood <b>screen</b> with sculpted depictions of the life of Servatius was demolished. Fragments from the 14th-century screen were discovered during the 1980s restoration works and are now kept in the church's lapidarium in the East crypt. By the end of the 18th century, the entire church interior had been painted white, the colourful Medieval stained glass windows had been replaced by colourless glass, and the church looked distinctly Baroque.|$|R
50|$|Although {{elements}} of the new style {{can be found at}} the Cistercian abbey church of Royaumont (begun 1228, now mostly destroyed), perhaps the most important step in the development of the Rayonnant style was the building of the Abbey Church of St Nicaise, in Reims (begun 1231). Although this church was entirely destroyed during the French Revolution, its facade is well known from 18th-century engravings. The architect (Hugues de Libergier) took various existing {{elements of}} the Gothic decorative vocabulary and used them to create a very new visual aesthetic. Perhaps the most influential feature of the Church of St Nicaise was its west facade, constructed as a series of pointed gables decorated with crockets and a mixture of blind and open tracery, interspersed with narrow pinnacles. Unlike earlier Gothic west facades, with their clear three-part horizontal and vertical divisions, Libergier's design was more screen-like (indeed it may have been inspired by earlier <b>choir</b> <b>screens)</b> and on a far more human scale than the cavernous doorways of Reims Cathedral. Several key {{elements of the}} St Nicaise facade were soon taken up by other architects and can be recognised, for example, in the treatment of the North transept portal of Notre Dame de Paris and around the roof line of the Sainte Chapelle.|$|R
25|$|The Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, on {{the orders}} of Henry VIII, {{resulted}} in St Mary's Abbey being dissolved and its buildings demolished in 1537. The <b>choir</b> stalls, two <b>screens</b> and the bells were transferred to Llanengan, where the parish church was then being built.|$|R
500|$|The most {{extensive}} restoration {{was carried out}} by the Gothic Revival architect, George Gilbert Scott, who between 1868 and 1876 [...] "almost entirely re-cased" [...] the cathedral. The current building is acknowledged to be mainly the product of this Victorian restoration commissioned by the Dean, John Saul Howson. In addition to extensive additions and alterations to the body of the church, Scott remodelled the tower, adding turrets and crenellations. Scott chose sandstone from the quarries at Runcorn for his restoration work. In addition to the restoration of the fabric of the building, Scott designed internal fittings such as the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> to replace those destroyed during the Civil War. [...] He built the fan vault of the south porch, renewed the wooden vault of the choir and added a great many decorative features to the interior.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the early}} 14th century, the {{interior}} of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a <b>choir</b> <b>screen.</b> The bracing arches are known as [...] "St Andrew's Cross arches", in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – rightly or wrongly – as [...] "brutally massive" [...] and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.|$|E
500|$|Closely {{detailed}} {{beams of}} light spill {{through the high}} windows and illuminate the interior, filling the portal and flowing across the tiled floors before it hits the clerestory windows. The brilliance of the daylight is juxtaposed with the gentle glow of the candles in the <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> altar, while the lower portion of the pictorial space is relatively poorly lit. Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle. Their angle is rendered in an unusually realistic manner for early 15th century, and the detail is such that their description is likely based on observation of the actual behaviour of light, a further innovation in 15th-century art. Yet while the light is portrayed as it might appear in nature, its source is not. Panofsky notes that the sunlight enters from the north windows, but contemporary churches normally had east-facing choirs, so the light should enter from the south. He suggests the light {{is not intended to}} be natural, but rather to represent the divine, and hence subject to [...] "the laws of symbolism and not those of nature." ...|$|E
50|$|The west {{tower was}} also {{added in the}} 15th century. This may be when the central tower was dismantled, leaving only the columns and vault visible inside the church. Also 15th-century are the <b>choir</b> stalls, the <b>screen</b> between the chancel and Lady chapel, the baptismal font and a doorway to a former rood loft.|$|R
50|$|Examples of his wood carving {{work can}} be found in The Cathedral Church of St Nicholas, Newcastle, where, between 1882 and 1889, he and his {{workshop}} carved the <b>choir</b> and rood <b>screen</b> for the scheme by architect Robert James Johnson (1832-1892), commissioned when the Diocese of Newcastle was founded and Newcastle upon Tyne became a City. Other carving {{work can be}} seen in St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne and many other North Eastern churches.|$|R
50|$|The {{provisions}} of the Lateran Council had less effect on monastic churches and cathedrals in England; as these would have already been fitted with two transverse screens; a pulpitum screen separating off the ritual choir; and an additional rood screen one bay further west, delineating {{the area of the}} nave provided for lay worship (or in monastic churches of the Cistercian order, delineating the distinct church area reserved for the worship of lay brothers). The monastic rood screen invariably had a nave altar set against its western face, which, from at least the late 11th century onwards, was commonly dedicated to the Holy Cross; as for example in Norwich Cathedral, and in Castle Acre Priory. In the later medieval period many monastic churches erected an additional transverse parclose screen, or fence screen, {{to the west of the}} nave altar; an example of which survives as the chancel screen in Dunstable Priory. Hence the Rites of Durham, a detailed account of the liturgical arrangements of Durham Cathedral Priory before the Reformation, describes three transverse screens; fence screen, rood screen and pulpitum. and the triple same arrangement is also documented in the collegiate church of Ottery St Mary. In the rest of Europe, this multiple screen arrangement was only found in Cistercian churches, as at Maulbronn. but many other major churches, such as Albi Cathedral, inserted transverse screens in the later medieval period, or reconstructed existing <b>choir</b> <b>screens</b> on a greatly increased scale. In Italy, massive rood screens incorporating an ambo or pulpit facing the nave appear to have been universal in the churches of friars; but not in parish churches, there being no equivalent in the Roman Missal for the ritual elaborations of the Use of Sarum.|$|R
2500|$|One {{feature of}} the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost {{completely}} preserved <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> structures from the 13th century. In the east choir, the only late Romanesque hall <b>choir</b> <b>screen</b> has survived. In the west choir, there is a Gothic partition-type screen: ″Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.″ ...|$|E

The altar features Tiffany Studios stained glass window depicting the empty cross.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} work on {{the main}} buildings of the college began in April 1500 on marshy land, supported by large oak beams. The chapel is topped with an imperial crown, i.e. a closed crown, which appears to make a claim to imperial status for the Scottish monarchy. The original was lost in a storm in 1633, and the present crown is a recreation. King's College chapel retains more medieval woodwork than any other Scottish church, including the <b>choir</b> stalls and <b>screen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the church was laid on the 4 December 1847 by Sir George Russell Clerk, Governor. When Conybeare stood down as town engineer in 1850, Captain C.W. Tremenheere of the Royal Engineers took {{on the role of}} superintending architect modifying certain aspects of the approved design such as reducing the pitch of the roof and height of the tower. Architect William Butterfield in conjunction with students from the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art designed the decorative tile reredos. The Afghan War Memorial mosaics, the polychrome floor tiles, <b>choir</b> stalls, <b>screen</b> and pews were also produced to Butterfield's designs. [...] The church was consecrated on January 7, 1858 by Bishop of Bombay, John Harding. The spire cost a sum of Rs 5,65,000 and was finished on June 10, 1865. Sir Cowasji Jehangir contributed a sum of Rs 7,500 to help complete the building.|$|R
