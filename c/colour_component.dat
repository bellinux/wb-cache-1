The main difference between the proposed method and other state-of-the-art methods is the usage of the <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> for the impulse noise detection method {{that are used in}} a more appropriate manner. The idea is to detect all noisy <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> by observing the similarity between (i) the neighbours in the same colour band and (ii) the <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> of the two other colour bands.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen the use of photo {{response}} non-uniformity noise (PRNU) - a unique fingerprint of imaging sensors, in various digital forensic applications such as source device identification, content integrity verification and authentication. However, {{the use of a}} colour filter array for capturing only one of the three <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> per pixel introduces colour interpolation error, while the existing methods for extracting PRNU do not take this into account and include the colour interpolation error as part of the PRNU, which leaves room for improvement. In this work we propose a new way of extracting PRNU, called Colour-Decoupled PRNU (CD-PRNU), by exploiting the difference between the physical and artificial <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> of the photos taken by digital cameras that use a colour filter array for interpolating artificial <b>colour</b> <b>components</b> from the physical ones.

The criterion for this selection was {{to achieve a}} reasonable degree of generalisation and recognition, where skin points exhibit a well defined cluster. After evaluating each <b>component</b> of several <b>colour</b> models, we found that a mixure of components can cope well with such requirements. We list the top components, and from these we select one colour space: H-GY-Wr (Wr [15]). A nearly convex area of this space contains 97 % of all skin points, whilst it encompass 5. 16 % of false positives. Even simple rules over this well-shaped space can achieve a high recognition rate and low overlap to non-skin points. This is a data analysis approach that will help to many skin detection systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Many complex {{timetabling}} {{problems have}} an underpinning bounded graph <b>colouring</b> <b>component,</b> a pattern penalisation component {{and a number}} of side constraints. The bounded graph <b>colouring</b> <b>component</b> corresponds to hard constraints such as “students are in at most one place at one time ” and “there is a limited number of rooms ” [1]. Despite the hardness of graph colouring, it is often easy to generate feasible colourings. However, real-world timetabling systems [2] have to cope with much more challenging requirements, such as “students should not have gaps in their individual daily timetables”, which often make the problem over-constrained. The key to tackling this challenge is a suitable formulation of “soft ” constraints, which count and minimise penalties incurred by matches of various patterns. Several integer programming formulations are presented and discussed in this paper. Throughout the paper, the Udine Course Timetabling Problem is used as an illustrative example of timetabling with soft constraints. The problem has been formulated by Schaerf and Di Gaspero [3, 4] at the University of Udine. Its input can be outlined as follows...|$|R
