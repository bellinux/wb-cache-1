Three e- donors {{have been used}} for <b>coupling</b> <b>site</b> III: ferrocyanide, ascorbate + tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), and succinate + TMPD. The H+/site ratios are 4. 0 with ferrocyanide and 6. 0 with succinate + TMPD (at pH < 7. 0); the charge/site ratios are 6. 0 with ferrocyanide and with succinate + TMPD (at pH < 7. 0) and 4. 0 with ascorbate + TMPD; the ATP/site ratio is 1. 34 with ascorbate + ferrocyanide. These ratios have been obtained in the presence of amounts of antimycin A that provide full inhibition of site II. For coupling sites I and II, ferricyanide has been used as e- acceptor and succinate or NAD-linked substrates as e- donors. The H+/site ratios are 4. 0 at sites I and II; the charge/site ratios are 4. 0 at site I and 2. 0 at site II; the ATP/site ratios are 1. 0 at site I and 0. 5 at site II. Two major factors affect the stoichiometries: (i) dimension of [unk]H and (ii) supply of H+ from the matrix. There is a correlation between collapse of [unk]H and increase of H+/site and charge/site ratios. This indicates that approximation of the phenomenologic stoichiometry of the H+ pump is obtained when flow ratios are measured at level flow. That charge/site and ATP/site ratios increase when ferrocyanide is e- donor and decrease when ferricyanide is e- acceptor is attributed to the localization of the redox couple. This leads to separation of 1 charge/e- when ferrocyanide is e- donor and to consumption of 1 charge/e- when ferricyanide is e- acceptor.
