40|$|Valid and {{reliable}} {{statistics on the}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is an essential input for setting of priorities in the health sector (Mahapatra, 1999). As is generally known, most developed <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting systems rely on medical certification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> using a well defined system of classification. The International classification <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (ICD) released by WHO {{from time to time}} is usually followed as such or with suitable adaptations to specific country settings. The 10 th revision of the ICD (ICD 10) is the latest instance of this kind (WHO, 1993). Most developed <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting systems have invariably achieved near total coverage. In other words a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> report is invariable filed by the medical attendant for all deaths in such countries. Developing countries like India have to depend on lay reporting <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for rural areas, where adequate medical facilities are not available. However, usability <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> statistics is questioned in view of poor coverage, and poor compliance with <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> reporting, coding and classification.

40|$|Background: Understanding how {{lay people}} {{perceive}} the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> mortality and their associated risk factors {{is important for}} public health. In resource-limited settings, where verbal autopsy (VA) is used as the most expedient method <b>of</b> determining <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> {{it is important to}} understand how pre-existing concepts <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among VA-informants may influence their VA-responses and the consequential impact on <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> assessment. This study describes the agreement between VA-derived <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and informant-perceived <b>causes</b> and associated influential factors, which also reflects lay health literacy in this setting. Method: Using 20 years of VA data (n= 11, 228) from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site in rural South Africa, we explored the agreement between the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> perceived by the VA-informants and those assigned by the automated Inter-VA tool. Kappa statistics and concordance correlation coefficients were applied to measure agreement at individual and population levels, respectively. Multivariable regression models were used to explore factors associated with recognised lay perceptions <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> mortality. Results: Agreement between informant-perceived and VA-derived <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> at the individual level was limited, but varied substantially by <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> However, agreement at the population level, comparing cause-specific mortality fractions was higher, with the notable exception of bewitchment as a cause. More recent deaths, those in adults aged 15 – 49 years, deaths outside the home, and those associated with external causes showed higher concordance with InterVA. Conclusion: Overall, informant perception <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was limited, but depended on informant characteristics and <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and to some extent involved non-biomedical constructs. Understanding discordance between perceived and recognised <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is important for public health planning; low community understanding <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> may be detrimental to public health. These findings also illustrate the importance of using rigorous and standardised VA methods rather than relying on informants’ reported <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R

This prospective study was conducted over a 5 month period during which 221 cases were admitted to our institute for forensic investigations. Whole-body PMCT and forensic autopsy were performed in every case. Of these, 101 cases were included in the final study population. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age > 18 years, (2) presence of {{at least one of the}} two principal investigators at the time of admission. One radiologist and one forensic pathologist independently read all PMCT datasets using a report template. <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> category and confidence levels were determined by consensus. Forensic autopsy was performed by two forensic pathologists; both unblinded to imaging results. Both post-imaging and post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> categorization were compared against the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> as stated in the forensic expert report, which included findings from histology and/or toxicology. Accuracy <b>of</b> post-imaging <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> category was substantial (82 %, 83 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 752). Accuracy <b>of</b> post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> category was near perfect (89 %, 90 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 852). Post-imaging sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were 82 % and 97 %, respectively. Post-autopsy sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were 89 % and 98 %, respectively.

Priority setting in public health should be informed {{not only by the}} current magnitude of health problems but by trends in them. However, <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data are often not available or are subject to substantial problems of comparability. We propose five general principles for <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> model development, validation, and reporting. Methods We detail a specific implementation of these principles that is embodied in an analytical tool - the <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>Death</b> Ensemble model (CODEm) - which explores a large variety of possible models to estimate trends in <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Possible models are identified using a covariate selection algorithm that yields many plausible combinations of covariates, which are then run through four model classes. The model classes include mixed effects linear models and spatial-temporal Gaussian Process Regression models for cause fractions and death rates. All models for each <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are then assessed using out-of-sample predictive validity and combined into an ensemble with optimal out-of-sample predictive performance.

Conclusions—With stroke death rates decreasing substantially in the United States from 1996 to 2005, stroke moved from the second to the third leading organ- and disease-specific <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Women and blacks may warrant attention for targeted stroke prevention and treatment because they continue to have disproportionately high stroke death rates.

40|$|This {{study will}} {{identify}} the age <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{and the major}} <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in Gypsies and Travellers. Reliable information as to the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in this population is not available. This study will provide very valuable data to those working with Gypsies and Travellers, and to the community itself, as to the predominant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> This will then be used to strategically design healthcare interventions. Gypsies and Travellers have poor health status and low life expectancy compared to other English-speaking minority ethnic groups. To inform healthcare service provision and interventions {{it is important to}} accurately identify the prevalent <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in this population and which causes differ from the general population. Gypsy or Traveller ethnic status is generally not collected on NHS systems and ethnicity is not recorded at death; therefore age and <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> cannot be accurately determined in this community. This study will link ethnicity and <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data. An appropriate funding source is currently being sought...|$|R

40|$|Pathologists' {{opinions}} <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{given at}} the end of post-mortem (PM) reports have often been used to validate clinicians' death certificates. Information about strokes, common coincident conditions and complications in 120 full PM reports was compared with the pathologists' opinions <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{given at the}} end of the reports. Intracranial haemorrhage and myocardial infarction were mentioned as frequently in the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> as in the full PM report. On the other hand, cerebral infarction, precerebral artery occlusion, severe cerebral atheroma, coronary artery occlusion, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary embolism were all under-cited in the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Whether a pathological condition mentioned in the full PM report also appeared in the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> varied with the decedent's age, the extent of the condition and type of stroke.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the limitations <b>of</b> traditional national <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> statistics. These limitations derive from {{an attempt to}} conceptualize a multidimensional phenomenon and reduce down to a unidimensional framework. The article outlines {{the characteristics of a}} new multidimensional approach which involves the codification and tabulation <b>of</b> all <b>causes</b> (multiple causes) listed on death certificates. Preliminary data are presented which illustrate that multiple <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data do indeed represent a major new dimension to <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> statistics. These data indicate that most major <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are contributory factors in many deaths in which they are not the underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> For example, in 1976, diabetes mellitus was the underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> approximately 35, 000 deaths but was a contributing factor in another 100, 000 deaths. This paper also demonstrates the contribution <b>of</b> multiple <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data to identifying patterns of association among diseases and the kinds of injuries resulting from various external causes. Finally, data are presented which depict the use <b>of</b> multiple <b>cause</b> data in evaluating the efficacy of the coding rules used to classify the underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{interpreting}} verbal autopsy (VA) {{that have been}} validated fall into two major categories: (1) physi-cian-certified verbal autopsy (PCVA), the commonly-used method in which one or more physicians ascertain <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> based on their clinical judgment; and (2) computerized coding of verbal autopsy (CCVA), in which <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are derived using predefined cri-teria. Decision rules for CCVA can be expert opinion-based or data driven. The accuracy of these VA inter-pretation methods varies depending on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> per se, while the effect of misclassification error in VA on the estimates of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMF) depends on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The importance <b>of</b> acknowledging the effects <b>of</b> misclas-sification <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> by VA has been highlighte...|$|R

The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (natural or violent) were analyzed in relation to sex, age, season, and environment (rural and urban areas), socio-economic and living conditions, and the number of children in the family. The results obtained were statistically analyzed, plotted and discussed in relation to data from the literature available. Regarding the autopsy cases of children and adolescents (194), 106 (54. 63 %) were the cases <b>of</b> violent <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and 87 were the cases (44. 84 %) <b>of</b> natural <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> while in one case the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> could not be determined due to late-stage decomposition alterations of the corpse.
