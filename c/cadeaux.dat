2500|$|On 2 June, St Nicholas Abbey {{attempted}} {{to win his}} second Coronation Cup. He was ridden confidently by O'Brien who held the horse up {{at the rear of}} the field in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight. He produced what the Irish Independent described as [...] "a brilliant turn of foot" [...] to take the lead and went clear of his opponents to win by four and a half lengths from Red <b>Cadeaux</b> and Masked Marvel. St Nicholas Abbey was made third favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on 21 July. He was restrained in last place by O'Brien before finishing strongly to take third place behind Danedream and Nathaniel. In the International Stakes at York in August, racing over ten and a half furlongs, he was beaten seven lengths by the winner Frankel and lost second place by a nose to Farhh. St Nicholas Abbey ran again over ten furlongs in the Irish Champion Stakes on 8 September when he finished third to Snow Fairy and Nathaniel. In the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, run on extremely soft ground, he was never in serious contention and finished eleventh of the eighteen runners behind Solemia. In November St Nicholas Abbey was sent to Santa Anita to defend the Breeder's Cup Turf. He made some late progress but was unable to repeat his 2011 success, finishing third to Little Mike and Point of Entry.|$|E
