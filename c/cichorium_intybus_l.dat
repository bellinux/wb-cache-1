40|$|ABSTRACT The use of {{compounds}} with antioxidant properties {{as a source}} of phelanoeid compounds is highly recommendable in the poultry industry. Therefore, the effect of <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> <b>L.</b> herb on pathobiochemical indexes of chicken under heat stress was studied. After exposure to heat stress (from day 21 to day 42 of growth), hydroalcoholic extraction was provided to 270 broiler chicks randomly divided into six groups and placed in two distinct poultry houses (heat stress and normal conditions). The three groups were recipient group of <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> <b>L.</b> (1); recipient group of vitamin C (2) and control group (3). The birds in one of the houses were exposed to heat stress conditions (35 °C for 8 hours) for a time period between 22 to 42 days and the birds in the other house were reared under normal conditions (20 - 22 °C) for the same time period. Blood samples collected from the birds showed that <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> <b>L.</b> herb caused significant decrease in uric acid, Triglyceride, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total body clearance factors (CL- factors) and right ventricular failure index (RVF) and significant increase in K+ under heat stress condition (p< 0. 05). Vitamin C caused significant decrease in uric acid, ALT, CL- factors and RVF index and significant increase in K+ and Na+ under heat stress condition (p< 0. 05). A significant decrease in cholesterol and triglyceride in recipient group of <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> <b>L</b> was observed compared to the recipient group of vitamin C under heat stress condition (p< 0. 05). In a pathologic examination normal observations were in recipient group of <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> <b>L</b> and recipient group of vitamin C compared to the control group.

The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate the in vitro effect of common herbal drugs used traditionally in management of neonatal hyperbillirubinemia. Methods: in this study 0. 5 cc of 5 common herbal drugs (<b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus,</b> Fumaria parviflora, Zizyphus jujuba, Alhagi pseudoalhagi and Purgative manna) which are obtained by hydrochloric instillation were added to 1 ml of serum of jaundiced neonates and then the level of billirubin determined by Diazo blank method.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the fatty acid (FA) content and composition of forages commonly fed to dairy animals in the tropics. Twelve forage species, namely, Trifolium alexandrinum, <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus,</b> Hordeum vulgare <b>L.,</b> Medicago sativa, Avena sativa, Pennisetum purpureum Setaria anceps, Sorghum almum, Panicum maximum, Rumex nepalensis, Panicum coloratum and Panicum antidotale were evaluated. Each forage species was grown in four replicate plots under standard agronomic conditions, and sampled at early, normal and late stages of maturity. The result of the present study showed that the chemical composition, dry matter digestibility and FA contents varied (P < 0. 001) among forage species and harvest maturity. Linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3), palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 n- 6) were the predominant FAs with an average content of 8. 65, 3. 61 and 2. 38 g/kg dry matter (DM), contributing on average to 53 %, 22 % and 14 % of the total measured FAs, respectively. Among the individual FAs, C 18 : 3 n- 3 had the largest variation ranging from 4. 26 to 17. 43 g/kg DM at first harvest.

40|$|Background Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} cancer and the second cause of death among women around the world. In many cancers, including breast cancer, Fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene expression is increased significantly. In breast cancer cell lines, expression of FASN is higher in HER 2 positive cell line like SKBR 3 than the others. FASN is the key enzyme for fatty acid synthesis de novo pathway and it is producing palmitate which is necessary for cell membrane formation. <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> is a medicinal plant that effectively leads to inhibition of fatty acid synthase and thus reduces the percentage of survival of cancer cell lines. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of methanol extract of Chicorium intybus root on percentage of survival in SKBR 3 cell line. Methods Human breast cancer SKBR 3 cell line was cultured in DMEM medium. Methanol extract of <b>Cichorium</b> <b>intybus</b> root was extracted and different dilutions (200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 µg/mL) were added to cell culture.
