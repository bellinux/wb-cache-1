25|$|Although <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> in {{healthcare}} {{is a global}} concept, {{this article focuses on}} <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> as practiced in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> {{was first}} used by Terry L. Cross and colleagues in 1989, {{but it was not}} until almost a decade later that health care {{professionals}} began to be formally educated and trained in <b>cultural</b> <b>competence.</b> In 2002, <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> in health care emerged as a field and has been increasingly embedded into medical education curriculum since then.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> {{involves}} more than having sensitivity or awareness of cultures. It necessitates an active process of learning and developing skills to engage effectively in cross-cultural situations and re-evaluating these skills over time. <b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> is often used interchangeably with the term cultural competency.|$|E
40|$|Background: In most European {{metropolitan}} areas, {{health services}} {{are required to}} provide culturally competent health care to ethnic minority patients. So far this goal has remained elusive because the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> have been mostly considered as an individual competence. We aimed at investigating the role of inter-professionals relationships on the diffusion of <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> within health care organisations. We tested the hypothesis that an individual {{is more likely to}} be culturally competent if his leaders are culturally competent themselves. Methods: We carried out a social network analysis in 24 inpatient and outpatient health services, selected according to their geographic localisation and their patient-centeredness. All healthcare professionals were requested to fill in a questionnaire tapping their level of <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> and their inter-professional relationships. We identified the most central actors within each health service according to the in-degree centrality. We regressed the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the individuals on the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the service leaders. Results: Bivariate regression indicated that the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the individuals increased with the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the leaders (beta= 0. 24, p< 0. 01). The <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the individuals increased with the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> of the leaders (beta= 0. 20, p< 0. 01), after controlling for contextual and sociodemographic variables. Overall interaction analysis suggest that the leadership effect depends on the own skills of the leaders rather than on their professional experience. Conclusions: <b>Cultural</b> <b>competences</b> are partly acquired among health professionals through role-modelling. Implementation of the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> requires an appraisal of inter-professional relationships and to rely on leadership role-modelling within the health care services...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> in {{healthcare}} {{refers to the}} ability for healthcare systems to demonstrate <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> toward patients with diverse values, beliefs, and behaviors. This process includes consideration of the individual social, cultural, and linguistic needs of patients for effective cross-cultural communication with their health care providers. The goal of <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> in health care is to reduce health disparities and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their race, ethnic background, native languages spoken, and religious or cultural beliefs. Cultural competency training is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, allied health, mental health, social work, pharmacy, oral health, and public health fields.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> in {{research}} {{is the ability of}} researchers and research staff to provide high quality research that takes into account the culture and diversity of a population when developing research ideas, design, and methodology. <b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> can be crucial for ensuring that the sampling is representative of the population and therefore application to a diverse number of people. It is important that a study's subject enrollment reflect as closely as possible the target population of those affected by the health problem being studied.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> {{curriculum}} {{is intended to}} improve the interaction between patients and physicians and to assure that students will possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes {{that enable them to}} provide high quality and culturally competent care to patients and their families as well as the general medical community.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the knowledge and theory on cross cultural communication by investigating the impact of cross <b>cultural</b> communication <b>competence</b> on the collective efficacy of multicultural National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball teams. Data was collected from 140 U. S. National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball coaches via the Cross <b>Cultural</b> Communication <b>Competence</b> Questionnaire and the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports. Principle component analysis {{was conducted on the}} data, revealing that the cross <b>cultural</b> communication <b>competence</b> and collective efficacy of basketball teams are multidimensional. The hypothesized relationship between cross <b>cultural</b> communication <b>competence</b> and collective efficacy was confirmed and statistically measured through regression analysis. It was found that four of the cross <b>cultural</b> communication <b>competence</b> dimensions produced by the principle component analysis exhibited a significant positive relationship with one of the two dimensions within collective efficacy.

25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should treat each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in <b>cultural</b> <b>competence.</b> With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent {{so that they can}} effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Culture is {{definitely}} beyond ethnicity and race. Healthcare professionals {{need to learn}} about the tolerance of other's beliefs and remember that the professional care is about meeting patients' needs even if they do not align with our personal beliefs. Discovering our own beliefs and why we have them (from upbringing or modeling of parents, for example) helps understand what is believed and actions at time when others are cared firwith different beliefs. As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>competence</b> {{is defined}} as a set of {{congruent}} behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals and that enables them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Essential elements that enable organizations to become culturally competent include valuing diversity, having the capacity for cultural self-assessment, being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact, having institutionalized cultural knowledge, and having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. By definition, diversity includes differences in race, ethnicity, age, gender, size, religion, sexual orientation, and physical and mental ability. Accordingly, organizations should include these considerations in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, and service delivery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mission is}} stated as having three broad themes: Ethical Leadership, <b>Cultural</b> <b>Competence</b> and Community Engagement. The {{goal of the}} Ethical Leadership {{component}} has been articulated by MSU as [...] "students will articulate their value systems, act ethically {{within the context of}} a democratic society, and demonstrate engaged and principled leadership." [...] The stated objective of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Competence</b> component is [...] "students will recognize and respect multiple perspectives and cultures." [...] Two goals have been articulated for the Community Engagement portion of the mission. They are that [...] "students will recognize the importance of contributing their knowledge and experiences to their own community and the broader society" [...] and [...] "students will recognize the importance of scientific principles in the generation of sound public policy." [...] The public affairs mission is emphasized and enhanced by designated Public Affairs Professorships and a Provost Fellow for Public Affairs, special scholarship programs, grant program, Excellence in Community Service Awards, a yearly week-long Missouri Public Affairs Academy for high school students, a campus-wide public affairs emphasis week and the annual MSU Public Affairs Conference which brings together a diverse group of speakers and panelist for public discussions of various aspects of the public affairs mission. [...] Past conference speakers have included Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Nawal El Saadawi, Les Garland, John Edwards and Frances Hesselbein.|$|E

2500|$|According to the LCME {{standard}} for <b>cultural</b> <b>competence,</b> [...] "the {{faculty and students}} must demonstrate {{an understanding of the}} manner in which people of diverse culture and belief systems perceive health and illness and respond to various symptoms, diseases, and treatments." [...] In response to the mandates, medical schools in the U.S. have incorporated teaching cultural competency in their curricula. A search on cultural competency in the curriculum of a medical school revealed that it was covered in 33 events in 13 courses in spring 2014. A similar search was performed on health disparities yielding 16 events in 10 courses covering the topic.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} provide {{culturally}} competent care for their diverse patients, physicians should at the first step understand that patients' cultures can influence profoundly how they define health and illness, how they seek health care, and what constitutes appropriate treatment. They should also realize that their clinical care process could also be influenced by their own personal and professional experiences as well as biomedical culture. Dr. Like pointed out {{in one of his}} articles that [...] "in transforming systems, transcultural nurses, physicians, and other health care professionals need to remember that cultural humility and <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> must go hand in hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patientâ€™s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of <b>cultural</b> <b>competence</b> by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patientsâ€™ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patientsâ€™ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patientsâ€™ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E
40|$|Films {{in foreign}} {{language}} classrooms are commonly used for developing studentsâ€™ linguistic and <b>cultural</b> <b>competences.</b> This approach, which suits certain educational contexts, particularly those of community or government organizations which cater for the general public, is not entirely suitable for learning at university. In China (and Hong Kong), Spanish is mainly taught at university as a foreign language degree. Students of Hispanic Film {{can learn how to}} analyze a fi lm both as a text and a cultural product in the target language. Therefore, when learning Spanish and Latin American Film as part of a Spanish undergraduate degree at university, the development of linguistic and <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> can be integrated with the development of creative and critical thinking skills as well as the capacity for fi lm and cultural analysis.

40|$|Cultural {{entrepreneurship}} {{and symbolic}} management perspectives portray entrepreneurs as skilled cultural operators and often assume {{them to be}} capable from the outset to purposefully use â€˜cultural resources' in order to motivate resource-holding audiences to support their new ventures. We problematize this premise and develop a model of how entrepreneurs become skilful cultural operators and develop the <b>cultural</b> <b>competences</b> necessary for creating and growing their ventures. The model is grounded in {{a case study of}} an entrepreneur who set up shop and sought to acquire resources in a culturally unfamiliar setting. Our model proposes that two adaptive sensemaking processes - approval-driven sensemaking and autonomy-driven sensemaking - jointly facilitate the gradual development of <b>cultural</b> <b>competences.</b> These processes jointly enable entrepreneurs to gain cultural awareness and calibrate their symbolic enactments. Specifically, while approval-driven sensemaking facilitates recognizing cultural resources to symbolically couple a venture's identity claims more tightly with the cultural frames of targeted audiences and gain legitimate distinctiveness, autonomy-driven sensemaking enables recognizing cultural constraints and more effective symbolic decoupling to shield the venture from constraining cultural frames and defend the venture's autonomy and resources. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the theoretical implications of our study for cultural entrepreneurship and symbolic management research...|$|R
