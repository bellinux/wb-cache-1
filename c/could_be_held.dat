5|$|During the four-day offense of Vahan, {{his troops}} {{had failed to}} achieve any {{breakthrough}} and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce {{for the next few}} days so that fresh negotiations <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1958, the Parliamentary Assembly {{recommended}} to the Council that the Assembly should have its {{seat in the}} same place where the other organisations are based, although it accepted that plenary sessions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> elsewhere. The Assembly also nominated three cities to be the seat of the institutions (Brussels, Strasbourg and Milan), however no permanent agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM {{represented}} negative numbers using two's complement, as most computers still do. In that representation, {{the value}} of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of numbers that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in each 32-bit word was −231 to +231−1 (decimal: −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647).|$|E

5|$|The {{bombing of}} Wewak, in which 100 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{were lost in}} August 1943, caused Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) in Tokyo to reconsider whether Eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> Concluding that it could not, IGHQ authorised {{the commander of the}} Japanese Eighth Area Army to conduct a fighting withdrawal to a new defensive position in Western New Guinea, which it hoped would be ready in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Washington had {{considered}} abandoning Fort Washington, {{but he was}} swayed by Nathanael Greene, who believed the fort <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> {{and that it was}} vital to do so. Greene argued that holding the fort would keep open communications across the river and might dissuade the British from attacking New Jersey. Magaw and Putnam concurred with Greene. Washington deferred to Greene and did not abandon the fort.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to left-wing and Basque separatist violence, the government passed a new anti-terrorist law on 26 August 1975. Sympathising with terrorists would now carry a penalty {{of up to}} 12 years imprisonment. The law re-established military tribunals, empowered to order executions of those they found guilty of terrorism against the state. It extended the time that suspects <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> for interrogation from 3 to 5 days, with an option of up to 19 days with judicial approval. In response, the European Parliament debated a motion proposed by the Confederation of the Socialist Parties of the European Community condemning the new law as an infringement {{of human rights and}} calling for the suspension of relations between the EEC and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Kinne went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and a sentence of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in October 1964.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{almost all}} {{marriage}} contracts stipulated that a widowed woman renouncing her indebted marital community <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> accountable for any liabilities of that community. Normally, the widowed woman <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> accountable for debts {{on her own}} personal property unless she had an independent business separate from her husbands and was recognized as an independent public merchant by her husband or if she decided to continue to manage the community as an undivided entity with her minor children.|$|R

5|$|Later in the morning, Ike {{picked up}} his rifle and {{revolver}} from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liman von Sanders {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from Nazareth {{in the early morning}} when the 5th Cavalry Division unsuccessfully attacked the town. During his journey to Deraa, Liman von Sanders ordered the establishment of a rearguard line running from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around the shore of the Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. If this line, across the two main roads and railway lines to Damascus <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> time could be gained for the consolidation of the retreating columns into a strong defence of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February, Aguirre's term {{of office}} expired. Against {{the wishes of the}} Amapolas, the {{moderate}} Tomás Villalba was elected by the Senate to replace Aguirre. French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a coup to retake power. Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and Manuel Herrera y Obes (representing Villalba's government) signed a peace accord on 20 February at the Villa de la Unión. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b>|$|E

Due to the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, new elections <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> new elections <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in 1939, and Michał Rostworowski retained his position as judge until his death in 1940. His position was not filled due to the dissolution of the court, which was replaced by the International Court of Justice as part of the creation of the United Nations.|$|R
50|$|On 13 August 1311, Gradenigo died, and, since Venice {{was under}} interdict and the {{religious}} ceremonies <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> he <b>was</b> buried in an unmarked grave on Murano.|$|R
5|$|The Equal Protection Clause {{served as}} the basis for the {{decision}} in Bush v. Gore (2000), in which the Court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 presidential election <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> within the needed deadline; the decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed election. In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} {{engaged in}} ongoing negotiations to establish {{conditions under which}} {{free and fair elections}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in Maputo, Mozambique. The Maputo Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral political decisions and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E
5|$|With {{evidence}} strongly {{pointing to}} Desha as the murderer, General William Reed summoned Desha {{to his house}} on November 9 and ordered him to remain until an examining trial <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> Desha complied, showed no emotion when viewing Baker's body, and {{did not attempt to}} flee although left unguarded in the house. The examining trial resulted in Desha's formal arrest, and he was imprisoned in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. Relief Party partisans said that Desha was innocent and his arrest was fabricated by the Anti-Relief Party to embarrass his father Governor Desha and weaken him politically.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{began his}} {{political}} career with his election {{to the office of}} city attorney in Prestonsburg in 1950. Later that year, Governor Lawrence Wetherby appointed him to fill a vacancy in the office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's 31st Judicial District. Combs announced, however, that he would serve only until a new election <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> In April 1951, Governor Wetherby appointed Combs to fill a vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals caused by the death of Judge Roy Helm. Later that year, he sought a full eight-year term on the court. His opponent was Simeon S. Willis, a popular former Republican governor who had previously sat on the court. Combs won the election by a vote of 73,298 to 69,379. In George Robinson's oral history, Combs attributed his victory to Willis's advanced age (68) and {{the fact that many of}} Willis' supporters assumed that their candidate would win and did not vote.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{president}} of the Boy Scouts' Association of Victoria for 23 years, and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association from 1959 to 1977. He was chairman of trustees of the Shrine of Remembrance from 1945 to 1978 (and remained a trustee until his death) and chairman of trustees of the Australian War Memorial from 1959 to 1974. He was made a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1949, received an honorary DCL from Oxford in 1953, became an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1963 and received an honorary LLD from Monash University in 1973. He was also active in the Anglican Church, and for many years was chancellor of the diocese of Melbourne, the highest church office that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> by a layman. In 1980 he was elected one of the inaugural fellows of Trinity College, Melbourne, under its new constitution.|$|E
