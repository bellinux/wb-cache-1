25|$|Chikungunya is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} <b>chikungunya</b> <b>virus</b> (CHIKV). Symptoms include fever and joint pain. These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Most people are better within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months. The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000. The very young, old, and those with other health problems {{are at risk of}} more severe disease.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDengue and <b>chikungunya</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{transmitted}} by Aedes mosquitoes. In Martinique, {{an island of}} the French West Indies, Aedes aegypti is the suspected vector of both arboviruses; there is no Aedes albopictus on the island. During the concomitant outbreak of 2013 - 2015, the authors collected wild A. aegypti populations, {{and for the first}} time, detected dengue and <b>chikungunya</b> <b>viruses</b> in field-collected females.

Diphtheria, which had been eradicated from Venezuela in the 1990s, reappeared in 2016 due to the shortages of medicine.|$|E
25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{was responsible for}} the Chikungunya epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005–2006. By September 2006, an estimated 266,000 people were infected with the virus, and 248 fatalities occurred on the island. The Asian {{tiger mosquito}} was also the transmitter of the virus in the first and only outbreak of Chikungunya fever on the European continent. This outbreak occurred in the Italian province of Ravenna in the summer of 2007, and infected over 200 people.
