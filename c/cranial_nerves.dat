40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the key predictive factors of radiation-induced <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy {{in patients with}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method and materials: From November 1998 to December 2007, all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NPC who were curatively treated with radiotherapy and subsequently developed radiation-induced <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy (RICNP) were included in our study. Patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy due to disease recurrence were excluded. Their records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Amongst 965 patients with NPC treated with radical radiotherapy, 41 developed new <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. After exclusion of 5 patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy due to recurrence, 36 (3. 7 %) developed RICNP. The median follow-up was 8. 9 years (range, 3. 2 - 11. 3 years). Ten of the 36 patients had <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation. Twenty-seven patients had single <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy and 9 patients had multiple <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. The most commonly involved <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> was <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII, with 30 patients having palsy of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII and 6 of them having bilateral <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII palsies. Magnetic resonance imaging features of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were demonstrated in our study. Multivariate analysis revealed that <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation was an independent prognostic factor {{for the development of}} RICNP. Other factors including T staging, N staging, gender, age, radiotherapy technique and the use of chemotherapy have no significant relationship with the risk of developing RICNP. Conclusion: RICNP in patients with NPC is not a rare complication, and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation is an important prognostic factor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|The chorda tympani (<b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> VII), the {{glossopharyngeal}} <b>nerve</b> (<b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> IX), and the vagus <b>nerve</b> (<b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> X) carry {{information from}} the taste receptors to the brain for cortical processing.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> are {{considered}} {{components of the}} peripheral nervous system (PNS), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more accurately {{considered part of the}} central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is a cranial nerve that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> or simply cranial nerve XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E

5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as cranial sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the blood vessels, and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{neurovascular}} conflict (NC) {{consists of}} a pathological contact between a vessel, generally an artery, and the root entry zone of a <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> close to the brainstem. Even if NC of the V, VII and IX <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> have been rarely described, {{to the best of}} our knowledge there is no report about the XII <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> NC in the paediatric age. A three-year-old girl presented with right-sided tongue atrophy and fasciculation, of one-year-duration, consistent with a peripheral lesion of the right XII <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Brain MRI and MRA documented a marked tortuosity of the vertebrobasilar arteries compressing the brainstem at the emergency of the XII <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve,</b> while the CT disclosed a concomitant osseous malformation of the cranio-cervical junction. The differential diagnosis of a peripheral unilateral <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy should include, even if rare in children, a neurovascular conflict. In this case a complete neuroimaging study is indicated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} pairs of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> emerge {{directly}} from the brainstem. The brainstem also contains nuclei of many cranial and peripheral nerves, as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing, control of eye movements and balance.

Many nerve tracts, which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body, pass through the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is one of}} twelve <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E
50|$|Motor {{innervation}} is {{from the}} buccal branch of the facial <b>nerve</b> (<b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> VII). Sensory innervation is supplied by the buccal branch (one of the muscular branches) of the mandibular part of the trigeminal (<b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> V).|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injuries, {{particularly}} {{motor nerve}} injuries, following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can be disabling and therefore {{patients should be}} given reliable information {{about the risks of}} sustaining such injuries. The reported frequency of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury in the published literature ranges from 3 to 23 %, and there have been few series in which patients were routinely examined before and after surgery by a neurologist. METHODS: The authors investigated the risk of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injuries in patients who underwent CEA in the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), the largest series of patients undergoing CEA in which neurological assessment was performed before and after surgery. <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury was assessed and recorded in every patient and persisting deficits were identified on follow-up examination at 4 months and 1 year after randomization. Risk factors for <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury were examined by performing univariate and multivariate analyses. There were 88 motor <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injuries among the 1739 patients undergoing CEA (5. 1 % of patients; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 1 - 6. 2). In 23 patients, the deficit had resolved by hospital discharge, leaving 3. 7 % of patients (95 % CI 2. 9 - 4. 7) with a residual <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury: 27 hypoglossal, 17 marginal mandibular, 17 recurrent laryngeal, one accessory nerve, and three Homer syndrome. In only nine patients (0. 5 %; 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 98) the deficit was still present at the 4 -month follow-up examination; however, none of the persisting deficits resolved during the subsequent follow up. Only duration of operation longer than 2 hours was independently associated with an increased risk of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury (hazard ratio 1. 56, p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of motor <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury persisting beyond hospital discharge after CEA is approximately 4 %. The vast majority of neurological deficits resolve over the next few months, however, and permanent deficits are rare. Nevertheless, the risk of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury should be communicated to patients before they undergo surgery...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of 271 new patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 36 (13. 3 %) {{were found to}} have <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement. Serous otitis media (SOM) was found in 98 (41. 4 %) of 237 patients who had undergone complete otologic assessment. The local control of tumor and actuarial survival of three subgroups of patients, namely, 80 patients with SOM only, 11 patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy only, and 18 patients with both SOM and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy, were analyzed. The local control of tumor was better in patients with SOM alone than in those with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy alone; those patients with both SOM and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement had worse local control as well as survival. As SOM is not uncommon in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and adult-onset SOM is otherwise distinctly uncommon, this provides a good opportunity for early recognition and, perhaps, better control of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5000|$|The trochlear nerve, {{also called}} the fourth <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> or <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> IV, is a motor nerve (a somatic efferent nerve) that innervates only a single muscle: the {{superior}} oblique muscle of the eye, which operates through the pulley-like trochlea.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{establish}} the true incidence of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction after carotid endarterectomy, 50 consecutive carotid endarterectomy procedures were assessed by careful and objective preoperative and postoperative <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> evaluations, including indirect laryngoscopic examination by a trained ENT surgeon. Of the 50 patients evaluated, 2 (4 %) {{were found to have}} a postoperative <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> deficit, and these were the following: 1 (2 %) recurrent laryngeal, none (0 %) superior laryngeal, 1 (2 %) marginal mandibular nerve, and none (0 %) hypoglossal nerve. In no instance was any patient who was asymptomatic found to have unsuspected objective evidence of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury; on the other hand, both symptomatic patients were found to have a significant <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injury by further evaluation. Our objective data refute the literature that would support a magnitude of either symptomatic or asymptomatic <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> injuries following such a procedure. Our study further fails to support a need for a more extensive exam-ination that would routinely include indirect laryngoscopy and a specialist-ori-ented consultation&mdash;both of which appear neither warranted nor cost effective. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on March 4, 2016 ves. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
40|$|The third <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is called}} the oculomotor nerve. The {{pathology}} is revealed by limitation of eye movement inward-up-down, mydriasis, loss of light reflex and ptosis. Oculomotor nerve pathologies are frequently seen in neurology practice and are situations that may {{be very difficult for}} differential diagnosis. Differential diagnosis first involves disqualifying intracranial etiologies by imaging because these intracranial etiologies may be situations that can result in death and should be primarily evaluated. If intracranial events are ruled out, generally rarer etiologic reasons with generally difficult differentiation should be researched. Viral infections are among the rare etiological reasons causing 3 rd <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement. Our case was a 71 -year old female with etiological research due to 3 rd <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. The patient with diabetes-linked immune deficiency was found to have <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement developed secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. We report this case as 3 rd <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> involvement is rarely observed developing linked to CMV infection...|$|R
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves,</b> producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
50|$|These {{muscles are}} innervated by the {{pharyngeal}} plexus via the vagus nerve, {{with the exception}} of the tensor veli palatini. The tensor veli palatini is innervated by <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> 5 branch V3 (which is the mandibular division of the trigeminal <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{contents}} of the fissure include communications of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> VII to the infratemporal fossa.
