The theme also appears at the end of [...] "It's a Beautiful Day (reprise)" [...] on the album Made in Heaven.

Instead of moving the lever by hand, a button (commonly labeled [...] "mix", [...] "auto" [...] or [...] "auto trans") can be used, which performs the transition over a user-defined period of time.

40|$|Antarctique is {{the seventh}} and final part of Grand Atlas, a cycle in which {{each of the seven}} world continents is {{depicted}} in an orchestral composition. The Antarctic cold prevents Earth’s southernmost continent from growing trees. Anyone who reaches the South Pole by skis and dog sled faces snow, ice and wind, for weeks in a row, with no respite. Likewise, Antarctique lacks the luxury of melodies and varied rhythm. It simply survives on a strict ration of chords, <b>cross</b> <b>fades,</b> and regular pulses. Antarctique originated from site-specific considerations. That is to say, the vast circular concert venue of the first performance, the spectacular gasholder of the Amsterdam Westergasfabriek, defined pretty much every aspect of the work. The monolithic music, scored for large symphony orchestra, passes through a spiral of harmonies, the complexity of which increases gradually throughout the work by stacking pitches according to the circle of fifths. The harmonies are strung together by means of a ‘cantus firmus’, containing all twelve chromatic notes as well as all possible intervals. Twelve percussionists, regularly spaced, surround both audience and orchestra, delineating a compass – or rather the Antarctic Circle, the border beyond which, at least once a year, there is a twenty-four hour period with continuous daylight or complete darkness. At the same time the percussion ensemble forms a live clock in ‘surround-sound’ – we hear time passing along the pitches of a chromatic scale: every five seconds is marked by the next semitone, from the next position, on the next bell. Yet, in Antarctica, our everyday concept of time is being challenged, since all time zones converge in the South Pole. Antarctique concludes by reaching this ultimate magnetic point in time and space: in the last minute we hear time ticking away counterclockwise on twelve woodblocks. The final stroke is heard on all of them, as if {{all hours of the day}} collide...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} application {{was developed to}} simulate the process of microphone positioning in sound recording applications. A dense, regular grid of impulse responses pre-recorded on {{the region of the}} room under study allowed the sound captured by a virtual mi- crophone to be auralised through real-time convolution with an anechoic stream representing the sound source. Convolution was performed using a block-based variation on the overlap-add method where the summation of many small sub- convolutions produced each block of output data samples. As the applied RIR filter varied on successive audio output blocks, a short <b>cross</b> <b>fade</b> was applied to avoid glitches in the audio. The maximum possible length of impulse response applied was governed by the size of audio processing block (hence la- tency) employed by the program.
