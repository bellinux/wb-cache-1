In 2012, the Club launched a 3rd XI which played at Amberley CC and an appeal to secure funds to renovate the West <b>Chilt</b> pavilion. At the end of August, the 1st XI were again crowned champions - this time in Division Two - and were promoted to Division One - just one division below Sussex county standard. The 2nds ended the season unbeaten in all competitions, finishing runners up in Division Six and were again also promoted.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{interventions}} to prevent obesity in children {{have never been}} more necessary. There have been over 30 published reviews and meta-analyses on such interventions (randomized and controlled trials) since 2008. In summary, interventions which involve the whole community (community-based) in complex interventions (promoting healthy eating, reduction in sedentary behaviours and increase in physical activity) that target environments and upstream determinants {{appear to be more}} effective. In this article {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} community-based complex interventions which aim to prevent obesity in children will be discussed and a selection of recent and ongoing interventions that are shaping the evidence-base in this field will be highlighted (beyond those reported in other papers in this supplement: KOPS, <b>CHILT,</b> TigerKids, IDEFICS and TrinkFit). This paper reviews the challenges and opportunities associated with designing and evaluating community-based complex interventions and initiatives. These include a) design issues (strengths and weaknesses of different types of evidence), b) measurement of (effectiveness) outcomes, c) development of interventions (pilot work, planning frameworks and underpinning theories), d) partnership working and community engagement and e) health inequalities. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Juvenile {{overweight}} is increasing, {{and effective}} preventive measures are needed. After years of arbitrarily assigning these measures disregarding socioeconomic and/or cultural differences, {{it has become}} necessary to tailor interventions more specific to these target groups. Providing data for such an intervention is {{the objective of this}} study. Methods: Influencing variables on children's weight status, motor skills and lifestyle have been analyzed among 997 first graders (53. 2 % male) involved in the Children's Health InterventionaL Trial (<b>CHILT).</b> Results: Median age was 6. 9 years; 7. 3 % were obese, 8. 8 % were overweight. Children with low socioeconomic status (SES) {{were more likely to be}} obese (p = 0. 029). Low SES (p &#x 02 C 2; 0. 001), migration background (p = 0. 001) and low sports activity levels (p = 0. 007) contributed most to an increased consumption of television. Migration background (p = 0. 003) and male gender (p Conclusion: Children with a low SES and migration background were more likely to exhibit unfavorable health behavior patterns, higher BMI scores, and poorer motor skills. Interventions should integrate motivational and targeting strategies and consider cultural and educational differences to address these vulnerable groups...|$|E
40|$|Obesity in {{childhood}} is increasing worldwide. To combat overweight and obesity {{in childhood}}, the school-based Children's Health InterventionaL Trial (<b>CHILT)</b> project combines health education and physical activity. This paper examines {{the effect of}} intervention on the body mass index (BMI) and motor abilities after 20. 8 Â± 1. 0 months in 12 randomly selected primary schools compared with 5 randomly selected control schools. The anthropometric data were assessed, BMI was calculated. Coordination was determined by lateral jumping and endurance performance by a 6 -minute run. No difference in the prevalence of overweight and obesity {{was found between the}} intervention (IS) and control schools (CS) either at baseline or following intervention (each p > 0. 05). The {{increase in the number of}} lateral jumps was significantly higher in the IS than in the CS (p < 0. 001). For the 6 -minute run the increase in distance run was significantly improved in IS (p = 0. 020). All variables were controlled for gender and age. Overweight and obese children in both IS and CS produced significantly lower scores in coordination and endurance tasks than normal and underweight children during both examinations (each p < 0. 001), adjusted for gender and age. Preventive intervention in primary schools offers an effective means to improve motor skills in childhood and to break through the vicious circle of physical inactivity - motor deficits - frustration - increasing inactivity possibly combined with an excess energy intake and weight gain. To prevent overweight and obesity these measures have to be intensifie...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the relative merits of two screening tests used for visual acuity assessment of preschool children. The tests that were compared were the Good-Lite Company versions of the E-Test and of the STYCAR (Screening Test for Young Children and Retardates). The former is the most popular method for evaluating central acuity in young children in this nation; the STYCAR is a relatively new letter-matching-test developed in England, where it is widely employed. The E-Test poses left-right orientation problems which are eliminated by the symmetrical letters H, T, O and V utilized in the Letter-Matching-Test. Both visual acuity tests were administered on two separate occasions by personnel from the Prevention of Blindness Society of Metropolitan Washington to 633 preschool children in Washington, D. C. By random selection, 150 of the children received the E-Test at both sessions, 162 children received the Letter-Matching-Test at both sessions, 160 <b>chilt</b> athe the second session, and 161 children received the Letter-Matching-Test at the first session and the E-Test at the second session. The author medically examined the eyes of 408 of the 633 children without knowledge of which test had been initially administered. Statistical analysis of the data obtained from the study indicated that the Letter-Matching-Test was significantly better in terms of testability rates, group and individual instruction time, and performance time. The E-Test was more reliable in terms of test-retest acuity scores and was also more valid in terms of agreement between pass-fail results obtained at the first screening session and two levels of pass-fail refraction criteria...|$|E
