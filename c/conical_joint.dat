40|$|Problem of {{the stress}} in the ceramic head of hip joint {{endoprosthesis}} pressed on the stem under oblique loading is solved in this paper. Oblique loading simulated the physiologi-cal conditions in vivo. The axis-symmetric production inaccuracies (deflection of nominal degree of taper) of the head - stem <b>conical</b> <b>joint</b> are considered. Computational modelling is realized by FEM - system ANSYS...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to assess the stress state in a plate-type device {{characterized}} by a <b>conical</b> <b>joint</b> between plate and screws connected through a titanium insert. Stress distributions for two different loading conditions (screw tension and bending) were computed by means of 3 -dimensional FEM models. Results show that the titanium insert flexibility provides a well distributed load in the plate and can thus help reducing stress-shielding phenomena. The last part of this work shows our clinical experience...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{concentrations}} at {{the ends}} of a flat contact including frictional sliding are analyzed in this article by using the finite element (FE) method. The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft coupled to the hub by conical rings. The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional <b>conical</b> <b>joints.</b> These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the shaft material can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well. The paper's findings and conclusions are applicable to the design and manufacturing process of the frictional <b>conical</b> <b>joints</b> with regard to assembly tolerances...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{overloading}} and under-loading on tissue ingrowth into the porous-coated tita-nium segmental prosthesis was studied in a canine femoral model. The prosthesis has modular components that are {{connected by a}} <b>conical</b> coupling <b>joint.</b> One of the dog’s hind legs was immobilized and suspended for three weeks using an external fixator to minimize loading and prevent weight-bearing, while the contralateral leg was allowed to bear weight freely, simulating an over-loading situation. Five dogs reached the final study pe-nod of twelve weeks without complication. There {{were no significant differences}} between the non-weight-bear-ing and weight-bearing sides on radiographic assess-ments. However, the immobilized side had significantly higher stem-push-out strength and energy to failure...|$|R
40|$|A prototypic {{heat pipe}} system for an out-of-core {{thermionic}} reactor {{has been built}} and tested. The emitter of the concentric thermionic converter consists of the condenser of a tungsten heat pipe utilizing a lithium working fluid. The evaporator section of the emitter heat pipe is radiation heated to simulate the thermal input from the nuclear reactor. The emitter heat pipe thermal transport is matched to the thermionic converter input requirement. The collector heat pipe of niobium, 1 %-zirconium alloy uses potassium as the working fluid. The thermionic collector is coupled to the heat pipe by a tapered <b>conical</b> <b>joint</b> designed to minimize the temperature drop. The area ratio of the evaporator to condenser is 16 : 1, which increases the radiation area. The composite wick structure consists of seven arteries and cylindrical wraps. The collector heat flux matches the design requirements of the thermionic converter...|$|E
30|$|In Version 3 (Fig.  3 c), {{a number}} of {{improvements}} were applied. Two conical connections at the two ends of the column were designed to replace the clamp-connections used in Version 2. The two caps and body of the column were connected by the two conical joints (vaseline should be used at the connect contact {{in order to facilitate}} the disassembling step). The connection was strengthened by stainless steel springs (or rubber bands) and hooks surrounding four sides of the column. This design also improved the manipulation of packing material in the column, making it quicker and easier to use. The leakage problem was mostly prevented by the <b>conical</b> <b>joint.</b> After several tests, the advantages of this version were compared to the previous versions and noted in terms of its faster manufacture, easier manipulating and packing, and lower production cost. Experiencing the trials, however, it was observed that the lower conical cap was not really necessary and, as a consequence, further refinements were made resulting in the final version (Version 4).|$|E
40|$|Hydrocyclones are devices {{worldwide}} used in {{mineral processing}} for desliming, classification, selective classification, thickening and pre-concentration. A hydrocyclone is composed by one cylindrical and one <b>conical</b> section <b>joint</b> together, without any moving parts {{and it is}} capable of perform granular material separation in pulp. The mineral particles separation mechanism acting in a hydrocyclone is complex and its mathematical modelling is usually empirical. The most used model for hydrocyclone corrected cut size is proposed by Plitt. Over the years many revisions and corrections to Plitt´s model were proposed. The present paper shows a modification in the Plitt´s model constant, obtained by exponential regression of simulated data for three different hydrocyclones geometry: Rietema, Bradley and Krebs. To validate the proposed model literature data obtained from phosphate ore using fifteen different hydrocyclones geometry are used. The proposed model shows a correlation equals to 88. 2...|$|R
40|$|This thesis shows {{a concept}} of a {{coupling}} point for gripper fingers. These gripping fingers {{are part of a}} three-finger-gripper for a new research robot at the DLR (German Areospace Center). Changing the gripper fingers gives high flexibility with regard to the feasible gripping tasks and a simple structure of the three-finger-gripper with only four degrees of freedom. The concept includes a PCB with spring loaded contacts for electical connection and a <b>conical</b> dovetail <b>joint</b> for mechnical connection. The mounting direction of the coupling point is in the acutation direction of the linear drive for the gripper finger. The transmission of the mechanical degree of freedom is achieved with two racks and pinions and the overload release is bases on the friction effect. The realisation of the concept is critical due to the geometrical boundaries which leads to gripping forces below the requirements. Some possible solutions are contemplated and unconsidered areas for alternative solutions are shown...|$|R
50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or {{sometimes}} volumetric flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (<b>conical)</b> ground glass <b>joints.</b> Some flasks, especially volumetric flasks, come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} Finite Element {{model is}} used to investigate the loosening behavior of countersunk threaded fasteners subjected to cyclic shear loading applied through prescribed transverse excitation to the fastener head. Fasteners with conical head profile require precision machining of both the fastener head and the mating joint hole. Any mismatch between the head and the <b>joint</b> <b>conical</b> angles affects the torque tension relationship {{as well as the}} loosening performance. Investigation focuses on the loosening behavior in its early stages. Factors investigated include the effect of the bolt head/joint hole contact location, joint elastic modulus, and tapped hole clearance for different combinations of thread fit, on the loosening performance of preloaded countersunk-head bolts. The FEA model prediction of the self-loosening behavior is experimentally validated...|$|R

The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable and are diagonally introduced to the surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for adhering components from same or different metals in the automotive-, aircraft- and engineering- and related industries, comprises coating adhesive surfaces of the components to be joined with an adhesive for actual adhesion process, introducing <b>conical</b> holes, <b>joints</b> and/or slots in the adhesion surfaces by a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser after coating, filling the holes, joints and/or slots with fast-hardening adhesives and then hardening. The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable, are diagonally introduced to the surface during tensile stress of the adhered components, and have changing directions. Contour sections act as the holes, joints and/or slots, where slots are S-shaped with oblique sections. Oblique boring and oblique cutting edge are implemented {{for the production of}} holes, joints and/or slots after trepanning process. Cyanacrylate and/or low-viscous 2 -K-epoxide resin and/or ultraviolet activated- or ultraviolet hard adhesive system are used as fast hardening adhesives. The holes, joints and/or slots are introduced into the join parts and then the adhesion surfaces are coated with the adhesive that penetrates into the join parts. The adhesive is temporarily heated and then flows into the holes, joints and/or slots. The temperature lies under the hardening temperature. Hot-melts are used as adhesive, are heated up to melting and flow into the holes. The heating and cooling of the adhesive in the holes, joints and/or slots take place before hardening the adhesive surfaces. The low-melting metals are introduced into the holes, joints and/or slots. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces is integrated into a continuous overall process. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces takes place in the cathodic immersion lacquer process during the application in the automobile industry. The already hardened adhesive is displaced with specified adhered rivet. The strengthening takes place by filling materials. The adhesives are strengthened in the holes, joints and slots to increase their firmness. The fiber strengthening of the adhesive takes place by carbon fibers, glass fibers and or textile fibers. Carbon-nanotubes and/or particles in micro- or nano-size are used as the filling materials. USE - Method for adhering components from same or different metals useful in the automotive-, aircraft- and engineering- and related industries. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures effective and economical adhering of components with high-strength and provides high-stability to the adhered places and areas...|$|R
40|$|Impact-loaded conical and {{cylindrical}} friction joints are studied theoretically and experimentally. The system considered {{consists of}} a long, straight, cylindrical and linearly elastic rod which is impacted axially at one end, and which has a body attached {{by means of a}} friction joint at the opposite end. The conditions are such that the wave propagation is 1 -D in the rod and can be neglected in the attached body. Slip and energy dissipation due to an impact load are determined. The theoretical results of the impact-loaded <b>conical</b> friction <b>joints</b> exhibit phenomena which sometimes have spectacular appearance. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results is fair. The influence of blow frequency and thrust on the performance of a percussive rock drill is studied theoretically. The drill considered consists of hammer, adapter, rod and bit. Two different rock drills are studied. The first is a simple drill with constant characteristic impedance throughout the drill. The second is a prototype of a high frequency percussive rock drill. The efficiency and the maximum (maximum tensile) and minimum (maximum compressive) stresses are determined. For the simple drill the average efficiency in the range from soft to hard rock is only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to relatively high blow frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high blow frequencies. It is also found that the maximum and minimum stresses in the drill in the range from soft to hard rock are only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to high frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high frequencies. The maximum stress increases and the minimum stress decreases with thrust. Godkänd; 1986; 20070108 (mlk...|$|R
