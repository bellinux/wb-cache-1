They combine the advantages of a metal with the structural advantages of foam. Among these, aluminium foams have created a great interest due to their light weight structure and their various applications in the automotive, aerospace and allied industries. Aluminium foam possesses high stiffness and low density, it has good energy-absorbing properties making it good for crash-protection and packaging and it has attractive heat-transfer properties that permit to use these materials to cool electronic equipment and as heat exchangers in engines. However, its manufacturing techniques and characterization methods need more attention. The inadequate knowledge on the physical phenomena governing the foaming process does not allow to obtain products with repeatable characteristics. In this paper aluminium foams in various fabrication components were produced by applying the powder compact melting method. In particular metal powders (AlSi 7) and powdered gas-releasing blowing agents (TiH 2) were mixed and subsequently pressed to obtain a foamable precursor material. The resulting precursor was then foamed by heating it up to above its melting point. Experimental tests were performed to study the fabrication of aluminum foam components and with the extent of optimize the pressing parameters of the foamable precursor material, the foaming temperature and the heating rate during foaming. It was studied the effects of geometrical discontinuities in the mould (such as holes, restrictions, etc) on the evolution and on the morphology of metal foams...|$|R

The nearshore MCC region had a dominant length scale of 8. 5 km. The offshore open cell region had larger length scales of 12 km to 20 km. Aircraft transects conducted through the <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> MCC exhibited variable perturbations on two distinct length scales. Perturbations associated with MCC occurred at lengths scales identical to satellite observations. Perturbations also occurred on smaller length scales due to narrow, sub-kilometer convective downdraft events imbedded within the MCC.

Typical event perturbations include colder, dryer, downdrafts.

The cytoplasm of the oncocytes in Hürthle cell adenomas and carcinomas is characterized by an eosinophilic granular nature, which is commonly due to the oncocytes' high content of mitochondria. Some of these cells can contain up to 5,000 mitochondria, which fills the cytoplasm to the point of nearly excluding other organelles. This high amount of mitochondria is reported to be a result of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA.

The behavior of polymeric foams studied depends on the constitutive material and the morphology of the porous structure.

The organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO) {{is one of the most}} commonly utilized CPAs and has been used with various levels of success depending on the type of cells. In recent years, to improve cryogenic outcomes, the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose has been used as an additive to Me 2 SO-based freezing solutions. Trehalose is a naturally occurring non-toxic compound found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates which has been shown to provide cellular protection during water-limited states. The mechanism by which trehalose improves cryopreservation outcomes remains not fully understood. Raman microspectroscopy is a powerful tool to provide valuable insight into the nature of interactions among water, trehalose, and Me 2 SO during cryopreservation. We found that the addition of trehalose to Me 2 SO based CPA solutions dramatically reduces the area per ice crystals while increasing the number of ice crystals formed when cooled to − 40 or − 80 °C. Differences in ice-formation patterns were found to have a direct impact on cellular viability. Despite the osmotic stress caused by addition of 100 mM trehalose, improvement in cellular viability was observed. However, the substantial increase in osmotic pressure caused by trehalose concentrations above 100 mM may offset the beneficial effects of changing the morphology of the ice crystals achieved by addition of this sugar...|$|R

The autophagy {{is thought to be}} a critical process for cancer stem cell (CSC) or tumor-initiating cell maintenance but the mechan-isms by which autophagy supports survival of CSCs remain poorly understood. In this study, inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of ATG 7 or BECN 1 modified the CD 44 þ/CD 24 low/ population in breast cancer cells by regulating CD 24 and IL 6 secretion. In a breast cancer cell line that is independent of autophagy for survival, autophagy inhibition increased IL 6 secre-tion to themedia. On the other hand, in an autophagy-dependent cell line, autophagy inhibition decreased IL 6 secretion, cell sur-vival, and mammosphere formation. In these cells, IL 6 treatment or conditioned media from autophagy-competent cells rescued the deficiency inmammosphere formation induced by autophagy inhibition. These results reveal that autophagy regulates breast CSC maintenance in autophagy-dependent breast cancer cells by modulating IL 6 secretion implicating autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. Implications: Modulation of autophagy in breast cancer has different and even opposite effects, indicating the need for a selection strategy when trying to manipulate autophagy in the context of cancer therapy.

This neural phenotypic plasticity allows us to consider the utilization of mesenchymal stem <b>cells</b> as <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> in regenerative medicine. In this study, we demonstrate that cultured adult rat stromal cells can express nestin, an intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed by neural stem cells. Two factors contribute to the regulation of nestin expression by rat stromal cells: serum in the culture medium inhibits nestin expression and a threshold number of passages must be reached below which nestin expression does not occur. Only nestin-positive rat stromal cells are able to form spheres when they are placed in the culture conditions used for neural stem cells. Likewise, only nestin-positive stromal cells are able to differentiate into GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) -positive cells when they are co-cultivated with neural stem cells. We thus demonstrated that adult rat stromal cells in culture express nestin in absence of serum after passaging the cells at least ten times, and we suggest that nestin expression by these cells might be a prerequisite for the acquisition of the capacity to progress towards the neural lineage.

30|$|The {{major step}} of the {{separation}} process is the extraction of PHA granules (Jacquel et al. [2008]). Extraction using solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride, propylene carbonate and dichloroethane resulted in very pure PHA (Ramsay et al. [1994]). This extraction method required large quantities of toxic and volatile solvent, which not only increased the total production cost but also had adverse environmental consequences ([Choi and Lee 1997]). During digestion of non-PHA <b>cellular</b> <b>materials</b> using hypochlorite, severe degradation of PHA was observed. An enzymatic digestion method developed by Zeneca {{was used for the}} production of Biopol (PHBV) but the use of expensive chemicals and complex processes {{did not seem to be}} economical ([Holmes and Lim 1990]). The extraction {{step of the}} described procedure consumed no energy and lesser quantities of chemicals compared to other recovery methods such as solvent and supercritical fluid extraction, digestion by sodium hypochlorite and enzymes as well as mechanical disruption of cell walls by high-pressure homogenization and ultrasonication (Jacquel et al. [2008]). As the PHA granules themselves do not contain much contaminant (Steinbüchel et al. [1995]), highly pure PHA can be produced by processes that break the <b>cell</b> and solubilize <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> other than PHA. Therefore, a simple digestion method by inexpensive chemicals seems to be the most efficient and economical recovery process. Subsequent purification steps were essential to obtain a high-purity product. Surfactant pre-treatment and hypochlorite digestion under optimized conditions resulted in a very pure PHB with less degradation (Choi and Lee, [1999]) and was applied for post-extraction purification in the present study.|$|R

Because of their cellular structure, they have unusual mechanical properties: {{they can be}} stiff, yet light, and {{they are capable of}} absorbing large deflections and thus large amounts of energy. Yet their mechanical behaviour has hardly been studied: no comprehensive attempt to relate mechanical properties to structure exists. In this thesis, we have attempted to do this. We first model a <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> as a simple, two-dimensional array of hexagonal cells and identify and analyze the mechanisms by which it deforms. From this we calculate the elastic moduli and the elastic and plastic collapse stresses for ideal two-dimensional <b>cellular</b> <b>materials.</b> The results (which we have experimentally verified) show that each of these properties depends on three parameters: a solid cell wall material property, a geometric constant, and the relative density of the <b>cellular</b> <b>material</b> raised to the power two or three.
