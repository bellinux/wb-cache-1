40|$|Warehouses are a {{substantial}} component of GDP {{and a significant}} contributor to speed and cost in supply chains. An analysis of a cross section <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> performance data would provide a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> technical efficiency, the factors contributing to efficiency and the best practices for improving efficiency.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the economic viability <b>of</b> the electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry introduction, as a step toward electronic warehouse receipts. Both forms <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipt paper and electronic exist in practice, but paper warehouse receipts are more widespread. In this paper, the dematerialization process is analyzed in two steps. The first step is the dematerialization <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry, with warehouse receipts still in paper form. The second step is the introduction <b>of</b> electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts themselves. Dematerialization <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipts is more complex than that for financial securities, because of the individual characteristics <b>of</b> each <b>warehouse</b> receipt. As a consequence, electronic warehouse receipts are in place for only to a handful of commodities, namely cotton and a few grains. Nevertheless, the movement towards the electronic warehouse receipt, which began several decades ago with financial securities, is now taking hold in the agricultural sector. In this paper is analyzed Serbian electronic registry, since the Serbia is first country in EU with electronic warehouse receipts registry donated by FAO. Performed analysis shows the considerable impact <b>of</b> electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts registry establishment on enhancing the security of the system <b>of</b> public <b>warehouses,</b> and on advancing the trade with warehouse receipt...|$|R

40|$|Warehouse {{management}} system (WMS) {{has been introduced}} and widely used to increase the competitiveness that provides better control on the warehouse operations since the last decade. However, most of the WMS do not support planning and monitoring the use <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources but only focus on managing the warehouse operations. The management <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources planning with incoming customer orders are solely relied on the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> experts. Decision making process becomes difficult to handle with complex orders. In this paper, a concept <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources management (WRM) is introduced to the typical WMS by extracting qualified order attributes from WMS for completing the operations with suitable resources. Through the use of rule-based reasoning (RBR) technique, the research objective is achieved to effectively fulfill the customer orders with appropriate resources, thereby achieving better customer satisfaction and increase the warehouse operation efficiency.

The interaction <b>of</b> production and <b>warehousing</b> is the topic most investigated in this category, but there is a significant gap in the relation <b>of</b> <b>warehouses</b> and external companies. Different types of contract (e.g., wholesale price, capacity reservation, performance-based contract) and contract mechanisms need to be explored with both qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify potential benefits and concerns. Integrated planning <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> operations with other departments and companies needs a suitable structure of information sharing. It is important to identify what information and when it should be shared, and how to structure interfaces between client and provider of outsourced services (e.g., contracting performance or activities).|$|R
