40|$|Abstract. The use of {{recycled}} natural latex rubber glove (NRL-G) as a reinforced material filled acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) was studied. The <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> different NRL-G <b>loading</b> (0, 10, 20 and 30 phr) were prepared by using two roll mills at room temperature. Two different size ranges of NRL-G such as 300 µm- 700 µm (fine) and 2 cm- 4 cm (coarser) were used. The properties such as cure characteristics, tensile and physical properties were determined. The NBR/NRL-G compound with the fine size of NRL-G exhibits overall good cure characteristics and physical properties compared with coarser size.

40|$|Novel drug {{delivery}} system has been introduced to overwhelm the drawback of fluctuating drug levels associated with conventional dosage forms. Out of various cellular carrier systems, erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC) {{have been the most}} widely investigated and found to possess great potential for the delivery of drugs and drug-loaded microspheres. These cellular carriers, having remarkable biocompatibility, biodegradability, and life-span in circulation, can be loaded by a wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> therapeutic value using different chemically, as well as physically, based methods. Most of the characteristics of the erythrocytes, including shape, membrane fragility, deformability, and hematologic indices undergo some degree of irreversible changes during the loading procedure. Carrier erythrocytes are prepared simply by collecting blood sample from the organism of interest, separating erythrocytes from plasma, then by using various physical and chemical methods the cells are broken. The drug is entrapped into the erythrocytes and finally resealing the resultant cellular carriers. Hence these carriers are suitably known as Resealed erythrocytes. Surface modification with glutaraldehyde, antibodies, carbohydrates like sialic acid and biotinylation <b>of</b> <b>loaded</b> erythrocytes (biotinylated erythrocytes) is possible to achieve various levels of targeting and increased circulation half-life. Upon reinjection the drug loaded erythrocytes serve as slow circulation depots, targets the drug to the reticuloendothelial system (RES), prevents degradation <b>of</b> <b>loaded</b> drug by endogenous chemicals, attain steady state concentration of drug and decrease the toxic-effects <b>of</b> <b>loaded</b> drug...|$|R

40|$|ON THE ORIGIN OF THE NOUN COMPOUNDS IN OLD PRUSSIAN Summary The article {{deals with}} the origin <b>of</b> the noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary and the Third Catechism.

The remaining <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary and the majority of those in the Third Catechism are loan translations from German. The noun <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary obviously tend to have simple base words. Except for a few questionable examples, there are no case compounds in the Elbing Vocabulary — all of them may be termed as stem compounds. However the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Third Catechism follow a clear trend of being comprised of underlying derivatives as well as having a case form for the first constituent. The German influence on the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Elbing Vocabulary is not very strong — it has impacted it only on the lexical level, while the <b>compounds</b> <b>of</b> the Third Catechism have also undergone more radical changes on the structural level.
