50|$|Nemapogon cloacella, the <b>cork</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of tineoid moth. It belongs to the fungus moth family (Tineidae), and therein to the {{subfamily}} Nemapogoninae. Its junior synonym N. infimella was established by G.H. Heydenreich in the 1851 volume of his Lepidopterorum Europaeorum Catalogus Methodicus, but many sources still attribute it to G.A.W. Herrich-Schäffer, who supposedly narrowly beat Heidenreich in (re)describing the species. But as it seems, Herrich-Schäffer was merely {{one of the first}} to use the name proposed by Heydenreich, as the volume of his Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa where he discussed the <b>cork</b> <b>moth</b> was not published until 1853 or 1854. That all nonwithstanding, the species had been already validly described by A.H. Haworth in the 1828 volume of Lepidoptera Britannica.|$|E
50|$|Larvae in {{association}} with humans will feed {{on a variety of}} dry organic material, such as dried fruit (e.g.bilberries, Vaccinium) and mushrooms, cereal and legume seeds, flour, Topinambur (Helianthus tuberosus) stalks, and even cork (e.g. corks of wine and champagne bottles) and the ergot fungus Claviceps purpurea. Further records have been claimed from Capsicum annuum fruit, poppyseed (Papaver somniferum), bitter almonds (Prunus amygdalus amara) and beeswax, {{but it is not clear}} if they refer to this species or the <b>cork</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|E
50|$|This small moth has a {{wingspan}} of 10-18 mm. The forewings are irregularly mottled black, {{white and}} grey, resembling congeners {{such as the}} <b>cork</b> <b>moth</b> (N. cloacella). They have a row of large black spoths on the leading edge, which merge with spots within the wing to form a rough band zigzagging {{along the length of}} the forewings. The hindwings are uniformly greyish-brown and surrounded by a fringe of long hairs. On the head, the adults have a tuft of yellowish-white hairs.|$|E
