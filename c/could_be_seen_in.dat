5|$|Many Dungeons & Dragons {{elements}} {{appear in}} hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing {{can be seen}} in improvisational theatre. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Glorantha's board games among others. Ultimately, however, Dungeons & Dragons represents a unique blending of these elements.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period Buddhism {{saw a small}} revival {{since its}} {{persecution}} during the Tang dynasty. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province. Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu, the Song temple at Mingshan in Anyue, Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes.|$|E
5|$|American musicians such as Juan Atkins, using names {{including}} Model 500, Infinity {{and as part}} of Cybotron, {{developed a}} style of electronic dance music influenced by synth-pop and funk that led to the emergence of Detroit techno in the mid-1980s. The continued influence of 1980s synth-pop <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> various incarnations of 1990s dance music including trance. Hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep have sampled 1980s synth-pop songs. Popular artists such as Rihanna, UK stars Jay Sean and Taio Cruz, as well as British pop star Lily Allen on her second album, have also embraced the genre.|$|E

5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Inglevert was {{captured}} by the Luftwaffe {{towards the end of}} the Battle of France. 1 Gruppe, Lehrgeschwader 2 moved in on 20 June, equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft. They departed for Jever, Germany, on 12 July, and were replaced by 1 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 51, also equipped with Bf 109s. From August until November Stab JG 51 were in occupation, and Aufklärungsgruppe 32(H) aircraft were also based at Saint-Inglevert during this period, with the unit operating Henschel Hs 126 parasol monoplanes. On 30 July 1940, Saint-Inglevert was bombed by the Royal Air Force, who claimed that hangars and aircraft were damaged, and a subsequent raid on 19 August resulted in a fire, smoke from which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Kent.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E

5|$|Tyche was a {{hypothetical}} gas giant proposed {{to be located}} in the Solar System's Oort cloud. It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. They argued that evidence of Tyche's existence <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a supposed bias in the points of origin for long-period comets. In 2013, Matese and Whitmire re-evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche, if it existed, would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche's characteristics, indicating that Tyche as hypothesized by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E

5|$|Other {{examples}} include Russborough, designed by Richard Cassels, an architect of German origin, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and Florence Court, County Fermanagh. Irish Palladian Country houses often feature robust Rococo plasterwork, frequently {{executed by the}} Lafranchini brothers, an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin {{was built in the}} 18th century that it set a Georgian stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin {{was one of the few}} cities where fine 18th-century housing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.|$|E

25|$|The same {{phenomenon}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> some coins from York in {{the tenth}} century where king is transliterated as CVNVNC but translated as KONUNGR (in English: KONUNGR). Old Norse in coin inscriptions ended after the tenth century.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, Henry Sutton {{developed}} a Telephane for closed circuit transmission of pictures via telegraph wires, {{based on the}} Nipkow spinning disk system, so that the Melbourne Cup <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Ballarat. Reports differ on whether the Telephane was successfully implemented.|$|E
25|$|By , World Series games <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> {{most of the}} country, but not all. 1950 also {{marked the}} first time that there was an {{exclusive}} network television broadcaster (NBC). As noted above, West Coast viewers finally saw live major league games on television during the 1951 postseason.|$|E
50|$|Lakeshores {{featured}} detached {{masses of}} rock of the Serpentine group. Granite in red, silver and gray were visible. Pyrite or fools gold <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> embedded <b>in</b> clay slate, particularly at Kettle Point.|$|R
30|$|This fact <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the {{perceived}} ease level. The mean value for ease was 2.6 {{on day one}} (SD: 0.5) which dropped to 2.3 (SD[*]=[*] 0.7) on the second day.|$|R

25|$|Priests' wives could {{nominally}} divorce {{their husbands}} {{in order to}} get jobs to support their families. Priests <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> rags in front of churches begging for alms and reportedly it could occur where priests had to mount the pulpit wearing their underclothes for lack of any other clothing that they owned.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{administered}} {{in a similar}} way as by the former German administrators, continuing policies such as ethnic identity cards. In 1959, moves towards independence <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the territory and agitation by PARMEHUTU, a Hutu political party, was evident. In 1960, the Rwandan Revolution occurred and Belgium changed the appointments of chiefs and vice-chiefs to promote Hutus into the posts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} between {{postponement}} and cancellation of Operation Sea Lion, {{the invasion of the}} UK, Germany developed some prototype prefabricated jetties with a similar purpose in mind. These <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Alderney, until they were demolished in 1978. The remaining foundations for the Alderney jetty formed an obstruction to the commercial quay extension project carried out in 2008-2009.|$|E
