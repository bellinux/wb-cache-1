40|$|Hydrogen and {{chemical}} heat pipes were proposed as methods of transporting energy from a {{primary energy source}} (nuclear, solar) to the user. In the <b>chemical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> system, primary energy is transformed into the energy of a reversible chemical reaction; the chemical species are then transmitted or stored until the energy is required. Analysis of thermochemical hydrogen schemes and <b>chemical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> systems on a second law efficiency or available work basis show that hydrogen is superior especially if the end use of the <b>chemical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is electrical power...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the production concept {{and efficiency of}} two new energy transmission and storage media intended to overcome the disadvantages of electricity as an overall energy carrier. These media are hydrogen produced by water-splitting and the <b>chemical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> Hydrogen can be transported or stored, and burned as energy is needed, forming only water and thus obviating pollution problems. The <b>chemical</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> envisions {{a system in which}} heat is stored as the heat of reaction in chemical species. The thermodynamic analysis of these two methods is discussed in terms of first-law and second-law efficiency. It is concluded that chemical heat pipes offer large advantages over thermochemical hydrogen generation schemes on a first-law efficiency basis except for the degradation of thermal energy in temperature thus providing a source of low-temperature (800 K) heat for process heat applications. On a second-law efficiency basis, hydrogen schemes are superior in that the amount of available work is greater as compared to chemical heat pipes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{heat flux}} {{increasing}} and cooling space decreasing in microelectronic and <b>chemical</b> products, micro <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> {{has become an}} ideal heat dissipation device in high heat-flux products. Through the analysis of its working principle, the factors that affect its heat transfer limits and the patterns in which copper powders are arrayed in circular cavity, this paper first established a mathematical model for the crucial factors in affecting heat transfer limits in a circular micro <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> with a sintered wick, i. e. a theoretical model for capillary limit, and then verified its validity through experimental investigations.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been}} investigated, {{developed}} and applied in many industrial fields since 1964. However, <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> technology {{is still a}} relatively new topic in high heat flux environments such as are encountered in the metallurgical and energy industries. This study focused {{on the development of}} a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that can be used under high heat flux conditions. The state of the technology prior to this study was that <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were not suitable for high heat flux applications. Even though numerous patents have been granted for <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and related applications, most are based on the basic concepts of the conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> as detailed in the literature. Researchers have found {{that there are a number}} of problems with these <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> when they are applied in high heat flux environments. Thus, it was a prime objective of this study to develop a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that is suitable for such high heat flux operations. In addition, some basic fundamental issues regarding the overall makeup of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were also investigated and explained. The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon can be a serious problem when a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is used under high heat flux conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> lose its ability for sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that was invented and studied eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this kind of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> a flow-modifier element was introduced into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> chamber to improve the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was dramatically better than a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> under a comparable high heat flux load. This novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> successfully combined the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and the loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and, thus, effectively overcame film boiling by collapsing the formed films. It was shown that the novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are suitable for high heat flux and high temperature operation where conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> will only function at a fraction of the heat load...|$|R

The tests have been conducted to compare the performance characteristics between conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> radiators for space nuclear power heat rejection systems. The fabric composite concept combines a strong ceramic fabric with a thin metal liner to form a very lightweight <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> tested have used identical, homogeneous fabric wicks and water as the working fluid. One fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has been constructed by fitting a braided aluminoborosilicate fabric tube over {{the outside of the}} conventional {{stainless steel}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A more advanced fabric composite design combines the woven fabric with a 0. 25 mm (10 mil) stainless steel tube as the liner, and reduces the mass of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> by a factor of three.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed, {{built and}} {{tested for the}} purpose of providing a thermal shunt between the two stages of a Gifford-McMahan (GM) cryocooler during cooldown. The nitrogen <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has an operating temperature range between 63 and 123 K. While the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is in the temperature range during the system cooldown, it acts as a thermal shunt {{between the first and second}} stage of the cryocooler. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the <b>heat</b> transfer to the first stage of the cryocooler, thereby reducing the cooldown time of the system. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> temperature drops below the triple point, the nitrogen working fluid freezes, effectively stopping the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operation. A small heat leak between cryocooler stages remains because of axial conduction along the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> wall.

50|$|Grooved wicks {{are used}} in {{spacecraft}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> {{as shown in the}} first photograph in this section. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are formed by extruding aluminum, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop.
