This paper overviewed the domestic and foreign CSOs current situation, and analysed the problems and deficiencies in the regulatory of CSOs in China. According to the characteristics of CSOs, we suggested that the regulatory of CSOs focus on the source, pipes and ends of the drainage system. The conclusion would be evidence for improving the <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> in China.

40|$|Deterring {{the waste}} in the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> and {{preventing}} water pollution during storm water events is the task of Combined Sewer Detention Tanks (CSDT). CSDTs are components of <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems,</b> the most-used sewerage-system in Germany. The aim is to realise an ecological en economical optimised dimension of CSDTs. A {{lack of knowledge of}} the hydrodynamic processes in these structures forces the planning engineer to apply more conceptional approaches in the simulation of pollutant transport In the frame of this thesis a detailed view into these processes could be realised. Experimental investigations were conducted on different synthetic materials simulating the waste. Subsequently the chosen material was examined concerning its sedimentational and erosional behaviour. Based on experiences with unsteady flow, the investigations on the chosen material at the CSDT were concentrated on an intransient and time dependent discharge simulating a real precipitation event in a laboratory scale model. The results of these laboratory studies are used to calibrate a three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model, which is adapted to the demands of this special kind of internal flow- and transport processes in a CSDT. The used approaches to simulate the transport phenomena are principally able to appreciate te efficiency of a CSDT. Internal processes can be simulated to supply the present method of dimensioning...|$|R
50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage <b>systems</b> connected to <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|R
40|$|A feed-forward, {{back-propagation}} Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{model has}} been used to forecast the occurrences of wastewater overflows in a <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> reticulation <b>system.</b> This approach was tested to evaluate its applicability as a method alternative to the common practice of developing a complete conceptual, mathematical hydrological-hydraulic model for the <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> to enable such forecasts. The ANN approach obviates the need for a-priori understanding and representation of the underlying hydrological hydraulic phenomena in mathematical terms but enables learning the characteristics of a sewer overflow from the historical data. The performance of the standard feed-forward, back-propagation of error algorithm was enhanced by a modified data normalizing technique that enabled the ANN model to extrapolate into the territory that was unseen by the training data. The algorithm and the data normalizing method are presented along with the ANN model output results that indicate a good accuracy in the forecasted sewer overflow rates. However, it was revealed that the accurate forecasting of the overflow rates are heavily dependent on the availability of a real-time flow monitoring at the overflow structure to provide antecedent flow rate data.

40|$|Integrated {{urban water}} system (IUWS) {{modeling}} aims at assessing {{the quality of}} the surface water receiving the urban emissions through sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and stormwater drainage systems. However, some micropollutants tend to appear in more than one environmental medium (air, water, sediment, soil, groundwater, etc.). In this work, a multimedia fate and transport model (MFTM) is 'wrapped around' a dynamic IUWS model for organic micropollutants to enable integrated environmental assessment. The combined model was tested on a hypothetical catchment using two scenarios: on the one hand a reference scenario with a <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> {{and on the other hand}} a stormwater infiltration pond scenario, as an example of a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS). A case for Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was simulated and resulted in reduced surface water concentrations for the latter scenario. However, the model also showed that this was at the expense of increased fluxes to air, groundwater and infiltration pond soil. The latter effects are generally not included in IUWS models, whereas MTFMs usually do not consider dynamic surface water concentrations,; hence the combined model approach provides a better basis for integrated environmental assessment of micropollutants’ fate in urban environments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{metabolic}} interaction between Paris and the Seine during the industrial era, 1790 – 1970, a period marked by strong population growth, technological changes, and the absence of specific legislation on environmental issues. The viewpoint focuses on exchanges of waters and wastes between city and river, quantifying them and tracing their evolution in the light of the strategies implemented by the stakeholders in charge. The study combines industrial ecology, local history and the history of technology. From 1790 to 1850, waste matters, and especially excreta, were considered as raw materials, not refuse: they generated real profits. The removal of human excreta aimed not only at improving urban hygiene, but at producing the fertilizers needed in rural areas. Discharging them into the river was out of the question. But after the 1860 s, several factors upset this exploitation, notably domestic water supply: night soil became more and more liquid, difficult to handle and to turn into fertilizer; once utilised, the water had to be removed from the house; at the same time, the sewerage system developed and had negative impacts on the river. Even so, Parisian engineers continued to process sewage using techniques that would not only ensure hygiene but also conciliate economic and agricultural interests: <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system</b> and sewage farms. Both of these early periods are thus noteworthy for a relative limitation of the river's deterioration by urban wastes. Not until the 1920 s, when domestic water supply had become the standard and excreta came to be considered as worthless waste, was the principle of valorisation abandoned. This led to important and long-lasting pollution of the Seine (despite the construction of a treatment plant), aggravating the industrial pollution that had been in evidence since the 1840 s. Analysing the priorities that led to the adoption of one principle or another in matters of urban hygiene and techniques, with the causes and consequences of such changes, enables us to understand the complex relations between Paris and the Seine. From raw material to waste matter, from river to drain, the concept of quality in environment remains the underlying theme...|$|E

Faecal {{indicator}} organism concentrations in sewage and treated effluents. Water Research, 42 (1 - 2), 442 - 454. The importance of faecal {{indicator organism}} (FIO) fluxes within drainage basins is increasing as the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive and the United States Clean Water Act place requirements on regulators to manage point and diffuse sources of microbial pollution causing non-compliance (EU) or impairment (US) of receiving waters. Central to this management task is {{knowledge of the}} likely FIO concentrations in raw sewage and treated effluents, but few empirical data {{have been published in}} the peer-reviewed literature. Accordingly, this paper presents results for 1933 samples from 162 different sewage discharge sites in the UK and Jersey, which encompass 12 types of sewage-related discharge, representative of untreated sewage and primary-, secondary- and tertiary-treated effluents. Geometric means (GMs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) have been used to characterise base- and high-flow FIO concentrations. The data sets and sub-sets are mostly quite large (ngreater-or-equal, slanted 40) and may therefore be applied with some confidence to comparable discharge sites in similar geographical regions. Very marked, statistically significant reductions in GM FIO concentrations result from secondary and tertiary treatment, and there are statistically significant differences between some secondary and some tertiary treatments. Flow conditions are also shown to be important: untreated sewage and effluent from primary treatment plant have lower concentrations at high flow, due to dilution within <b>combined</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems,</b> whereas some treated effluents (e. g. from activated sludge plant) have higher concentrations at high flow because of the shorter residence time within the plant. Under base-flow conditions, secondary treatments result in estimated GM FIO reductions of 95. 22 ? 99. 29 % (cf. primary-treated effluent). Corresponding figures for tertiary treatment plants (cf. secondary-treated effluent) are 93. 24 ? 96. 59 % for reedbed/grass plots and 99. 71 ? 99. 92 % for UV disinfection. Results suggest that secondary and tertiary treatment plants are less effective under high-flow conditions, but further high-flow sampling is required to confirm this. Peer reviewe...|$|R
