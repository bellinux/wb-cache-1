5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the <b>carriage</b> <b>frame</b> and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the <b>carriage</b> <b>frame,</b> is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

5000|$|... 00 {{models can}} be {{converted}} to work on EM or P4 by replacing or reprofiling wheels, fitting the correct width axles and moving the locomotive or <b>carriage</b> <b>frames</b> outward to suit. Modern products from Hornby, Bachmann UK and others have some element of springing in their suspension to aid this, and many aftermarket chassis kits exist from a variety of vendors such as high level kits, Comet, DJH, and others. Products intended for the more dedicated modeller are generally designed to be buildable to fit any of the three standards, though one side effect of underscale locomotive frames for 00 gauge is that the width between the frames is limited, which can limit the size of electric motor that may be fitted.|$|R

5000|$|Though seldom seen today, the Magirus company {{produced}} {{almost all}} of the early, movable ladders used in the construction of large, rigid airships in both the Germany and the United States. The multi-extension, wooden ladders were mounted on massively constructed, wooden <b>carriage</b> <b>frames</b> with a [...] "fifth-wheel" [...] style, forward axle assembly. Although it appeared to be designed for horses, the ladders could be easily moved by two men. The carriage was equipped with four, hand screw type [...] "outriggers" [...] that would resist the ladder from tipping. The ladder did not swivel on the carriage. It was elevated and extended only towards the front of the carriage. In the [...] "working" [...] position, the ladder had to be elevated to about an 80 degree angle in order to allow full extension to 85 feet. (I do not know what the maximum extended length of the largest wooden Magirus ladder was, but the ones used during the erection of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation's USS AKRON and USS MACON reached to 85 feet.) ...|$|R

40|$|Multiaxial {{stress states}} in many welded constructions like {{chemical}} plants, railway <b>carriages</b> and <b>frames</b> of trucks. Those stresses can have constant and changing principal stress directions, {{depending on the}} loading mode. Latest research results on welded steel joints show a loss of fatigue life for changing principal stress directions simulated by out-of-phase bending and torsion compared to constant directions given by in-phase loading. However, aluminium welds reveal no influence of changing principal directions on fatigue life compared to multiaxial loading with constant principal stress directions. This behaviour is not predictable by any conventional hypothesis. A hypothesis {{on the basis of}} local normal and shear stresses in the critical plane has been developed and applied to aluminium weldings...|$|R
