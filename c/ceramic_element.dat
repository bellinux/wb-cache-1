50|$|Normally, the {{lifetime}} of an unheated sensor is about 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). Heated sensor lifetime is typically 100,000 miles (160,000 km). Failure of an unheated sensor is usually caused by the buildup of soot on the <b>ceramic</b> <b>element,</b> which lengthens its response time and may cause total loss of ability to sense oxygen. For heated sensors, normal deposits are burned off during operation and failure occurs due to catalyst depletion. The probe then tends to report lean mixture, the ECU enriches the mixture, the exhaust gets rich with carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and the fuel economy worsens.|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} type of {{narrow-band}} lambda sensor has a <b>ceramic</b> <b>element</b> made of titania(It is also invented by NTK) (titanium dioxide). This type does not generate its own voltage, but changes its electrical resistance {{in response to the}} oxygen concentration. The resistance of the titania {{is a function of the}} oxygen partial pressure and the temperature. Therefore, some sensors are used with a gas temperature sensor to compensate for the resistance change due to temperature. The resistance value at any temperature is about 1/1000 the change in oxygen concentration. Luckily, at lambda = 1, there is a large change of oxygen, so the resistance change is typically 1000 times between rich and lean, depending on the temperature.|$|E

High flow pot filters, produced by increasing the rice husk content, had a higher initial flow rate (6 – 19 L h − 1), but initial LRVs for E. coli of high flow filters was slightly lower than for regular ceramic pot filters. This disadvantage was, however, only temporarily as the clogging in high flow filters had a positive effect on the LRV for E. coli (from below 1 to 2 – 3 after clogging). Therefore, it can be carefully concluded that regular ceramic pot filters perform better initially, but after clogging, the high flow filters have a higher flow rate as well as a higher LRV for E. coli. To improve the initial performance of new high flow filters, it is recommended to further utilize residence time of the water in the receptacle, since additional E. coli inactivation was observed during overnight storage. Although a relationship was observed between flow rate and LRV of MS 2 bacteriophages, both regular and high flow filters were unable to reach over 2 LRV. </p...|$|E

Two different classifiers, using artificial neural networks (supervised) and clustering (un-supervised) are supplied with features selected using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and their classification performance compared.

The materials coefficients are delineated as a function of temperature of the piezoelectric charge coefficients dij, relative permittivity r, electromechanical coupling factor kij and frequency constants Ni. One of the chapters also determines the piezoelectric charge constant d 33 of PZT ceramics by laser interferometer and compares it with the value measured by resonance methods. The surface displacement was measured by a single-beam interferometer Polytec OFV- 5000. The results of measurements of piezoelectric charge coefficients d 33 acquired by the first and the second method are identical.
