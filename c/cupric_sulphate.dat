50|$|Benedict's {{solution}} is a deep-blue solution {{used to test}} {{for the presence of}} the aldehyde functional group, - CHO. It is an aqueous alkaline mixture of CuSO4 and sodium citrate. Here sodium citrate is the complexing agent that keeps Cu2+ in solution, which would otherwise precipitate as cupric carbonate. The substance to be tested is heated up to 95 °C (for example, in a water bath) with Benedict's solution; formation of a brick-red precipitate indicates presence of the aldehyde group in relatively high concentrations. Since simple sugars (e.g., glucose) give a positive test, the {{solution is}} used to test for the presence of glucose in urine, a symptom of diabetes. One litre of Benedict's solution contains 173 grammes sodium citrate, 100 grammes sodium carbonate, and 17.3 grammes <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate.It reacts chemically similarly to Fehling's solution; the cupric ion (complexed with citrate ions) is reduced to cuprous ion by the aldehyde group (which is oxidised), and precipitates as cuprous oxide, Cu2O.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether a mechanism exists for bacterial oxidation of covellite (CuS) other than that involving cyclic reduction and oxidation of soluble iron, and to describe any such mechanism. It was thought likely that mechanisms of bacterial attack on CuS would also apply to other metal sulphides. High purity covellite was synthesized by the thermal reaction of sulphur and copper. Thiobacillus cultures were obtained from other workers and from the natural environment, and enriched for sulphide oxidizing capability. 	Oxygen consumption was monitored polarographically. Soluble copper, sulphate and total iron were assayed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry while ferrous ion was determind spectrophotometrically as a complex with orthophenanthroline. 	By rapid specific inhibition of biological activity during sulphide oxidation, the contribution of bacteria to the stoichiometry of oxidation was determined. At pH 2. 5 the product of either biological (Thiobaccillus ferrooxidans) or non-biological oxidation was CuSO 4, the biological rate exceeding the non-biological rate about a hundredfold. At pH 4. 5 T. thioparus was incapable of oxidizing CuS itself but catalysed attack by oxygen (about fivefold) by oxidizing a sulphur passivation film which formed by reaction of CuS with oxygen. The nett result was again CuSO 4 production. 	At pH 2. 5 three strains of T. ferrooxidans oxidized CuS itself without the aid of ferric ion; a fourth strain (BJR-V- 1) was completely dependent on ferric ion or dissolved oxygen to oxidize CuS to sulphur. 	In situations where dissolved oxygen initiated the oxidation of CuS, the oxidation rate was approximately first order with respect to dissolved oxygen, while zero order kinetics were observed when other mechanisms predominated. 	In dilution experiments designed to demonstrate the dependence of sulphide oxidation (to sulphate) on physical contact between bacteria and mineral surfaces, no dependence was observed. It was concluded that water soluble intermediate were involved in CuS oxidation by T. ferrooxidans and in sulphur transport to the cells of T. ferrooxidans and T. thioparus. Arguments were advanced suggesting that the intermediates were inorganic and the concentration of intermediates was estimated from experimental results and the theory if diffusion. 	The process of CuS passivation was studied; consumption of oxygen and acid, and production of <b>cupric</b> ion and <b>sulphate</b> were measured, the results indicating that passivation resulted from the accumulation of approximately 30 micromole of elemental sulphur per square metre of CuS. Oxygen consumed during depassivation by thiobacilli supported this conclusion. Assuming an even distribution of sulphur over the surface, the film was calculated to be one or two atoms thick. 	From consideration of {{the results of this study}} it was proposed that polythionates may be involved both in CuS oxidation by bacteria and in transport of sulphur into bacterial cells. 	The role of iron was investigated. Chemically synthesized ferric ion was less effective in CuS oxidation than was ferric ion produced by T. ferrooxidans strain BJR-V- 1 through oxidation of ferrous ion. 	The half saturation ferrous ion concentration with respect to oxidation by each of the T. ferrooxidans strains was approximately 10 - 5 molar, in contrast to values of 10 - 2 molar reported by others. Further ferrous oxidation kinetic experiments with strain BJR-V- 1 indicated that the major substrate for the rate limiting reaction in ferrous oxidation was a ferrous phosphate complex; a sulphate complex also played a part...|$|R

40|$|Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with chicken for fattening and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl up to the maximum authorised copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The powder form of copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised.

This thesis attempts to properly evaluate the interaction between ion exchange resins and heavy metals at trace metal concentrations. The durability of the resins and their effectiveness in real slurries were also investigated. In this study, a chelating resin, {{as well as a}} cation, and anion exchange resin was contacted with aqueous solutions of heavy metals in both free and complexed form. Zinc, nickel and copper cyanide complexes were adsorbed onto the anion exchange resin, while the chelating and cation exchange resins were contacted with zinc and nickel nitrates, and <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate.</b> All the tests were conducted in batch stirred tank reactors. All the metal cyanide complexes behaved in a similar manner when contacted with the anion exchange resins. These tests were p~rf 0 nned under variations in temperature, stirring speed, pH., ionic strength and. initial metal 90 E~entrations. Fitting of a dual resistance model to the profiles for thetlptllk:e" of the complexes, show that both film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion rates were improved with an increase in temperature, and that film diffusion rates improved with an increase in stirring speed. A high ionic strength negatively affected equilibrium loading as well as diffusional rates. It was found that at these low concentrations, the diffusional rates improves with a decrease in the external metal concentration. A comparative study involving the chelating and cation·exchange resins were performed, during which the resins were contacted with the metals in free fonn. It was found that at high metal concentrations, the chelating resin induced a rate limiting effect, but at trace concentrations, this effect is virtually negated. Whereas the cation exchange resin exhibited little selectivity in adsorbing the metals, {{it was found that the}} chelating resin prefers the metals in the eu > Ni > Zn. The chelating resin proved to be no less durable then the cation exchange resin, and both slightly lost their ability to adsorb the metal cations as a result of the effects of an inert coarse sand slurry. Tests performed with a real ore leachate, showed the cation exchange resin to be efficient at a low pH, but also relatively non selective, since the adsorption of copper from the leachate was greatly reduced due to the presence of other heavy metals...|$|E
40|$|Brannerite, ideally UTi 2 O 6 is a {{refractory}} uranium mineral {{found in}} many uranium and rare earth element ore deposits around the world, including many in Australia. As brannerite is refractory, ores containing brannerite require more intense leaching conditions than typical uranium ores. Brannerite {{is the most common}} refractory uranium mineral, and the most important uranium ore mineral after uraninite (UO 2) and coffinite (U(SiO 4) 1 -x(OH) 4 x). Several high-brannerite uranium deposits in Australia remain un-developed, despite being discovered as early as the 1950 s. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the leaching chemistry of brannerite in a variety of systems, starting with the conventional acidic ferric sulphate system and alternatives including the ferric chloride-hydrochloric acid system and the alkaline-carbonate system. The principal assumption is that an improved understanding of the leaching chemistry of brannerite will lead to more effective extraction processes, improving the extractions at existing mines, and enabling the development of new ones. Brannerite was found to undergo congruent dissolution in acid, contrary to the often-reported mechanism in which a titanium oxide coating forms on the surface. Phosphate released by gangue minerals such as apatite can cause the formation of this layer however. When leaching with acidic ferric solutions, sulphate media is superior to chloride media. Alkaline carbonate leaching was also found to be effective for brannerite leaching, albeit much slower than acid leaching. These same alkaline leaching conditions were applied to a sample of refractory uranium ore from Queensland high in acid soluble gangue and shown to be effective. These findings are discussed in detail below. A sample of brannerite from the Dieresis deposit in the Sierra Albarrana region of Spain was characterised in detail by XRD and SEM-EDX methods. The brannerite was found to be altered and metamict (rendered amorphous by self-irradiation), as is typical for brannerite. Many brannerite particles contained linear zones of titanium oxide surrounded by silicon enriched and uranium depleted brannerite, consistent with descriptions of naturally altered brannerite. These altered zones were more susceptible to leaching, regardless of the leaching conditions. All leached residues were analysed by the same methods to understand the changes taking place in the solid phase during leaching. This suggests that the extent of natural alteration influences the leachability of a particular brannerite. The leaching of brannerite was studied in acidic ferric sulphate media (0. 05 mol/L or 2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +) over a range of temperatures (25 - 96 °C) and acid concentrations (10 - 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) for five hours. Leached brannerite was pitted and corroded. The rate of leaching was strongly dependent on temperature and weakly dependent on acid concentration. At lower temperatures, brannerite dissolved incongruently in the early stages of leaching. At higher temperatures brannerite dissolved congruently for the entirety of the leaching experiment. The transition between these two mechanisms happened at lower temperatures when the acid concentration was higher. In the incongruent dissolution reaction, the activation energies for uranium and titanium release were 36 and 48 kJ/mol respectively. In the congruent dissolution process, the activation energy was 23 kJ/mol for both uranium and titanium dissolution. At high temperatures (> 75 °C) and low acid concentrations (< 25 g/L H 2 SO 4), the concentration of titanium dropped after the first hour of leaching and some secondary anatase (TiO 2) formed. This anatase was distinct from the anatase in the original material in that it contained iron and did not contain uranium, confirming that it formed during leaching. Ferric chloride and <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> lixiviants were studied over a similar range of temperatures and acid concentrations. As with the ferric sulphate leaching tests, the oxidising cation concentration was kept constant at 0. 05 mol/L. The leaching behaviour of brannerite in <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> media was quite similar to what was observed in ferric sulphate media; the rate of leaching was slightly lower than what was observed in ferric sulphate media under comparable conditions. In chloride media, the rate of leaching was slow compared to sulphate media at the same temperature and acid concentration. This suggests that the formation of stable uranium complexes is an important part of the dissolution process. Uranyl sulphate complexes are much stronger than uranyl chloride complexes. Certain leaching experiments were repeated with the addition of minerals commonly associated with brannerite to gain a clearer understanding of the effects of deleterious gangue. These experiments were run at the extremes and middle of the range of temperatures and acid concentrations studied. Ilmenite accelerated the precipitation of anatase while fluorite significantly increased the rate of uranium and titanium dissolution. Fluorapatite greatly reduced the rate of brannerite dissolution. These results showed a previously unknown interaction between phosphorus and titanium. Phosphate helped to initiate the formation of a titanium oxide coating on the leached brannerite, inhibiting the leaching reaction. Higher concentrations of sulphuric acid reduced these negative effects. Interestingly, phosphate improved the rate of leaching in chloride media, suggesting that chloride leaching may be a viable option when processing high-phosphate refractory uranium ores. Alkaline leaching may be an effective alternative processing option. While it is often reported that brannerite and similar minerals will not readily dissolve in alkaline media, leaching experiments with sodium carbonate based lixiviants showed that alkaline leaching of brannerite is possible. Compared with acid leaching, it is slow however. Uranium extractions of 83...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the technique and procedures {{used for the}} simultaneous determination of elements involved in Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis, applied to some geological samples as a sensitive and non-destructive tool. Using Isotopic Neutron Source, the delayed gamma-rays emitted due to neutron capture have been applied for {{the investigation of the}} elemental constituents and concentrations of major, minor and trace elements in such samples. The experimental investigations were carried out at the scale of researcher's practices at the chosen site by measuring soil/rock nutrient contents from hydrologically isolated farmland/site plots. Using detailed sampling procedures with special precautions, against contaminations, to yield meaningful results, soil/rock samples have been collected from selected areas of East Gojjam, pulverized, homogenized and prepared for irradiation. The samples were properly prepared together with known standards of potassium iodide or <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> or arsenic trioxide (one /or both at a time), and simultaneously irradiated in to isotopic neutron ux in the same irradiation position. After activation, the samples were subjected to gamma-ray spectrometry, using a high-purity germanium detection system and computerized multichannel analyzer. The gamma-ray spectra from the irradiated samples were measured by high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry with a calibrated germanium detector. Both qualitative and quantitative approach to data collection and analysis were used in order to gain insight into what should be acceptable to the community. The results obtained have a practical interest in view of possible applications to the technology of extraction and exploration of a variety of industrial, metallic, cement minerals, and geothermal energy and coal deposits. These results tend to agree with the lowest values reported in the literature, and the analytical precision is su cient for the determination of the standard deviation of the distribution of all elements in East Gojjam and these results were brie y discussed within the text of this research work. In carrying out the analysis, the best and most convenient method being the Instrumental and /non-destructive Neutron Activation Analysis was adopted, and NAA has matured and attained analytical competence providing not only rapid, quantitative, qualitative, simultaneous, multielement analysis but also crucial validation support to programmes using di erent analytical techniques. This method of analysis is generally multi-element and experimental conditions can be designed to be nondestructive to the sample, and it plays a leading role among analytical techniques in the eld of environmental research related to human, animal and plant health. Studies of di erent radionuclide and trace elements in the environmental samples are very important for health physics, research and education.

40|$|Nitrification {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the major barriers towards efficient chloramination in water supply distribution systems. Many water utilities employing monochloramine as the final disinfectant have been encountering unwanted microbiologically assisted choramine decay and find it difficult to maintain desired chloramine residual at distribution system extremities. A novel method of using <b>cupric</b> <b>sulphate</b> (< 0. 4 mg-Cu(II) /L) to inhibit ammonia oxidizing bacteria was recently granted a US patent (7465401). Efficient inhibition was achieved in bench scale work and a pilot reservoir in the field. However, unexpected dissolved Cu(II) loss occurred when copper salt was dosed into one pipe section of the Goldfield & Agricultural Water Supply System (G&AWSS) in Western Australia. It prevented dissolved copper from reaching extremities to protect chloramine from microbiologically assisted decay. Our previous research and evaluation of the pipe environment suggested that severe dissolved copper loss could be related to iron pipe corrosion due to aging of the cementlined steel pipe, extensive temperature fluctuation, chloramination and nitrification. A large amount of copper and iron found in sediments after the pipes’ flushing provided further evidence. Although scale formation could be a complicated process that depends on a variety of physical and chemical conditions and the composition of corrosion scale can be distinct in each particular system, based on the literature review, ferric hydroxide flocs are acknowledged {{as one of the}} major corrosion products. Consistent severe copper loss over the three-year trial indicated that iron pipe corrosion is continuously occurring in the distribution system and thus supplying fresh iron salts. Ferrous ions could be released from new crevices during the initial stage of corrosion and oxidized to ferric ions. Ferric ions are further converted to ferric hydroxide flocs under drinking ii water pH and oxidation conditions. Therefore, ferrous and ferric ions as well as ferric hydroxide were chosen as the major corrosion products in this research. Bearing the goal of improving the inhibition strategy, this research investigated aqueous copper speciation in bulk waters, quantified dissolved Cu(II) removal by the iron corrosion products at trace concentrations (< 2 mg-Fe/L) and modelled dissolved Cu(II) loss subject to iron pipe corrosion. Mundaring raw water (MRW), which is the source water of G&AWSS, was employed as the main water source in this study. In addition, the nitrified water (NW) which was sourced from our laboratory reactors and the water containing humic substance (HAW) were used to investigate the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) of different characters on the fate of dissolved copper. Batch experiments were undertaken to measure Cu(II) solubility under various aqueous conditions. MINEQL+® (chemical equilibrium modelling system) was used to analyse Cu(II) speciation and cross-examine aqueous Cu(II) concentrations measured in the laboratory experiments. Aqueous ferrous ions, ferric ions and ferric hydroxide flocs, which are believed to be representatives of iron corrosion products, were added at low concentrations to remove dissolved Cu(II) in various bulk water samples. Their ability to remove dissolved Cu(II) was assessed individually, then the theory that a two-stage corrosion process removes Cu(II) was developed. The impact of NOM character on Cu(II) -NOM chelation in bulk water and their subsequent removal by ferric salts were elucidated by means of apparent molecular weight distribution and differential absorption spectra analysis. Finally, the dynamic process of dissolved Cu(II) removal by ferric salts was investigated. Combining both equilibrium and dynamic studies of dissolved Cu(II) removal by ferric salts, a model was established to predict dissolved Cu(II) loss in a corroded iron pipe distribution system. Aquasim® was used for estimating parameters and simulating corrosion patterns and thus predicting Cu(II) loss in the field. Cu(II) -NOM complexes were found to be the dominant forms in MRW, NW and HAW. Cu(II) solubility varied slightly in these bulk waters due to different NOM characters. Generally, intermolecular dicarboxylate chelation was considered to be the dominating chelation type between Cu(II) and organic compounds in MRW and NW, while salicylate chelation was prevalent in HAW due to more salicylate type binding sites available in humic substances. The removal of dissolved Cu(II) was assumed to occur via a two-stage process during corrosion: Stage I-coagulation and aggregation by released ferrous/ferric ions; Stage II-adsorption by iron hydroxide flocs formed afterwards. Both ferrous/ferric ions and ferric hydroxide flocs showed considerable capacity to remove dissolved Cu(II). Addition of 2 mg-Fe/L ferric ions was sufficient to remove the majority of dissolved Cu(II) in MRW and NW. The dissolved Cu(II) removal by Fe(OH) 3 flocs in MRW and NW could be explained as multilayer adsorption obeying a Freundlich isotherm. In addition, the adsorption process could be interfered with by the presence of heterogeneous Cu(II) -containing particles (CuO and Cu(OH) 2), which rendered less dissolved Cu(II) removal. Cu(II) -NOM in HAW demonstrated a relatively high resistance to removal by ferric salts. From these observations, Cu(II) was thought to preferentially complex with small organic molecules until saturation is reached. Slightly higher Cu(II) solubility and less dissolved Cu(II) removal observed in NW indicated that a proportion of small soluble organic substances was probably produced and chelated with Cu(II) during nitrification. In humic acid water (HAW), Cu(II) bound with small MW organic matter could be shielded by a relatively high proportion of large MW organic matter. The dynamic process of dissolved Cu(II) removal by Fe(OH) 3 flocs can be described by Pseudo second order decay. From the comparison of dissolved Cu(II) loss between the modelling results and field data, the loss of dissolved Cu(II) could be due to removal by iron corrosion products and modelled by a reasonable assumption of the iron corrosion situation in the distribution system. At the end, Cu(II) -based inhibition and chloramination strategies are recommended...|$|E
