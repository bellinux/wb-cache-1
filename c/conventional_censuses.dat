There is thus a pressing need to understand better the detailed relationship between population characteristics as recorded in such systems and <b>conventional</b> <b>censuses.</b> This paper explores these issues using the unique Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS). It takes the 2001 Census enumeration as a benchmark and analyses the social, demographic and spatial patterns of mismatch with the health register at individual level. Descriptive comparison is followed by multivariate and multilevel analyses which show that approximately 25 % of individuals are reported to be in different addresses and that age, rurality, education, and housing type are all important factors. This level of mismatch appears to be maintained over time, as earlier migrants who update their address details are replaced by others who have not yet done so. In some cases, apparent mismatches seem likely to reflect complex multi-address living arrangements rather than data error...|$|E

More detailed data, including spatial products such as boundaries for output areas, postcode lookup tables and an entirely new geography of workplace zones will be released in phases through the winter and during 2013, along with API access to area-based statistics. The census spatial datasets provide a widely-used infrastructure for the presentation and analysis of population data, including much non-census information. Even as the results continue to be published, there is a strong possibility that 2011 will be the last <b>conventional</b> <b>census,</b> with a variety of alternative collection strategies and linked data sources currently under review by the Office for National Statistics under the banner of “Beyond 2011 ”.

However, census geographic units are often unsuited to health-related research, especially in rural areas where development is clustered and discontinuous. Objective: We evaluated the accuracy of both standard census methods and alternative GIS-based methods to measure rural density. Methods: We compared residential density (units/acre) in 335 Vermont school neighborhoods using <b>conventional</b> <b>census</b> geographic units (tract, block group and block) with two GIS buffer measures: a 1 -kilometer (km) circle around the school and a 1 -km circle intersected with a 100 -meter (m) road-network buffer. The accuracy of each method was validated against the actual residential density for each neighborhood based on the Vermont e 911 database, which provides an exact geo-location for all residential structures in the state. Results: Standard census measures underestimate residential density in rural areas. In addition, the degree of error is inconsistent so even the relative rank of neighborhood densities varies across census measures. Census measures explain only 61 % to 66 % {{of the variation in}} actual residential density. In contrast, GIS buffer measures explain approximately 90 % of the variation.

Conclusion Residential density based on census units can mask clusters of development in rural areas and distort associations between residential density and health-related behaviors and outcomes. GIS-defined buffers, including a 1 -km circle and a road-network buffer, can be used in conjunction with census data to obtain a more accurate measure of residential density. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{fundamental}} issues surrounding research on Zipf's law regarding city sizes are whether and why this law holds. This paper does {{not deal with}} the latter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf's law holds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly relied on <b>conventional</b> <b>census</b> data such as populations, and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt naturally (in terms of data speaks for itself) delineated cities, or natural cities, to be more precise, {{in order to examine}} Zipf's law. We find that Zipf's law holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and remains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time instants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf's law is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is mainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a static view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is that Zipf's law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in order to observe it. We further find Zipf's law applied to city numbers; the number of cities in the first largest country is twice as many as that in the second largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest country, and so on. These findings have profound implications for big data and the science of cities.

40|$|The Sundarbans is a Tiger Conservation Landscape {{of global}} {{priority}} that supports {{one of the}} most important tiger populations across their current range. In Bangladesh, Sundarbans is the last stronghold of the critically endangered tiger, therefore conserving this flagship species will help to ensure the long-term future of the Sundarbans which has been providing significant economic and ecosystem services to human communities for centuries. However, scientific information is lacking on many aspects of the Sundarbans tigers, including population and genetic status, and detailed patterns of tiger and prey poaching. The objectives of this study were therefore to improve the knowledge base to help design better management strategies for long-term persistence of the Sundarbans tigers. As a consequence of challenges faced in applying <b>conventional</b> <b>census</b> methods in the Sundarbans mangrove habitat, a non-invasive genetic approach was applied to collect samples that were then screened using polymorphic microsatellite markers to estimate density and population size of tigers within the spatially explicit capture-recapture model. DNA analyses provided reasonable population estimates, indicating that a non-invasive genetic approach is a viable method for monitoring tigers and can be applied to monitor tiger populations elsewhere. Bayesian and Maximum likelihood inferences using mitochondrial DNA sequences supported a polyphyletic relationship between tiger population in the Sundarbans and the populations in central India. Together, microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed a signal of fine-scale genetic structure and significant genetic differentiation on a spatial scale which is probably the consequence of limited tiger dispersal due to the presence of wide rivers in the Sundarbans landscape. Systematic field survey across sample areas detected a range of snaring methods used to catch tiger prey and evidence of killing tigers by poisoning prey carcasses with the Carbofuran pesticide. Spatial analysis showed that poachers selected sites that tended to be further away from guard posts, and close to river banks. Based on these results, a range of future management interventions were recommended including the reduction of water-based commercial and resource collection activities to allow tiger dispersal, and regulation of Carbofuran and snare materials to better tackle tiger and prey poaching in the Sundarbans...|$|R

Migration topics remain closely connected with the territory of former Yugoslavia. Slovenia was and still is the destination country for numerous people from the territory of former Yugoslavia. The share of residents of Slovenia with countries of birth from the territory of former Yugoslavia among all foreign-born residents was 88.9% at the 2002 Census and on 1 January 2011 despite new migration flows from EU Member States and from non-European countries still 86.7%. http://www.stat.si/eng/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=4430 ...|$|R
40|$|For {{disaster}} risk management and risk-based urban planning, time-dependent knowledge on the {{spatial distribution of}} various social groups is of critical importance. However, in a highly dynamic urbanizing world data are mostly outdated, generalized, not area-wide, not reliable or even not existing. This paper explores the potential of interdisciplinary integration of social science and remote sensing {{to deal with the}} problem of area-wide and up-to-date information derivation of the spatial distribution of population, and especially the vulnerable groups. The integration of <b>conventional</b> socio-economic data (<b>census</b> and household survey data) with the structural information of the urban landscape extracted from remotely sensed data aims at assessing dynamic exposure of various social groups. The analysis was done for the case study in the tsunami and earthquake prone coastal city of Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The information generated is particularly useful for giving an additional insight for urban planners, how land use and urban development shape the exposure of various social groups to natural hazards. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the great}} {{awareness}} of the growing need for information on population dynamics, a comprehensive study of demography in Nigeria with particular reference to population census and projection is a desirable venture. Existing sources of demographic data in Nigeria is restricted to census, surveys, and special inquires. There are no national systems of registration of vital events at the levels of completeness sufficient to provide useful demographic information. The time taken to summarize, analyze, and publish census results are usually very long. This observable problem {{can be associated with}} the <b>conventional</b> approach to <b>census</b> collection taken in Nigeria. In this study, an attempt is made to design a framework for a distributed database system for population census collection in Nigeria. This framework includes a model for the analysis of demographic parameters of respondents in a study area. Basically, the demographic parameter or population variables are: relation to head of household, sex, age, disability, home local government area, home place, address, literacy, educational qualifications, work status, type of employment, sector of employment, marital status, and statistics of marriage.

50|$|Ethiopia's {{estimated}} {{livestock population}} {{is often said}} to be the largest in Africa. It is estimated to number over 150 million in 2007/2008. Excluding the Afar and Somali Regions, there were approximately 47.5 million cattle, 26.1 million sheep, 21.7 million goats, 2.1 million horses and mules, 5.6 million donkeys, 1 million camels, and 39.6 million poultry. For the later two Regions, estimated numbers vary greatly between <b>conventional</b> and aerial <b>censuses,</b> but total less than 15% of the non-nomadic Regions. Though the raising of livestock always has been largely a subsistence activity, intensive, factory farm facilities are gaining in popularity and are present in Addis Ababa and Debre Zeit, run by Ethiopian agribusiness ELFORA. Ethiopia has great potential for increased livestock production, both for local use and for export. However, expansion was constrained by inadequate nutrition, disease, a lack of support services such as extension services, insufficient data with which to plan improved services, and inadequate information on how to improve animal breeding, marketing, and processing. The high concentration of animals in the highlands, together with the fact that cattle are often kept for status, reduces the economic potential of Ethiopian livestock.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen badgers and 20 foxes were radio-tracked in the Wytham Estate, Oxfordshire, between 1981 and 1983. Thirteen badger and 10 fox {{groups were}} {{identified}} from radio-tracking and bait marking. Badger groups (mean size 1982 : 4. 45, 1983 : 5. 82) occupied contiguous territories (size: 22 - 75 ha) with boundaries marked by latrines. Seasonal variation in marking intensity and choice of marking sites presumably were responses to changing intrusion pressure. Fox groups (mean size: 2. 6) occupied stable territories (size: 22 - 104 ha) with little overlap. Faeces deposition by foxes facilitated territory marking. Earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) dominated the diet of badgers (63 % estimated dry weight EDW, faeces), followed by cereals, fruits and other Invertebrates. Diet was highly variable between groups and seasons. For foxes, lagomorphs (20 % EDW) and earthworms (33 % EDW) {{were the most}} important prey, followed by scavenge and fruits. Variation in diet between groups and seasons was marked in lagomorphs but not earthworms. Multlvarlate analyses of habitat parameters revealed a low-dimensional 'resource space' that could be divided into <b>conventional</b> habitat categories. <b>Censuses</b> of prey species indicated that resource presence varied consistently between habitat categories. Key habitats occurred at fairly constant proportions in territories of both species) their dispersion partly determined the configuration of territory boundaries. The proportions of specific habitats per territory were correlated with the proportions of certain prey items in diets. space use by individuals was analysed by spatial autocorrelation methods, variation in space use by foxes was attributed to variation in resource dispersion. In contrast, individual badgers were similar in their use of space. Here, small-scale heterogeneity in intensity of use may reflect local earthworm availability, in one studied fox group, males and females differed in range use. Individuals in one studied badger group coordinated their use of space probably to minimize foraging interference. It is suggested that group living in Wytham badgers is a response to defending resources, and a model is proposed to explain how the spatial and social organisation of male and female badgers relate to the characteristics of the resources they require. </p...|$|R
