5000|$|<b>Constructive</b> <b>possession</b> is an {{important}} concept in both the criminal law regarding theft and embezzlement, and the civil law regarding possession of land and chattels.

5000|$|<b>Constructive</b> <b>possession</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} concept in cases of seizure of goods by private or government authorities. Take, for example, a large piece of equipment. Should money be lent against the value of the equipment, and the loan goes into default, the creditor may find it difficult to actually remove the equipment in a timely manner. However, it may by notice to the borrower take <b>constructive</b> <b>possession,</b> which effectively prevents the borrower from further using the equipment pending its removal. Similarly, when a landlord exercises a contractual remedy of distraint of goods for unpaid rent, the landlord need not remove the goods from the premises, but may take <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of the goods through a simple declaration. At that point, if the tenant attempted to remove them, the tenant would be guilty of theft.|$|E

50|$|Larceny is a {{crime against}} possession. Furthermore, it has two {{elements}} which must be met, the actual taking of the property, even if momentarily (actus reus) and the culpable intent to deprive another of their property (mens rea). Larceny involves the trespassory taking of property from possession of another, {{with the intent to}} permanently deprive the owner of that property. To understand larceny, one must understand the distinction between custody and possession. A person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property (actual possession) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property (<b>constructive</b> <b>possession).</b> A person has custody if he has actual physical control of the property but the person who has <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> has substantially restricted the custodian's right to use the property. Examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant, or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment. This is to be contested to, for example, a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud.|$|E

50|$|Property, in {{the first}} instance, is a thing-in-itself. When a person finds a thing and takes that thing into that person's {{possession}} and control, then that thing becomes a thing-for-you for that person. Once the person has that thing in that person's possession, that thing becomes that person's property by reason of discovery and conquest, and that person has the individual right to defend that property (property interest) against all others by reason of self-help. Typically, persons join {{together to form a}} political state which may develop a formal legal system which enforces and protects property rights so that the individual can go to court to get protection and enforcement of that person's property rights, rather than having to use self-help. It is possible that when a person has <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of personal property, but another person has actual possession, then the person having <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> has bare legal title, while the other person has actual possession. Generally, the ground and any buildings which are permanently attached are considered real property, while movable goods and intangibles such as a copyright are considered personal property. Also, property cannot be considered a reified concept, because {{in the first}} instance, property is very concrete as a physical thing-in-itself.|$|E

The court was of opinion that, on all the facts of the case, the latter was the true construction of the transaction between the parties. Respondent defended against complainant's claim to redeem by setting up that the alleged mortgage was an absolute conveyance.

50|$|The judges {{all agreed}} that {{the actions of the}} carrier {{constituted}} larceny but they could not agree on a rationale. The prevailing reason was provided by Lord Chokke who concluded that the carrier had lawful possession of the bales only. The merchant retained <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of the contents. Therefore, when the carrier broke open the bales and removed the contents, he committed the crime of larceny because he had taken the contents from the possession of the merchant. The merchant had a royal safe conduct covering his goods. The merchant argued that this protection meant that even if his goods were stolen, as the court had determined, they would not be forfeited to the King as waif. The court agreed with the merchant on this second point and the Sheriff was required to return the goods to the merchant. Despite the fact that the carrier had temporary possession of the goods with permission of the merchant, he had 'broken bulk', i.e., he had broken up the bales and then sold them. The fact that he broke bulk shows the intention to commit larceny. He was therefore guilty and hence the goods were forfeited to the king. However, due to the royal safe conduct that the merchant had, he got his goods back anyway.|$|E
40|$|Sometimes a {{constitutional}} right to do a particular thing is accompanied by a right not to do that thing. The First Amendment, for example, guarantees both the right to speak and the right not to speak. This Article asks whether the Second Amendment should likewise be read to encompass both the right to keep or bear arms for self-defense and the inverse right to protect oneself by avoiding them, and what practical implications, if any, the latter right would have. The Article concludes - albeit with some important qualifications - that a right not to keep or bear arms is implied by what the Supreme Court has called the “core” and “central component” of the Second Amendment: self-defense, especially in the home. Recognizing such a right might call into question the constitutionality of the growing number of “antigun control” laws that make it difficult or illegal for private individuals to avoid having guns in their actual or <b>constructive</b> <b>possession...</b>|$|E

It is not {{within the scope of}} this dissertation to discuss all types of securities, rather attention is merely drawn to the securities that are specified in the Circulars of the Central Bank of Sudan. This dissertation is divided into Fives Chapters: Chapter one is concerned with the Proprietary Securities.

Chapter Two addresses the Possessory Securities and discusses the manners whereby the banks can take <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> over the goods rather than taking actual possession i. e. the classic pledge. Chapter Three is about Choses in Action. It deals exclusively with the company stocks, shares and bank balances according to the Circulars of Central Bank of Sudan.

40|$|Abstract. For {{financing}} {{consumer durables}} like houses, cars or computers, conventional banks use {{what are called}} the equated monthly installment (EMI) models. EMI is the fixed payment a borrower makes to a lender to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan amount is cleared in full. Islamic banks have followed the practice using EMI on diminishing musharakah partnership basis. The model is popularly known as the MMP, an abbreviation of its Arabic nomenclature. The defining character of this model is increasing amortization of capital through a customer buy back provision in the agreement. We have shown more than once that models of the sort invariably involve compounding of return on capital and pass the ownership of property to the client at a slower rate than the rate of capital amortization until the contract is concluded.   This paper provides additional evidence and documentation to reiterate that the MMP exhibits the same characteristics and is not, therefore, Shari’ah compliant. We propose an alternative model free of the indicated blemishes, having additional advantages as well. Keywords.

40|$|The concept “right of control” {{virtually}} {{has been}} widely used in other transport modes than carriage of goods by sea. It has been regulated, for example, in Warsaw and Montreal convention on air transportation, COTIF-CIM convention on rail transportation and CMR convention on road transportation, whereas this subject has never been dealt with in maritime conventions. Features of the modes results {{in the development of}} the documentary rules applicable for the transport documents towards various directions. Compared with other transport practice, goods carried by sea are often resold many times before its arrival at the destination. In order to carter for this characteristic of maritime transport, a bill of lading system has been developed which helps the traders to transfer the property rights in goods. A traditional bill of lading representing the goods then gives a <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of the goods to its holder. By presenting the bill to the carrier, the holder can demand delivery of goods from the latter. The transfer of the bill means the transfer of the <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of goods. Thus who has the possession of the bill actually has the control of the goods. With the overwhelming improvement of the shipping industry and consequent shortening of the time used for each voyage, the use of bills of lading in many trades is rapidly decreasing or has entirely disappeared. Instead sea waybills or other non-negotiable transport documents are more and more appreciate especially where there is no requirement for financing security. Besides, the multimodal transport documents used in the container logistic and multimodal transport can hardly fit in with the concept of traditional bill of lading so as to provide a document of title function, which means a document relating to goods the transfer of which operate as a transfer of the <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of the goods, and may operate as a transfer of the property in them. Furthermore, e-commerce systems have also a swift tendency with utilization in the maritime transport. The characteristics of these transport documents distinguish from each other (e. g. negotiable or non-negotiable, documentary or electronic), yet they are endowed with (or at least related with), by agreement or by statute, one common and significant feature—the control of goods. Normally the control of goods in transit includes: (a) The right to give or modify instructions in respect of the goods that do not constitute a variation of the contract of carriage; (b) The right to demand delivery of the goods before their arrival at the place of destination; and (c) The right to replace the consignee by any other person. Although there are rules peculiar to the use of certain transport document, the aspect of right of control, which is given by the document to the parties interested in the contract of carriage, has not been paid much attention on in the maritime law context. There are no uniform rules on this subject on an international scale. Consequently, practices on this point diverge very much in different jurisdictions. Furthermore, the existent rules on right of control for certain documents often cannot provide clear guidance on problems associated with the distribution of right of control and the liability of the carrier in relation to the execution of instruction of the party who has the right of control. Cases in this respect can be found in both England and China. Take the sea waybill for instance, one of the merit of sea waybill that the shipper can, at any time before delivery, direct the carrier to deliver the goods to a person other than the named consignee. The carrier would, prima facie, be obliged to comply with this order since normally the contract would be construed as one to deliver to the named consignee or to such other person as the shipper might direct. There is then a conflict which needs to be resolved. On the one hand, the shipper wishes to retain his rights of disposal at any time before delivery. On the other hand, the named consignee wants delivery made to him in accordance with the carrier’s undertaking. The carrier will not wish to resolve the conflict in favor of either in case he is liable to the other. Neither the existing conventions on carriage by air, road and rail provide clear guidance on this problem, nor do the CMI rules. The above reasons constitute the primary rationale for the thesis, ‘‘Right of Control’’. Upon the call for a comprehensive solution on the subject ‘‘right of control’’, the recent UNCITRAL draft convention on transport law has provided a set of brand new rules for this subject. Chapter 11 concerns the concept of right of control and the transfer of the rights. Can it provide a proper normative predictability for all the traders interested in a contract of carriage? Can it provide sufficient guidance for the problems which already exist? Does it facilitate a fair weighting of the diverse interests involved? Is it sufficiently clear? Is it applied consistently? Are there significant gaps? Can it fit in with the future documentary development? All these factors underline the need for this thesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{everyday}} life both {{adults and children}} {{are faced with the}} problem of judging who owns an object. Past research has indicated that adults and children may base their decisions on who was seen possessing an object first (the first possessor bias) or the person with whom an initial visual association was created [...] The current thesis aimed to investigate this, and ascertain whether children and adults maintain their bias to choose the first possessor of an object as its owner when other competing information regarding ownership is available. Chapters 2 and 3 used between subjects factorial designs in which adults (aged 18 - 60) and children (aged 3 - 4 years) viewed a number of stories of characters possessing objects in a variety of different scenarios. After viewing each story participants were required to judge which character owned the object. Results showed that when adults and children had no information, other than who possessed an object first, they chose the first possessor as the owner of the object. However when other competing information, such as the gender or age stereotype of the object, or who had <b>constructive</b> <b>possession</b> of the object, was available both adults and children disregarded their first possessor bias and made decisions in line with this other information. Chapter 4 used a between subjects factorial design and a mixed factorial design. The aim of the experiments was to ascertain whether adults and children take the history of an object into account when deciding who owns an object. Adults (aged 18 - 60) and children (aged 3 – 4 years) were shown stories in which one character wore and object and another character held an object. Information was given to help participants infer the history of each of the objects in the stories. Following each story participants were asked to judge who owned the object. Results demonstrated that both adults and children take the history of an object into account in their ownership decisions, and privilege this information above other competing information such as visual association, but that adults do this more reliably than children. All the experiments in this thesis demonstrated that when there is no other information available both adults and children base their decisions on who was seen possessing an object first. However when other information is available both adults and children take this into account in their decisions. Adults and children may use the information in order to reconstruct the history of an object to ascertain who had contact with it in the past and therefore who may have a legitimate claim of ownership over it...|$|E
40|$|In general derivatives, futures, {{options and}} swaps are {{considered}} against {{the principles of}} shari‘ah for various reasons, such as the absence of asset-backed deals, dealing in prohibited transaction of debt, presence of element of gharar (uncertainty), gambling, absence or non-existence of subject matter, Short-Selling, sale of subject-matter without prior acquiring of possession or <b>constructive</b> <b>possession,</b> ghabn (market price manipulation), ‘ina (sale and buy-back), tawarruq (multiple buy-back sales involving no actual asset transfer), amongst others. In the recent past there have been attempts to find and explore Islamic hedging products having same functions as that of derivatives having link with real economy growth. Financial transactions either linked with economic activities or they are pure financial instruments known as ‘synthetic’ transactions having no contribution to the real economy. Due to Muslim investors’ demand and excess saving due to oil wealth in the Gulf Cooperation Council, there is a demand for Islamic financial transactions. Therefore, derivatives in compliance with shari‘ah principles were developed. Sukuk are fine and popular example of such financial products and emerged as a strong substitute to conventional derivative products. Sukuk are considered shari‘ah compliant {{but at the same}} time ethical and hence fits into the requirements of financial products to overcome the adverse effects of the financial crisis. This research, hence, explores and analyses sukuk as an Islamic securitization product. In addition, this research also investigates whether or not sukuk meet the standards and criteria of conventional securitization structures in order to safeguard the interests of different parties involved in it and the public at large. Furthermore, this research examines sukuk structures whereby it identifies further shari‘ah and ethical underlying principles for further product development, design under shari‘ah. In responding to the research aims, this research attempted to peruse through original sources of both shari‘ah and English Common law on sukuk and the application of wa‘ad (undertaking) particularly in the context of sukuk and derivatives. While discussing the identified research aims in terms of determining the key legal, regulatory and shari‘ah compliance issues in the development of sukuk, the focus remained on the United Kingdom (UK), which attempts to become one of the leading centers of Islamic finance. After foundational and exploratory research, this study concludes and answered the research questions that: (i) sukuk are based on shari‘ah principles; (ii), derivatives are allowed under shari‘ah; (iii) sukuk as Islamic derivative instruments are as efficient as that of conventional derivative products and apply the similar securitization principles; (iv) wa‘ad has the same authority as that of ‘aqd (contract) and can be compared with ‘promise’ and ‘promissory estoppel’ in Common law; (v) use of wa‘ad in equity-based sukuk is against the shari‘ah; (vi) usage of wa‘ad in derivatives like Foreign Currency Forward Options, Total Return Swaps and Short-Selling is inappropriate, and (vii) UK is an attractive country for promotion and growth of sukuk. For this purpose the results of the sub-research questions were: (a) UK has sufficient legislative and regulative infrastructure to entertain shari‘ah compliant products such as sukuk in the future (b) UK so far is impartial in the debate on shari‘ah compliance approval process of products (c) there is confusion about whether sukuk are categorised as debt instruments or Collective Investment Schemes. This study came with an extensive research and analysed growth of sukuk and its structures in UK with legislative and regulatory developments and concludes UK is a place where development of sukuk is phenomenal for the strategic significance of London Stock Exchange in the global market. Though not many sukuk are being issued in UK but it is a place where most of the sukuk are listed. ...|$|E
