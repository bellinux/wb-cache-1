40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} accreditation surveyors’ and hospitals’ use and perceived usefulness of clinical indicator reports and the potential to establish the <b>control</b> <b>relationship</b> between the accreditation and reporting systems. The <b>control</b> <b>relationship</b> refers to instructional directives, arising from appropriately designed methods and efforts towards using clinical indicators, which provide a directed moderating, balancing and best outcome for the connected systems. Design. Web-based questionnaire survey. Setting. Australian Council on Healthcare Standards’(ACHS) accreditation and clinical indicator programmes. Results. Seventy-three of 306 surveyors responded. Half used the reports always/most of the time. Five key messages were revealed: (i) report use was related to availability before on-site investigation; (ii) report use was associated with the use of non-ACHS reports; (iii) a clinical indicator set's perceived usefulness was associated with its reporting volume across hospitals; (iv) simpler measures and visual summaries in reports were rated the most useful; (v) reports were deemed to be suitable for the quality and safety objectives of the key groups of interested parties (hospitals’ senior executive and management officers, clinicians, quality managers and surveyors). Conclusions. Implementing the <b>control</b> <b>relationship</b> between the reporting and accreditation systems is a promising expectation. Redesigning processes to ensure reports are available in pre-survey packages and refined education of surveyors and hospitals on how to better utilize the reports will support the relationship. Additional studies on the systems’ theory-based model of the accreditation and reporting system are warranted to establish the <b>control</b> <b>relationship,</b> building integrated system-wide relationships with sustainable and improved outcomes...|$|E
30|$|Magnusson (2002) {{described}} another {{experiment that}} related selection and rejection controls and eye movements. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare eye movements during the training of selection and rejection control conditional relationships based on the procedure used by Johnson and Sidman (1993). Eye movements were defined by the frequency with which participants observed one of the comparison stimuli. Duration of observation was not considered. Participants observed S- more frequently than S+ when establishing a rejection <b>control</b> <b>relationship,</b> but observed S+ more frequently than S- when establishing a selection <b>control</b> <b>relationship.</b> Thus, this experiment demonstrated that particular relationship to be learned can modulate the frequency of stimuli observations. The relationship between the duration of eye fixation and the establishment of controls, however, has not yet been systematically investigated.|$|E

30|$|However, the low {{variability}} {{we observed}} in performance does not exclude {{the possibility of}} a relationship between the duration of eye fixation and the establishment of controlling by selection or rejection. For example, in terms of duration of eye fixation, it would be important to know whether other participants exhibiting a different pattern than that {{of the participants in the}} present experiment would achieve a high percentage of correct responses in probes evaluating select and reject <b>control</b> <b>relationships.</b> In a similar way, it would be important to know whether participants who performed poorly on tests would exhibit a pattern of eye fixation different from that of the present experiment. These questions require future studies in which experimental manipulations generate differential patterns of select and reject <b>controlling</b> <b>relationships</b> (for example, as suggested by Johnson and Sidman 1993) in order to assess whether such variability is related to patterns of eye fixation.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} extend {{understanding}} of how being responsible and accountable for performance impacts on control processes between organisations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses empirical findings gathered from officers of two local education authorities about their <b>control</b> <b>relationships</b> with schools. It provides a Habermasian theoretically informed analysis of these <b>control</b> <b>relationships.</b> <b>Control</b> is studied as the steering processes that occur between organisations in response to regulation from government. Findings – The LEA officers employ the language of influence to conceal ongoing direct forms of control over schools. As the officers attempt to demonstrate their accountability to the Department of Education and Skills, they use communication and information strategically to steer schools towards their ways of thinking. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses only on the views of LEA officers. Further research is required to ascertain the views of schools and other stakeholders in local education. Practical implications – Where regulatory bodies demand performance accountability from organisations, appropriate control mechanisms are necessary to ensure that organisations work in transparent ways towards regulatory objectives. Originality/value – Steering, responsibility, accountability and control are discussed in an educational context.

Indeed, it is remarkable that our natural perceptual and motor capabilities are able to adapt, with sufficient training, to the high demands posed by the handling of such machines. Much progress has been achieved in formalizing the <b>control</b> <b>relationship</b> between the human operator and the controlled vehicle, particularly within a closed-loop control framework. In comparison, much less is understood with regards to how human cognition influences this <b>control</b> <b>relationship.</b> This is especially important in the prevalence of autonomous vehicular control, which will radically modify the responsibility of the human operator from one of control to supervision. In this talk, I will begin by demonstrating how a classical cybernetics approach reveals the necessity of understanding high-level cognition during control, such as anticipation and expertise.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} whether during a matching-to-sample procedure (MTS), {{the time spent}} observing stimuli {{is related to the}} establishment of selection or rejection <b>controlling</b> <b>relationships</b> in human participants. It also evaluated whether different response topographies (i.e., participants using the keyboard or mouse) would influence the duration of eye fixations. Ten college students participated. The procedure established conditional relationships among six sets of abstract stimuli. Five participants selected the comparison stimuli using a computer mouse and five used a keyboard. An eye-scan device recorded eye movements throughout the training procedure. After participants completed training, probes verified whether the conditional <b>relationships</b> learned were <b>controlled</b> by selection (e.g., if A 1, select B 1), by rejection (e.g., if A 1, reject B 2), or both. All participants displayed a similar pattern of stimuli observation. Time spent observing the sample stimulus (e.g., A 1) was longer than observing the comparison stimuli (e.g., B 1 and B 2). Time spent observing S+ (positive stimuli; e.g., B 1) was longer than observing S- (negative stimuli; e.g., B 2). Duration of eye fixation was not related to selection or rejection <b>controlling</b> <b>relationships,</b> but different response topographies appeared to modulate {{the amount of time spent}} observing stimuli.|$|R
