5|$|The {{widespread}} {{assumption of}} European {{influence in the}} design of Taman Sari has been also challenged by the research of Hélène Njoto-Feillard from the University of Pantheon-Sorbonne, presented in a 2003 conference paper. Analysing the historic context and architectural style of the complex, the <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the creators are most likely local Javanese. The absence of any mention of European involvement in the construction of Taman Sari in Dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E

25|$|The atheistic <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{arguments}} and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe}} that any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no {{reason to believe that}} a god exists.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, certain {{scholars}} suggested that Aharon Ben Asher {{might have been}} a Karaite and not a rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and his <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ben Asher was a rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.|$|E

25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{criticizes the}} Alianza's filings {{by stating that}} they were based only on {{individual}} situations rather than a widespread study, that the information was based almost invariably on newspaper clippings, and that they only studied 26 districts. For his own study, Pliego Carrasco contrasted the growth in votes from the 2000 to the 2006 election for all parties. In all cases, the Alianza increased substantially more than the PAN, which even lost votes in the two categories of lowest marginalization. His <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there was no evidence}} that the PAN benefited from the expenditures. He found no statistical correlation between expenditures and the winning candidate. He derived similar conclusions for the other four programs. His <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the vote distribution does not support the hypothesis that social programs were used wholesale to influence the vote.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, Aurora (which claimed nearly 3,000 {{residents}} at the time) was in serious danger of dying out; Brammer's research {{also showed that}} Haydon was known in the town {{to be a bit}} of a jokester, and her <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Haydon's article was a last-ditch attempt to keep Aurora alive.|$|E

Spong identifies this augmentation with the origin of modern Anti-Semitism.|$|E
25|$|No duplex {{locomotives}} survive. Even today, {{their success}} {{and whether they}} could have been made to work well given sufficient time and effort is a controversial subject.

25|$|Researchers at the University of Washington and University of California {{examined}} the security around OBD, {{and found that}} they were able to gain control over many vehicle components via the interface.

25|$|His <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} no bias in the {{arithmetic}} errors (in other words, they were not present more often in the polling places won by {{one or the other}} candidate); he concludes that the errors were likely caused by the normal distribution of mathematical and organizational abilities of the randomly selected citizens in the polling place, and in the sometimes confusing design of the tally sheets and inadequate training of polling place workers.|$|E
25|$|Afshar's <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the light}} {{exhibits}} wave-like behavior when going past the wires, since the light {{goes through the}} spaces between the wires, but avoids the wires themselves, when both slits were open, but also exhibits particle-like behavior after going through the lens, with photons going to a given photo-detector. Afshar argues that this behavior contradicts the principle of complementarity, since it shows both complementary wave and particle characteristics in the same experiment for the same photons.|$|E
25|$|Maggie Barnes: Barnes {{claimed to}} be 117 at her death on 19 January 1998. Barnes, who was born to a slave and married a tenant farmer, had fifteen children; 11 of whom preceded her in death.

The <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Barnes was at least 115 years and 319 days old at her death, {{and may have been}} one to two years older.|$|E
