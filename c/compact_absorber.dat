40|$|Microwave {{absorbers}} {{are widely}} used in electromagnetic compatibility problems to reduce the mutual interactions between different devices, in antenna applications to reduce the back-radiation and to improve the radiation pattern of a radiator, in stealth problems to reduce the radar signature of a given object, in the measurement of the scattering features of objects and antennas, etc. The design of a microwave absorber usually consists of a trade-off among some major contrasting goals, such as reduced electrical dimensions, wide angular bandwidth, and wide frequency bandwidth. Recently, we have presented a new idea for a <b>compact</b> <b>absorber,</b> consisting of a metamaterial complementary resonant bilayer. In this layout, a resistive sheet with a given resistance is placed at the interface between two materials with oppositely signed constitutive parameters. If {{the resistance of the}} sheet is chosen in a judicious way, the presence of the resistive sheet does not sensibly weaken the resonance arising at the interface, and, thus, allows maintaining sufficiently high field amplitudes at its location, absorbing most of the impinging power. Since this resonance is independent on what surrounds the bilayer, the absorber does not need any metal backing and may also be electrically very thin. We have shown theoretically that this configuration might in principle be less affected by the incidence angle of the incoming electromagnetic wave and may exhibit also a reduced dependence on the field polarization. Some new theoretical results, giving further insights into the physical phenomena characterizing this <b>compact</b> <b>absorber,</b> and foreseeing some possible practical applications will be presented at the conferenc...|$|E

Absorption chiller technology {{has long been}} considered an ideal candidate for portable applications and designing a <b>compact</b> <b>absorber</b> for a new type chiller has merit. This study aims at investigating experimentally and analytically, under vacuum operating conditions, the influence of membrane properties on the water vapor transfer flux into a lithium bromide-water solution through a hydrophobic microporous membrane contactor at a liquid/vapor interface forming a confined narrow channel. The experimental results show that under a higher flow Reynolds number, followed by a higher mass transfer coefficient at an aqueous solution, the vapor interface has a more dominant effect on the water vapor transfer flux than the thin membrane effective layer thickness. The analytical results show that a large pore diameter combined with a higher porosity val ue of 0. 8 leads to an almost doubled water vapor flux through the membrane compared to the 0. 5 porosity value. However, for the membrane strength inside the absorber, a membrane of a porosity ranging from 0. 7 to 0. 8 is recommended.

40|$|The {{layout of}} the CBM muon {{detection}} system has been improved and optimized in 2007 with respect to background suppression and a more realistic detector response.

The present design of the muon detection system consists of several hadron absorber layers (iron with variable thickness) and 15 - 18 tracking detectors based on GEM technology. For the measurement of muons from low mass vector mesons (ρ, ω, φ) the total iron absorber thickness is 125 cm (corresponding 7. 5 λI) whereas for muons from charmonia 1 m of iron is added (corresponding total thickness of 13. 4 λI).

30|$|Metamaterials {{are able}} to tailor the amplitude, phase, and {{polarization}} responses of the incident light in an unprecedented way. In particular, absorption enhancement with metamaterials {{is one of the}} most interesting topics associated artificially engineered metamaterials [1 – 5]. Several metamaterial structures were demonstrated as high-performance light absorbers, such as dense nanorods and nanotubes [6, 7], multilayer planar photonic structures [8 – 10], and photonic crystals [11]. In the past decade, Au [12] and Ag have been intensively investigated [13 – 16] for designing absorbers. At earlier stage, most research activities have focused on the absorption of the electromagnetic field within a narrow waveband with structures of metal nanoparticles, periodic gratings, and metal/dielectric/metal thin layers [17 – 20]. However, broadband absorption throughout the entire visible regime is important for photovoltaic and thermo-photovoltaic cells. Driven by real needs in realistic applications, research works on broadband absorption were reported in recent years. The absorber with a nanostructured top silver film composed of crossed trapezoidal arrays offers broadband and polarization-independent resonant light absorption with an average measured absorption of 0.71 against a simulated absorption of 0.85 over the entire visible regime (400 – 700  nm) [16]. The broadband absorption was further improved with an absorber based on multiple metal/dielectric/ metal layers with an average simulated absorption of 93 % over the entire visible region [14]. In order to get better broadband absorption, semiconductor-based oxides and transition metal nitrides [21, 22] were proposed as alternative plasmonic materials. Specifically, transition-metal nitrides such as TiN or ZrN can serve as substitutes for conventional noble metals in the visible waveband [21]. A broadband metamaterial absorber based on TiN with square ring array shows an average absorption of 95 % over the entire visible regime (400 – 800  nm) [23]. And absorption over 98 % from 560 to 675  nm was obtained in a broadband metamaterial absorber with TiN and indium tin oxide transparent conducting films, while the average absorption was less than 85 % for the short waves from 400  nm to 500  nm [24]. Recently, monolayer MoS 2 shows great potential for generating various optoelectronic devices [25 – 34] and for photocatalytic applications owing to high absorption at the short wavelength side [35, 36]. The broadband absorber with metal Ag metasurface and a monolayer MoS 2 was studied yet with average absorption less than 90 % [37]. In this work, a more <b>compact</b> <b>absorber</b> with a monolayer MoS 2 and hexagonal-arranged TiN nano-disk array is proposed, with as high as 98.1 % average absorption over the entire visible region extending to near-IR (from 400 to 850  nm).

40|$|Extragalactic jets are {{collimated}} and magnetized outflows of {{relativistic plasma}} produced by accreting supermassive black holes. Although their understanding has significantly progressed over the years, the physical processes driving their launching, acceleration and collimation are still unclear. One {{reason is that}} the crucial mechanisms for jet formation take place on extremely small scales, and the angular resolution achievable in observations is only recently becoming sufficient. This thesis aims at investigating the nuclear regions of the jet in the radio galaxy Cygnus A through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations down to millimeter wavelengths. The large viewing angle of this jet (θ ∼ 75 deg) facilitates the study of the intrinsic properties of the flow thanks to the reduced geometrical and relativistic effects, and allows a counter-jet to be detected. At the source redshift (z= 0. 056), mm-VLBI can achieve a resolution of only ∼ 200 Schwarzschild radii (Rs). This thesis starts with an introduction to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on the radio-loud class (Chapter 1). A review of the currently most favored jet launching models is given in Chapter 2, complemented by a comparison with results from state-of-the-art observational studies. A large part of the work for this thesis was spent for the calibration and imaging of VLBI data, therefore Chapter 3 is dedicated to the description of this elegant and challenging observational technique. Chapter 4, 5 and 6 are focused on the study of Cygnus A, and the main findings are summarized in Chapter 7. Monitoring of the source at 43 GHz (Chapter 4) reveals that the flow is parabolic in its acceleration region, which extends for ∼ 10 ^ 4 Rs. Results are in agreement with predictions for a magnetically-driven jet confined by an external medium with mild pressure gradient. The presence of a speed transverse gradient with spine-sheath structure, likely giving rise to the limb brightening observed, is also inferred at 43 GHz. Its origin is further investigated in Chapter 5 at 86 GHz. At this frequency, the improved resolution enables to trace the limb-brightened structure down {{to the base of the}} two-sided flow, suggesting that stratification is a direct result of the jet launching mechanism. The minimum jet transverse size of 135 ± 27 Rs is much larger than the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (1 – 9 Rs), implying that the launching region must involve also the outer part of the accretion disk. A spectral analysis in the frequency range 8 – 86 GHz (Chapter 6) constrains the location of the true central engine to coincide with a prominent gap of emission seen at 43 GHz and at lower frequencies, at a distance of ∼ 1000 Rs from the 86 GHz core. The gap is a synchrotron self-absorbed region which becomes partially optically thin at 86 GHz. The counter-jet exhibits a flat or inverted spectrum up to high frequencies, compatible with the presence of a <b>compact</b> <b>absorber</b> extending between ∼ 0. 5 and 1. 5 pc from the central engine.

In addition, the pressure drop percentage in the case of water/(LiNO 3 + KNO 3 + NaNO 3) working fluid mixture is significantly lower than the water/LiBr and water/(LiBr + LiI + LiNO 3 + LiCl) working fluid mixtures because of the higher operating pressure...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a blind search for narrow absorption features at energies greater than 6. 4 keV {{in a sample}} of 42 radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. We detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 XMM-Newton EPIC pn observations. The number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies E> 7 keV is 22. Their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations is very low, less than 3 x 10 ^- 8, and their detection have been independently confirmed by a spectral analysis of the MOS data, with associated random probability < 10 ^- 7. We identify the lines as Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-shell resonant absorption. They are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocity distribution ranging from zero up to 0. 3 c, with a peak and mean value at 0. 1 c. We detect variability of the lines on both EWs and blue-shifted velocities among different observations even on time-scales as short as a few days, possibly suggesting somewhat <b>compact</b> <b>absorbers.</b> Moreover, we find no significant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources and the lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination by local absorption. If we define Ultra-fast Outflows (UFOs) those highly ionized absorbers with outflow velocities higher than 10 ^ 4 km/s, then the majority of the lines are consistent with being associated to UFOs and the fraction of objects with detected UFOs in the whole sample is at least 35 %. This fraction is similar for Type 1 and Type 2 sources. The global covering fraction of the absorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range C= 0. 4 - 0. 6, thereby implying large opening angles. These lines indicate that UFOs are a rather common phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and they are probably the direct signature of AGN accretion disk winds/ejecta. The detailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in a companion paper. Comment: 35 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics; corrected reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to develop lightweight barrier and compact absorbing material systems for controlling low frequency noise (say below 2 kHz). The solutions explored fell into the broad category of segmented cellular materials in which local resonances are built-in attributes. The body of the work was divided into four parts. First, a cellular metamaterial concept for lightweight barrier materials was proposed, then, secondly, the concept was experimentally verified by testing application-scale designs in a diffuse sound field setup. In the remaining {{two parts of the}} work, the idea of shifting sound energy emporally and spatially was explored as a means of improving the performance of metamaterial-based barrier solutions and of <b>compact</b> sound <b>absorbers,</b> respectively. ^ The high sound transmission loss (STL) metamaterials described to-date commonly require the introduction of relatively heavy resonating or constraining components which runs counter to the desire to create lightweight barrier solutions. It was proposed here that a cellular panel comprising a periodic arrangement of unit cells consisting of plates held in a grid-like frame, which itself is unsupported, can possess a high STL within a specified frequency range without an undue mass penalty. It was numerically demonstrated that such a cellular panel can yield enhanced STL if the unit cell mass is apportioned appropriately between the unit cell plate and the surrounding grid-like frame. ^ The concept of planar cellular metamaterials was verified through diffuse field experiments on application-scale specimens by using intensity methods. Two cellular panel designs were tested and their behavior was compared with that of a reference limp panel. It was found that the predicted benefit of the cellular panels could be realized by increasing the mass contrast in the designs, and that the benefit was reduced with increasing diffuseness of the sound field. It was also found that the loss in performance could be mitigated by the addition of appropriate treatments such as a lightweight grid that modified the incident sound field to be normally directed. ^ Although the performance of the metamaterial-based barrier solutions was better compared to the conventional ones, the performance can be poor at the system eigenfrequencies. The possibility of shifting energy from the deficit bands to other regions where the barriers are more efficient was numerically explored for embodiments of segmented cellular materials having non-linear stiffness characteristics. The acoustical behavior of such materials was probed through representative two-dimensional models of a segmented plate with a contact interface. Super-harmonic response peaks were observed for pure harmonic excitations, the strength of which were found to strongly depend on the degree of non-linearity or bilinear stiffness ratio. The closer an excitation frequency was to the characteristic eigenfrequencies of the structure, the stronger was the super-harmonic response, which supported the idea of transferring energy from problematic frequency bands to higher frequencies. ^ Finally, the possibility of a spatial-shift of energy from longitudinal to lateral direction was explored with the idea of eliminating the design constraints associated with conventional absorbing materials, and with the hope of realizing a <b>compact</b> sound <b>absorber.</b> The embodiment was a two-phase chiral composite made using a Topologically Interlocked Material (TIM) with its unit cell being a tetrahedron consisting of two helicoid dissections. A comparative study was conducted with standard microstructures inspired by the Voigt and Reuss models. The twist mode of the chiral composites was found to be excited by an incident sound field normal to the plane of the TIM assembly. Although this behavior is not unique to a chiral microstructure, many other microstructures do not exhibit this behavior. The excitation of the twist mode by the incident sound field offers a new avenue for realizing a <b>compact</b> sound <b>absorber.</b> ...|$|R

The intermediate portions of the straps are doubled over and stitched together in a pattern enabling the doubled-over portions to progressively separate at a predicable load designed to be well below the tensile capability of the straps as the stitches are successively torn apart by the forces imposed on the retainer members whenever the cover plate is explosively separated from the bulkhead and propelled into the net.

Good agreement prevailed for the analytically evaluated water vapor mass transfer flux and aqueous solution outlet temperature when compared with measured values at similar operating conditions.

The project lasted 42 months and started in April 2001. Recent developments at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Oregon State University suggest that the performance of absorption and desorption systems can be significantly enhanced {{by the use of}} an ultra-thin film gas/liquid contactor. This device employs microtechnology-based structures to mechanically constrain the gas/liquid interface. This technology can be used to form very thin liquid films with a film thickness less then 100 microns while still allowing gas/liquid contact. When the resistance to mass transfer in gas desorption and absorption is dominated by diffusion in the liquid phase the use of extremely thin films (< 100 microns) for desorption and absorption can radically reduce the size of a gas desorber or absorber. The development of <b>compact</b> <b>absorbers</b> and desorbers enables the deployment of small heat-actuated absorption heat pumps for distributed space heating and cooling applications, heat-actuated automotive air conditioning, manportable cooling, gas absorption units for the chemical process industry and the development of high capacity CO{sub 2 } absorption devices for CO{sub 2 } collection and sequestration. The energy potential energy savings associated with these technologies is estimated to ultimately be 2. 88 quads per year.

40|$|Fueled {{by their}} high third-order {{nonlinearity}} and nonlinear saturable absorption, carbon nanotubes (CNT) {{are expected to}} {{become an integral part}} of next-generation photonic devices such as all-optical switches and passive mode-locked lasers. However, in order to fulfill this expectation it is necessary to identify a suitable platform that allows the efficient use of the optical properties of CNT. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel device consisting of an optofluidic device filled with a dispersion of CNT. By fabricating a microchannel through the core of a conventional fiber and filling it with a homogeneous solution of CNTs on Dimethylformamide (DMF), a <b>compact,</b> all-fiber saturable <b>absorber</b> is realized. The fabrication of the micro-fluidic channel is a two-step process that involves femtosecond laser micro-fabrication and chemical etching of the laser-modified regions. All-fiber high-energy, passive mode-locked lasing is demonstrated with an output power of 13. 5 dBm. The key characteristics of the device are compactness and robustness against optical, mechanical and thermal damage...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{adaptive}} tuned vibration absorbers (ATVAs) {{based on}} magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) have mainly {{been developed in}} a shear working mode. The enhancing effect of MREs in squeeze mode has already been investigated, but ATVAs in squeeze mode have rarely been studied. This paper reports {{the development of a}} <b>compact</b> squeeze MRE <b>absorber</b> and its subsequent performance in various magnetic fields characterized under various frequencies by a vibration testing system. The results revealed that the natural frequency of the MRE absorber working in squeeze mode can be tuned from 37 Hz to 67 Hz. Following this, a theoretical model based on magnetic dipole theory was developed to investigate the dynamic performance of the squeeze MRE absorber, and the vibration attenuation of the squeeze MRE absorber was then verified by mounting it on a beam with supports under both ends. The results revealed that the squeeze MRE absorber extended its vibration attenuation range from 37 Hz to 67 Hz while the passive absorber was only effective around 53 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Absorption {{refrigeration}} technology, {{which has}} the ability to utilize heat directly for cooling purposes, {{has been one of the}} most widely used technologies for refrigeration and cooling applications since the early stages of refrigeration technology. Working fluid mixtures employed in the absorption cooling systems are environmental friendly and do not contribute in green house gas emission when compared to vapour compression systems which also use costly mechanical energy input. However, high initial costs and bigger size are some of the main obstacles that impede their wide use in small scale residential buildings and transport sector. In order to overcome these obstacles, design and configuration of the system and its components need to be reinvestigated in order to achieve compact components and reduce the size of the system. Use of membrane contactors in the form of hollow fiber membrane module or plate-and-frame membrane module is one of the alternatives to achieve <b>compact</b> components. <b>Absorber</b> is an important component of the absorption refrigeration system and plays a critical role in the overall performance, size, and capital cost of the system. In this study, numerical analyses are performed to evaluate the performance of a plate-and-frame membrane contactor based absorber employing water/(LiBr + LiI + LiNO 3 + LiCl) and water/(LiNO 3 +KNO 3 +NaNO 3) working fluid mixtures for air cooled absorption cooling systems and multi-stage high temperature heat sources applications, respectively. CFD tool ANSYS/FLUENT 14. 0 is used to perform the simulation and investigate in detail the heat and mass transfer mechanisms and the fluid dynamics behaviour at local levels in the channels. Moreover, a MATLAB code is developed to investigate the effect of membrane material characteristics and operating conditions on the absorption performance of the absorber. This study recommends optimum operating and design parameters to effectively utilize the membrane based absorber...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} novel air-coupled absorbers {{for use in}} a diesel engine exhaust-driven ammonia-water absorption system operating in extreme ambient conditions was conducted. Electrically driven vapor-compression systems are under scrutiny due to the environmental impact of synthetic refrigerants and the exacerbation of electric utility loads during peak demand periods. One alternative to vapor-compression systems is the absorption heat pump that uses environmentally benign working fluids and can be driven by a variety of heat sources, including waste heat and solar thermal processes. Direct air coupling of the absorber and condenser instead of indirect hydronic coupling can reduce absorption system size, complexity, and inefficiency, but materials compatibility issues with ammonia-water and the poor heat transfer properties of air present challenges. Heat and mass transfer modeling was used to predict the performance of round-tube corrugated-fin and <b>compact</b> tube-array <b>absorbers</b> designed for a 2. 64 -kW absorption chiller operated in high ambient temperature (51. 7 °C) conditions. A single-pressure ammonia-water test facility was constructed and used in conjunction with a temperature- and humidity-controlled air-handling unit to evaluate the absorbers at design and off-design operating conditions. Absorber performance was recorded over a range of air temperatures (35 - 54. 4 °C), air flow rates (0. 38 - 0. 74 m 3 s- 1), inlet solution temperatures (92 - 102 °C), concentrated solution flow rates (0. 006 - 0. 010 kg s- 1), and concentrated solution concentrations (38 - 46 %). At design conditions, round-tube corrugated-fin absorbers of 394 and 551 Fins Per Meter (FPM) demonstrated comparable performance (Q 394 -FPM,exp = 4. 521 ± 0. 271 kW; Q 551 -FPM,exp = 4. 680 ± 0. 260 kW), and measured heat transfer rates were 0. 7 - 1. 9 % AAD higher than those predicted through modeling. The measured heat transfer rate in the prototype tube-array absorber was significantly lower than the values predicted at design conditions (Qprot,exp = 2. 22 ± 0. 24 kW; Qprot,mod = 4. 33 kW). Maldistribution of the two-phase flow in the tube array is the probable cause of the disparity between the prototype absorber data and model predictions. Results from this investigation can be used to guide the development of air-coupled heat and mass exchangers for compact absorption heat pumps. M. S...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of NV {{absorption}} systems at 1. 5 < z < 2. 5 in the optical spectra of 19 QSOs. Our analysis includes both absorbers arising from the intergalactic medium as well as systems {{in the vicinity of}} the background quasar. We construct detailed photoionization models to study the physical conditions and abundances in the absorbers and to constrain the spectral hardness of the ionizing radiation. The rate of incidence for intervening NV components is dN/dz = 3. 38 +/- 0. 43, corresponding to dN/dX = 1. 10 +/- 0. 14. The column density distribution function is fitted by the slope beta = 1. 89 +/- 0. 22, consistent with measurements for CIV and OVI. The narrow line widths (b_NV ~ 6 km/s) imply photoionization rather than collisions as dominating ionization process. The column densities of CIV and NV are correlated but show different slopes for intervening and associated absorbers, which indicates different ionizing spectra. Associated systems are found to be more metal-rich, denser, and more <b>compact</b> than intervening <b>absorbers.</b> This conclusion is independent of the adopted ionizing radiation. For the intervening NV systems we find typical values of [C/H] ~ - 0. 6 and n_H ~ 10 ^- 3. 6 cm^- 3, and sizes of a few kpc, while for associated NV absorbers we obtain [C/H] ~ + 0. 7, n_H ~ 10 ^- 2. 8 cm^- 3, and sizes of several 10 pc. The abundance of nitrogen relative to carbon [N/C] and alpha-elements like oxygen and silicon [N/alpha] is correlated with [N/H], indicating the enrichment by secondary nitrogen. The larger scatter in [N/alpha] in intervening systems suggests an inhomogeneous enrichment of the IGM. There is an anti-correlation between [N/alpha] and [alpha/C], which could be used to constrain the initial mass function of the carbon- and nitrogen-producing stellar population.
