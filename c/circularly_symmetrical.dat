40|$|Abstract: In this paper, it is {{demonstrated}} that a uniform traveling-wave current distribution on a circular loop of one-wavelength circumference {{can be obtained}} by loading the loop with a lumped reactance at a position of 45 ° away from the feed point. To achieve a uniform traveling-wave current distribution, the loading reactance and the input impedances of the loaded and unloaded loop antennas need to satisfy certain relations from which the loading reactance can be predicted theoretically. It is shown that the circular loop antenna with uniform traveling-wave current distribution results in a lower profile, a more <b>symmetrical</b> <b>circularly</b> polarized radiation pattern, and a much better input impedance matching.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{characteristics of}} GaAs Whispering Gallery microdisk lasers {{have been investigated}} for different disk shapes and sizes. Elliptical structures showed {{a substantial increase in}} the emission intensity from the sides of the disk with the greatest curvature, while stadium-shaped disks did not support any laser emission. Deformation of circular disks towards squares reduces the number of resonant modes for lasing but does not eliminate lasing totally; thus operation with non-Whispering-Gallery modes is possible, and this implies that such operation may be relevant even for <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> lasers...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{polarized}} light transmitted through randomly scattering media of a polystyrene-microsphere solution is described. Temporal {{profiles of the}} Stokes vectors {{and the degree of}} polarization are measured experimentally and calculated theoretically based on a Monte Carlo technique. The experimental results match the theoretical results well, which demonstrates that the time-resolved Monte Carlo technique is a powerful tool that can contribute to the understanding of polarization propagation in biological tissue. Analysis based on the Stokes-Mueller formalism and the Mie theory shows that the first scattering event determines the major spatial patterns of the transmitted Stokes vectors. When an area detected at the output surface of a turbid medium is <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> about the incident beam, the temporal profile of the transmitted light is independent of the incident polarization state. A linear relationship between the average order of the scatters and the light propagation time can be used to explain the exponential decay of the degree of polarization of transmitted light...|$|E
40|$|Stereoacuity was {{determined}} for gratings and Gabor patches as their orientation was varied. Acuity was constant for 1 cyc/deg and 2 cyc/deg gratings {{over the range}} 0 - 80 deg when it was expressed as the interocular phase shift. The same was true of an 8 cyc/deg elongated Gabor patch. Thus the threshold for these stimuli was well predicted by a constant shift {{at right angles to}} the orientation of the carrier grating. However, the threshold disparity at right angles to the major axis of an oriented Gaussian patch rose as it was tilted away from the vertical. Also, thresholds for a <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> Gaussian patch rose steeply with the angle of the disparity away from the horizontal. We conclude that stereo matching depends upon the horizontal component of angular disparity. The apparent insensitivity of grating stereoacuity to orientation {{can be explained by the}} invariance of horizontal disparity with orientation when disparity is expressed as a horizontal phase shift in the grating profile...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{studies on the}} primary visual cortex have revealed complicated nonclassical neuronal activities. Contextual modulation on orientation-contrast is one typical example of nonclassical neuronal behavior. This modulation by surrounding stimuli in a nonclassical receptive field is mainly thought to be mediated by short- and long-range horizontal connections within the primary visual cortex. Short-range connections are <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> and relatively independent of orientation preferences, while long-range connections are patchy, asymmetrical, and orientation specific. Although this modulation {{can be explained by}} long-range specific connections qualitatively, recent studies suggest that long-range connections alone may be insufficient with respect to the balance between two types of connections. Here, in order to clarify the role of short-range connections in the process of contextual modulation, we propose a model of the primary visual cortex with isotropic short-range connections and a geometric orientation map. Computational simulations using the model have demonstrated that contextual modulation can be explained by short-range connections alone. This is due to the interaction between the spatial periodicity of orientation domains and the excitatory-inhibitory regions arising from the propagation of activities...|$|E
40|$|Voids {{and cracks}} in asphalt or {{concrete}} can indicate {{the condition of}} a road or pavement. A decaying road may contain many very small cracks, and such small artifacts {{can be difficult to}} identify using conventional ground penetrating radar (GPR) techniques. A new approach is examined here to detect the scattering from the multitude of small defects in the ground. Consideration is given to the layout of suitable antennas to sensitise a GPR system to the laterally propagating cross-polarised signals that voids in a road will produce. A self-shielded antenna with a <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> beam pattern is used to transmit vertically downwards. This is surrounded by a number of wide band dielectric wedge directional antennas, oriented to pick up the cross-polarisation of the scattered signal. The two antenna types and their groundplane configuration have reduced direct path coupling and therefore maximise system sensitivity. Tests over asphalt slabs with 7 % and 3 % changes in density and porosity show that quite significant changes in signal level make such changes in porosity detectable...|$|E
40|$|The density {{distribution}} of inhomogeneous dense deuterium-tritium plasmas in laser fusion is {{revealed by the}} energy loss of fast protons going through the plasma. In our {{simulation of a plasma}} density diagnostics, the fast protons used for the diagnostics may be generated in the laser-plasma interaction. Dividing a two-dimensional area into grids and knowing the initial and final energies of the protons, we can obtain a large linear and ill-posed equation set. for the densities of all grids, which is solved with the Tikhonov regularization method. We find that the accuracy of the set plan with four proton sources is better than those of the set plans with less than four proton sources. Also we have done the density reconstruction especially. for four proton sources with and without assuming <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> density distribution, and find that the accuracy is better for the reconstruction assuming circular symmetry. The error is about 9 % when no noise is added to the final energy for the reconstruction of four proton sources assuming circular symmetry.

40|$|AbstractStereoacuity was {{determined}} for gratings and gabor patches as their orientation was varied. Acuity was constant for 1 c/deg and 2 c/deg gratings {{over the range}} 0 – 80 deg when it was expressed as positional shift {{at right angles to}} the grating orientation. The same was true of an 8 c/deg elongated gabor patch. However, the threshold disparity at right angles to the major axis of an oriented gaussian patch rose as it was tilted away from the vertical. Also, thresholds for a <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> gaussian patch rose steeply with the angle of the disparity away from the horizontal. Disparities of the centroids of 4 c/deg gabor patches could be detected equally well at angles of 0 and 70 deg, independently of the angle of the carrier grating. The data indicate a variety of rules for stereoscopic matching. Large-field gratings are matched by detecting orthogonal phase shifts, or alternatively phase shifts along the horizontal axis. Smaller patches of grating are matched by their centroids, independently of their angle. Small gaussian patches are difficult to match in any direction other than along the horizontal axis. The difference between gaussian patches and 4 c/deg gabor patches with the same envelope argues against the involvement of a second-order rectifying non-linearity preceding matching...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe have observed the {{spatial distribution of}} coherent or resonant transition radiation (RTR) in the soft-x-ray region of the spectrum (1 - 2 keV). Resonance transition radiators were constructed and tested at two accelerators using electron-beam energies ranging from 50 to 228 MeV. These radiators emitted soft x-rays in a <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> annulus with a half-angle divergence of 2. 5 - 9. 0 mrad. The angle of peak emission was found to increase with electron-beam energy, {{in contrast to the}} incoherent case, for which the angle of emission varied inversely with electron-beam energy. By careful selection of foil thickness and spacing, one may design radiators whose angle of emission varies over a range of charged-particle energies. A particular RTR mode (r=m= 1) was found to give a sharp annular ring that becomes more accentuated as the number of foils is increased. The RTR effect has application in particle detection, beam diagnostics, x-ray source brightness enhancement, and x-ray free-electron-laser emission.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been the design and {{demonstration}} of refractive devices, not only for acoustic waves, but also for flexural waves in thin plates. Mathematically these problems have been treated {{by means of the}} multiple scattering theory, because the geometries of the problems were mainly circular and such theory is the best one in these cases. The multiple scattering theory, previously stated, is here explained. Additionally, a multilayer scattering theory for flexural waves is here introduced and successfully used to numerically simulate their behavior. Therefore, this PhD thesis is divided in two parts. The first part is devoted to describe two acoustic refractive devices: a gradient index lens and an omnidirectional broadband acoustic absorber, or “acoustic black hole”. Both are based on sonic crystals consisting of of rigid cylinders immersed in a fluid background. As the homogenization method states, the desired refractive index can be obtained by tailoring the radii of the cylinders. Thereafter, numerical simulations and measurements were conducted to test the behavior of each device. For this purpose, two specific measuring systems were developed: the two-dimensional chamber and the impedance chamber. Both are here explained in detail. The second part describes the design of refractive devices for flexural waves. Instead of using “platonic crystals”, we made use of the peculiar dispersion relationship of flexural waves. As the equation states, the wave speed is modified not only by the elastic properties of the plate, but also from its thickness. Using the latest approach a set of numerical simulations of known <b>circularly</b> <b>symmetrical</b> gradient index lenses have been performed. Additionally, an omnidirectional broadband insulating device for flexural waves has been designed. It consist of a well-like thickness profile in an annular region of the plate, that mimics the combination of an attractive and repulsive potentials. The waves are focused at its bottom and dissipated by means of an absorptive layer placed on top. Numerical simulations are here presented and discussed. Finally, we present an in-plane flexural resonator, consisting of a hole in a thin plate traversed by a beam. Here, a closed form of the transfer matrix is obtained by coupling the Kirchhoff-Love and the Euler-Bernoulli motion equations.
