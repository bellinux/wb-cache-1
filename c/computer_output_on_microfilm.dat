This work followed an independent UK clinical trial that evaluated the impact of computer-aided detection(CAD) in breast screening. The aim was to use data from this trial to feed into probabilistic models (similar to those used in "reliability engineering") which would detect and assess possible ways of improving the human-CAD interaction. Some analyses required extra data; therefore, two supplementary studies were conducted. Study 1 was designed to elucidate the effects of computer failure on human performance. Study 2 was conducted to clarify unexpected findings from Study 1...|$|R
5000|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} (AI) aims to or {{is required}} to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding. The starting-point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing's question [...] "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered although the Turing test is still used to assess <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>on</b> the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful {{as a substitute for}} human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.|$|R

2500|$|Engelbart, {{with the}} help of his {{geographically}} distributed team, and with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions. The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large 6.7-metre high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing. Additionally, live video of him and his associates from ARC in Menlo Park, about 48 kilometers away, was combined with the <b>computer's</b> <b>output</b> <b>on</b> the Eidophor. [...] The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baud which were high-speed in 1968, linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at Brooks Hall [...] to their Menlo Park headquarter's SDS-940 computer. [...] In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used, relayed by a microwave van near the summit of a hill that overlooked both sites. English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand—at the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog—who also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo.|$|R

50|$|The company {{developed}} two {{chips to}} facilitate displaying the <b>computer’s</b> <b>output</b> <b>on</b> a standard color television set. The UM1 chip controlled sixteen rectangular objects {{on the screen}} that could be manipulated in size and shape, placement on the screen, and image within the rectangle. Software could designate {{the color of the}} image and of the remaining space within the rectangle, usually the background color of the display which was also software selectable. The UM1 was in turn controlled by an F8 processor. The UM1 fed a stream of pixels into a FIFO buffer which passed them along to be converted into signals that were delivered to the RF antenna input of a television set. Because the UM1 delivered the pixels needed for every line on the raster scan of the TV, rather than using the same pixel stream for every two or more adjacent lines as in then current video games, the VideoBrain produced finer display resolution than most television sets could support. The UM1 chip (Patent #4,232,374) was designed by John Cosley and Len Chen under the direction of Dr. Chung. A second chip, the UM2, was developed to serve as a clock for the entire system and to produce the NTSC (USA) and PAL (Europe) scanning video frames for the TV set. The PAL version of the UM2 was never manufactured or brought to market. Though a much simpler chip than the UM1, getting the UM2 into manufacturing was difficult because any flaw in timing, even once in millions of cycles, could bring the entire system down.|$|R

40|$|When we {{interact}} with computers today, we typically feed {{input into the}} computer with our hands controlling a mouse or keyboard, while we employ our eyes to examine the <b>computer’s</b> <b>output</b> <b>on</b> a screen. Intuitively, it seems beneficial to this process to also use the eyes as input devices- by measuring eye movements indicating shifts of attention – and thus eliminate the motor control loop for arm and hand. Obviously, gaze-controlled interfaces are particularly useful for physically challenged users, especially those who cannot move their limbs and also have difficulties using speech-recognition systems. The aim {{of the present study}} is the development and empirical evaluation of such a gaze-controlled interface that allows their physically challenged users to easily perform everyday tasks such as writing text, writing and reading e-mails, and doing calculations. Obviously, using the eyes as a means of input differs from using a standard input device – such as a computer mouse – in many ways. On the one hand, eye movements can serve as a fast and direct means of controlling a computer, but on the other hand, they are not completely under conscious control, so when using gaze-control interfaces we may sometimes trigger actions unintentionally (the “Midas-Touch Problem”). It is a crucial point in the design of gaze-controlled interfaces to minimize such undesirable effects. Consequently, the present study includes not only the development of the interface, but also its empirical evaluation. In cooperation with the Center for Adaptive Computing at UMass Boston, physically challenged users will test the interface and give valuable feedback for the improvement of our system. Several different kinds of gaze-controlled interfaces have already been developed for physicall...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest that many {{argumentative}} moves in casual dialogues can be explained in terms of conflicting desires and conflicting beliefs, in such a way that some of these moves may be predicted. Participants appraise the different outcomes of the conflicting situation and try to find, together, through dialogue, a solution that they consider as acceptable. We show how realistic dialogues can emerge through a simple recursive process from an initial cognitive conflict. This model is implemented in our program PARADISE which can reconstruct the argumentative moves of some real conversations.

Tangicons foster algorithmic construction and reasoning as well as discussions among the players. In contradiction to other collaborative educational games Tangicons intend to avoid competition between children in favor for a strictly collaborative process. Children learn to solve problems together by manipulating physical objects that communicate with each other in order to move virtual characters on a map. This requires a high degree of abstraction. To sustain concentration and motivation, the game also includes playful elements as well as fine and gross motor activity. The focus of the investigation, however, will be the logical-abstract thinking of children.
