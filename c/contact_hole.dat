40|$|Abstract: The {{patterning}} the <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> by photolithography process, in {{this case}} polysilicon contacts, is the process to produce electrical connection between metal layer and polysilicon gates or metal layer and source/drain. The photolithography process can control {{size and shape of}} the <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> patterns on photoresist before permanently patterned by etching process and then metallization. The <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> were specified to have the size of 0. 8 micron after the photolithography process. In order to achieve this, the process parameters to be considered are exposure energy, focus length of the lens system, and the effect of light reflecting from the film topography underneath. Since in the previous processing step, the attempt to reduce the film topography was done by planarization using BPSG. By adjusting the exposure energy and focus, the optimal condition, to produce 0. 8 micron <b>contact</b> <b>holes,</b> was found to be energy of 305 mJ/cm 2 and focus of- 1. 0 µm...|$|R

The low bottom coverage of the sputter deposited layers in contact holes is well predicted by the simulations.

40|$|Directed {{self-assembly}} (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP) {{is considered}} a promising patterning approach for the 7 nm node and beyond. Specifically, a grapho-epitaxy process using a cylindrical phase BCP may offer an efficient solution for patterning randomly distributed <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> with sub-resolution pitches, such as found in via and cut mask levels. In any grapho-epitaxy process, the pattern density impacts the template fill (local BCP thickness inside the template) and may cause defects due to respectively over- or underfilling of the template. In order to tackle this issue thoroughly, the parameters that determine template fill {{and the influence of}} template fill on the resulting pattern should be investigated. In this work, using three process flow variations (with different template surface energy), template fill is experimentally characterized as a function of pattern density and film thickness. The impact of these parameters on template fill is highly dependent on the process flow, and thus pre-pattern surface energy. Template fill has a considerable effect on the pattern transfer of the DSA <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> into the underlying layer. Higher fill levels give rise to smaller <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> and worse critical dimension uniformity. These results are important towards DSA-aware design and show that fill is a crucial parameter in grapho-epitaxy DSA. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|SiO 2 contact {{holes with}} a high {{anisotropy}} and aspect ratio were etched using an advanced cyclic etching (ACE) process to reduce the diameters of the contact holes. The ACE process consisted of the pre-deposition of a protection layer on the mask in a C 4 F 6 /CH 2 F 2 /Ar plasma and a subsequent cyclic process of alternating etching and deposition steps in C 4 F 6 /CH 2 F 2 /Ar/O 2 and C 4 F 6 /CH 2 F 2 /Ar plasmas, respectively. The pre-deposition of the protection layer suppressed the mask-sidewall slope and mask faceting, thereby preventing the hole pattern from widening. An additional deposition step to the subsequent etching {{of the sample was}} introduced to maintain mask-sidewall protection and to deposit a passivation film on the sidewall of the <b>contact</b> <b>hole.</b> When the <b>contact</b> <b>hole</b> was etched using the conventional continuous etching process, its opening diameter increased by 22 %, degree of bowing was 10 nm, and aspect ratio was 18.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA) {{is used for}} the {{analysis}} of both polarized broadband reflectance and transmittance spectra with the purpose of measuring the degree of corner rounding in 2 D contact holes. The use of transmittance spectra proves to be advantageous for the characterization of the shape of the contact holes. In contrast with the conventional reflectance-only techniques, transmittance measurements prove to be more sensitive to the angstrom-level variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>hole.</b> Therefore, the new technique is capable of accurately determining the degree of rounding of the <b>contact</b> <b>hole</b> corners and characterizing a variety of shapes- from perfectly round to perfectly square. Additionally, the high intensity of the transmitted spectra improves the signal-to-noise ratio and guarantees better repeatability of the results. For the current study, 2 D arrays of square contact holes with 800 nm pitch are measured on an After Clean Inspection (ACI) phase-shift mask, using a spectrophotometer-based instrument capable of collecting four continuous spectra during one measurement – two polarized reflectance spectra (Rs and Rp) and two polarized transmittance spectra (Ts and Tp). The measured spectra are analyzed using the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations, in conjunction with RCWA.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{integrated}} circuits (ICs), {{it is important to}} minimize the number of vias between conductors on different layers since excess vias lead to decreased yield and degraded circuit performance. Similarly, in {{the design of}} printed circuit boards (PCBs), it is important to minimize the number of <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> used to connect copper strips {{on opposite sides of the}} board. Excess <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> increase manufacturing cost and decrease the board's reliability. Given a particular design of an IC (or PCB), the Constrained Via Minimization Problem is to find a layer assignment that requires the fewest possible vias (or <b>contact</b> <b>holes).</b> It is shown that this problem is NP-hard for two- layer layouts and remains so when the layout is restricted to be grid-based, vias are restricted to lie at previously existing junctions, and the maximum number of wires which are joined at any particular junction does not exceed six. A new graph- theoretic formulation of the two-layer problem is then presented along with an algorithm which yields optimum results when the maximum junction degree is limited to three. The worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is O (n sup 3) where n is the number of routing segments in the given layout. Unlike previous algorithms, this algorithm does not require the layout to be grid based and places no constraints on the location of vias or the number of wires that may be joined at a single junction. If there are junctions with degree exceeding three, then our solution may be slightly less then optimum. If vias are limited to a subset of all possible via sites such as those allowable by a particular set of geometric design rules, then a further speedup is possible. This algorithm has been fully implemented. When tested on examples from the literature, it was found to be faster than the existing heuristic algorithms. A new heuristic is also suggested that is based on properties of the optimum solutions which were generated by this algorithm...|$|R

In particular, CNT-based contacts appear advantageous when compared with current tungsten or copper technologies and could therefore find an application as metal contacts interconnecting the transistors with {{the back end of}} line of the microchip. In this work, the integration of vertical CNT bundles in sub-micron <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> is evaluated at wafer scale and the major integration challenges encountered in the practical realization of the process are discussed. Nickel PVD films were used to selectively grow CNT into the <b>contact</b> <b>holes</b> at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C, which is the thermal budget available for contacts. The height of the contacts and the length of the CNT are controlled by a chemical mechanical polishing step (CMP) after embedding the CNT into SiO 2. Ti/Au metal pads are then formed onto the CNT bundles by PVD and lift-off. The integrated CNT are electrically characterized and an annealing treatment was found to improve the CNT-via resistance. As the electrical properties of the CNT can be evaluated, the structure and the process presented constitute a test vehicle for the development of high-quality CNT-contacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
