40|$|Latent dirichlet {{allocation}} Transfer {{learning a}} b s t r a c t Due to {{the scarcity of}} user interest information in the target domain, recommender systems generally suffer from the sparsity problem. To alleviate this limitation, one natural way is to transfer user interests in other domains to the target domain. However, objects in different domains may be in different media types, which {{make it very difficult}} to find the correlations between them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to transfer user interests <b>cross</b> <b>domains</b> or media. We model documents (corresponding to media objects) from different domains and user interests in a common topic space, and learn topic distributions for documents and user interests together. Specifically, to learn the model, we combine multi-type media information: media descriptions, user-generated text data and ratings. With this model, recommendation can be done in multiple ways, via predicting ratings, comparing topic distributions of documents and user interests directly and so on. Experiments on two real world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in addressing the sparsity problem by transferring user interests <b>cross</b> <b>domains.</b> & 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Condorcet domains are sets {{of linear}} orders with the {{property}} that, whenever {{the preferences of}} all voters belong to this set, the majority relation has no cycles. We observe that, without loss of generality, such domain can be assumed to be closed {{in the sense that}} it contains the majority relation of every profile with an odd number of individuals whose preferences belong to this domain. We show that every closed Condorcet domain is naturally endowed with the structure of a median graph and that, conversely, every median graph is associated with a closed Condorcet domain (which may not be a unique one). The subclass of those Condorcet domains that correspond to linear graphs (chains) are exactly the preference domains with the classical single crossing property. As a corollary, we obtain that the domains with the so-called `representative voter property' (with the exception of a 4 -cycle) are the single <b>crossing</b> <b>domains.</b> Maximality of a Condorcet domain imposes additional restrictions on the underlying median graph. We prove that among all trees only the chains can induce maximal Condorcet domains, and we characterize the single <b>crossing</b> <b>domains</b> that in fact do correspond to maximal Condorcet domains. Finally, using Nehring's and Puppe's (2007) characterization of monotone Arrowian aggregation, our analysis yields a rich class of strategy-proof social choice functions on any closed Condorcet domain...|$|R

40|$|The <b>domain</b> {{of single}} <b>crossing</b> {{preference}} profiles {{is a widely}} studied domain in social choice theory. It has been generalized to the <b>domain</b> of single <b>crossing</b> preference profiles with respect to trees which inherits many desirable properties from the single <b>crossing</b> <b>domain,</b> for example, transitivity of majority relation, existence of polynomial time algorithms for finding winners of Kemeny voting rule, etc. In this paper, we consider a further generalization of the <b>domain</b> of single <b>crossing</b> profiles on trees to the domain consisting of all preference profiles which can be extended to single crossing preference profiles with respect to some tree by adding more preferences to it. We call this domain the weakly single <b>crossing</b> <b>domain</b> on trees. We present a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing weakly single crossing profiles on trees. We {{then move on to}} develop a polynomial time algorithm with low query complexity for eliciting weakly single crossing profiles on trees even when we do not know any tree with respect to which the closure of the input profile is single crossing and the preferences can be queried only sequentially; moreover, the sequential order is also unknown. We complement the performance of our preference elicitation algorithm by proving that our algorithm makes an optimal number of queries up to constant factors when the number of preferences is large compared to the number of candidates, even if the input profile is known to be single crossing with respect to some given tree and the preferences can be accessed randomly...|$|R
40|$|In {{practicable}} multi-level secure systems it {{is necessary}} occasionally to transfer information in violation of security policy. Machines for doing this reliably and securely are called <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> solutions; systems incorporating them are <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> systems. Data owners, especially in classified environments, tend to distrust other data owners, other systems and networks, their own users, and developers of <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> solutions. Hence, data owners demand rigorous testing before they will allow their information into a <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> system. The interests of data owners are represented by certifiers and accreditors, who test newly developed <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> solutions and newly installed <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> systems, respectively. Accreditors {{have the authority to}} grant approval to operate and the responsibility for accepting residual risk. Certification and accreditation have always been expensive and time consuming, but there are hidden inefficiencies and unexploited opportunities to predict the actions of accreditors and to control the cost of certification. Some case studies of successful and unsuccessful security certifications and accreditations were analysed using grounded theory methodology. It was discovered that inefficiency arises from conflation of the principle of defence in depth with the practice of independent verification and validation, resulting in an irresistible appearance of cost savings to managers with a possible explanation in the relative maturity of different levels of software engineering organisations with respect to policy, process, and procedures. It was discovered that there is a simple rule relating certifier findings to developer responses that predicts the duration of penetration testing and can be used to bound the schedule. An abstract model of <b>cross</b> <b>domain</b> system accreditation was developed that is sufficiently powerful to reason about collateral, compartmented, and international installations. It was discovered that the behaviour of accreditors satisfies the criteria for reliable signalling in the presence of asymmetric information due to Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz. </p...|$|E
