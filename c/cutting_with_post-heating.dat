40|$|Abstract. Plasma-sprayed HA {{coatings}} (HACs) on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrates <b>with</b> <b>post-heat</b> treatments {{were employed}} to improve the microstructural homogeneity, bonding strength and reliability of the HACs. A defect-healing effect can be recognized to diminish coating defects with the hydrothermal treatment, and 150 °C hydrothermally-treated HACs shows a significant improved bonding strength than 600 °C vacuum heating HACs because of its dense structure from the defect-healing effect. Low-temperature hydrothermal treatment demonstrates a more superior crystallization effect than vacuum heat treatment. Based on the statistical calculation by the Weibull distribution function, hydrothermally-treated HACs show a wear-out failure with a higher Weibull modulus than vacuum heating HACs. Hydrothermally-treated HACs possessed better reliability {{can be attributed to}} the suppression of defect content (about 2. 6 - 3. 2 volume %) and its smaller strength data fluctuation...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} focused on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of thin concrete panels reinforced with GFRP rebars. The considered thin panels (thickness of 4 cm) were exposed to increasing temperature and bending loading. These concrete elements are typical for low bearing function concrete layers in façade claddings. The influence of two aspects was studied: the concrete cover and the external surface of rebars. The heating condition was such that the temperature of the internal GFRP rebars reached about the transition temperature of the resins. This allowed to verify the variation of the deformability and the load carrying capacity of the panels <b>with</b> <b>post-heating</b> bending tests. As main outcome, the imposed temperature did not generate evident degradation of the GFRP reinforcement and of its adhesion to the concrete, while a reduction of the initial global stiffness was measured...|$|R

40|$|Thuya occidentalis “Emeraud” (Thuya ssp), {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{evergreen}} ornamental plants for decoration of parks and gardens with very slow growth. They form few seeds with relatively low germination. This is the cause of the continuous efforts to find efficient ways of vegetative propagation, which influence the increase of the coefficient of thuya’s propagation. The paper presents the influence of the naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) 4000 ppm in the rooting of one year vegetative cuttings of Thuya occidentalis “Emeraud”, with and without biennial wood. The experiment was carried out during three consecutive years, 2008 - 2010, in the flower’s greenhouse of the Experimental Centre of the Department of Horticulture at Agricultural University of Tirana. The one year vegetative cuttings were prepared as simple cuttings (cuttings without bark or biennial wood) and <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> the scion (<b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> bark or biennial wood). Vegetative cuttings of thuya were sown in the perlite band. Control for the final rooted seedlings and/or rooting percentage was carried out 60 days after sowing of the vegetative cuttings in the perlite band. There was calculated the rooting percentage of the vegetative cuttings treated and untreated with NAA 4000 ppm. The results show that the average rooting percentage of the simple untreated cuttings was 20 %, while the average rooting percentage of the untreated <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> a scion was 45 %. Total rooting percentage of the untreated cuttings was 32. 5 %. So, <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> a scion (the <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> bark and biennial wood), have a higher rooting percentage even when they are not treated with NAA. There were observed significant differences of the results in the case of treating <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm. These differences consisted in increasing the rooting ability and the rooting percentage of the cuttings. The average rooting percentage of the simple untreated <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> NAA was 51 %, while the mean percentage of the <b>cuttings</b> <b>with</b> a scion treated with NAA was 80 %. The total rooting percentage of the untreated cuttings was 65. 5 %. The use of the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm, for the treatment of the one year vegetative cuttings of thuya was followed by the significant increases the rooting percentage in total from 32. 5 % to 65. 5 %. The three-year-results showed that the use of the rooting hormone NAA, 4000 ppm, does affect significantly in the increase of the rooting percentage of the vegetative cuttings, up to 30 %, as well as in doubling the quantity of the seedling produced for each planting season, which was confirmed by ANOVA...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to deposit dense intermetallic compound coatings by cold spraying directly using the compound feedstock powders due to their intrinsic low-temperature brittleness. A method to prepare intermetallic compound coatings in-situ employing cold spraying was developed using a metastable alloy powder assisted <b>with</b> <b>post-heat</b> treatment. In this study, a nanostructured Fe/Al alloy powder was pre-pared by ball-milling process. The cold-sprayed Fe/Al alloy coating was evolved in-situ to intermetallic compound coating through a post-heat treatment. The microstructural evolution of the Fe- 40 Al powder during mechanical alloying {{and the effect of}} the post-heat treatment on the microstructure of the cold-sprayed Fe(Al) coating were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that the milled Fe- 40 Al powder exhibits lamellar microstructure. The microstructure of the as-sprayed Fe(Al) coating depends significantly on that of the as-milled powder. The heat-treatment temperature significantly influences the in-situ evolution of the intermetallic compound. The heat treatment at a temperature of 500 C results in the complete transformation of Fe(Al) solid solution to FeAl intermetallic compound...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been undertaken {{to study the}} depth of cut in multipass abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting of an 87 % alumina ceramic with controlled nozzle oscillation. The experimental data have been statistically analysed to study the trends of the depth of cut {{with respect to the}} process parameters. It has been found that multipass <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> controlled nozzle oscillation can significantly increase the depth of cut. Within the same cutting time and using the same cutting parameters other than the jet traverse speed, it has been found that multipass <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> nozzle oscillation can increase the depth of cut by an average of 74. 6 % as compared to single pass cutting without nozzle oscillation. Furthermore, a multipass <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> higher nozzle traverse speeds can achieve a larger depth of cut than a single pass cutting at a low traverse speed within the same cutting time. A recommendation has been made for the selection of appropriate process parameters for multipass <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> nozzle oscillation. In order to estimate the depth of cut on a mathematical basis, predictive models for the depth of cut in multipass <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> and without nozzle oscillation have been developed using a dimensional analysis technique. The model development starts with the models for single pass cutting which are then extended to multipass cutting where considerations are given to the change of the actual standoff distance after each pass and the variation of kerf width. These predictive models has been numerically studied for their plausibility by assessing their predicted trends with respect to the various process variables, and verified qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experimental data. The model assessment reveals that the developed models correlate very well with the experimental results and can give adequate predictions of this cutting performance measure in process planning...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnidirectional fiber-reinforced {{composite}} workpieces {{are often}} machine-processed in practice. During such cutting process, strong fibers are bended far more intensively than the weak matrix and an interfacial debonding between them occurs under the machined surface. It deteriorates composite performance properties and thus, debonding reduction {{is a vital}} technological problem. One of the perspective ways to diminish such debonding is to apply special cutting means. On {{the first stage of}} the problem study it is recommended to apply calculation and, first of all, numerical calculation methods. Attempts to apply the finite element method have presented some difficulties. Therefore, the SPH method has been previously used as the study basis. Calculations are performed using three design models: free orthogonal and oblique <b>cutting</b> (including <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> two opposite located wedges), free orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> the advanced wedge and, at last, free orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>with</b> the advanced roller.

However, the bioinertness of the surface of Ti has motivated researchers to improve the physicochemical and biological properties of the implants through various surface modifications, such as coatings. For this purpose, we prepared a novel bioactive material, a lanthanum-incorporated hydroxyapatite (La-HA) coating, using a dip-coating technique with a La-HA sol along <b>with</b> <b>post-heat</b> treatment. The XRD, FTIR and EDX results {{presented in this paper}} confirmed that lanthanum was successfully incorporated into the structure of HA. The La-HA coating was composed of rod-like particles which densely compacted together without microcracks. The results of the interfacial shear strength test indicated that the incorporation of lanthanum increased the bonding strength of the HA coating. The mass loss ratios under acidic conditions (pH = 5. 5) suggested that the La-HA coatings have better acid resistance. The cytocompatibility of the La-HA coating was also revealed by the relative activity of alkaline phosphatase, cellular morphology and cell proliferation assay in vitro.
