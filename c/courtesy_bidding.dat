5000|$|Complementary bidding, {{also known}} as cover bidding or <b>courtesy</b> <b>bidding,</b> occurs {{where some of the}} bidders agree to submit bids that are {{intended}} not to be successful, so that another conspirator can win the contract. For example, the cover bids might contain prices that are uncompetitive in relation to the prices submitted by the conspirator who is designated to win the contract, or alternatively, the cover bids might contain conditions that the conspirators know will be unacceptable to the agency calling for the bids.|$|E
60|$|She {{returned}} promptly, and, with a reserved <b>courtesy,</b> <b>bade</b> {{the party}} enter. Then she sent {{her husband and}} the guide to stable the ponies, and fifteen minutes later the travelers reassembled beside the deep-seated window of a great stone-flagged room, darkly wainscoted, which apparently once had been the hall, and was now kitchen. There were a spotless cloth and neat cutlery on the table by the window; trout and bacon, hacked from the sides hanging beneath the smoke-blackened beams, frizzled upon a peat fire; and, though she found neither wine nor potatoes, Mrs. Savine {{said that she had}} not enjoyed such a meal since she left Vancouver.|$|R
60|$|Passing hastily {{through a}} small and mean town, where their {{appearance}} excited neither surprise nor curiosity in the few peasants whom the labours of the harvest began to summon from their repose, the party crossed an ancient and narrow bridge of several arches, and, turning to the left up an avenue of huge old sycamores, Waverley found {{himself in front of}} the gloomy yet picturesque structure which he had admired at a distance. A huge iron-grated door, which formed the exterior defence of the gateway, was already thrown back to receive them; and a second, heavily constructed of oak and studded thickly with iron nails, being next opened, admitted them into the interior court-yard. A gentleman, dressed in the Highland garb and having a white cockade in his bonnet, assisted Waverley to dismount from his horse, and with much <b>courtesy</b> <b>bid</b> him welcome to the castle.|$|R
40|$|Procurement auctions may be {{affected}} by abnormally low bids, whose acceptance may have negative consequences on the auctioneer. A method, based on the average submitted bid, is considered to detect such anomalous bids and aid the auctioneer in the possible rejection decision. Analytical expressions or simulation results are provided for the detection probability and for the false alarm probability. The performances heavily depend {{on the number of}} tenderers and on the dispersion of bid values. Both performance indices improve as the number of tenderers grows and generally degrade as the dispersion grows. The presence of multiple anomalous bids leads to a significant worsening of the performance, while <b>courtesy</b> <b>bids</b> raise both the false alarm probability and the detection probability. The use of the average-bid criterion, though officially endorsed in national legislations, is therefore recommended as a strongly precautionary criterion, i. e. when the need to avoid anomalous bids is considered much more relevant than the costs associated to deeper investigation of anomalous bids or to the erroneous rejection of regular bids.

40|$|Detecting {{abnormally}} low bids in procurement auctions is {{a recognized}} problem, since their acceptance {{could result in}} the winner not being able to provide the service or work awarded by the auction, which is a significant risk for the auctioneer. A rank-and-compare algorithm is considered to detect such anomalous bids and help auctioneers in achieving an effective rejection decision. Analytical expressions and simulation results are provided for the detection probability, {{as well as for the}} false alarm probability. The suggested range of application of the detection algorithm leaves out the cases of many tenderers (more than 20) and quite dispersed bids (coefficient of variation larger than 0. 15). An increase in the number of tenderers leads to contrasting effects, since both the false alarm probability and the detection probability are reduced. If the bids are spread over a large range, we have instead a double negative effect, with more false alarms and less detections. The presence of multiple anomalous bids worsens the performance of the algorithm as well. On the other hand, the method is quite robust to the presence of <b>courtesy</b> <b>bids.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
60|$|Morning parties, as a rule, are failures. People {{never know}} how to get away from them gracefully. A picnic on an island or a {{mountain}} or in a wood may perhaps be permitted. There is no master of the mountain bound by <b>courtesy</b> to <b>bid</b> you stay while in his heart he is longing for your departure. But in a private house or in private grounds a morning party is a bore. One is called on to eat and drink at unnatural hours. One is obliged to give up the day, which is useful, and is then left without resource for the evening, which is useless. One gets home fagged and désoeuvré, and yet at an hour too early for bed. There is no comfortable resource left. Cards in these genteel days are among the things tabooed, and a rubber of whist is impracticable.|$|R
5|$|No. 19 Virginia Tech {{earned a}} bid to the 2009 Orange Bowl via an {{automatic}} <b>bid,</b> <b>courtesy</b> of a 30–12 victory against Boston College in the 2008 ACC Championship Game that saw the Hokies named champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The game was played on January 1, 2009, and also featured the No. 12 Cincinnati Bearcats, champions of the Big East Conference. Pregame {{media coverage of the}} game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history, and despite their bowl-game inexperience, the Bearcats were favored to win by two and a half points on the eve of the game.|$|R
