40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reactions which occur on heating mixtures of Bi compounds and a <b>chloroparaffin,</b> which are suitable fire retardant additives for polymers, have been studied. BiCl 3, which is evolved {{at a high}} initial rate by reaction of Bi compounds with HCl eliminated by the <b>chloroparaffin,</b> has a strong catalytic effect on the dehydrochlorination process of the <b>chloroparaffin</b> itself. BiCl 3 evolution occurs in a two-stage process: a fast step characterised by a maximum rate at 300 °C followed by a slower step which occurs between 300 and 500 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a typical fire retardant <b>chloroparaffin</b> imparts fire retardant characteristics to high density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene is studied by comparing the oxygen indices of these mixtures measured before and after dehydrochlorination. It is shown that flame poisoning by HCl evolved from the <b>chloroparaffin</b> is negligible in polystyrene and high density polyethylene, whereas it is noticeable in polypropylene. The results obtained are related to previous data on the thermal degradation of these mixtures. It is concluded that the <b>chloroparaffin</b> acts mainly by modifying the mechanism of pyrolysis of these polymers in the burning process. Only {{in the case of}} polypropylene is there an appreciable contribution by flame poisoning...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of the products formed by the thermal degradation of PS is modified {{by the presence of}} a fire retardant <b>chloroparaffin.</b> In particular, chain fragments with more than one phenyl group are evolved in larger yield from polystyrene in the mixtures than from the pure polymer, whereas the yield of monomer is decreased. A mechanism of degradation of polystyrene in the mixtures is proposed which accounts for the volatile products evolved. The mechanism of fire retardance by the <b>chloroparaffin</b> is discussed and shown to derive from its action on the thermal degradation reactions which occur in the condensed phase in burning polystyren...|$|E
50|$|Chlorinated {{paraffins}} {{have the}} general sum formula CxH(2x−y+2)Cly and are categorized into three groups: Low molecular weight chlorinated paraffins are short chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> (SCCP) with 10 to 13 carbon atoms, followed by medium chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> (MCCP) with carbon chain lengths of 14 to 17 carbon atoms and long chain chlorinated paraffins (LCCP), owing a carbon chainwith more than 17 carbon atoms. Approximately 70% of the <b>chloroparaffins</b> produced are MCCPs {{with a degree}} of chlorination from 45 to 52%. The remaining 30% are divided equally between SCCP and LCCP. Short chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> have high toxicity and easily accumulate in the environment. The European Union has classified SCCP as a category III carcinogen and restricted its use.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chloroparaffins</b> (CPs) {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of n-alkanes homologues with variable chain lengths and chlorine contents consisting of several thousands of congeners, homologues, isomers and enantiomers. Although <b>chloroparaffins</b> belong to chemicals of high volume production, {{little attention has}} been paid to the analysis and environmental levels of these compounds in the last decades. Short chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> have been included in several regulation programs worldwide since studies demonstrated toxicity to aquatic organisms. However, environmental levels still missing for a detailed risk assessment, especially for aquatic systems. The aim of the work was to develop a method for the determination of short and medium chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> in sediments. The clean-up should be as simple as possible and the detection carried out by high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) coupled to low resolution mass spectrometry (LRMS). In total, three mass spectrometric methods were applied for the detection of <b>chloroparaffins</b> in sediments using different ionization techniques (electron ionization (EI), electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) and chloride attachment chemical ionization (CACI)). They allowed to determine short (SCCP) and medium chain CP (MCCP) levels and patterns in sediments from the North and Baltic Sea. Soxhlet extraction was followed by a clean-up consisting of adsorption chromatography with silica gel and Florisil®, which allowed the separation of CPs from other interfering organochlorines such as polychlorinated biphenyls, toxaphene and DDT-related compounds. At first, thirty three sediments from the North and Baltic Sea were investigated by EI-MS/MS. Secondly, eight additional sediments from the Seine estuary, Tromsø and Hamburg harbour were analysed as well as fifteen suspended particular matter samples from the rivers Rhine, Neckar, Elbe and from the North Sea. EI-MS/MS allowed simultaneous determination of short, medium and long chain <b>chloroparaffins.</b> Concentrations ranged between 5 - 355 ng/g dry weight (d. w.) for the North Sea, 45 - 377 ng/g d. w. for the Baltic Sea, 70 - 156 ng/g d. w. for the Seine estuary and the harbours of Tromsø and Hamburg as well as 127 - 669 ng/g d. w. for the samples from Rhine and Neckar. The application of ECNI-MS and CACI-MS allowed the separate quantification of short and medium chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> and of the homologue and congener group patterns. SCCP concentrations ranged between 8 - 144 ng/g d. w. and MCCP between 23 - 407 ng/g d. w. in twenty eight samples (ECNI-MS). The SCCP and MCCP content was determined in those samples exceeding ca. 50 ng/g total CP. Below this level the quantities were too low for this differentiation based on single formular and congener groups. MCCP levels were highest in all samples. Differences in the CP patterns were obtained. Sea sediments were predominated by chlorinated doand tridecanes and those from rivers, harbours and suspended particular matter samples by chlorinated un- and dodecanes. No difference was observed between the MCCP patterns. Concentrations obtained by CACI-MS were in the range of 13 - 128 ng/g d. w. for SCCP and between 36 - 303 ng/g d. w. for MCCP in eighteen sediments from the North and Baltic Sea. The MCCP/SCCP ratios varied between 1. 5 and 3. 2 and were in good agreement (< 25...|$|R
50|$|Although some C14 alpha olefin is {{sold into}} aqueous {{detergent}} applications, C14 has other {{applications such as}} being converted into <b>chloroparaffins.</b> A recent application of C14 is as on-land drilling fluid basestock, replacing diesel or kerosene in that application. Although C14 is more expensive than middle distillates, it has a significant advantage environmentally, being much more biodegradable and in handling the material, being much less irritating to skin and less toxic.|$|R
40|$|From {{oxygen and}} nitrous oxide indices of polypropylene-chlorinated {{paraffin}} mixtures {{it can be}} deduced that, {{in addition to the}} flame poisoning effect of HCl eliminated by the <b>chloroparaffin,</b> the lower flammability of the volatile products formed by thermal degradation of polypropylene heated in the presence of this additive seems to contribute to its fire retardance activit...|$|E
40|$|When {{polypropylene}} is thermally degraded {{in mixtures}} {{with a highly}} chlorinated fire retardant <b>chloroparaffin,</b> a smaller amount of the lighter hydrocarbon fraction, which is also modified in composition, is evolved compared with that evolved from pure polypropylene. A corresponding increase {{in the amount of}} high boiling chain fragments is obtained from the mixtures. This effect can be explained in terms of the interactions which occur between degrading polymer and additiv...|$|E
40|$|In {{mixtures}} of polystyrene {{with a fire}} retardant <b>chloroparaffin,</b> the rate of volatilisation of the polymer is initially increased during the thermal dehydrochlorination of the additive. In the residue which results, the volatilisation of polystyrene occurs at a lower rate than when it is heated alone. The mechanisms of the reactions which occur in the mixture are discussed and related to the fire retardant action of the chloroparaffi...|$|E
40|$|The short-chain <b>chloroparaffins</b> (SCCP), (C 10 - 13 chloroalkanes) are {{identified}} in the European Water Framework Directive, as priority hazardous substances. Within the ScorePP project, {{the aim is to}} develop emission control strategies that can be employed to reduce emissions from urban areas into receiving waters. Six different scenarios for mitigating SCCP emissions in two different semi-hypothetical case cities representing eastern inland and northern coastal conditions have been evaluated. The analysis, associated with scenario uncertainty, indicates that the EU legislation, Best Available Technologies (BAT) and stormwater/CSO management were the most favorable in reducing emissions into the environment...|$|R
40|$|The infinite-dilution {{activity}} coefficients (γ∞) of paraffins, olefins, <b>chloroparaffins,</b> aromatics, alcohols, ethers, and acetates {{were measured}} by medium-pressure gasliquid chromatography (GLC) in alkanediamines: octane- 1, 8 -diamine, decane- 1, 10 -diamine, and dodecane- 1, 12 -diamine at temperatures from (328. 15 to 363. 15) K. The present measurements show good agreement with available literature data. The partial molar excess enthalpies at infinite dilution were {{calculated from the}} experimental γi∞ values obtained over the temperature range.

50|$|By photochlorination <b>chloroparaffins</b> can be {{prepared}} from alkanes. Compared to thermal chlorination, {{the risk of the}} formation of secondary products by thermolysis (for example, by elimination of hydrogen chloride) is very small. The selectivity is low because the reaction takes place by a radical mechanism. Mixtures of complex composition consisting of several chlorinated paraffins are formed. The degree of chlorination varies and the exact composition of the resulting product mixtures is often not known. In 1985 the world production was 300,000 tonnes; since then the production volumes are falling in Europe and North America. In China, on the other hand, production rose sharply. China produced more than 600,000 tonnes of chlorinated paraffins in 2007, while in 2004 it was less than 100,000 tonnes.|$|R
40|$|The main {{characteristics}} {{of the evolution of}} HCl and SbCl 3 during the thermal degradation of chloroparaffin-Sb 2 O 3 mixtures, which are typical fire retardant additives for polymers, have been studied. Sb 2 O 3 reacts with HCl evolved from the <b>chloroparaffin</b> without any apparent effect on the dehydrochlorination process itself. Evolution of SbCl 3 occurs at a maximum rate between 300 and 350 °C and is somewhat delayed in the earlier stage of reaction, depending on the composition of the mixture...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{is given}} that the thermal {{behaviour}} of a mixture of polypropylene and a fire retardant chlorinated paraffin (Cl 70 %) is not the sum of their individual behaviours. An interaction is shown {{to take place in}} the degrading mixtures which is related to the low temperature dehydrochlorination step of the <b>chloroparaffin.</b> This occurs at temperatures at which pure polypropylene is stable and leads to an increase in the overall rate of volatilisation of the mixtures compared with that of the separate components. A partial overlapping of volatilisation of polymer and additive, which otherwise degrade in two well separated temperature ranges when heated alone, is observed. The relevance of these observations to the mechanism of fire retardance is discusse...|$|E
40|$|Volatilisation of {{mixtures}} of {{high density polyethylene}} (PE) with a fire retardant <b>chloroparaffin</b> (CP) occurs in two separate steps on programmed heating. CP eliminates HCl at 250 - 370 °C whilst, at 400 - 530 °C, hydrocarbons are formed by quantitative volatilisation of PE. However, chlorine radicals which propagate the thermal dehydro-chlorination of CP induce crosslinking of PE. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} CP, a larger ratio of saturated to unsaturated hydrocarbons is obtained than from PE alone. The fire retardant activity of CP in PE-CP mixtures, although slight, is likely to be of the 'condensed phase' type. This is in agreement with the separate evolution of the flame inhibitor HCl, and flammable hydrocarbons and with the change in the composition of the hydrocarbons evolved by PE degrading in the presence of C...|$|E
