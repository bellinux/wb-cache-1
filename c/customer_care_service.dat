40|$|Abstract: For Open and Distance Learning (ODL) {{institutions}} {{to remain competitive}} {{in the face of}} stiff competition from other providers of higher education, it is imperative that they raise their <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services,</b> so as to be able to attract and retain the students they already have. <b>Customer</b> <b>care</b> is now the cornerstone of student satisfaction, and students are now spoilt for choice with regards to the available higher education institutions in which they can study with. It is critical to realize that the customer in institutions of higher learning go beyond the student, but include parents, research sponsors, accreditation bodies, employers and the society in general. This research paper however will be limited to the <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> provided to the students by the Zimbabwe Open University through the department of student affairs, as a way to delight the students and form a long term relationship with them. It {{is important to note that}} <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> cannot be successfully achieved, if issues of quality services are not addressed. This study was a survey carried out to establish the <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> provided to Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) students by the department of student affairs. Ten student advisors were purposively selected from the ten regional centres and interviewed. The results showed that various <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> were provided by student advisors starting from the moment the student advisor interacts with prospective student up to the time they graduate and form the alumni.

40|$|Customer {{relationship}} management (CRM) is a customer-focused {{business strategy}} that dynamically integrates sales, marketing and <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> {{in order to}} create and add value for the company and its customers. This change towards a customer-focused strategy is leading to a strong demand for CRM solutions by companies. However, in spite of companies' interest in this new management model, many CRM implementations fail. One of the main reasons for this lack of success is that the existing methodologies being used to approach a CRM project are not adequate, since they do not satisfactorily integrate and complement the strategic and technological aspects of CRM. This paper describes a formal methodology for directing the process of developing and implementing a CRM System that considers and integrates various aspects, such as defining a customer strategy, human resources management, management of change and continuous improvement...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify themes from dialogues of telephone conversations in a real-life <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>service.</b> In order to capture significant semantic content in spite of high expression variability, features are extracted in a large number of hidden spaces constructed with a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach. Multiple views of a spoke document can then be represented with several hidden topic models. Nonetheless, the model diversity due to the multi-model approach introduces a new type of variability. An approach is proposed based on features extracted in a common homogenous subspace with the purpose of reducing the multi-span representation variability. A Gaussian Mixture Model subspace model, inspired by previous work on speaker identification, is proposed for theme identification. This representation, novel for theme classification, is compared with the direct application of multiple topic-model representations. Experiments are reported using a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris Transportation Service. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed representation paradigm with a theme identification accuracy of 78. 8 %, showing a significant improvement with respect to previous results on the same corpus...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify themes from dialogues of telephone conversations in a real-life <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>service.</b> In this task, the word semantic variability contained in these conversations may impact the classification performance by retaining the noise in their vectorial representation. In this article, we propose an original method to compensate this semantic variability using the Factor Analysis (FA) paradigm, initially designed for speech processing tasks to compensate the acoustic variability, mainly in Speaker Verification (SV) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In our proposal, we used the FA paradigm to estimate the semantic variability as an additive component located in a subspace of low dimension (with respect to the super-vector space). This additive semantic variability is estimated in Factor Analysis model space. From this estimation, a specific vector transformation is obtained and is applied to vectors of dialogue representation. Experiments are reported using a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris Transportation Service. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed representation paradigm with a theme identification accuracy of 80. 0 %, showing a significant improvement with respect to previous results on the same corpus...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{automatic}} analysis of conversations between a customer and an agent in a call centre of a <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>service.</b> The purpose of the analysis is to hypothesize themes about problems and complaints discussed in the conversation. Themes are defined by the application documentation topics. A conversation may contain mentions that are irrelevant for the application purpose and multiple themes whose mentions may be interleaved portions of a conversation that cannot be well defined. Two methods are proposed for multiple theme hypothesization. One of them {{is based on a}} cosine similarity measure using a bag of features extracted from the entire conversation. The other method introduces the concept of thematic density distributed around specific word positions in a conversation. In addition to automatically selected words, word bi-grams with possible gaps between successive words are also considered and selected. Experimental results show that the results obtained with the proposed methods outperform the results obtained with support vector machines on the same data. Furthermore, using the theme skeleton of a conversation from which thematic densities are derived, {{it will be possible to}} extract components of an automatic conversation report to be used for improving the service performance.

40|$|In {{day to day}} life, {{messengers}} or chatting applications provide {{facility for}} instant messaging over the internet. Exchange of messages takes place in universally used languages like English, French, etc. where both the users know how to communicate in a common language. Thus chatting on mobile phones is a luxury when both the parties involved know a common language. When any company wants to provide <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> to its <b>customer</b> they use mediums like talking to the customers over the telephone which requires employees that are proficient in speaking various languages and set up large numbers of call centers to serve the customers worldwide. Hence we have implemented ALLTALK™ which is a Windows 8 phone based chatting application which makes cross language communication possible using mobile programming and networking technology. This application will enable the communication between two persons irrespective of the language each user wishes to use individually. The various modes of communication available in this messenger are through text and voice. Due to the best processing power provided among the available smartphones and high battery life we choose to work on windows 8 platform. This application provides a facility which enables service providers companies to provide <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> to their <b>customers</b> in their native languages without the need of employees being skilled in various languages.
