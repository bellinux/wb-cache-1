In this context, this article aims to test a temporal filtering technique to replace missing pixels after filtering clouds, from the observation of time series EVI images before and after the altered image, estimating values from the average between these images, but with an attention to pixels with null values. Two models (1 and 2) were tested in IDL environment routine. Observing the vegetation index and the temporal profile after the temporal filtering, the model 2 had more spatial coherence with the neighboring pixels, with a better continuity of the profile over time.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the EU Commission, the EFSA PLH Panel {{conducted}} a scientific opinion on risk analysis and supporting documents provided by APHIS/USDA {{in support of the}} request to remove the Union's plant health import requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where, {{since the beginning of the}} last <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> no symptoms of citrus canker were observed, neither in their vicinities. The PHL Panel concluded that the transmission of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) on asymptomatic citrus fruit was more likely when the fruit were collected from infested than from non-infested areas and groves. Symptomatic fruit carries more Xcc cells than asymptomatic fruit and the packinghouse disinfectant treatments do not achieve the eradication of Xcc. The application of management option 2 (i. e. „allow distribution of all types and varieties of commercially packed citrus fruit to all US States, subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved disinfectant. No packinghouse phytosanitary inspection is required‟) selected by USDA will result in an increase in the Xcc load of citrus fruit consignments and in a subsequent increase in the probability of spread of citrus canker through the fruit pathway. Some data provided in the APHIS-USDA documents support that citrus fruit remain a conceptually possible pathway for transmitting and establishing citrus canker disease. The PLH Panel agrees that transmission of Xcc from infected fruit to a susceptible host is rare. But the withdrawal of the current EU requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where no symptoms of citrus canker have been observed in the field of production and in its immediate vicinity since the beginning of the last <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation,</b> will increase the probability of introduction of Xcc into new areas...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} causes for, and {{distribution}} of, unimodal versus bimodal seasonal <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> greenness in the Southwest United States using extensive site observations, climate data, satellite data, and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) vegetation model. Peak vegetation greenness is achieved in a clockwise manner across the Southwest, beginning in {{spring in the}} Sonoran Desert following winter rains, then in Utah-Colorado with snowmelt/summer rains, and finally in New Mexico–eastern Arizona with late summer monsoon rains. At high elevations, spring-summer snowmelt is critical for supplying the necessary soil moisture to trigger vegetation growth. A bimodal seasonal <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> greenness is evident in satellite data and LPJ simulations across eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, characterized by peaks during late spring–early summer and late summer–early autumn. This bimodal green-up remains a pressing paradox for which many competing hypotheses exist. The mechanism for this seasonal pattern is demonstrated using LPJ and observational data and is found to deviate from the traditional pulse-reserve paradigm. This paradigm states that rainfall events in arid lands produce nearly immediate pulses of vegetation growth and accumulation of reserves but does not consider cold dormancy, time-lagged vegetation responses, or rainfall seasonality. The following soil moisture based mechanism for bimodal greening is proposed. The initial peak in vegetation greenness during late spring–early summer results from a break in cold dormancy and benefits from the gradual winter-long accumulation of deep soil moisture from weak synoptic rain events and snowmelt in colder regions. Limited precipitation and ongoing transpiration, from the initial vegetation greening, trigger a midsummer drying of the soil and a consequential minimum in vegetation activity. Later, pulses of monsoon rainfall in late summer–early autumn support the secondary greening, although significant runoff of brief, intense rainstorms and substantial soil evaporation limit moisture to the upper soil layers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{investigation}} of the phylogeny {{of a group of}} organisms has the potential to identify ecological and evolutionary processes that have been occurring within a community. Seed dispersal is a key process in the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> and reflects different reproductive strategies of plants to a set of ecological and evolutionary factors. Knowing the dispersal syndromes and fruits types of a plant community may help elucidate plant-animal interactions and colonization strategies of plants. We investigated dispersal syndromes and fruit types in Cerrado formations as a parameter for understanding the evolution of angiosperm reproductive strategies in this mega-diverse tropical biome. To do this we identified and mapped the distribution of different parameters associated with seed dispersal on a phylogeny of Cerrado angiosperms genera and tested the presence of phylogenetic signal. The results showed that there were strong relationships between fruit types, seed dispersal strategies and vegetation life forms and that these traits were closely related to angiosperms phylogeny and, together, contribute to the evolution of plants in the forest, savanna and grassland formations of the Cerrado biome...|$|E

An early blizzard episode that occurs in October it is an extreme event with severe consequences over people, environment and agriculture. In Romania, since the first synoptic observations are made, the earliest blizzard phenomenon was recorded on October 21, 1931 at Dorohoi (Botoșani County–North Romania) and another one on October 22, 1938 at Sinaia (Prahova County–South-East Romania).

Lengths of the whole <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> and its individual stages were essentially same as in ground control experiments. Dry mass of one plants equal, the number of headed shoots was in 2. 7 times less in the flight harvest as compared with the control. The height of shoots was reduced by one half.

40|$|Land surface phenological <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{greening}} and browning {{are influenced}} by variability in climatic forcing. Quantitative spatial information on phenological cycles and their variability is important for agricultural applications, wildfire fuel accumulation, land management, land surface modeling, and climate change studies. Most phenology {{studies have focused on}} temperature-driven Northern Hemisphere systems, where phenology shows annually recurring patterns. However, precipitation-driven non-annual phenology of arid and semi-arid systems (i. e., drylands) received much less attention, {{despite the fact that they}} cover more than 30 % of the global land surface. Here, we focused on Australia, a continent with one of the most variable rainfall climates in the world and vast areas of dryland systems, where a detailed phenological investigation and a characterization of the relationship between phenology and climate variability are missing. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed an algorithm to characterize phenological cycles, and analyzed geographic and climate-driven variability in phenology from 2000 to 2013, which included extreme drought and wet years. We linked derived phenological metrics to rainfall and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). We conducted a continent-wide investigation and a more detailed investigation over the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), the primary agricultural area and largest river catchment of Australia.

Characteristic features of wheat development in space flight are plentiful early tillering, and formation and rapid growth of side shoots. Elementary spikelets in the composite head were more numerous but the top spikelets were rudimentary and, therefore, the ripe head contained less of these spikelets as compared with the ground controls (9 - 13 and 14, respectively). The number of florets in a spike was also higher reaching 14 - 16 vs. 7 - 8 in the control. Typically, no more than 4 to 5 florets vs. 3 in the control were fully differentiated while the others died off earlier in development. The fact that there were no caryopses found in the flight crop is explained by absolute male sterility appearing at different stages of staminal development: before archesporium formation, on the stage of differentiated archesporium, during meiosis, on the stage of microspores or uninucleate "pollen". The female generative system developed mainly without abnormalities.

After the maximum the presence of Phyllocladus-Nothofagus-Eucalyptus-Microstrobos suggests deterioration to subalpine woodland/shrubland, and Compositae, Gramineae-Microstrobos to alpine shrubland and herbland.

For this investigation the annual <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> is implemented in the land surface parameterization scheme of REMO. As input data source a new global dataset of land surface parameters is used. It contains monthly varying vegetation parameter values for leaf area index, fractional vegetation cover and background surface albedo. This dataset is adapted to both standard REMO model domains at 0. 5 degree and 0. l 6 degree horizontal resolution focusing Europe. For both resolutions present-day climate simulations are performed to examine the sensitivity of REMO to the modified vegetation parameterization. The simulation results are compared to corresponding reference simulations where vegetation parameter values are held constant in time.

A significant influence of monthly varying vegetation on the regional climate can be demonstrated. Vertical surface fluxes, near surface temperature and precipitation are strongly affected. The temporal analysis of the results reveals that the vegetation effect on the simulated climate occurs mainly in the summer season. In general, the simulated near-surface climate becomes cooler and wetter during the growing season. Concerning the spatial resolution, main effects can be detected in eastern Europe and the Hungarian lowlands.

Point au Sauble, a Green Bay coastal wetland, was an open water lagoon as of 1999, but became entirely vegetated as Lake Michigan experienced a prolonged period of below-average water levels. Repeat visits in 2001 and 2004 documented {{a dramatic change in}} emergent wetland vegetation communities. In 2001 non-native Phragmites and Typha were present but their cover was sparse; in 2004 half of the transect was covered by a 3 m tall, invasive Phragmites and non-native Typha community. Percent similarity between plant species present in 2001 versus 2004 was approximately 19 % (Jaccard's coefficient), indicating dramatic changes in species composition that took place in only 3 years. The height of the dominant herbaceous plants and coverage by invasive species were significantly higher in 2004 than they were in 2001. However, floristic quality index and coefficient of conservatism were greater in 2004 than 2001. Cover by plant litter did not differ between 2001 and 2004. The prolonged period of below-average water levels between 1999 and early 2004 exposed unvegetated lagoon bottoms as mudflats, which provided substrate for new plant colonization and created conditions conducive to colonization by invasive taxa.

40|$|Projected {{changes in}} the Earth system will likely be {{manifested}} in changes in reflected solar radiation. This paper introduces an operational Observational System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) to calculate the signals of future climate forcings and feedbacks in top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra. The OSSE combines simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report for the NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM) with the MODTRAN radiative transfer code to calculate reflectance spectra for simulations of current and future climatic conditions over the 21 st century. The OSSE produces narrowband reflectances and broadband fluxes, the latter {{of which have been}} extensively validated against archived CCSM results. The shortwave reflectance spectra contain atmospheric features including signals from water vapor, liquid and ice clouds, and aerosols. The spectra are also strongly influenced by the surface bidirectional reflectance properties of predicted snow and sea ice and the climatological seasonal <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation.</b> By comparing and contrasting simulated reflectance spectra based on emissions scenarios with increasing projected and fixed present-day greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, we find that prescribed forcings from increases in anthropogenic sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols are detectable and are spatially confined to lower latitudes.

These findings suggest that the proposed NASA Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission to measure shortwave reflectance spectra may help elucidate climate forcings, responses, and feedbacks...|$|R
40|$|The annual <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> growth may {{be altered}} in {{response}} to climate changes affecting ecosystem dynamics. However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982 – 2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VGrate) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VGrate of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VGrate and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67 % of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VGrate to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VGrate acceleration in warm years (0. 07 (15 -day) ! 1) {{is larger than the}} VGrate deceleration in cold years (! 0. 03 (15 -day) ! 1), suggesting that the response of VGrate to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present work {{within the context of}} the EBONE {{objectives}} is to investigate if leaf phenology indicators as derived from SPOT and MODIS NDVI time series can provide useful information for the detection and mapping of forest habitats, with specific reference to the General Habitat Category scheme. The report is divided into three main parts. The first part focuses on a description of the Phenolo model. This includes the pre-processing and processing steps applied to extract leaf phenology indicators from SPOT and MODIS data, and a short analysis of the spatial distribution of a selection of phenometrics in test areas. The second part introduces two pilot habitat classification tests using the Random Forests™ approach and SPOT NDVI data. The last part focuses on investigating the intercalibration of GHCs with MODIS-derived phenometrics. Random Forests classifications were tested in a variety of configurations and accuracy checked using the JRC Forest Map 2006. A set of 31 leaf phenology indicators (phenometrics) was extracted using JRC Phenolo model from a time series of NDVI ten day Maximum Value composites of six years (MODIS) and eleven years (SPOT). The Phenolo model considers an annual <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> leaf phenology as represented by one permanent component, or ‘background’ and a variable component, function of seasonal dynamics. Pre-processing involved substitution of no data, outlier analysis and filtering. NDVI time series processing involved the extraction of date and productivity phenometrics. The model, coded in IDL, provided fast calculations in a stable environment. The performance of the Random Forests classifications and the contribution of individual phenometrics were tested through the calculation of the Mean Decrease Accuracy parameter (MDA). Overall, the results suggest date phenometrics to be more important for forest habitat classification than productivity phenometrics, especially indicators defined around the Peak of Season point and the NDVI curve minima. Apart from areas with spatially and spectrally homogeneous forest habitat classes (Coniferous forests in Austria), the overall classification accuracy achieved with the Random Forests approach using MODIS-based phenology indicators is generally not satisfactory. We identified three main factors influencing these result: the spatial/spectral heterogeneity present in the GHC forest polygons and subsequently in the training pixels associated to these classes: the low number of training pixels available and the use of an independent dataset to calculate accuracy which was built uniquely on spectral information. The introduction of artificial data gaps within the MODIS NDVI time series did not influence significantly classification accuracy. On the basis of the investigation results, the following remarks were made: 1) the spatial scale of current EObased phenology data (250 m) is at the edge of an adequate resolution for effective habitat classification with respect to GHC categories and field data; 2) It is recommended to build a large dataset of GHC training pixels in order to take into account the high spectral variability present within single GHC classes and 3) Adequate classification accuracy assessment should be based on a reference dataset which takes into account as much as possible the elements of heterogeneity typical of the GHCs. The structural (height) characteristics of the life forms types considered in the General Habitat Category scheme are very valuable information which should be taken into account when using EO-derived information. For this reason, for the purpose of GHCs classification a strategy that integrates EO-based phenology indicators with EO derived information on vegetation structure, from e. g. LiDAR or high resolution radar, could potentially be more effective than only a phenology-based approach. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E

Over the last decades consistent monitoring efforts of various national networks have created a wealth of pollen concentration time series. These constitute a nearly untouched treasure, which is still to be exploited to investigate questions concerning pollen emission, transport and deposition. New monitoring methods allow measuring the allergen content in pollen. Results from research on the allergen content in pollen are expected to increase {{the quality of the}} operational pollen forecasts...|$|R

Soil moisture data from the VIC (variable infiltration capacity) model and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was analyzed using the SAD (severity-area-duration) method to investigate the soil moisture differences between natural droughts and agricultural droughts. The model was used to reconstruct and evaluate the 2000 to 2008 droughts in the Colorado River Basin. The {{results indicate that the}} NDVIP (normalized difference vegetation index percentile) and SMP (soil moisture percentile) models can both be used for drought reconstruction with the durations of droughts detected by NDVIP tending to be shorter than those predicted by SMP. NDVIP has better potential for detecting drought and wetness, though the predictions are limited by the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation...</b>|$|R

The Study area is in the semi-arid region, State of Pernambuco, Brazil. We pretend to work with EVI and meteorological data since 2000, but until now we have EVI data only from February 2000 to December 2002, and meteorological data from December 2000 to December 2002. We could observed as partial results of multi-temporal EVI data that: i) the phenology of caatinga resulted in changes in values of EVI, where the highest values occurred during the wet months, from January to March; ii) the values of EVI in irrigation area were approximately constant due the soil of this area were under optimum water conditions.

40|$|The {{radionuclide}} burden <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> comprising a tide-washed pasture at Ince Marsh in the Mersey Estuary, U. K., derives {{mainly from}} adhered external particulates originating as suspended sediments in estuarine water. Radionuclide concentrations {{are dominated by}} the growth <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vegetation,</b> with the highest winter levels of contamination activity {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the lowest levels in mid-summer. A secondary effect due to sediment transfer during periods of severe flooding produces subsidiary features on this dominant seasonal profile. Radionuclide concentrations on vegetation are in the range 137 Cs= 8 – 191, 134 Cs= 0. 3 – 0. 9, 241 Am= 0. 6 – 46, 238 Pu= 0. 1 – 1. 5, and 239 / 240 Pu= 0. 8 – 44 Bq kg− 1. These ranges reflect the relative concentrations of radionuclides in estuarine sediment (137 Cs= 615, 241 Am= 202, and 239 / 240 Pu= 104 Bq kg− 1) rather than the values in filtered estuary water (137 Cs= 0. 4, 241 Am= 0. 001, and 239 / 240 Pu= 0. 001 Bq 1 − 1).

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades Central Asia has {{experienced}} widespread changes in land cover and land use following the socio-economic and institutional transformations of the region catalyzed by the USSR collapse in 1991. The decade-long drought events and steadily increasing temperature regimes in the region came on top of these institutional transformations, affecting the long term and landscape scale vegetation responses. This research is based on the need to better understand the potential ecological and policy implications of climate variation and land use practices in the contexts of landscape-scale changes dynamics and variability patterns of land surface phenology responses in Central Asia. The land surface phenology responses - the spatio-temporal dynamics <b>of</b> terrestrial <b>vegetation</b> derived from the remotely sensed data - provide measurements linked to the timing <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> growth <b>cycles</b> (e. g., start of growing season) and total vegetation productivity over the growing season, which are used as a proxy for the assessment of effects of variations in environmental settings. Local and regional scale assessment of the before and after the USSR collapse vegetation response patterns in the natural and agricultural systems of the Central Asian drylands was conducted to characterize newly emerging links (since 1991) between coupled human and natural systems, e. g., socio-economic and policy drivers of altered land and water use and distribution patterns. Spatio-temporal patterns of bioclimatic responses were examined to determine how phenology is associated with temperature and precipitation in different land use types, including rainfed and irrigated agricultural types. Phenological models were developed to examine relationship between environmental drivers and effect of their altitudinal and latitudinal gradients on the broad-scale vegetation response patterns in non-cropland ecosystems of the desert, steppe, and mountainous regional landscapes of Central Asia. The study results demonstrated that the satellite derived measurements <b>of</b> temporal <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> greenness and productivity data was a valuable bioclimatic integrator of climatic and land use variation in Central Asia. The synthesis of broad-scale phenological changes in Central Asia showed that linkages of natural and human systems vary across space and time comprising complex and tightly integrated patterns and processes that are not evident when studied separately...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{has emerged as}} a major driver of {{ecosystem}} change. Here, we present evidence for globally consistent responses in vegetation dynamics to recent climate change in the world’s mountain ecosystems located in the pan-tropical belt (30 °N– 30 °S). We analyzed decadal-scale trends and seasonal <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> greenness using monthly time series of satellite greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and climate data for the period 1982 – 2006 for 47 mountain protected areas in five biodiversity hotspots. The time series of annual maximum NDVI for each of five continental regions shows mild greening trends followed by reversal to stronger browning trends around the mid- 1990 s. During the same period we found increasing trends in temperature but only marginal change in precipitation. The amplitude of the annual greenness cycle increased with time, and was strongly associated with the observed increase in temperature amplitude. We applied dynamic models with time-dependent regression parameters to study the time evolution of NDVI–climate relationships. We found that the relationship between vegetation greenness and temperature weakened over time or was negative. Such loss of positive temperature sensitivity has been documented in other regions as a response to temperature-induced moisture stress. We also used dynamic models to extract the trends in vegetation greenness that remain after accounting for the effects of temperature and precipitation. We found residual browning and greening trends in all regions, which indicate that factors other than temperature and precipitation also influence vegetation dynamics. Browning rates became progressively weaker with increase in elevation as indicated by quantile regression models. Tropical mountain vegetation is considered sensitive to climatic changes, so these consistent vegetation responses across widespread regions indicate persistent global-scale effects of climate warming and associated moisture stresses...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{vegetation}} mapping methods use high cost, labour-intensive aerial photography interpretation. This {{approach can}} be subjective and is limited by {{factors such as the}} extent <b>of</b> remnant <b>vegetation,</b> and the differing scale and quality of aerial photography over time. An alternative approach is proposed which integrates a data model, a statistical model and an ecological model using sophisticated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques and rule-based systems to support fine-scale vegetation community modelling. This approach is based on a more realistic representation <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> patterns with transitional gradients from one vegetation community to another. Arbitrary, though often unrealistic, sharp boundaries can be imposed on the model by the application of statistical methods. This GIS-integrated multivariate approach is applied to the problem <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> mapping in the complex <b>vegetation</b> communities <b>of</b> the Innisfail Lowlands in the Wet Tropics bioregion of Northeastern Australia. The paper presents the full <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> this <b>vegetation</b> modelling approach including sampling sites, variable selection, model selection, model implementation, internal model assessment, model prediction assessments, models integration <b>of</b> discrete <b>vegetation</b> community models to generate a composite pre-clearing vegetation map, independent data set model validation and model prediction 2 ̆ 7 s scale assessments. An accurate pre-clearing <b>vegetation</b> map <b>of</b> the Innisfail Lowlands was generated (0. 83 r(2)) through GIS integration of 28 separate statistical models. This modelling approach has good potential for wider application, including provision of. vital information for conservation planning and management; a scientific basis for rehabilitation of disturbed and cleared areas; a viable method for the production <b>of</b> adequate <b>vegetation</b> maps for conservation and forestry planning of poorly-studied areas.

40|$|Micrometeorological {{measurements}} of the surface flux of carbon dioxide were made {{at a number of}} spatially separate sites within the HAPEX-Sahel experimental area. Differences in the timing of plant development caused by differences in rainfall (both quantity and frequency) over the experimental area exert a major influence on the absolute magnitude of the surface flux of carbon made simultaneously over the experimental area. Surface fluxes are presented for the three major types <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> in the Sahelian landscape, namely, millet, savannah and tiger bush. The atmospheric and surface controls on the surface flux of CO 2 are described for these three land surfaces and the fluxes are compared between sites.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} dense alien plant invasion on vegetation development following clearing, from a nutrient-acquisition perspective. The majority of fynbos plants form arbuscular mycorrhizas but Hakea and Pinus, {{two of the most}} invasive alien plant genera in mountain fynbos, do not. We hypothesised that these aliens would negatively impact on arbuscular mycorrhizal infectivity and thereby influence post-clearing vegetation development. The mycorrhizal status <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> at two mountain fynbos sites was compared between invaded and uninvaded sites before clearing and after alien clearing and fire. On cleared sites, non-mycorrhizal guilds were under-represented and arbuscular mycorrhizal guilds were over-represented. Soil arbuscular mycorrhizal infectivity and spore numbers were not affected by alien plants, possibly because an understorey of arbuscular mycorrhizal species had persisted in the alien stands. We conclude that following a single <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> dense alien <b>vegetation,</b> arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species are not negatively affected and that other effects <b>of</b> alien <b>vegetation</b> on the environment are responsible for changes in plant guilds. Soil under alien plants was enriched and this {{may have contributed to the}} success of the arbuscular mycorrhizal guild after clearing...|$|R
40|$|Water {{quality data}} {{spanning}} 13 years and covering an extensive range of major, minor and trace elements in rain and stream waters at Plynlimon in mid Wales, are presented. Rainfall water chemistry is highly variable due to varying proportions of marine and pollutant derived constituents associated with patterns of atmospheric circulation. Stream waters, being composed of different proportions of waters from three chemically distinct sources {{at any one}} time (atmospheric deposition, the soil system and deeper groundwaters), are also chemically highly variable. For example, components predominantly derived from deposition such as chloride change only in response to sea-salt deposition episodes. Solutes associated with bedrock weathering such as calcium, magnesium, and alkalinity decrease with increasing flow, those associated with the upper soil layers such as aluminium, many transition metals, dissolved organic carbon and hydrogen ions increase with increasing flow. The nutrients (e. g. nitrate, boron, bromide and iodine) exhibit strong seasonal cycles associated with <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetation</b> growth and decay. The changes in stream water chemistry resulting from tree harvesting in the Afon Hore catchment are shown to have run their course within a period of eight years. Nutrient increases in the first few years following the commencement of felling have returned to or fallen below pre-felling values. Aluminium changes are shown to be complicated by changes in nitrate and calcium. Aluminium concentrations initially increased and have fallen below their pre-felling value. Data for chloride suggest a reduction in capture of dry and mist deposition; this indicates the importance of understanding reduced deposition as a result of felling. Felling has also affected the soil micro-climate which experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and an increase in the concentration of constituents associated with organic matter. Input-output mass balance estimates show that atmospheric inputs of many constituents are retained strongly by the catchment (e. g. ammonium, phosphate, barium, boron, lead and iodine). In contrast, many of the transition elements as well as divalent base cations, aluminium and alkalinity show a net release from the catchment. Conservative constituents such as chloride and sodium show a net input-output balance. ...|$|R
