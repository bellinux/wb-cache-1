5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.

The <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.|$|E
5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2009, at {{the closing}} {{performance}} of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas had not had the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and had not had them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{assessment of the}} load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> of piles based on static approach with special consideration to steel as pile type in cohesive and cohesionless soils is reported in this paper. Uncertainties are common phenomena in engineering, therefore all the interrelated variables in the load <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> are treated as random variables with assumed practical probability density functions. The concept of the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) is {{a powerful tool for}} estimating nominal probability level of failure associated with uncertainties and it is the method invoked for the reliability estimations. From the results, it can be concluded that steel piling should be encouraged in cohesive and cohesionless soils; it is good to use steel piles in cohesionless soils...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} developed a simulation framework (SPLATCHE) {{to model the}} past demography of human population and the resulting genetic diversity at neutral markers. Additional to range expansions and population subdivisions, we increase here the realism of our simulations by incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environment. This heterogeneity can be translated into maps of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> (maximum density of individuals) and frictions (difficulty of moving) that will in turn influence the size of local populations and the direction {{and the intensity of}} migrations. We have considered the influence of several environmental variables: the type of vegetation directly affects the available resource and therefore the carrying capacities; streams and coastlines act as migration corridors with higher <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> than the surrounding environment; a rough topography may also drastically influence migrations. We discuss in this paper each of these environmental variables and how one can estimate <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> and friction values for each of them. We also present an innovative way of considering dynamic changes of vegetation through temporal vegetation heterogeneity. Finally, we examine how environmental heterogeneity might affect genetic differentiation of human populations, and discuss the limitations and perspectives of our approach...|$|R
