40|$|<b>Cefonicid</b> (Smith Kline & French Laboratories; D- 75073) {{is a new}} {{parenteral}} cephalosporin with a markedly long half-life, high serum levels, {{and good}} in vitro activity against Haemophilus influenzae. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia were randomized 2 : 1 to receive <b>cefonicid,</b> 1 g daily (21 cases) or cefamandole, 1 g every 6 h (12 cases). The two groups were similar, except that the <b>cefonicid</b> patients were older (mean 42 versus 31 years). Peak serum levels of <b>cefonicid</b> averaged 133 microgram/ml after intravenous and 83 microgram/ml after intramuscular administration compared with 55 microgram/ml with intravenous cefamandole. All 9 patients on intramuscular <b>cefonicid</b> and 8 or 12 patients on intravenous <b>cefonicid</b> had trough serum levels of greater than 2. 0 microgram/ml at 24 h. Sputum levels of <b>cefonicid</b> were usually between 2. 0 and 4. 0 microgram/ml and did not correlate with serum levels. <b>Cefonicid</b> was well tolerated, and all <b>cefonicid</b> patients responded clinically. Sputum cultures for H. influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae became negative in 6 of 7 cefamandole patients and 13 or 15 <b>cefonicid</b> patients. In in vitro studies, <b>cefonicid</b> inhibited 90 % of beta-lactamase-negative h. influenzae at 0. 5 microgram/ml and beta-lactamase-positive strains at 2. 0 microgram/ml. <b>Cefonicid</b> inhibited 50 % of S. pneumoniae at 1. 6 microgram/ml, but required 6. 4 microgram/ml to inhibit 90 %. <b>Cefonicid</b> once a day appears to be as safe and as effective as cefamandole {{four times a day}} for therapy of community-acquired pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|Perioperative single-dose {{antibiotic}} prophylaxis of <b>cefonicid</b> was compared with clindamycin in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of patients undergoing oncologic {{head and neck}} surgery. Antibiotics were administered intravenously beginning 1 to 2 h preoperatively. <b>Cefonicid,</b> 1 g, was given as a single dose. Clindamycin, 600 mg, was administered every 8 h {{for a total of}} four doses. Blood and wound drainage samples were collected for 24 h following the dose of <b>cefonicid</b> and assayed for total and free <b>cefonicid</b> concentrations, using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Although total concentrations of <b>cefonicid</b> in both serum and wound drainage exceeded the MIC for 90 % of the isolates of common bacterial pathogens for 24 h, free concentrations in serum and wound drainage (11. 0 and 14. 9 % of total concentrations) were subinhibitory within 6 h following administration. Free concentrations of <b>cefonicid</b> in the postoperative wound drainage were subinhibitory for the entire study period, both perioperatively and postoperatively. Postoperative wound infection occurred significantly (P less than 0. 05) more frequently in patients receiving <b>cefonicid</b> (24 %) as compared with those receiving clindamycin (8. 2 %). The relatively low free levels of <b>cefonicid</b> achieved in serum and wound drainage were attributed to the high degree of protein binding (89 % in serum) and {{may be related to the}} poor clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} <b>cefonicid</b> (2 g every 12 h) and ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) {{for their}} efficacy and safety in treating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients {{in an open}} randomized clinical trial (30 patients in each group). Clinical, laboratory, and bacteriologic characteristics were similar in both groups. Ceftriaxone-susceptible strains were isolated on 44 occasions (94 %), and cefonicid-susceptible strains were isolated on 43 occasions (91. 5 %). The antibiotic concentration in ascitic fluid/MIC ratio for ceftriaxone was > 100 throughout the dose interval (24 h), while it was lower for <b>cefonicid</b> (between 1 and 18). A total of 100 % of patients treated with ceftriaxone, and 94 % of those treated with <b>cefonicid</b> were cured of their infections (P was not significant). Hospitalization mortality was 37 % in the <b>cefonicid</b> group and 30 % in the ceftriaxone group (P was not significant). The time that elapsed between the initiation of treatment and the patient's death was shorter in the <b>cefonicid</b> group patients (5. 3 +/- 3. 90 days) than in the ceftriaxone group patients (11. 8 +/- 9. 15 days) (P < 0. 05). None of the patients presented with superinfections, and only two patients treated with <b>cefonicid</b> and three patients treated with ceftriaxone developed colonizations with Enterococcus faecalis or Candida albicans.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} high, concentration-dependent serum protein binding of <b>cefonicid.</b> To determine the in vivo pharmacokinetic significance of these observations, the pharmacokinetics of both total and unbound (non-protein-bound) <b>cefonicid</b> was studied in six volunteers after a single intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg. Saturable serum protein binding was observed in vivo; the mean +/- standard deviation free fraction of <b>cefonicid</b> was 17. 6 +/- 6. 1 % immediately after administration and declined to a constant value of approximately 2 % as total serum concentrations fell below 100 micrograms/ml. This nonlinear binding {{was associated with a}} pronounced decline in unbound serum <b>cefonicid</b> concentrations during the first 3 h after administration, with low or undetectable unbound drug concentrations by 12 h. Renal clearance of total <b>cefonicid</b> averaged 21. 1 ml/min per kg and did not vary with time; in contrast, the mean +/- standard deviation unbound <b>cefonicid</b> renal clearance increased from 5. 7 +/- 2. 1 to 10. 8 +/- 1. 6 ml/min per kg with time (P less than 0. 02). This study may partially explain the poor results obtained with single daily dosing of <b>cefonicid</b> in endocarditis. Dosage regimens of certain antimicrobial agents with high, saturable serum protein binding and extensive renal tubular secretion may be most appropriately designed based on unbound drug pharmacokinetics...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefonicid</b> (SKF 75073) is a second-generation {{cephalosporin}} {{which has}} a spectrum of antimicrobial activity {{similar to that of}} cefamandole, but cefoxitin (a cephamycin) and cephalothin have uniquely different spectra of activity. The second-generation cephalosporins tested displayed comparable susceptibility to beta-lactamases and inhibited type I beta-lactamases. Although <b>cefonicid</b> has a longer serum half-life (3 to 4 h) compared with the currently used drugs, the same minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints separating susceptible and resistant categories were applied to tests with <b>cefonicid,</b> cefamandole, and cephalothin. Regression analysis of the disk diffusion test results confirmed the use of identical zone size breakpoints for 30 -micrograms <b>cefonicid,</b> cefamandole, and cephalothin disks: all three produced similar parabolic regression lines. Further analysis of disk test data confirmed the fact that <b>cefonicid</b> and cefamandole disks might be used interchangeably. But for routine tests, <b>cefonicid</b> disks might be preferred in order to minimize the number of very major (false-susceptible) interpretive errors. Suggested <b>cefonicid</b> 30 -micrograms disk interpretive criteria are: susceptible, {{greater than or equal to}} 18 mm (less than or equal to 8. 0 micrograms/ml), and resistant, less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than 16 micrograms/ml).

40|$|<b>Cefonicid</b> {{is a new}} "second-generation " {{parenteral}} cephalosporin with an antibacterial spectrum {{similar to}} that of cefamandole. It has, however, somewhat less activity in vitro against gram-positive cocci. Because of high blood levels and long serum half-life, daily dosing with <b>cefonicid</b> is feasible. Patients with community-acquired infections of the lower respiratory tract were randomized in a ratio of 2 : 1 to receive <b>cefonicid</b> once daily or cefamandole every 6 hr. All doses were 1, 000 mg except for 13 patients given 500 mg of <b>cefonicid.</b> Of 100 patients evaluated, 66 received the study drug. Most infections were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. One-fourth of the pa-tients had no demonstrable pathogen. Ninety-four percent of both groups were cured or improved by therapy. No significant toxicity or adverse effects were seen with <b>cefonicid.</b> One dose per day of <b>cefonicid</b> is adequate therapy for many patients having community-acquired pneumonia who might otherwise be treated with cefamandole.

The MIC 50 and MIC 90 for the strains tested were 0. 06 and 1 microgram/ml for penicillin, 0. 125 and 8 micrograms/ml for cefazolin, and 4 and 32 micrograms/ml for <b>cefonicid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in renal perfusate flow on the excretion of <b>cefonicid</b> was examined in isolated perfused rat kidneys. <b>Cefonicid,</b> an expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, is primarily eliminated by active tubular secretion and is neither metabolized nor reabsorbed in the isolated kidney. We used angiotensin II (AII), a strong vasoconstrictor hormone of the afferent and the efferent arterioles in the kidney, {{to determine whether}} the renal and secretion clearances, as well as the excretion ratio (ER = CLR/[fu x GFR], where CLR is renal clearance, fu is the unbound fraction, and GFR is glomerular filtration rate), of this low-extraction compound can be altered by a decreased perfusion flow. Control studies were performed in the absence (n = 5) and presence (n = 4) of AII; <b>cefonicid</b> studies were performed in the absence (n = 4) and presence (n = 5) of AII. AII (1 to 4 ng/min) and <b>cefonicid</b> (5 to 10 micrograms/min) were infused into the perfusate. <b>Cefonicid</b> was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and its protein binding was determined by ultrafiltration. AII decreased the perfusate flow rate and increased the renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction of the isolated kidney in the presence and absence of <b>cefonicid.</b> The glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged among the groups. The fractional excretion of glucose was low and steady, indicating a well-preserved tubular function. Although the unbound fraction was unchanged between treatments, the renal and secretion clearances and the excretion ratio of <b>cefonicid</b> were reduced by about 40 % in the presence of AII (excretion ratios, 10. 3 without AII versus 6. 03 with AII). These results suggest that the altered clearance parameters of <b>cefonicid</b> are the result of a flow-induced change in the intrinsic secretory transport of the drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>cefonicid</b> and cefazolin into cardiac tissue was compared after a single 30 -mg/kg dose in 30 patients undergoing aortocoronary artery bypass graft surgery. Samples {{of the right}} atrial appendage, pericardial fluid, and serum were obtained at various times and assayed for drug content. The concentrations of <b>cefonicid</b> in serum and the atrial appendage were at least twice those observed for cefazolin {{at a given time}} after a dose. The mean (+/- standard deviation) atrial appendage-serum ratio was 0. 47 +/- 0. 14 for <b>cefonicid</b> and 0. 34 +/- 0. 06 for cefazolin (P less than 0. 005). Pericardial fluid concentrations of <b>cefonicid</b> were slightly lower than those observed in patients receiving cefazolin (P greater than 0. 05). A single intravenous dose of <b>cefonicid</b> provides high and sustained concentrations in serum and cardiac tissue and thus may be useful in antibiotic prophylaxis of certain surgical procedures; however, further study of the efficacy of this agent in the prevention and treatment of infections associated with Staphylococcus spp. is needed...|$|E
40|$|Young {{men with}} {{uncomplicated}} gonococcal urethritis {{were treated with}} 1 gram of <b>cefonicid</b> given intramuscularly plus 1 gram of probenecid by mouth. Of 53 evaluable patients, 33 (62 %) had penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae. All but one of these patients were cured.

Both the area under the concentration-time curve ratio and the concentration ratio (by the disk method) for <b>cefonicid</b> were statistically lower than the ratios for ceftizoxime and cefotaxime.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>cefonicid</b> (2 g intravenously every 24 h) was assessed in 15 patients with skin and skin structure infections. Trough and peak concentrations in serum were measured on two successive days {{to verify the}} attainment of steady state; and 1 trough and 12 postdose values of the concentration in serum were collected on the following day. <b>Cefonicid</b> concentrations in serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The <b>cefonicid</b> serum concentration versus time profile after intravenous infusion was clearly biexponential in all patients. The terminal elimination half-life determined by nonlinear regression analysis was 4. 63 +/- 1. 49 h (mean +/- standard deviation). The steady-state volume of distribution and total body clearance were 0. 12 +/- 0. 04 liter/kg and 0. 369 +/- 0. 110 ml/min per kg, respectively.

40|$|Three hundred one {{patients}} were studied in ongoing, double-blinded, randomized clini-cal {{trials of the}} efficacy and safety of multiple-dose cefoxitin and single-dose <b>cefonicid</b> {{for the prevention of}} postoperative surgical infection in patients undergoing elective biliary tract operations or hysterectomy. In the biliary surgery trial, one patient (1. 50 / 0) of 66 assessable patients given cefoxitin and three (4. 7 %) of 64 given <b>cefonicid</b> devel-oped incisional infection of the abdominal wound (P = not significant [NS]). Two (6 %) of 31 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy who were given cefoxitin and four (14 %) of 29 given <b>cefonicid</b> developed vaginal cuff cellulitis (P = NS); three (6 %) of 49 pa-tients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy who were given cefoxitin and none of 37 given <b>cefonicid</b> developed pelvic cellulitis (P = NS).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variations}} in plasma protein binding on the renal excretion of <b>cefonicid</b> {{was assessed by}} using isolated perfused rat kidneys. <b>Cefonicid</b> exhibits preferential binding ex vivo to human serum albumin (HSA), as opposed to bovine serum albumin (BSA), and is eliminated mainly by tubular secretion, a process that {{was reported to be}} dependent on the total drug concentration. This contradicts previous studies with antimicrobial compounds and other drugs of low renal extraction in which the unbound drug concentration was shown to be the driving force for carrier-mediated tubular transport. To clarify this discrepancy, we performed perfusion studies by using 6 % BSA at initial concentrations of 200 micrograms/ml (n = 6) and 20 micrograms/ml (n = 9) and in a combination of 4 % BSA plus 2 % HSA at initial concentrations of 200 micrograms/ml (n = 4). The excretion ratio [ER = CLR/(fu x GFR) ] of <b>cefonicid</b> decreased with increasing unbound concentrations, whereas no apparent relationship with the total concentration was evident. At similar total concentrations of <b>cefonicid,</b> the renal clearance remained unchanged; the secretion clearance increased significantly in the 4 % BSA- 2 % HSA experiments, reflecting the reduced unbound fraction and unbound drug concentration of <b>cefonicid.</b> The excretion ratio data were compatible with a model in which Michaelis-Menten kinetics were required to describe active transport and secretion was dependent on the unbound <b>cefonicid</b> concentration. As a result, changes in plasma protein binding as a result of drug interactions or disease states could significantly influence the tubular transport capability of compounds with low renal extraction...|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the incidence of}} postoperative infections in patients undergoing open-heart surgery, antibiotics should maintain tissue concentrations greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for potential pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus) {{for the duration of}} the operation. The ability of <b>cefonicid,</b> a new β-lactamase-resistant parenteral cephalosporin, to attain plasma and myocardial levels greater than the MIC (4. 8 to 5. 0 μg/mL) for penicillin-resistant Staphylococci was assessed in 13 patients. Six patients were administered 1 g and seven patients were administered 2 g of <b>cefonicid</b> IM one hour prior to surgery. In all patients the plasma concentrations of the drug were determined at the start of surgery, 15 minutes after the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and at the completion of CPB. In addition, the concentration of <b>cefonicid</b> was determined in a right atrial biopsy. It was found that both 1 g and 2 g of <b>cefonicid</b> administered one hour prior to surgery resulted in plasma and myocardial levels greater than the MIC for the organisms most frequently implicated in postoperative infections...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with skin and soft-tissue infections {{were treated with}} parenteral <b>cefonicid.</b> Cultures obtained in cellulitis cases from an aspirate of a leading edge of inflammation were positive in 42 % of these patients.

Adverse effects were pain on intramuscular injection (two patients), rash (one patient), and positive Coombs test (one patient). All side effects were mild and none required discontinuing antibiotic therapy. A single treatment failure occurred in a patient with an undrained perirectal abscess. <b>Cefonicid</b> may be a useful drug {{in the treatment of}} skin and soft-tissue infections.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{characteristics of}} <b>cefonicid,</b> a highly protein-bound expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, {{were examined in}} six noninfected, clinically stable patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. After a 1. 0 -g intravenous dose of <b>cefonicid,</b> the mean concentrations in serum were 105 +/- 25 and 35. 6 +/- 14. 4 micrograms/ml at 3 and 72 h, respectively. Despite a prolonged half-life in serum of 49. 7 +/- 18 h, the penetration into peritoneal fluid was low. The average concentration in dialysate over the 72 -h study period was 2. 7 micrograms/ml. The serum clearance was 2. 6 +/- 1. 0 ml/min, and the distribution volume was 0. 14 +/- 0. 02 liter/kg.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of multiple-dose {{administration of}} <b>cefonicid</b> {{to patients with}} normal and impaired renal function were studied by using high-performance liquid chromatography to measure serial serum and urine concentrations. Eighteen patients received an initial dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously over 12 min plus two or three subsequent modified doses at intervals of 24 to 72 h, depending upon the degree of renal impairment. Six patients chronically requiring hemodialysis and 12 nondialysis subjects (creatinine clearance, 10 to 80 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2) were studied. The concentrations of <b>cefonicid</b> in serum after the initial dose were best described by an open two-compartment model. The elimination half-life of <b>cefonicid</b> ranged between 5. 5 and 84. 9 h. Mean peak and trough concentrations in serum for all patients were 178. 2 +/- 29. 3 micrograms/ml (plus or minus standard deviation) and 39. 0 +/- 17. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Trough concentrations were higher in patients requiring hemodialysis than in nondialysis subjects, but the difference was clinically insignificant. The renal clearance/plasma clearance ratio of <b>cefonicid</b> was linearly related to creatinine clearance and decreased with impaired renal function. Therefore, nonrenal mechanisms of elimination become more important as renal function declines. Since <b>cefonicid</b> concentrations were within the therapeutic range for nearly all dosing intervals, we conclude that the guidelines used for dosage reduction and interval prolongation in this study result in therapeutically adequate concentrations in serum and, at the same time, result in no significant drug accumulation...|$|E

The parameters such as the growth rate constant (k), inhibitory ratio (I), the maximum power output (P-m) and the time corresponding to the maximum power output (t(m)) were calculated. The change tendencies of k, with the increasing of concentration (C) of the two cephalosporins, are similar which show that cefazolin sodium and <b>cefonicid</b> sodium have the same inhibitory mechanism.

Of 50 patients with symptoms of lower urinary tract infection randomized to receive either <b>cefonicid</b> or amoxicillin, 39 were infected with {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) bacteria per ml. At early posttherapy follow-up (5 to 18 days), 19 of 21 (90 %) cefonicid-treated patients and 16 of 18 (89 %) amoxicillin-treated patients were cured.

40|$|The {{levels of}} in vitro protein binding of <b>cefonicid</b> and {{cefuroxime}} in human adult and neonatal sera were compared. Binding parameters for each drug were determined within the concentration range of 25 to 3, 000 micrograms/ml. <b>Cefonicid</b> exhibited concentration-dependent protein binding in {{both types of}} sera, with more extensive binding in adult serum at all concentrations. Two classes of binding sites were found: a high-affinity, saturable site and a low-affinity, nonspecific site. Cefuroxime also showed two-class, concentration-dependent protein binding in adult serum, but binding in neonatal serum was to a single class and was independent of drug concentration. Parameters for class 1 binding sites for <b>cefonicid</b> indicated one binding site per albumin molecule in both adult and neonatal sera, with association constants of 7. 0 x 10 (4) and 1. 3 x 10 (4) M- 1, respectively. These parameters were also derived for cefuroxime in adult serum and were 0. 15 and 7. 1 x 10 (4) M- 1, respectively. In neonatal serum, the combined value (number of binding sites per molecule x equilibrium association constant) was similar to combined values calculated for class 2 binding sites for cefuroxime in adult serum and for <b>cefonicid</b> in neonatal serum (287 versus 195 and 261 M- 1, respectively). Cephalosporins {{have been shown to}} compete with bilirubin for albumin binding sites. Lower levels of protein binding of cefuroxime in the therapeutic range may mean a lower potential for drug displacement of bilirubin in neonates, {{on the basis of these}} results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>cefonicid,</b> a cephalosporin antibiotic with a modified N-methylthiotetrazole (MTT) side chain, caused testicular toxicity when subcutaneously administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats from days 6 to 36 postpartum at doses of 50 to 1, 000 mg/kg per day. Moxalactam (a cephamycin antibiotic which will be referred to as a cephalosporin for convenience throughout), which contains the MTT side chain, was used as a positive control and was administered at 100 to 1, 000 mg/kg per day, and cephalothin, which lacks an MTT side chain, was used as the negative control at 1, 000 mg/kg per day. Moxalactam caused a significant reduction in testicular and seminal vesicle weights in 37 -day-old animals, and histological examination revealed bilateral multifocal atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all dose levels. Animals reared to reproductive maturity had significant deficits in fertility, and histological examination revealed multifocal or diffuse atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all doses with a severity greater than that observed in the 37 -day-old animals. The histological findings were confirmed by marked reductions in testicular sperm production rates and cauda epididymal sperm numbers. Cephalothin and <b>cefonicid</b> had no treatment-related adverse effects on the sexual maturation of prepubertal, juvenile, or adult males. The absence (in cephalothin) or modification (in <b>cefonicid)</b> of the MTT side chain was not associated with adverse reproductive effects. The relevance of these findings to humans in prenatal and prepubertal stages of life cannot be determined at this time...|$|E

Model-dependent and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and found to be congruous; noncompartmental data are reported. Significant differences in the values for area under the curve, mean residence time, total body clearance, and renal clearance were observed between the geriatric and young groups. Mean elimination half-life values were 9. 59 and 4. 88 h for the geriatric and young groups, respectively. Total body and renal clearances were inversely correlated to age and directly correlated to creatinine clearance. Free fraction was not correlated to albumin concentration but was correlated exponentially to total <b>cefonicid</b> concentration. Despite the prolonged half-life values observed in our geriatric patients, the difference in mean trough concentrations was slight. Daily administration of a 15 -mg/kg dose should provide adequate concentrations in serum and should not produce appreciable accumulation in geriatric patients...|$|E
40|$|A {{nationwide}} susceptibility {{survey of}} the Bacteroides fragilis group was continued at New England Medical Center in 1983. A total of 555 strains were obtained from eight centers in the United States. In addition to the nine antimicrobial agents studied in the two previous years, three other agents {{were added to the}} evaluation: cefamandole, cefuroxime, and <b>cefonicid.</b> The results for the strains tested with the original nine drugs in 1983 were compared with those for 1, 292 isolates tested in 1981 and 1982. The most active beta-lactam drug was piperacillin, which had an 8 % resistance rate. Cefoxitin resistance increased from 10 % in 1982 to 16 % in 1983. High rates of resistance to cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, <b>cefonicid,</b> and cefuroxime were encountered. No metronidazole- or chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were found during the 3 years of the study. Susceptibility patterns varied at the eight hospitals: the outbreak of cefoxitin resistance reported in 1982 at New England Medical Center remitted, while a high clindamycin resistance rate was documented at one hospital in 1983. These data indicate the need for determining the susceptibility patterns for the B. fragilis group of organisms at each hospital...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activities of}} trospectomycin, cefpodoxime, cefamandok, ccfonicid, and cefuroxime against /Mactamase-negative and-positive invasive clinical isolates of HaemophUus influenzae type b {{were determined by}} the agar dilution method. Trospectomycin and cefpodoxime inhibited 90 % of the strains at concentrations of 5 and 0 - 06 mg/ 1, respectively, and no differences between the susceptibilities of the /f-lactamase-negative and-positive strains were noted. The activity of cefpodoxime was minimally affected by increased inoculum size, but significant inoculum effects were noted with cefamandole, <b>cefonicid,</b> and cefuroxime with /i-lactamase positive strains...|$|E
40|$|Inconsistent {{quality control}} results in disk {{diffusion}} testing of cefaclor, cefamandole, <b>cefonicid,</b> and cefuroxime with Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and Haemophilus test medium (HTM) prompted {{a search for}} an alternative control strain that would provide more reliable results. A five-laboratory {{study was conducted to}} evaluate two candidate H. influenzae strains as possible alternatives to the aforementioned strain. Repetitive testing of the candidate strains and H. influenzae ATCC 49247 over several days with a total of six different lots of HTM documented consistent performance of the two candidate strains and confirmed inconsistent results for some of the antibiotics with H. influenzae ATCC 49247. In particular, certain lots of HTM failed to yield cefaclor and cefamandole zone sizes within the quality control range advocated by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Because of the greater consistency offered by the new strains, one was selected (now designated H. influenzae ATCC 49766) to be recommended for routine quality control testing of cefaclor, cefamandole, <b>cefonicid,</b> cefuroxime, and the related carbacephem loracarbef. The new control strain and zone size ranges proposed here have been approved by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards in place of the previously recommended strain and zone size limits for testing of these five cephem antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of several new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (piperacillin plus tazobactam, ceftizoxime and <b>cefonicid</b> with sulbactam and clavulanic acid, and ampicillin plus 8 micrograms of sulbactam per ml) were tested with anaerobic bacteria and compared with known beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and other potent antianaerobe agents. All the combinations tested (except for the cefonicid-inhibitor combinations) were active against almost all {{strains of the}} Bacteroides fragilis group. This report indicates that beta-lactamase inhibitors may improve the activity of beta-lactam agents with marginal activity against the B. fragilis group...|$|E
40|$|A beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant {{strain of}} Haemophilus influenzae is {{currently}} used for quality control of broth microdilution tests performed with Haemophilus test medium (HTM). Studies with eight lots of HTM broth documented {{the fact that}} MIC limits for some antimicrobial agents are unrealistically stringent; i. e., only three of eight lots of HTM broth were satisfactory for testing cefaclor. An alternative, ampicillin-susceptible strain of H. influenzae (ATCC 49766) was found to provide much more reproducible results with five problematic drugs (cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefamandole, loracarbef, and <b>cefonicid).</b> Multilaboratory studies defined MIC control limits for both control strains tested against 12 antimicrobial agents...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{antimicrobial}} agents, ampicillin, aztreonam, cefamandole, cefazolin, <b>cefonicid,</b> ceforanide, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin, {{were prepared}} at pH 6. 80 and 7. 31 in microdilution trays for storage at 4, - 10, - 25, and - 70 degrees C and for weekly susceptibility testing. All 12 drugs had stable biological activity when stored at - 70 degrees C for 1 year. All but ampicillin and aztreonam were stable at - 25 degrees C. Storage at - 10 degrees C was least satisfactory. Desiccation occurred at 4 degrees C, but short-term storage at this temperature is possible since the antimicrobial agents are stable {{for up to}} several months...|$|E
