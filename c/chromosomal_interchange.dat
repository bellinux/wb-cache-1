We have been using the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchange</b> reported in 1948, which came from a cross between Glycine soja (PI 101. 4048) and G. max. We received seed in 1970 from R. L. Bernard (U.

40|$|Chromosomal {{interchanges}} {{were utilized}} {{to investigate the}} inheritance of oil content in the corn kernel. Two inbred lines, one isolated from the Illinois High Oil strain, the other from the Illinois Low Oil strain, were tested. F 1 crosses between the interchange stocks, which were intermediate in oil content, {{and each of the}} two inbreds representing extremes in oil percentage, were backcrossed to their respective high or low oil parent. Associations between the points of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchange</b> involved and genes conditioning oil content were studied in the resulting backcross progeny. The interchange stocks explored at least one region of each of nine different chromosomes;It appeared from rather limited data that the morphological and physiological effects of semisterility in plants heterozygous for a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchange</b> may have resulted in a slight decrease in the oil percentage of the grain. The size of this decrease, however, was apparently very small and it was hoped that it had little effect on the association studies in the backcross progenies;The results in the high oil backcross progenies suggested that genes conditioning oil percentage were present in each of the chromosome regions tested. The genetic effects of each of these chromosome regions, however, were small and of about the same magnitude as any of the other regions tested;In the low oil backcross progenies there was little evidence of any associations between genes conditioning low oil content and the points of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchange</b> involved;A discussion was presented concerning the types of results expected in the present study under various assumptions as to the number and distribution of genes conditioning oil percentage. It was pointed out that the observed results were compatible with the hypothesis that the oil content of the strains tested was conditioned by a rather large number of genes, having small and approximately equal effects, and distributed at random over the ten pairs of maize chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Cereals are {{the basis}} of global {{agriculture}} providing {{more than half of}} the human food consumption. In Spain, barley is the main crop in terms of growing area, mostly in the poorest agricultural areas. In semiarid areas crop productivity is not only limited by drought, but also by high temperatures at the end of the growth cycle. An increased use of ‘local’ germplasm could lead to the selection of varieties adapted to specific regional conditions. The use of a barley variety like ‘Albacete’, with its proven adaptation to semiarid conditions, can be an excellent option. It has been hypothesized that the high popularity of ‘Albacete’ with farmers particularly in semi-arid areas where barley is grown under rain fed conditions, may be due to the presence of a special form of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchange,</b> a reciprocal translocation. This thesis provides a cytological, genetic and agronomic characterization of this reciprocal translocation...|$|E

40|$|Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a diploid crop having 2 n 5 14 chromosomes. Four {{different}} plant types, heterozygous for {{reciprocal translocation}} (RT), RT- 1, RT- 2, RT- 3, and RT- 4 showing pollen semisterility, were isolated in induced mutant population of three varieties of grass pea. Transmission rate of these 4 translocations was studied in advanced selfed and intercrossed progenies, whereas multiple <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchanges</b> were detected by {{the pattern of}} chromosomal ring formation at meiosis I in the F 1 progeny of RTRT. RT transmitted {{at an average of}} 48. 89 % in selfed progeny and along with normal plants, RT and translocation homozygotes produced some trisomic plants in the segregationg progeny. RT- 3 showing maximum frequency (68. 20 %) of zig-zag or alternate chromosome orientation exhibited highest transmission (55. 20 %). Presence of a ring of 6 or 2 rings of 4 chromosomes in F 1 double heterozygotes obtained from RTRT suggested involvement of one common chromosome in translocations of RT- 1, RT- 2, and RT- 4 but a different one in commo...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{assumptions}} pertaining to the organization and function of chromomeric DNA, the cytogenetic analysis of intragenic deletions that start at Notch and spread to the right or left of the locus suggests that the recombinational gene is bilaterally associated with salivary band 3 C 7. Either there are two genes resolved as a single cistron, or one must seek an alternative interpretation that allows some modicum of independent {{in the relationship between}} gene and band. Although we momentarily lean toward the hypothesis that gene and salivary band are separate entities on a binemic chromosome, alternative views can be devised, and the data must remain open to reinterpretation. —The recessive visible allele faswb behaves as a point mutant at the left end of the map and seems to be a deletion in the interval 3 C 6 to 7; we suspect some part of the band is missing. We have used the aberration in faswb as a cytological marker, isolated intragenic recombinants, and subjected them to examination. The analysis indicates that the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>interchanges</b> occurred to the right of 3 C 7...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> <b>interchanges</b> are {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{because of the}} opportunities they offer {{for the study of}} chromosome behavior and crossing over. The great volume of work which has already been done on crossing over and on translocations but still lack of understanding among the graduates students. Hence, continue discussions and question still to be made on this terminology. This paper gives the opportunity for students to understand chromosome mechanism in which crossing over and cytological changes are often occurs. In very beginning (middle of 20 th century), several study on the behavior of chromosomes such as crossing over, interchange and trisomics. But in order to link them with plant systems and breeding implications, it is necessary to review in brief since the interchange in plants are revealed so far only a small proportions but large proportion being ignored by current phase of crop improvement scientists. Since interchange is being a good cytogenetic markers are useful in genetic and basic investigation studies in cytology. Hence this has some practical applications on ploidy breeding programme which is re-patterning or alteration of basic chromosome number of a species and also an important evolutionary mechanism of species and they are poorly understood (Jauhar, 1971). However, a comprehensive explanation of translocation role in evolutionary aspects of a species is lengthy profession so that, my paper will explains the basics and applied aspects of interchange in plants in briefly...|$|R
40|$|Goss 2 ̆ 7 s wilt, {{caused by}} Clavibacter (=Corynebacterium) michiganense ssp. nebraskense (C. m. ssp. nebraskense), is a foliar and {{vascular}} disease of maize (Zea mays L.). This disease, first reported in central Nebraska in 1969, has since spread throughout {{a major portion}} of the northern Corn Belt. This research investigation was designed to add to the knowledge of the cytogenetic basis of susceptibility to this disease. Two sets of endosperm-marked <b>interchange</b> (<b>chromosomal</b> reciprocal translocation) stocks in the resistant inbred M 14 were crossed onto the susceptible inbred A 632. Testcross, F 2, and F 3 progenies were developed and seed of individual progenies were separated by endosperm markers and were planted in paired rows in randomized complete blocks in the field. Plants were inoculated with C. m. ssp. nebraskense and scored for disease reaction. Chi-square tests for association of endosperm type and disease reaction were performed to identify chromosome arms of inbred A 632 with a gene(s) for susceptibility to C. m. ssp. nebraskense. Results indicated that several chromosome arms of inbred A 632 contained genes that affected the susceptible response to C. m. ssp. nebraskense. Chromosome arms 4 S, 7 L, and 8 L appeared to have genes with major effects on susceptibility whereas 1 S, 1 L, 2 S, and 3 L had genes with lesser effects. Genotype by environment interactions were common and disease reaction varied across disease-scoring dates for many progeny. ^ A set of interchange stocks in the susceptible inbred A 632 that transmitted duplicate-deficient segments of the chromosomes involved in the interchanges were crossed to the resistant inbred Mo 20 W. F 2 seed were separated into yellow or white endosperm, and the resulting F 2 plants were tested in the greenhouse for reaction to C. m. ssp. nebraskense. Results from this small experiment suggested that genes for susceptibility may be located on chromosome arms 4 S and 7 L. F 2 plants grown from sugary kernels, which segregated in the progeny of the cross between A 632 interchange 4 S. 36 - 6 S. NOR and Mo 20 W, were retested since they showed rapid and systemic susceptibility to C. m. ssp. nebraskense. The retest results indicated that a gene(s) for susceptibility was present on chromosome arm 4 S of inbred A 632. These data, combined with results from progenies involving the M 14 interchanges, suggested that 4 S had a gene(s) conferring the largest effect on the susceptible response to C. m. ssp. nebraskense. ...|$|R
