Prior research contends that for the research activities of action inquiry to result in adaptive expertise, they must include the elements of reflection: experience, collaboration, and examination of values and beliefs. Therefore, this study focuses on the opportunities six full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who participated in such an inquiry project had for reflection. It then examines therelationship between those reflective opportunities and self reported changes in faculty members’ perceptions of their expertise in instruction and shared governance.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Background: Previous studies {{suggested}} that the professional identity of community college faculty is less than clearly articulated. Lack of clarity with regard to professional identity may have impacts {{in a number of}} areas, including recruitment, professional development, and the overall reputation of community colleges. Purpose: To examine how <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> articulate their professional identity and how the discourse around that professional identity affects the social reality of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> Setting: Interviews were conducted at “typical case” community colleges in Washington and Oregon: institutions with an annual full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment of between 3, 000 and 10, 000 FTE, with a mission mix in which academic transfer students formed the largest percentage of annual enrollments, followed by career and technical education, and then pre- college programs. Subjects: Fifteen faculty members were interviewed at three community colleges. Faculty members were full-time, tenured teaching faculty. Research Design: Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured question matrix; the question matrix was designed to elicit responses related to elements of social identity theory. Data Collection and Analysis: Face to face interviews were conducted on college campuses. Audio recordings were collected, transcribed, then coded using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Coded excerpts were grouped into prominent themes. Findings: Five primary themes were identified from the interview data. • Participants became <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> through an accidental or unexpectedly changed career path. • Teaching was the most salient role feature for community college faculty. • Being involved in a significant committee, professional development project, or other work group was often cited as a marker of professional identity development. • Autonomy, freedom, and flexibility were prominent values attached to the professional roles. • Community college faculty articulated a strong sense of mission; however, that sense of mission tended to vary between three values—a traditional academic paradigm, a workforce development paradigm, and a social justice/student empowerment paradigm. Conclusions: While teaching was the most salient role feature for community college faculty, most had little or no professional training for that role. In addition, the accidental career path that most faculty members experienced may contribute to a sense of luck or randomness that prohibits serious self-examination of the professional role. The strong value placed on autonomy and flexibility by <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> may also inhibit examination of the professional identity. The social identity constructed by the discourse of community college faculty seemed weakly defined from the perspective of social identity theory...|$|E

Another {{purpose of this study was}} to measure and to compare for possible relationships among stressors, coping strategies, and selected demographic characteristics. Participants who received a three-part survey questionnaire consisted of 90 <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who were members of either Texas Business and Technology Educators Association or the Accounting Section of the Texas Community College Teachers Association. Each participant was sent a survey questionnaire consisting of three sections. Sections I and II were used to gather data pertaining to the sources of occupational stressors and the coping strategies used by the participants. Section III was designed to request information concerning personal and professional demographic characteristics of each research participant. An analysis of the data was completed on all three sections. The major findings for the study indicated the following: 1. Community business teachers experienced high levels of stress from issues involving reward and recognition, time constraints, college/departmental influence, professional identity, and student interaction. 2. Community college business faculty members responded by identifying additional stressors, such as teaching inadequately prepared students to experiencing too heavy a teaching load. To relieve these stressors, these faculty members use coping strategies, such as talking to other persons about problems to experiencing nature. Based on the findings of this study, this researcher's recommendations include the following: 1. Community college districts should provide stress management training to their faculty, especially the new faculty, along with some clerical assistance for all faculty members, especially during the beginning and ending of a semester. 2. Community college administrators should encourage the establishment of wellness programs. 3. <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> should be encouraged to develop and to utilize effective coping strategies to reduce the negative effects of their stress...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine factors associated with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members employed at U. S. community colleges. This study addressed the need to better understand foreign-born faculty members within the community college sector. The following research questions that guided this investigation were: (a) which motivator and hygiene factors have the most significant relationship with job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges? (b) to what extent does gender influence job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges? (c) to what extent does academic status influence job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members at community colleges? (d) are there significant differences in the overall job satisfaction between foreign-born and U. S. citizen <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members?</b> This study was guided by Hagedorn’s (2000) conceptual model and Herzberg’s et al. (1959) theoretical framework. Variables from Hagedorn’s model were used to measure job satisfaction among foreign-born <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> A secondary analysis was conducted utilizing data from the 2013 Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR). Data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics to address each research question. Multiple regression and an independent sample t-test were applied to analyze the data. The sample included 214 foreign-born community college members. The multiple regression analysis revealed that opportunities for advancement, salary, degree of independence, and contribution to society were significant in predicting job satisfaction among foreign-born <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> However, the results indicated that gender and academic status were not significant factors influencing job satisfaction among foreign-born faculty members. The t-test results showed that there was a significant difference in U. S. citizen and foreign-born faculty members’ overall job satisfaction.

At the same time, these institutions must retain their quality of instruction, accountability for learning outcomes, and institutional obligations. Blended learning, where students attend class both on campus and online, is promoted as one solution for attaining such goals. Among the four-year undergraduate population, blended learning has been shown to support student success, meet diverse learning styles, and meet institutional obligations; however, research within the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> population is limited. In particular, faculty members’ perspectives and challenges for teaching blended learning have not been well documented.

The cause for optimism or pessimism is the prospect of a large turnover of faculty and administrators. The pros-pect is exciting because community college leaders will have the opportu-nity to impact significantly the culture and future direction of their insti-tutions (Murray, 1999; Vaughan, 2001). However, much has also been written about a potential shortage of qualified <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> The impending shortage seems to be due to four factors: large numbers of retirements, increasing undergraduate enrollments, a lack of qualified candidates for faculty positions, and the inability of colleges to retain faculty. In the next few years, faculty may be retiring in unprec-edented numbers. "Nationally, some 30 % of the almost 100, 000 commu-nity-college faculty members are likely to retire or otherwise leave their teaching positions in the next 3 years, according to the American Asso-ciation of Community Colleges " (Evelyn, 2001, p.

40|$|This {{narrative}} {{research study}} was conducted to explore the experiences of full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> involved in assessment of student learning beyond the course level. The {{participants in this study were}} employed at public two-year institutions of higher education regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission that had been recognized for their work in assessment. All participants in the study were involved in program or institutional level assessment during the time of the study. The central research question this study addressed was: What factors influenced <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> to become involved with assessment of student learning beyond the course level and what are their recommendations for increasing faculty participation in institutional or program level assessment? To answer the research question the researcher conducted one-hour, semi-structured interviews with nine participants working at three different institutions. All nine participants were asked the same 14 open-ended interview questions that were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Prior published research documented the need for more community college faculty involvement with assessment at the program and institutional levels; however, there was little research based on faculty experiences with assessment at these levels. This study adds to the body of literature about community college faculty participation with assessment by sharing the perspectives of faculty members who had participated with either program or institutional assessment on their campus. The shared experiences of the participants in this study revealed that faculty commitment to assessment for the purpose of improving programs or the institution was largely influenced by the actions of the leaders at their institutions. This study also provides recommendations to institutional leaders, policy makers, and other faculty who want to increase faculty involvement with assessment beyond the course level...|$|E

This phenomenological study explores the underlying themes leading to the decisions made by nursing educators to leave the practice of teaching, and presents strategies for preserving and strengthening the position of nursing <b>faculty</b> within the <b>community</b> <b>college.</b> The guiding question for this inquiry is: "What is the lived experience of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> nursing <b>faculty</b> who leave the profession of teaching?" Text for this study comes from narrative sources such as reflective writings and one-on-one conversations with six former full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> nursing <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> In chapters two and three, I turn to the literature and am guided by the phenomenological philosophers such as Heidegger, Gadamer, and Casey. Nursing leaders and their work provide me with grounding for the study and to help me to draw out the phenomenon for investigation. The six research activities of van Manen provide the methodological framework for the research. Chapter four is a meeting place for those who tell their stories. The nursing <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who offer up their stories journey with me as I explore the meanings of their experiences. These conversations help to unravel the experiences of being a teacher of nurses and offer a place for their voices to be heard. Several themes that were uncovered showed a lack of a welcoming into teaching, unrealistic workload expectations and work-family conflict. Using the metaphor of sheltering walls, the study explores the needs of nursing <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> to find, claim and maintain an appropriate dwelling place in order to sustain professional growth and well-bring. Pedagogical insights serve as a challenge to nurse educators to fortify the bonds of community within nursing education programs.

Both instruments used a five-point Likert scale to assess the respondents’ opinions. One hundred forty-one responses were evaluated using the Analysis of Variance, with an alpha level of. 05, to determine if there were any significant differences between the satisfaction and effectiveness of administrators, <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> and computer professionals with manual, partially automated and fully automated administrative systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case study was to understand rural <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences with work engagement. As community college enrollments grow, it becomes increasingly important to have faculty who are engaged in their work. Recent research suggests engaged students require engaged faculty (Kezar, 2011). One {{of the most significant}} factors in student learning and graduation are the interactions and relationships students develop with faculty members (Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, 2 ̆ 6 Whitt, 2010). This study addressed how rural <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> perceive, experience, and sustain work engagement, as well as why work engagement is important in rural community college faculty. Two rural community colleges, one small and one mid-sized, were investigated. While these colleges differed in size, they shared similar characteristics in course offerings, programs, and extracurricular activities. Data collection consisted of one-on-one interviews of both full-time faculty members and faculty administrators; in addition, documents and websites were reviewed. There were a total of eight participants between the two colleges, six of which were faculty members. The faculty members were involved in a series of three interviews. Upon analysis, four shared themes emerged from the data. The themes included a) understanding the multidimensional role of rural community college faculty, b) recognizing work engagement is student-centered and rooted in passion for the field and for the community college system which matches the faculty members 2 ̆ 7 personal values, c) fulfilling requests for constructive feedback from students and administrators and offering opportunities for professional development, and d) identifying the importance of work engagement as a shared experience that enhances the faculty members 2 ̆ 7 and students 2 ̆ 7 experiences.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to understand and describe the context of the different levels of initiation in student-faculty interaction outside of class for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> students and <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> The researcher examined the meanings constructed about the initiation of interactions between <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> and students and how those interactions contributed to the construction of the students' identities and academic experiences. Constructivist grounded theory was utilized in this study. A total of 14 students were interviewed through one focus group and individual interviews. Five <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> were interviewed individually. Grounded theory methods lead to the following four themes: (1) student attitudes toward initiation of student-faculty interaction, (2) faculty attitudes toward initiation of student-faculty interaction, (3) initiation of student-faculty interaction, and (4) perceptions of student-faculty interactions. An overarching theme of underutilization of student-faculty interaction emerged from the data. Described in this study, reasons for low levels of interaction outside of class included the following: (1) underestimation of benefits of student-faculty interaction by both students and faculty, such as increased intellectual self identity and academic performance; (2) lack of intentional initiation of interaction by faculty; (3) lack of faculty knowledge of strategies for interaction outside of class; (4) student intimidation of faculty sometimes interpreted by faculty as an absence of interest; and (5) an absence of an equity-minded perspective that provides validation and empowers students through interaction outside of class.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 How do {{organizational}} members socially {{construct the}} shared {{meaning of a}} mandated change in the external environment? The opportunity {{to address this question}} presented itself when President Barack Obama set forth a goal for American <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> {{to increase the number of}} students completing certificates and degrees by 5 million by the year 2020. As an external mandate, the explicit prioritization of completion is a relatively recent phenomena. This interpretive qualitative study explored the ways in which organizational members socially construct the shared meaning of a change in the external environment by examining how <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty,</b> as organizational <b>members,</b> construct the concept of completion. Phenomenology was employed as a guiding theoretical and methodological framework. Using saturation sampling, the self-reported perceptions of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> were collected via audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews. Interview transcript data was subjected to a six-step process of inductive, constant comparison analysis, which yielded ten categories, or subthemes. These categories were further subjected to constant comparison, which yielded four major themes: external dictate, legitimacy, ownership, and enactment. External dictate confirmed member cognizance of changes in the external environment, and indicated that members are aware of the potential impact of those changes. Legitimacy and ownership confirmed the process of meaning making and provided insight into how that meaning is constructed. Enactment confirmed, as posited by Living Systems Theory, that system members act upon meaning in self-sustaining ways. The interdependent functioning of the four themes suggests that shared vision is system-generated as members, not only socially construct changes in the environment, but also socially construct the vision that ultimately constitutes the organization's transformation. These findings serve to inform our understanding of the role of shared vision in advancing organizational transformation. Leaders must acknowledge that system members socially construct the meaning of change in the external environment. Furthermore, rather than attempt to establish a vision, astute leaders will socially construct the vision in consort with system members...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the issues {{involved}} with implementing and using pedagogies of engagement in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> STEM courses. The rationale for this study was based on current and emerging STEM education policy directives calling for an updated approach to teaching undergraduates, focused on student engagement, and also the need to include the perspectives of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> in guiding the refinement of these policies. Pedagogies of engagement are classroom techniques intended to stimulate deeper and more student-centered learning experiences and include such activities as calibrated peer review, cooperative learning, interactive lectures, case-based studies, and peer-led learning. Numerous studies have indicated that pedagogy intending to better engage students can improve learning as well as retain and even recruit students into STEM fields. Therefore, engagement has been a central theme in recent education policy. Given the relatively-new policy encouraging the use of pedagogies of engagement in undergraduate STEM courses, research that contributes to this topic is significant, especially in the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> setting, a focus that is rarely highlighted in the literature. This study was designed to contribute to the growing body of research about how pedagogies of engagement can improve <b>community</b> <b>college</b> STEM programs by investigating issues that full-time faculty experience when implementing and using these pedagogical strategies. This study was guided by the following foundational questions: (1) What are the issues involving pedagogies of engagement in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> STEM programs? (2) How can the identified issues be resolved? (3) What strategies can be used for implementing and using pedagogies of engagement? This study employed a qualitative research approach focusing on six individual <b>community</b> <b>college</b> full-time <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who were experienced with these instructional styles. These individuals were recruited via a preliminary screening survey that determined their experience with the techniques and willingness to be interviewed. The data gathered in this study consisted of inperson interviews, analysis of supportive documentation provided by or referred to by the participants, and participant feedback of the results. The issues experienced by full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> STEM <b>faculty</b> when implementing and using pedagogies of engagement were broadly organized into the following themes: student issues, faculty issues, and external issues. Student issues involved student resistance and the perception of engaged pedagogy being of lesser value than traditional lecture-based instructional approaches. Faculty issues included skepticism of the efficacy of the pedagogy, the need for curriculum planning time, cost of facility and equipment upgrades, and the lack of assessment tools to measure student engagement. External issues included insufficient access to professional development opportunities with an engagement focus and also the need for faculty evaluation systems with student engagement as a key outcome. The study findings revealed that those issues could be resolved through collaborative team problem-solving approaches and through participation in high-quality professional development programs. Finally, in regard to the final research question involving strategies for implementing and using pedagogies of engagement, questions for practice were developed that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> educators might consider when implementing these instructional strategies...|$|R
40|$|Building upon {{a three-year}} {{study of history}} {{teaching}} at community colleges, the American Historical Association (AHA) helps instructors take an international approach to the U. S. history survey, {{one of the most}} widely taught humanities courses on community college campuses. The project opens with a conference at the Huntington Library, where participating <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> study the history and cultures of the Pacific Rim in relation to North America from 1600 to 1850. They spend the next year exploring ways to incorporate the new material into their survey courses. A second conference - to be held at the Library of Congress - similarly takes up the Atlantic World from 1450 to 1850. Following this conference, participants implement their course revisions. A third conference in New York City serves as a showcase for presentations on results. William Deverell (University of Southern California) leads the study of the Pacific Rim, and Philip Morgan (Johns Hopkins University) leads the study of the Atlantic World. They present at the conferences and take part in online seminars, along with faculty mentors Cheryll Cody (Houston Community College, Southwest) and Kevin Reilly (Raritan Valley College). Core readings include works by David Abulafia, David Armitage, Bernard Bailyn, Jean Heffer, Patrick Kirch, and Matt Matsuda, among others. Participants also have opportunities to work with the collections at the Huntington Library and the Library of Congress...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the information literacy dispositions that community college faculty find important to their disciplines and therefore, to their students. The study examined who <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> believe is responsible for teaching various information literacy concepts. The study analyzed community college faculty responses related to information literacy skills. Research was conducted in accordance with the Association of College and Research Libraries’ information literacy framework and measured the importance of specific information literacy skills from the perception of faculty. A cross sectional design used quantitative survey methods modeled after Gullikson’s significant research on faculty perceptions. The study results indicate that community college faculty view all information literacy dispositions as important, and implementing information literacy concepts is a shared responsibility between community college faculty and librarians. Subtle variances between different categories of survey respondents were recorded. The findings may be used to shape recommendations to improve, evaluate, and implement information literacy at the community college level. Community colleges need to adopt information literacy as an institutional goal while providing financial support and policies that encourage partnerships between librarians and faculty, require assessment of information literacy initiatives. An assessment of student information literacy skills is also warranted with consideration of the needs and limitations of students, faculty and programs in order for information literacy programs to be successful...|$|E
40|$|Community college {{students}} who transfer to four-year universities face a variety of academic, social, and psychological challenges as they adjust to new postsecondary institutions (Laanan, 2001; Townsend, 2008). Student success through the transfer process is positively influenced by accumulated knowledge, skills, and experiences from the community college environment, characterized as transfer student capital (Laanan, Starobin, and Eggleston, 2011; Moser, 2012). Because community {{college students}} {{are less likely to}} interact with their institutions through structured out-of-classroom living-learning communities, it is especially important to examine the role of classroom experiences on educational outcomes for this population (Tinto, 2000). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of academic experiences in the classroom and with <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> on transfer student outcomes at four-year universities, specifically self-efficacy/intent to persist and academic adjustment. A hypothesized structural model of academic forms of transfer student capital and their relationship with self-efficacy/intent to persist was tested using Laanan-Transfer Student Questionnaire (L-TSQ) data from community college transfer students at two public universities in the Midwest. The results of this study provide insight about the influence of specific forms of student-faculty interaction and classroom experiences on academic adjustment at four-year universities. The associated implications for research, policy, and practice presented in this study provide information that will help community college and university educators and policy makers to promote successful completion for increasing numbers of community college transfer students...|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{determined}} that early childhood (EC) educators need to have personal and social skills and competencies to address the emotional demands of the EC profession. Research is lacking regarding how preservice programs help prepare students emotionally for the EC profession and on whether online courses are a suitable environment for future EC teachers to learn these skills. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore if and how personal and social emotional intelligence (EI) competencies were being embedded and modeled in <b>community</b> <b>college</b> preservice EC educator online courses. This qualitative multiple case study design was employed using a conceptual framework based on Goleman 2 ̆ 7 s EI theory and included 3 <b>community</b> <b>college</b> preservice EC <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> participants. Research questions targeted self-awareness, motivation, and empathy competencies and data sources included faculty interviews, syllabi, assignment descriptions, asynchronous discussion forum prompts, and faculty feedback on student assignments. Data analysis included using values coding and the identification of relevant themes as related to Goleman 2 ̆ 7 s EI theory. Results indicated that while faculty perceived EI as important and that they modeled competencies in online discussions and feedback, there were not many embedded activities in the online courses that provided practice or helped to show growth in EI competencies. This study contributes to positive social change for EC faculty by acting as an impetus for the intentional incorporation of EI activities in online environments, leading possibly to better prepared EC teachers and therefore improved teacher quality of life and teacher retention...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the attitudes of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> general education <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> regarding their perceptions of the importance of internationalizing the general education curriculum and to what extent those perceptions are related to their attitudes toward globalization. The study further examined the degree to which <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> perceive that they are incorporating the teaching of global competencies into their courses. Finally, the study looked at <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of administrative support - both from the perspective of what they felt their college should be doing to support internationalization and what their college was actually doing to support internationalization efforts. No studies were found that examined the importance of internationalizing the general education curriculum in Florida <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> Quantitative data were collected using an online survey instrument sent to full-time and part-time general education <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> teaching at <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> in the State of Florida. The data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and regression tables and descriptive statistics were also reported. Results showed that respondents generally believed that globalization and internationalization are important; however, respondents were not incorporating international instructional strategies at a level that correlated with their attitudes toward globalization and internationalization. Among those <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who were incorporating international instructional strategies, results indicated that the more years 2 ̆ 7 experience in higher education a respondent had, the more likely they were to be incorporating these strategies in the classroom. Respondents also indicated that they would like more support from administration to internationalize the curriculum than they believe they are receiving. Release time, and professional development and training experiences are strategies colleges could use to help improve instruction in international education. Providing opportunities for <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> to travel to conferences and meetings with a global/international scope would also help faculty to have a better understanding of international issues...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The study {{examined}} administrator and faculty perceptions toward staff development needs and ascertained the differences which {{exist between the}} reported staff development needs of full-time <b>community</b> <b>college</b> instructors with{{in the state of}} Oregon. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The three objectives identified for this study were: 1. To determine if administrators and faculty agree upon the staff development needs of the full-time instructional staff. 2. To determine if educational background and <b>community</b> <b>college</b> teaching experience variations affect the reported staff development needs of vocational technical program instructors. 3. To determine if vocational technical and lower division transfer program instructors with similar educational backgrounds and similar years of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> teaching experience report similar staff development needs. THE PROCEDURE: A survey instrument was developed, pilot tested, abjudicated by a jury of experts and administered to a randomly selected group of instructional administrators and full-time faculty from the thirteen <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> in the state of Oregon. The sample for the study consisted of 171 instructional administrators, 342 lower division transfer program instructors and 393 vocational technical program instructors from Oregon's <b>community</b> <b>colleges.</b> The dependent variable in the study was a score assigned by the respondents to each of the fifty-two Likert-type questions in the survey instrument. The F statistic was used to analyze contrast among the mean scores for criterion variable statements relating to each of the study's three objectives. SELECTED FINDINGS: All null hypotheses in the study were rejected at the. 05 level of probability. The findings relative to these hypotheses are summarized according to the three objectives. In relation to objective number one, significant differences were found to exist between the perceived staff development needs of instructors as reported by faculty and administrators. In analyzing the rejected null hypothesis, it was found that administrators indicated the faculty development need was larger than that reported by the instructors. In relation to objective number two, significant differences were found to exist between the reported staff development needs of vocational technical program instructors. <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> teaching experience, educational preparation and the interaction between these two variables significantly affected reported needs. The greatest differences in mean scores were reported by individuals with one to six or more than fifteen years of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> teaching experience. <b>Faculty</b> with seven to fifteen years of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> experience felt that their abilities were acceptable. Reported staff development needs decreased as the formal educational preparation variable increased in years. In relation to objective number three, significant differences were found to exist between the reported staff development needs of vocationai technical and lower division transfer program instructors with a minimum of sixteen years of formal educational preparation. Differences were shown on the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> experience, teaching area and interaction variables for each of the seven hypotheses. As with objective number two, the greatest amount of staff development need was reported by individuals with less than seven or more than fifteen years of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> teaching experience. Also as with the data from objective number two, reported staff development needs decreased as the amount of formal educational training increased. The study presented conclusions and implications based on the findings relative to each specific objective. Specific characteristics affecting the staff development needs of <b>community</b> <b>college</b> full-time <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> within the state of Oregon were delineated...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Online {{learning}} has grown exponentially within {{higher education in}} the past decade, especially at community colleges. As online course offerings expand community colleges need to assess student learning in order to ensure quality learning experiences for students and for accreditation purposes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the assessment methods of community college faculty who teach the same course in both face-to-face and online formats, in order to determine the similarities and differences that exist in assessment practices. This study stemmed from the constructionist and pragmatic perspectives of the researcher. Additionally this study asked how community college faculty perceive the effectiveness of different assessment methods on student learning. The method for this research was a qualitative multiple case study in which community college accounting faculty were interviewed to explore how they assess student learning in both the online and face-to-face formats. Homework problems, exams, quizzes were the most commonly used methods of assessment of student learning in both formats by the study participants. Furthermore, exams and quizzes were believed to be most effective in assessing student learning, among the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> interviewed. Another discovery from this study included the prevalent use of publisher's software,called My Accounting Lab, among community college accounting faculty in administering assessments to students. Additional concerns around assessing online students effectively, managing online student group work, and mitigating online student cheating were also revealed during interviews with study participants...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore {{experiences}} of professional growth for mid-career community college faculty. The research question that guided the study is: How do <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> experience professional growth at mid- career? The research design included an interpretive social science methodology and phenomenological method. Nine mid-career community college faculty, identified as being engaged and active in their professional role, participated through in-depth interviews. Profiles of the participants in their own words were presented to reflect on their early career experiences, and themes were presented as they emerged from the data as participants talked about their experiences of professional growth. Themes emerged in the areas of: (1) experiences of professional growth; (2) how faculty made meaning of these experiences; and (3) how faculty experienced support for their growth. Faculty interviewed for this study were active in campus leadership and governance and in pursuing professional development opportunities. They demonstrated a high degree of engagement in student learning and improving instruction. They were thoughtful about their experiences, reflecting on diversity as one of the strengths of their institution and engaging in a self-reflective post-tenure process. They also experienced a high level of support from administrators and colleagues. By voicing the professional growth experiences of highly engaged faculty at an important career stage, this study offers implications for practice for faculty, administrators, and policy makers concerned with faculty, instructional, and organizational development...|$|E

Business leaders and academic scholars urge organizations to continuously reshape and renew through learning and innovation to assure viability and sustainability. Organizational climate serves as a foundation that can promote or hinder innovation. Consequently, an organizational climate that encourages innovation is paramount to get community colleges through challenging times and ensure their relevance and value in meeting the needs of the 21 st century complex society. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess perceptions of full-time faculty members about organizational climate for innovation in community colleges in Oregon and to determine if there is any difference in perceptions based on individual demographic factors or organizational characteristics. The secondary purpose was to gather feedback related to enhancements that community colleges can pursue to improve organizational climate for innovation. A web-based questionnaire was developed using items from other instruments that measured organizational climate for innovation with the constructs of leadership, support for creativity, norms for diversity and risk-taking, continuous development, ownership, and resources.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 <b>Community</b> <b>college</b> and {{university}} <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> changing their practice of teaching have reported benefits to participating in peer support within communities of practice that offer an online knowledge sharing space. The ability of such online knowledge sharing to {{provide opportunities for}} collaborative knowledge building has made fostering a viable online knowledge sharing space within a community of practice a goal of instructional innovation projects. However, motivating members to participate in knowledge sharing and generating sufficient member commitment to sustain the online knowledge sharing has proven difficult to accomplish. This study therefore addressed the question "How do cost and benefit factors relate to participation in online knowledge sharing in communities of practice meant to support efforts to improve instruction?" Kankanhalli, Tan, and Wei's (2005) model of knowledge sharing as an individual cost and benefit analysis decision influenced by institutional context was applied to online knowledge sharing within communities of practice supporting faculty innovation. Online knowledge sharing was defined as members posting information to the online site for a community of practice. Registrants to the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Program's 2011 Principal Investigator's Conference were invited by email to complete an online version of the original study's survey modified for the new population. A total of 174 recipients (24. 4 % of the 712 invited) started and 153 (21. 5 %) finished the survey. The hypotheses were assessed with Moderated Simultaneous Regression. Participation in online knowledge sharing was significantly increased among contributors who identified knowledge self-efficacy (adjusted Beta =. 18, p =. 047) and enjoyment in helping others (adjusted Beta =. 24, p =. 011) with participation. However, reciprocity and generalized trust did not moderate the influence of pro-sharing norms and participation effort on the respondent's participation. These findings suggest {{research is needed to}} identify other benefits to participation for the participants. Understanding what motivates participation may aid managers of communities of practice and projects supporting faculty innovation to improve participant support so as to more effectively increase and sustain participation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 125 - 132) Public {{funding for}} <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> {{has been steadily}} declining since the peak of funding in the 1970 s (Brightman, 1989). Surviving the constant threats of budgetary cuts has been a key motivating factor for <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> to embrace academic entrepreneurialism. I examined the academic entrepreneurial pursuits of one California <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> (CCC) to understand those factors that encourage <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> to pursue academic entrepreneurial solutions. The purpose of this qualitative study is to examine factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Specifically, I investigated three categories of factors that influence academic entrepreneurialism: individual, institutional, and environmental. Individual factors include demographic and background characteristics, including age, race, gender, academic training, and previous professional careers. Institutional factors include program offerings available for students, institutional reputation and history, institutional policies and practices, and academic and administrative leadership. Environmental factors relate to the peer influences of a campus that encourages academic entrepreneurial behavior of faculty. The significance of this study lies {{in the identification of}} factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty,</b> ultimately supporting institutional efforts to augment funding. I investigated individual, institutional, and environmental factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Accordingly, the research questions identify key factors that encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> and explain how they facilitate faculty to engage in academic entrepreneurialism. The research questions that I evaluated in this study are: What individual, institutional, and environmental factors influence <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> to engage in academic entrepreneurialism? What is the relationship between faculty background, institutional, and environmental characteristics and the frequency and quality of academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty?</b> I found that all three factors are essential elements of academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Individual, institutional, and environmental factors consist of people who are all pursuing their self-interest. This follows the tenets of rational choice theory as the study finds that self-interest influences faculty academic entrepreneurialism. The study argues that changes to institutional policies are the key determining factor to encourage academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> Institutional policies determine how a college functions and understands the interrelationship between individual, institutional, and environmental factors. Encouraging academic entrepreneurialism among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty</b> requires institutional policies that focus on the fundamental issue: recruiting, retaining, and evaluating <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>faculty.</b> The study offers suggestions for how to influence institutional policies that in turn encourage faculty academic entrepreneurialism by addressing the following areas: faculty job descriptions, faculty job announcements, evaluating faculty levels of academic entrepreneurialism, and offering entrepreneurial faculty financial incentives...|$|R
