A dead manta is worth $40 to $500 while manta ray tourism <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> $1 million during {{the life of a}} single manta ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.|$|E
25|$|Politicians court mafiosi {{to obtain}} votes during elections. A mafioso's mere {{endorsement}} {{of a certain}} candidate can be enough for their clients, relatives, and associates to vote for that candidate. A particularly influential mafioso <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> thousands of votes for a candidate; such is the respect that a mafioso can command. The Italian Parliament has {{a huge number of}} seats (945, roughly 1 per 64,000 citizens) and a large number of political parties competing for them, meaning that a candidate can win with only a few thousand votes. A mafia clan's support can thus be decisive for their success.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in times}} of solar minimum, when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long {{distance}} possibilities. Sporadic E propagation <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late {{spring and early summer}} being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on transequatorial paths, for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.|$|E

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of Let's Play and similar video commentaries have {{also led to}} changes in how some video games have been developed. The Let's Play approach favors games that are quirky and idiosyncratic that draw viewer attention, making some developers aim for these qualities in their games. It also helps for games in early access or beta release cycles as developers from such games can use these videos for feedback to improve their games prior to full release. The Let's Play videos also <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> more attention to a niche title than traditional gaming press. Some games such as Goat Simulator and I am Bread are considered by critics and players to have been purposely made {{to be the subject}} of Let's Plays on popular channels as to drive interest in an otherwise-lackluster game, and are usually derided as [...] "YouTube bait".|$|E
2500|$|Repartnering or remarrying <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> {{additional}} {{levels of}} conflict and anger into their home environment. One {{of the reasons that}} re-partnering causes addition stress is {{because of the lack of}} clarity in roles and relationships; the child may not know how to react and behave with this new “parent” figure in their life. [...] In most cases, bringing in a new partner/spouse will be the most stressful when done shortly after the divorce. In the past, divorce had been viewed as a “single event”, but now research shows that divorce encompasses multiple changes and challenges. It is not only internal factors that allow for resiliency, but the external factors in the environment are critical for responding to the situation and adapting. Certain programs such as the 14-week Children’s Support Group and the Children of Divorce Intervention Program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce.|$|E
25|$|For a {{team that}} is losing a game, a fresh striker <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> more benefit <b>in</b> {{circumventing}} an opposed defence line composed of relatively tired players. For {{a team that}} is winning a game, a fresh midfielder or a defender <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> more benefit <b>in</b> strengthening the defence against the opposition's attackers (who may be fresh substitutes themselves). In this situation, it is usually imaginative attacking flair players who are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders.|$|R

Only mind, if you will forgive me, my lord--mind to spice high with Latin; a curn or two of Greek would not be amiss; and, if you <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> any thing about the judgment of Solomon, in the original Hebrew, and season with a merry jest or so, the dish will be the more palatable.--Truly, I think, that, besides my skill in art, I owe much to the stripes of the Rector of the High School, who imprinted on my mind that cooking scene in the Heautontimorumenos."

60|$|The {{other way}} of {{retention}} is, the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been as it were laid aside out of sight. And thus we do, when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet,--the object being removed. This is MEMORY, which is as it were the storehouse of our ideas. For, the narrow mind of man not being capable of having many ideas under view and consideration at once, {{it was necessary to}} have a repository, to lay up those ideas which, at another time, it might have use of. But, our IDEAS being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be anything; when there is no perception of them; this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this,--that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that IT HAS HAD THEM BEFORE. And in this sense it is that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere;--but only there is an ability in the mind when it will to revive them again, and as it were paint them anew on itself, though some with more, some with less difficulty; some more lively, and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings which, though we do not actually contemplate yet we <b>CAN</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there.|$|E

Perhaps they may have caught the holy man's trick of plain speaking--and ears are dainty in Alexandria. And there are some in these parts, too, that have never forgiven him the part he took about those three villains, Marc, Zosimus, and Martinian, and a certain letter that came of it; or another letter either, which we know of, about taking alms for the church from the gains of robbers and usurers. [...] "Cyril never forgets." [...] So he says to every one who does him a good turn.... And so he does to every one who he fancies has done him a bad one. So here am I slaving away, a {{subordinate}} priest, while such fellows as Peter the Reader look down on me as their slave. But it's always so. There never was a bishop yet, except the blessed Augustine--would to Heaven I had taken my abbot's advice, and gone to him at Hippo!--who had not his flatterers and his tale-bearers, and generally the archdeacon at the head of them, ready to step into the bishop's place when he dies, over the heads of hard-working parish priests. But that is the way of the world.

Look now; there are but seven deacons to this great city, and all its priests; and they and the archdeacon are the masters of it and us. They and that Peter manage Cyril's work for him, and when Cyril makes the archdeacon a bishop, he will make Peter archdeacon....They have their reward, they have their reward; and so has Cyril, for that matter.' ...|$|E
