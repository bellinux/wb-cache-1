25|$|Returning to the US {{soon after}} the Japanese surrender, Indiana was placed in reserve status in September 1946 and {{formally}} decommissioned a year later. She saw no further active service and was sold for scrapping on 6 September 1963.

Indianas prow was formerly located in Berkeley, California, {{in a parking lot}} across the street from Spenger's Restaurant on Fourth Street but was moved to Memorial Stadium at Indiana University in July 2013.

5000|$|Hemocytometers (<b>counting</b> <b>chambers</b> {{that hold}} a {{specified}} volume of diluted blood and divide it with grid lines) {{are used to}} calculate the number of red and white cells per litre of blood. (The dilution and grid lines are needed because there are far too many cells without those aids.) ...|$|R
2500|$|As is with <b>counting</b> <b>chambers,</b> {{cultures}} usually need to {{be heavily}} diluted prior to plating; otherwise, instead of obtaining single colonies that can be counted, a so-called [...] "lawn" [...] will form: thousands of colonies lying over each other. Additionally, plating is the slowest method of all: most microorganisms need at least 12 hours to form visible colonies.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason that}} these {{instruments}} are so sensitive {{is that they}} are often housed in low background <b>counting</b> <b>chambers.</b> Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of low-background steel (~20 cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1 cm). This shielding can reduce background radiation inside the chamber by several orders of magnitude.|$|R
5000|$|To use the hemocytometer, first {{make sure}} that the special {{coverslip}} provided with the <b>counting</b> <b>chamber</b> is properly positioned {{on the surface of the}} <b>counting</b> <b>chamber.</b> When the two glass surfaces are in proper contact Newton's rings can be observed. If so, the cell suspension is applied to the edge of the coverslip to be sucked into the void by capillary action which completely fills the chamber with the sample. The number of cells in the chamber can be determined by direct counting using a microscope, and visually distinguishable cells can be differentially counted. The number of cells in the chamber is used to calculate the concentration or density of the cells in the mixture the sample comes from. It is the number of cells in the chamber divided by the chamber's volume, which is known from the start, taking account of any dilutions and counting shortcuts: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>counting</b> <b>chamber</b> {{should be}} filled by {{capillary}} action after the chamber lid (special cover-slip with certified thickness and flatness) has been put in place. This avoids {{the risk that the}} cells could sediment/stick to the glass or some volume to evaporate before the cover-slip is placed on top and resulting in an overestimation of the cell concentration. Sedimentation is less of a problem with bacteria but evaporation, more prevalent in low-humidity air-conditioned laboratories, still has to be minimized.|$|E
5000|$|Often, such {{a system}} is housed in a low {{background}} <b>counting</b> <b>chamber</b> whose thick walls will be made of low-background steel (~20 cm thick) and will be lined with ~1 cm of lead, then perhaps thin layers of cadmium, or tin, with a final layer of copper.

The optimum flotation solution for lungworm larvae is zinc sulphate and mercury II iodide (s. g. 1. 45) although zinc sulphate (s. g. 1. 20 or 1. 35) on its own also gave good results.

40|$|Abstract-Dielectrophoretic {{concentrators}} {{were successfully}} developed on a EWOD-based chip. In such a chip, two major electrokinetic forces were exerted on objects on different scales. EWOD {{is used to}} pump droplets on a mm scale, while DEP manipulates bio-particles on a gm scale. Both cells and polystyrene beads were used to demonstrate the concentration abilities by pDEP and nDEP forces, respectively. Since electrodes are covered with a dielectric layer, instead of creating non-uniform electric fields in the liquid, low frequency signals are consumed in the dielectric layer and providing EWOD. It is necessary to use high frequency signals to generate DEP on a EWOD-based chip. Concentration efficiency, measured by cell <b>count</b> <b>chamber</b> before and after experiments, is around 1. 62 with single cycle ofpDEP attraction.
