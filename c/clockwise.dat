5|$|Exits are {{numbered}} sequentially (unlike other interstates in Maryland which use a milepost-based system), {{and in a}} <b>clockwise</b> (inner loop) direction, in accordance with AASHTO guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Line 6 of the Oslo Metro {{operate to}} Sinsen, with a 15-minute headway. The line operate <b>clockwise</b> through {{the eastern part}} of town into the Common Tunnel towards Sognsvann, while it {{operates}} counterclockwise via the western part into the Common Tunnel towards Bergkrystallen. Line 3, which operates to the other stations on the Ring Line, does not continue to Sinsen. Travel time from Sinsen to Stortinget is 9 minutes <b>clockwise</b> and 16 minutes counterclockwise. The service is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|Lines 4, 5 and 6 of the Oslo Metro {{operate to}} Nydalen, {{each with a}} 15-minute headway. Lines 4 and 5 operate {{counterclockwise}} through the ring via {{the western part of}} town into the Common Tunnel, while line 6 operates <b>clockwise</b> via the eastern part into the Common Tunnel. Line 5 continues eastwards only to Storo before stopping; lines 4 and 6 swap numbers between Nydalen and Storo. Travel time from Nydalen to Stortinget is 13 minutes <b>clockwise</b> and 12 minutes counterclockwise. Therefore, any traveler heading for the city center can get on the first train, independent of its direction (except line 5 to Storo), and can be certain it will be the quickest connection to the downtown area.|$|E

Lines 4 and 5 operate {{counterclockwise}} through the ring via {{the western part of}} town into the Common Tunnel, while line 6 operates <b>clockwise</b> via the eastern part into the Common Tunnel. Line 5 terminates at Storo. Lines 4 and 6 swap numbers between Nydalen and Storo. Travel time from Storo to Stortinget is 11 minutes <b>clockwise</b> and 14 minutes counterclockwise. Therefore, any traveler heading for the city center can get on the first train, independent of its direction and it is ensured to be the fastest connection to the downtown area. The metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|The City of Skopje {{reaches the}} Kosovo border to the North-East. <b>Clockwise,</b> {{it is also}} bordered by the Macedonian {{municipalities}} of Čučer-Sandevo, Lipkovo, Aračinovo, Ilinden, Studeničani, Sopište, Želino and Jegunovce.|$|E
5|$|The journey {{across the}} four {{cardinal}} points in India is considered sacred by Hindus, who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetimes. Traditionally, the pilgrimage {{starts at the}} eastern end from Puri, proceeding <b>clockwise</b> in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.|$|E
5|$|The main {{areas of}} the town are (approximately <b>clockwise</b> from the north-west): Innox Hill, Welshmill, Packsaddle, Fromefield, Stonebridge, Clink, Berkley Down, Easthill, Wallbridge, The Mount, Keyford and Lower Keyford, Marston Gate, The Butts, Critchill, Trinity, and Gould's Ground.|$|E
5|$|The pillars {{supporting}} the roof are named shitebashira (principal character's pillar), metsukebashira (gazing pillar), wakibashira (secondary character's pillar), and fuebashira (flute pillar), <b>clockwise</b> from upstage right respectively. Each pillar {{is associated with}} the performers and their actions.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{a source}} of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low {{pressure}} at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a <b>clockwise</b> direction (southern hemisphere) or counter <b>clockwise</b> (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a <b>clockwise</b> loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} I-495 (Capital Beltway) around Washington, D.C., on which exit numbers are {{generally}} arranged by mileposts counterclockwise {{starting at the}} southern crossing of the Potomac River, the exit numbers for the Baltimore Beltway are arranged consecutively <b>clockwise</b> starting at Interchange #1 at Quarantine Rd, west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge crossing of the Patapsco River.|$|E
5|$|Line 5 {{operates}} the entire ring with a 15-minute headway. From east to west, trains on line 5 enter the common tunnel from the Grorud Line {{then make a}} full <b>clockwise</b> circle around the Ring Line, including a second pass of the common tunnel, before proceeding {{to the end of}} the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|Neuman and EUROSEC {{official}} Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) interrogate Ross, who {{denies that}} he aborted the mission. Shortly after, Kane dies from his injuries. Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is a mirror image of his. Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move anticlockwise, a tape deck's reels that turn <b>clockwise</b> and an oscilloscope that scans from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the {{tropical}} cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50mph (85km/h) for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. While the steering currents weakened on May25, Aletta slowed {{and moved in}} a large <b>clockwise</b> loop until May28. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May29 roughly 180mi (290km/h) southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|The All Terminals loop, {{an airport}} {{terminal}} circulator, serves the six terminal stations (Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 4, Terminal 5, Terminal 7, and Terminal 8). It operates {{in the opposite}} direction as the Howard Beach and Jamaica branches, making a continuous <b>clockwise</b> loop around the terminals. Connections to the Q3, Q10 and B15 local buses are available at Terminal 5.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a <b>clockwise</b> direction around.|$|E
5|$|The three {{variants}} of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If {{the corners of}} one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by 1,3,5,2,4 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either <b>clockwise</b> or counterclockwise.|$|E
5|$|When {{operating}} a full circle route, trains start through the Common Tunnel. If running <b>clockwise,</b> {{they pass through}} all the common stations (Tøyen, Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Stortinget, Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen). They head north on the Sognsvann Line, stopping at Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion. The Ring Line proper then splits off, and the trains serve Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen, before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line. After that, the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. <b>Clockwise</b> from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and <b>clockwise</b> in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats. After turning to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of , followed by executing a <b>clockwise</b> loop from September16 through September18. After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. The storm dissipated on September21 just off the Georgia coast.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a <b>clockwise</b> route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a <b>clockwise</b> direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day. Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, {{as well as a}} conductor {{at the rear of the}} train who supervises the passengers.|$|E
5|$|By September25, Georges {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around {{the center of}} circulation. By September27, Georges reached an intensity of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief <b>clockwise</b> loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever rings {{in with the}} right answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants <b>clockwise</b> from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates <b>clockwise.</b> As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and <b>clockwise</b> in the {{northern}} hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between <b>clockwise</b> and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, Jeanne {{weakened}} to a Category 1 hurricane. It {{entered the}} western Gulf of Mexico, and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east. Later, Jeanne diminished to a 65mph (105km/h) tropical storm. A developing trough remained west of Jeanne, and the cyclone was {{embedded in a}} weak pressure gradient. Although Jeanne briefly re-intensified to 70mph (110km/h), an advancing frontal boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14. It executed a <b>clockwise</b> loop, and it merged with the frontal boundary on November 16.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were {{built around the}} curtain wall. Moving <b>clockwise</b> from {{the entrance to the}} Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent {{to the site of the}} first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it <b>clockwise.</b> This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{physicists}} were {{rocked by}} the news that Wu and Tsung-Dao Lee had demonstrated in the Wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions. This inspired Ward to consider particle physics again. Along with many others, he consider how gauge theory {{could be applied to}} Fermi's theory of beta decay. Ward became {{one of the authors of}} the Standard Model of gauge particle interactions; his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co-authored with Abdus Salam. Ward wrote a note to Abdus, informing him that Albert Einstein would be spinning in his grave, presumably <b>clockwise.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sera {{complex is}} divided into two sectors by pathways; the eastern part {{contains}} the Great Assembly Hall and the dwellings and the western part has the well-known three colleges: the Sera Je Dratsang, the Sera Me Dratsang; and the Ngakpa Dratsang, all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8-70. All the structures within this complex formed a <b>clockwise</b> pilgrimage circuit, starting with the colleges (in the order stated), followed by the hall, the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great Assembly Hall.|$|E
5|$|The Zoloti Vorota station {{features}} {{a number of}} distinct mosaic decorations, which were completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. There are a total of 80 large mosaic pieces; they run in a <b>clockwise</b> direction around the station, depicting the history of Kievan Rus. The two artists, accompanied by the station's lead architect Vadym Zhezherin, concluded that the station should be decorated with mosaic pieces of historical significance of the period {{leading up to the}} Mongol invasion of Rus'. Korin completed the mosaics in either ends of the station and the large ceiling arches, while Fedko was completed the unique images relating to Kievan Rus' and the smaller arches in between each of the station's pillars.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward is {{guarded by}} four large {{circular}} towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, <b>clockwise</b> from the north-east, {{they were called}} Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials {{in a similar fashion}} to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.|$|E
