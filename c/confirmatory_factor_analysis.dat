25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, <b>confirmatory</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis,</b> internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

2500|$|NFC {{has been}} found to be {{strongly}} associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas. Epistemic curiosity can be defined as ‘‘desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems". Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a [...] "personality construct that represents an individual’s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing". Openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with [...] "aspects of being open minded, engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself". Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and [...] typical intellectual engagement (r = [...]78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct. Further studies have found that NFC, [...] typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. Factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis. The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others. A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using <b>confirmatory</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits. For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than NFC.|$|E

Few indices measure self-care, and research about interventions that enhance self-care is sparse. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a simple, direct measure of the dimension of proactive self-care in medical settings for use in research about participatory medical interventions. Methods: An exploratory <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> (EFA) was conducted to examine the initial factor structure of the 10 -item follow-up questionnaire commonly used in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) groups. The sample consisted of 185 participants enrolled in MBSR groups. A <b>confirmatory</b> <b>factors</b> <b>analysis</b> (CFA) was then conducted on part of the sample (n = 94) at MBSR follow-up to test the fit of the model uncovered in the EFA. Results: EFA results revealed a clear 5 -item factor assessing what we perceived to be self-care attitude and behavior. The follow-up CFA confirmed a good fit of the data to these items, along with a sixth item we developed. We labeled these six items the Mindful Self-Care Index (MSCI). Conclusion: The MSCI provides a direct measure of proactive self-care and can be reliably employed in studies to help determine the effectiveness of interventions that intend to enhance self-care...|$|R

40|$|Social {{scientists}} and researchers frequently use latent variable models {{to analyze the}} relationships between observed variables and latent variables representing the hypothesized constructs. The population, or true, model is not always known, resulting in a degree of misspecification in the relationships between variables in the model. Therefore, model- and item-fit statistics have been developed {{in order to provide}} evidence for the validity of a specific latent variable model. Conditions for mathematical equivalence between two popular latent variable modeling methods, <b>confirmatory</b> <b>factors</b> <b>analysis</b> (CFA) and item response theory (IRT), have been established, availing the researcher and practitioner of a variety of model- and item-fit indices. This dissertation employs a simulation design to examine the behavior of three model-fit indices (χ 2 /df, RMSEA, and GDDM) and three item-fit indices (S-χ 2, Modification Index, Wald Test) under various conditions of model misspecification and test design conditions. The results of this study show the empirically-derived cut points to out-perform the theoretical and suggested cut points when true models are estimated; these cut points are employed in subsequent analysis of misspecified models. In addition to examining the statistical power of each fit index to correctly reject the misspecified models, recommendations are made for the use of each fit statistic according to the model misspecification and test design conditions manipulated in the simulation study.

The CDMI measures the individual along eight dimensions: Decidedness, Comfort, Career Choice Anxiety, External Barrier, Need for Career Information, Readiness, Career Salience, and Inconsistent Information. The scale has been validated through a scientific method in order to ensure its reliability and validity. Two advanced statistical methods were used, namely: Exploratory <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> (EFA) and <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>factors</b> <b>analysis</b> (CFA).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-criticism {{refers to}} a series of {{persistent}} and negative self-judgements, often involuntary, that an individual makes about themselves. Recent research has explored the possibility that self-criticism can lead to a more perseverative style of thinking called self-critical rumination. There is evidence that self-critical rumination may be a separate construct from other forms of rumination, such as depressive rumination and post-event processing. Research has indicated that metacognitions, beliefs that individuals have about their internal experiences and how to control them, {{may play a role in}} self-critical rumination. The aim of our work was to develop a measure to assess metacognitions related to self-critical rumination. METHOD: In Study 1, a community sample of 178 participants completed the newly developed Metacognitions about Self-Critical Rumination Questionnaire (MSCRQ) and results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis. In Study 2, a community sample of 247 participants completed a battery of questionnaires including the MSCRQ. A <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>Factors</b> <b>Analysis</b> was performed on the MSCRQ and validity was ascertained by correlating with other measures. RESULTS: In Study 1, a 15 -item two-factor structure was identified. A 10 -item two-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2. Results also indicated that the MSCRQ has acceptable levels of reliability, and good concurrent and incremental validity. CONCLUSIONS: The MSCRQ appears to be a reliable and valid measure of metacognitions about self-critical rumination whilst the MCQ- 30 is a better predictor of general emotional distress...|$|R
