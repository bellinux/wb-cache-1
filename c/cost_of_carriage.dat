60|$|For {{suppose that}} the prices have {{adjusted}} themselves, no matter how, and that the imports and exports balance one another, each commodity, of course, being dearer by the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> in the country which imports than in that which exports it: and suppose now that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> both of the one and of the other, were suddenly and miraculously annihilated, and that the commodities could pass {{from country to country}} without expense. If each country bore its own <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> before, each country will save its own <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> now. Cloth, in Germany, will in that case fall exactly to what it is in England; linen in England, to what it is in Germany.|$|E
60|$|But {{the result}} might be, that {{the fall of}} price might not have an effect exactly equal, on the demand in the two countries. Suppose, for instance, that the fall of cloth in Germany owing to the saving of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> did not {{increase}} the demand for cloth in Germany; but that the fall of linen in England from a like cause, did increase the demand for linen in England. The linen imported {{would be more than}} could be paid for by the cloth exported: the difference must be paid in money: the change in the distribution of the precious metals between the two countries would lower the price of cloth in England, (and consequently in Germany), while it would raise the price of linen in Germany, (and consequently in England). Germany, therefore, by the annihilation of <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> would save in price more than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> of the cloth; England would save less in price than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> of the linen. But if by the miraculous annihilation of <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> England would not save the whole of the carriage of her imports, it follows that England did not previously pay the whole of that <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{inspection}} {{it would appear}} that each country bears its own <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> that is, that each country pays the carriage of the commodity which it imports. Upon this supposition, each country would gain whatever share of the joint saving of labour would otherwise fall to its lot, minus the cost of bringing from the other country the commodity which it imports. This solution is rendered plausible by the circumstance just now mentioned, that the price of the commodity will be higher in the country which imports it, than in the country which exports it, by the amount of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> If linen is sold in England at a higher price than in Germany, by a per-centage equal to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> of the linen, it appears obvious that England pays for the carriage of the linen, and Germany, by parity of reason, for that of the cloth.|$|E

Explaining how plasmids persist in host populations however is difficult, given the high costs often associated with plasmid carriage. Compensatory evolution to ameliorate this cost can rescue plasmids from extinction. In a recently published study we showed that compensatory evolution repeatedly targeted the same bacterial regulatory system, GacA/GacS, in populations of plasmid-carrying bacteria evolving across a range of selective environments. Mutations in these genes arose rapidly and completely eliminated the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage.</b> Here we extend our analysis using an individual based model to explore the dynamics of compensatory evolution in this system. We show that mutations which ameliorate the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage</b> can prevent both the loss of plasmids from the population and the fixation of accessory traits on the bacterial chromosome. We discuss how dependent the outcome of compensatory evolution is on the strength and availability of such mutations and the rate at which beneficial accessory traits integrate on the host chromosom...|$|R

40|$|Conjugative {{plasmids}} are {{widespread and}} {{play an important}} role in bacterial evolution by accelerating adaptation through horizontal gene transfer. However, explaining the long-term stability of plasmids remains challenging because segregational loss and the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage</b> should drive the loss of plasmids though purifying selection. Theoretical and experimental studies suggest two key evolutionary routes to plasmid stability: First, the evolution of high conjugation rates would allow plasmids to survive through horizontal transmission as infectious agents, and second, compensatory evolution to ameliorate the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage</b> can weaken purifying selection against plasmids. How these two evolutionary strategies for plasmid stability interact is unclear. Here, we summarise the literature on the evolution of plasmid stability and then use individual based modelling to investigate the evolutionary interplay between the evolution of plasmid conjugation rate and cost amelioration. We find that, individually, both strategies promote plasmid stability, and that they act together to increase the likelihood of plasmid survival. However, due to the inherent <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> increasing conjugation rate, particularly where conjugation is unlikely to be successful, our model predicts that amelioration is the more likely long-term solution to evolving stable bacteria-plasmid associations. Our model therefore suggests that bacteria-plasmid relationships should evolve towards lower plasmid costs that may forestall the evolution of highly conjugative, 'infectious' plasmids...|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} of the first crushing, at the end of 1883, hopes for a prosperous goldfield were high because of its well-constructed tramway, water races, and battery and because of the many {{apparently}} payable mines. Within a few months, the field’s reputation had plummeted, as formerly promising ground had proved to be unpayable.

Despite more prospecting and a second battery being erected, eventually, Waiorongomai’s fortunes failed to improve. Two new mining areas were discovered, at Stoney Creek and, more significantly, at Tui, the latter being a consequence of a new interest in finding silver. As a lack of capital was recognized as being a significant handicap, overseas capital was sought, successfully, but without permanently reversing the decline in the district’s fortunes. Too much ground was held for speculation, and too little profitable mining took place.

It has been shown that amongst fit individuals walking at a given speed and gradient, the energy <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carrying up to 30  % BW as external weight is the same as if that weight were additional BW [19].

60|$|Thus, the {{division}} of the cost of trade, and {{the division}} of the advantage of trade, are governed by precisely the same principles; and the only general proposition which can be affirmed respecting the cost is, that it is pro tanto a deduction from the advantage. It cannot even be maintained that the cost is shared in the same proportion as the advantage is; because the increase of the demand for a commodity as its price falls, is not governed by any fixed law. Suppose, for instance, that the advantage happened to be divided equally: this must be because the greater cheapness arising from the establishment of the trade, either did not affect the demand at all, or affected it in an equal proportion on both sides. Now, because such is the effect of the degree of increased cheapness resulting from importation burthened with <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> it would not follow that the still greater degree of cheapness, produced by the additional saving of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> itself, would also affect the demand of both countries in precisely an equal degree. But we cannot be said to bear an expense, which, if saved, would be saved to somebody else, and not to us. Two countries may have equal shares of the clear benefit of the trade, while, if the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> were saved, they would divide that saving unequally. If so, they divide the gross gain in one unequal ratio, the cost in another unequal ratio, though their shares of the cost being deducted from their shares of the gain leave equal remainders.|$|E
60|$|The {{expense of}} the {{carriage}} is evidently a deduction pro tanto from the saving of labour produced by {{the establishment of the}} trade.

But here the question arises, which of the two countries bears this deduction, or in what proportion it is divided between them.|$|E
40|$|SummaryPlasmids drive genomic {{diversity}} in bacteria via horizontal gene transfer [1, 2]; nevertheless, explaining their survival in bacterial populations is challenging [3]. Theory predicts that irrespective of their net fitness effects, plasmids should be lost: when parasitic (costs outweigh benefits), plasmids should decline due to purifying selection [4 – 6], yet under mutualism (benefits outweigh costs), selection favors {{the capture of}} beneficial accessory genes by the chromosome and loss of the costly plasmid backbone [4]. While compensatory evolution can enhance plasmid stability within populations [7 – 15], the propensity for this to occur across the parasitism-mutualism continuum is unknown. We experimentally evolved Pseudomonas fluorescens and its mercury resistance mega-plasmid, pQBR 103 [16], across an environment-mediated parasitism-mutualism continuum. Compensatory evolution stabilized plasmids by rapidly ameliorating the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage</b> in all environments. Genomic analysis revealed that, in both parasitic and mutualistic treatments, evolution repeatedly targeted the gacA/gacS bacterial two-component global regulatory system while leaving the plasmid sequence intact. Deletion of either gacA or gacS was sufficient to completely ameliorate the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> plasmid <b>carriage.</b> Mutation <b>of</b> gacA/gacS downregulated the expression of ∼ 17 % of chromosomal and plasmid genes and appears to have relieved the translational demand imposed by the plasmid. Chromosomal capture of mercury resistance accompanied by plasmid loss occurred throughout the experiment but very rarely invaded to high frequency, suggesting that rapid compensatory evolution can limit this process. Compensatory evolution can explain the widespread occurrence of plasmids and allows bacteria to retain horizontally acquired plasmids even in environments where their accessory genes are not immediately useful...|$|R

40|$|Plasmids are {{important}} drivers of bacterial evolution, {{but it is}} challenging to understand how plasmids persist over the long term because plasmid carriage is costly.

Methods: Different MGEs, including two conjugative transposons (CTns) of the Tn 916 family (18 and 33 kb), a pathogenicity island (PAI) of 200 kb and vancomycin-resistance (vanA) plasmids (80 – 200 kb) of various origins and classes, were transferred into common ancestral E. faecium and E. faecalis strains by conjugation assays and experimentally evolved (vanA plasmids only). Transconjugants were characterized by PFGE, S 1 nuclease assays and Southern blotting hybridization analyses. Single specific primer PCR was performed to {{determine the}} target sites for the insertion of the CTns. The fitness <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> various MGEs in E. faecium and E. faecalis were estimated in head-to-head competition experiments, and evolved populations were generated in serial transfer assays.
