40|$|Charges {{for parking}} in the {{countryside}} pose a particular dilemma in Scotland as they are seen by many outdoor groups as a backdoor approach to restricting the public's newly acquired right of responsible access to the countryside. The issue is particularly sensitive {{in the case of}} the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) where charging has spread to a number of key car parks across the area. Based on the results of a survey of over 300 visitors this paper investigates visitors' attitudes and perceptions towards car park charging in the CNP, and explores the conditions under which they would find charging legitimate; in particular, the notion <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> (i. e. the practice of declaring where and how monies contributed will be spent). We find that the vast majority of visitors surveyed are supportive of charging but that support is conditional on: the nature of the charging system, the type of location in question, and the landowners' commitment to hypothecating user fees for reinvestment in visitor facilities and preservation of the environment. We conclude by proposing a CNP-wide charging policy, fundamentally based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over corporeal movable property. This real right in security operates by way <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation,</b> often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default.

According to Article 1, paragraph (1) <b>of</b> <b>Hypothecation</b> Law (UUHT) No. 4 / 1996,” A hypothecation is a security right which is charged on land rights as it is stipulated in Law No. 5 / 1960 on the Principal Provision of Agrarian Law, with or without other objects related to the land to the paying off, the position is prioritized to a certain creditor other than to the other creditors. ” Although the ruling about sequestration is placed on the object case (the land) by the District Court, the ruling is void (illusoir) sinct e he position of the creditor as the receiver <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> is prioritized to carry out his rights according to civil law.

40|$|Environmental Tax Reform (ETR) {{is widely}} {{accepted}} to be a policy with desirable environmental, {{and other economic}} effects. The question arises then as to why its implementation has been so patchy. There is a broad literature on {{the economic impact of}} ETR, however, there have been very few research efforts devoted to understanding the roles and imperatives of the public, policy-makers, businesses and other stakeholders who are addressed by ETR. This paper examines the impediments to environmental tax reform. Focus groups were formed comprising of members of the general public and these provided a forum for detailed reactions to the ETR concept. Interviews were conducted with policy makers and key business people in an attempt to identify both the patterns of thinking behind ETR and the main obstacles to its introduction. Having presented the results, a theory of the main impediments to ETR is developed. The principal potential impediments to ETR include: mistrust of the government, implausibility of the policy, means <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation,</b> information asymmetries, the political system, the structure of government, the macroeconomic environment, the impact on competitiveness, inequity between sectors, regressivity, elasticities and the level of the tax, terminology, and the marketing of ETR...|$|R

40|$|A {{major concern}} of {{business}} {{with respect to}} transport-charging interventions is the context of revenue-investment policy, particularly how the timing of improvements may alter the time lags between fewer car journeys and more public transport journeys, and the problems for business in the intervening periods. The authors present a conceptual framework and case study of the whole-life effects on business performance. The impacts of charging occur as a sequence of gradually interacting changes, {{rather than as a}} single set of impacts, and positive amenity effects brought about through revenue hypothecation occur incrementally, taking years to achieve full effect. In the case study, a Delphi panel of business leaders predicted the time-marching effects of workplace-parking levies and road-user charging over a 24 -year period in Nottingham. The findings revealed that the temporal nature <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> results in minor fluctuations in performance for some business sectors in the first few years, but that these tail off as benefits gradually overwhelm disbenefits resulting in modest increases in performance for most sectors in the medium to long term. Many local authorities are reluctant to implement charging interventions due to concerns about economic vitality; it is expected that the results will inform policy and future research in this area. ...|$|R
