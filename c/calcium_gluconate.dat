40|$|I {{have some}} {{difficulty}} in using MTA {{because of its}} slow setting time. How can I make the MTA set faster or regulate the setting time?Q MTA is used widely in endodontic treatment as a pulp capping material, root-end filling material, and perforation repair. 1 Although MTA has many favorable properties, long setting time is a clinical disadvantage. To overcome this problem many studies were performed. Hydration accelerators, such as citric acid, lactic acid, calcium chloride, and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>gluconate,</b> were added during the mixing of MTA. In our previous study, hydration accelerators improved the setting time but the compressive strength decreased. 2 In the cytotoxicity test, citric acid and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>gluconate</b> showed favorable biocompatibility, while calcium chloride showed lower cell viability. 3 Therefore, addition {{of these kinds of}} hydration accelerators to MTA fastens the setting time of MTA. Recently, fast setting MTA like materials, such as Biodentine, was introduced. Biodentine showed fast setting time and higher compressive strength compared to MTA.

25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate)</b> increases {{threshold potential}} through a mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate</b> is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia. This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line.

Burns with areas larger than 160cm2 (25 square inches) have the {{potential}} to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. [...] In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the etiology for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Thus, hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride ions. HF chemical burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate</b> gel or special rinsing solutions.

50|$|There are {{two factors}} {{that need to}} be or can be {{adjusted}} for successful Reverse Spherification; The amount of free calcium ion and density of the liquid to be made for spherification. The amount of free calcium ion needs to be sufficient in order to form a gel-like capsule reaction with Sodium Alginate. Milk based product such as cream, yogurt or milk already has a sufficient amount of calcium. However, conducting reverse spherification with a liquid containing deficiency in calcium ion concentration, calcium salt could be added to the liquid; for example, <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>gluconate</b> could be added to a liquid to produce a 2% concentration in the liquid creating an effective solution for conducting reverse spherification. Calcium ion from calcium lactate is responsible for providing a gelling process without increasing the pH of the food to be too high and the gel will not melt once heating. Secondly, the density of the liquid need to be adjusted in order to allow the sufficient surface tension to form a spherical shape of this desired method. Xanthan gum can be used in order to increase the viscosity of the liquid. Usually, the concentration of Xanthan Gum ranges between 0.2% and 0.5%.|$|R

40|$|Background Case {{reports have}} {{identified}} hydrofluoric acid (HF) as causing fatal work injury, and HF has {{both local and}} systemic toxicity. Surveillance for HF-related mortality is problematic {{because of the lack}} of unique coding for this acid in hospital records and vital statistics. Methods We identified HF-related fatal work injuries investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 1984 – 94 from coding of Hazardous Substance 1460 (HF) and requested case investigation files under the Freedom of Information Act. We attempted to identify HF-related deaths in the US for the same period through literature case reports, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). Results For the 11 year period, OSHA investigated nine deaths in eight incidents which involved HF. Four deaths were from skin contact with concentrated HF, and five deaths involved both skin contact and inhalation of vapor. Unsafe work practices were factors in all of the deaths. <b>Calcium</b> chloride or <b>gluconate</b> was noted to have been administered to five of the nine victims.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that in the vitamin D-deficient state the activity of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 - 1 alpha-hydroxylase (25 -OHD 3 - 1 alpha-hydroxylase) is modulated by parathyroid hormone and the plasma concentration of phosphate only {{in the presence of}} small amounts of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (or some other metabolite of vitamin D), we measured the activity of this enzyme 24 h after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in frankly hypocalcemic, vitamin D-deficient chicks that were not supplemented with vitamin D or one of its metabolites. The otherwise predictable complications of PTX in this metabolic setting (hypocalcemia of increasing severity, tetany, moribundity, and death) were prevented by continuous intravenous administration of calcium (as a solution of <b>calcium</b> chloride/calcium <b>gluconate</b> 1 : 1) through a catheter in the external jugular vein placed at the time of PTX. The findings were as follows: (a) The activity of 25 -OHD 3 - 1 alpha-hydroxylase was significantly less in the parathyroidectomized group than in the sham-operated control chicks (P less than 0. 001). (b) The reductive effect of PTX on the activity of this enzyme was significantly attenuated when hypophosphatemia was increased in severity by administration of glucose. (c) In the post-PTX state the activity of 25 -OHD 3 - 1 alpha-hydroxylase and plasma concentration of phosphate were significantly, inversely related (P less than 0. 001). (d) In the sham-operated control group the activity of this enzyme and the plasma concentration of phosphate were not significantly correlated. These findings indicate that in the vitamin D-deficient state, both circulating parathyroid hormone and the plasma concentration of phosphate can significantly modulate the activity of 25 -OHD 3 - 1 alpha-hydroxylase in the absence of vitamin D or its metabolites. The findings also suggest that in the vitamin D-deficient state the plasma concentration of phosphate modulates the activity of this enzyme only when the concentration of circulating parathyroid hormone is not increased...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Vascular {{responses}} to calcium were studied in 14 genetically hypertensive (GH) rats of the New Zealand strain and 16 weight- and age-matched normotensive parent strain control rats under chloralose-pentobarbital anesthesia. <b>Calcium</b> (chloride or <b>gluconate)</b> in an isosmolar solution was infused intraarterially into the hindlimb vascular bed which was vascularly isolated, innervated, and pump-perfused (blood, 1 ml/min). Increases in limb plasma calcium concentrations up to 30 mEq/ liter decreased limb vascular resistance, with {{no evidence for}} vasoconstriction. In GH rats decreases in limb vascular resistance in response to increments in limb plasma calcium concentrations of 3. 6 to 10. 8 mEq/liter were significantly (p < 0. 02) attenuated compared to age-matched controls. When responses in GH were compared to weight-matched controls, similar trends toward attenuation reached significance (p < 0. 02) at Ca 2 + increments of 10. 8 mEq/liter. In eight other GH rats, we measured total serum calcium concentrations and found them reduced (4. 94 ± 0. 08 mEq/liter), especially as compared to values in eight rats of an unrelated Wistar strain (5. 42 ± 0. 04 mEq/liter; p < 0. 05).

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relative}} importance of calcium and gastrin in regulation of calcitonin secretion, we administered graded oral doses of calcium to 10 normal men, ages 23 - 29 yr. Each subject had previously shown an appropriate increase in calcitonin secretion in response to a pharmacologic (0. 5 μg/kg) pentagastrin injection. On separate days and in random order, each man drank 250 ml of distilled water containing 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 5, and 3. 0 g of elemental <b>calcium</b> as the <b>gluconate</b> salt. Blood samples were drawn before and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after the oral calcium dose. The samples were analyzed for calcium by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and for gastrin and calcitonin by radioimmunoassays of established sensitivity and specificity. Ingestion of water (control) caused no change in any of the three variables. Calcium ingestion resulted in dose-related increases, within the normal range, of all three variables. Immunoreactive gastrin rose promptly, peaking at 30 min, and returning to basal levels or below by 120 min. In contrast, calcium and immunoreactive calcitonin levels rose slowly and in parallel, peaking at 120 - 240 min. Changes in calcitonin and changes in calcium were strongly and positively correlated, r = 0. 73, when all data were pooled. Furthermore, individual linear regressions for changes in calcitonin and calcium levels (calculated separately for the three oral calcium doses in each subject) had positive slopes in 28 out of 30 sets (P < 0. 01). The changes in calcitonin concentrations were much more poorly correlated with the corresponding changes in serum gastrin levels; in fact, the regression coefficient was weakly negative, r = − 0. 20. These results show that, at least in young adult men, changes of ambient calcium concentration within the normal range may be of major importance in physiologic regulation of calcitonin secretion. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that calcitonin functions to prevent excessive postprandial hypercalcemia...|$|R
