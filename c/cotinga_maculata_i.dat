40|$|Dactylorhiza maculata is {{a common}} {{terrestrial}} orchid in Finland. It is nectarless and the seed production is relatively high for a deceptive species. The pollinators of D. maculata do not have frequent visits to the flowers, but the species is capable of over 50 % seed capsule production. Geitonogamy is the transfer of self pollen between flowers on the same individual. It is typical that the pollinators of deceptive inflorescences visit only few flowers and have short stays in them, and therefore it is commonly thought that geitonogamy is infrequent among deceptive species. I examined the role of geitonogamy in the seed production of D. <b>maculata.</b> <b>I</b> prevented geitonogamy in male-sterilization experiment by removing the pollinaria in the experiment group, and in hand-pollination experiment I conducted cross-fertilization and self-fertilization (in the form of both geitonogamy and autogamy). When the seeds had matured I calculated the relative seed capsule production in male-sterilization experiment, and estimated the proportions of embryonic seeds in both experiments. From this data I analyzed the differences in fertilization success and seed quality. The seed quality in both experiments was verified with in vitro germination of the seeds. I found that geitonogamy is not a significant reproduction strategy for D. maculata, because self-pollination is a disadvantage that reduces the seed set and the seed quality. One mechanism to prevent geitonogamy is pollinaria bending, a time delay before the freshly withdrawn pollinaria are able to conduct fertilization. In D. maculata this delay is approximately 50 s which is rather long for a deceptive species. The explanation for the high natural seed capsule production of D. maculata might be a fact that probably the species is not deceptive in all means. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were found to act as beetle pollinators in the study population. The beetles were found to bear large pollinaria loads of up to approximately 30 pollinaria...|$|R

50|$|Inocybe maculata has no {{generally}} recognised synonyms. However, {{there has}} been some debate about its status as a single species; due to the wide geographic and morphological variation of the species, some authors have proposed multiple species and varieties. In response, mycologist Thom Kuyper has listed over thirty specific names and varieties as synonyms of Inocybe lacera, which is still generally recognised. It has also been suggested that Inocybe lanatodisca is a synonym, but where the species occur together, they can be distinguished from each other, and so it is still recognised as distinct.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} and describe different aspects of variation in the Dactylorhiza maculata complex and to relate the variation patterns to underlying biological processes such as Quaternary migration history, hybridization and polyploid evolution. The variation patterns were analysed at various geographic levels using molecular markers (plastid DNA and ITS of nrDNA), cytological data, morphometry and ecological data. A total of c. 2 500 plants from almost 400 populations from throughout Europe were analysed. Dactylorhiza maculata s. l. is the maternal parent of many allotetraploid taxa. It was shown that allotetraploids in Scandinavia belong to several different widespread lineages that probably arose before the last glaciation. A minimum of three autotetraploid lineages were discerned in the D. <b>maculata</b> complex: (<b>i)</b> southern/western ssp. <b>maculata,</b> (ii) northern/eastern ssp. maculata and (iii) Central European ssp. fuchsii. The southern/western and northern/eastern lineages, which probably predate the last glaciation, form a contact zone in central Scandinavia. Measures of genetic diversity therefore reach high values in central Scandinavia. A high frequency of intermediate plastid haplotypes in the contact zone suggests that plastid DNA recombination is occurring there. Source areas for postglacial migration of ssp. maculata may have been Central Europe and parts of central Russia located between the Fennoscandian ice sheet and the Urals. Areas of sheltered topography in Central Europe may have provided suitable habitats for the more thermophilous ssp. fuchsii. A clinal differentiation in genetic markers from the south to the north was observed for ssp. fuchsii (including ssp. saccifera). The tetraploid lineage of ssp. fuchsii is poorly separated from diploid ssp. fuchsii and probably originated during the current postglacial period. The Mediterranean region and the Caucasus have not contributed to northward migration, neither for ssp. fuchsii, nor for ssp. maculata. Introgression between ssp. fuchsii and ssp. maculata is limited. The differentiation between diploid ssp. fuchsii and autotetraploid ssp. maculata in hybrid zones is reinforced by niche separation at the microhabitat level...|$|R

40|$|Many prey species lack innate {{recognition}} of their potential predators. Hence, learning is required for them to recognize and respond to predation threats. When wild-caught, these same species may show amazing sophistication in their responses to predator cues. They are able to adjust the intensity of their antipredator responses to a particular predator according {{to the degree of}} threat posed by that predator. This ability is therefore acquired through learning. While many studies have shown that prey can learn to respond to predator cues through different learning modes, little is known about what the prey are actually learning. The results presented in this thesis show that learned predator recognition goes beyond the simple labelling of predators as dangerous. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), woodfrog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles and boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris <b>maculata)</b> tadpoles, <b>I</b> demonstrated that a one time learning event, either through pairing with alarm cues or through social learning, was enough for prey to learn the level of threat associated with the novel predator cues. I showed that the level of danger associated with the predator cues was determined by the concentration of alarm cues when learning through pairing of alarm cues, or by the intensity of antipredator response displayed by the tutors and by the tutor-to-observer ratio when learning occurred through cultural transmission. Moreover, when subsequently exposed to predator cues, prey adjusted their antipredator responses according to the change in concentration of predator cues between the learning event and the subsequent exposure. Prey displayed stronger antipredator responses when exposed to higher concentrations of predator cues and vice versa. When minnows were provided with conflicting information about the danger level associated with a predator, they displayed a safety strategy and used the most recent information available to respond to predation threats. On a longer time scale, the data also suggest that woodfrog tadpoles are able to learn to respond to predation threats according to the risk posed by the predator at different times of day. Finally, I showed that prey learn to recognize particular characteristics of predators and can generalize their antipredator responses to novel species sharing those characteristics. However, generalization of predator recognition is dependent on the level of risk associated with the predator. Threat-sensitive learning is an extremely complex process shaped by the millions of years of selection imposed by predators on prey...|$|R
40|$|Cryptomonad algae (cryptophyte algae), {{originated}} from a eukaryotic host cell and a eukaryotic endosymbiont by secondary endosymbiosis, are unicellular biflagellate, freshwater or marine, eukaryotic algae, unique among flagellate algae in having phycobiliproteins (Cr-phycoerythrin or Cr-phycocyanin) as photosynthetic accessory pigments. An eyespot is {{found only in}} some species (e. g. Chroomonas coerulea) {{although most of the}} cryptomonad species are phototactic. Cryptomonad phototaxis may be exclusively positive (Cryptomonas sp. CR- 1, cryptomonas rostratiformis and Chroomonas nordstedtii) or exclusively negative (Chroomonas coerulea) or positive at low fluence rates and negative at higher fluence rates (Cryptomonas <b>maculata)</b> or diaphototactic, <b>i.</b> e. orienting perpendicular to the direction of the light beam (Cryptomonas sp. S 2). Action spectroscopy for positive phototaxis in Cryptomonas sp. CR- 1 led to the discovery of its very unique yellow-light sensing with an action peak in the yellow light region at ca. 560 nm, which was later confirmed in the action spectrum for positive phototaxis in cryptomonas rostratiformis and Chroomonas nordstedtii, together with a new action peak at 460 nm (the former showing also a UV peak at 280 nm), strongly suggesting that the photoreceptor mediating positive phototaxis is common among these species, and not phycobilins. Analyses using repeated pulses of stimulus light showed that light is sensed by the ventral side of Cryptomonas sp. CR- 1 cells. The striking similarity of the action spectra for photoaccumulation and light-induced membrane depolarization in the ciliate Paramecium with that for the cryptomonad phototaxis seems to suggest considerable common nature of their unidentified photoreceptors. Analyses of phototactic responses of Cryptomonas sp. CR- 1 cells to intermittent light stimuli with variable light durations and dark intervals revealed a striking dark interval dependence, suggesting also considerable similarity in the photoreceptor-signal transduction processes between cryptomonads and the green alga Chlamydomonas, in which retinal-binding protein(s) are supposed to work as the photoreceptor(s) for its green-light sensing phototaxis, suggesting that a dark interval dependence of phototaxis is theoretically expected on the basis of kinetic analyses of the photoreceptor current. The presence of Ca 2 + is crucially needefor phototactic orientation and antagonized by K + ions, consistently with other phototactic organisms such as Chlamydomonas, Euglena and Paramecium. The ecological significance of cryptomonad phototaxis is demonstrated, in general accordance with other algae, as the means for the cells to locate themselves in photosynthetically advantageous light habitats and to avoid harmful strong light or UV radiation both horizontally and vertically. The molecular identification of the photoreceptor pigment(s) as well as the understanding of the ecological and biochemical meanings of the UV-sensing in Cryptomonas is a challenging subject of future studies...|$|R
