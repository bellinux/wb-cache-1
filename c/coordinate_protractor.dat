Students will learn to use the grid <b>coordinate</b> <b>protractor</b> (GCP) to plot azimuth values as a means of indicating direction on these maps; they will also learn to perform simple map traverses.

40|$|All {{students}} will regularly and routinely use calculators, computers, manipulatives, and other mathematical tools to enhance mathematical thinking, understanding, and power. Descriptive Statement Calculators, computers, manipulatives, and other mathematical tools {{need to be}} used by students in both instructional and assessment activities. These tools should be used, not to replace mental math and paperand-pencil computational skills, but to enhance understanding of mathematics and the power to use mathematics. Historically, people have developed and used manipulatives (such as fingers, base ten blocks, geoboards, and algebra tiles) and mathematical devices (such as <b>protractors,</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems, and calculators) to help them understand and develop mathematics. Students should explore both new and familiar concepts with calculators and computers, but should also become proficient in using technology as it is used by adults, that is, for assistance in solving real-world problems. Meaning and Importance Both mathematics and the way we do mathematics have changed dramatically in the last few decades. The presence of technology has made more mathematics accessible to us, has allowed us to solve mathematica...|$|R
