The rotational speed of centrifuge is directly proportional to the infiltration force that penetrates into the nanochannels of the template. By varying the rotational speed of centrifuge, different types of PCPDTBT nanostructures are procured. Infiltration force created during the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>process</b> has been found a dominant factor in tuning the morphological, optical, and structural properties of PCPDTBT nanostructures. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images proved the formation of nanotubes and nanowires.

40|$|Batchwise <b>centrifugal</b> {{filtration}} <b>process</b> of limestone^- and coal-water slurries were experimentally {{investigated by}} using the method of stroboscopic photography, instead of the conventional method to measure the volume of filtrate. By means of this method, the relation between filtrate volume and time was exactly determined and the <b>centrifugal</b> sedimentation <b>process</b> of particles was examined in detail. The particle settling {{had to be taken}} into account the <b>centrifugal</b> filtration <b>process.</b> It was demonstrated that the cake volume predicted on the basis of filtrate volume was largely different from the true value, and consequently the specific filtration resistance could not be determined as a characteristic value of the cake. Thus, the rate equation of cake formation was derived taking into account the particle setting. And then it was approximated to simplify the subsequent calculating procedure. By using this equation and the experimental data, the true values of average specific resistance were calculated and the batchwise <b>centrifugal</b> filtration <b>process</b> was predicted in the course of time. The process calculated by the approximated method, which proposed in this paper, was favourably consistent with the experimental course. In addition to the conclusion, the process predicted by the precise filtration theory, which was in need of the compression-permeability data and a trial and error calculating method, showed fairly coincidence with the experimental results...|$|R
