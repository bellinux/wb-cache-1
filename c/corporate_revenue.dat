40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{economic}} determinants of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenue</b> to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across European Union members {{over the period}} 1998 - 2009. The Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) regression results suggest that structural, cyclical, international and institutional factors such as GDP, Government Deficit, Industry Turnover, Unemployment, Number of Enterprises, Trade Openness, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Corruption affect revenue performance of an economy. Thus, the findings show that Unemployment Rate and Corruption have an adverse effect on tax collection, while the other analysed factors contribute to a better performance concerning tax collection. In the present paper we also consider as explanatory factors the tax variables Effective Average Tax Rate (EATR) and Effective Marginal Tax Rate (EMTR). In fact, empirical results indicate a parabolic relationship between EMTR and <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues,</b> reinforcing the hypothesis {{of the existence of}} a Laffer curve. Our findings also suggest that {{the last two years of}} European Union enlargement are likely not to have had effect in <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenue</b> to GDP.

40|$|This study investigates why {{countries}} mandate accruals in {{the definition}} of corporate taxable income. Accruals alleviate timing and matching problems in cash flows, which smoothes taxable income and thus better aligns it with underlying economic performance. These accrual properties can be desirable in the tax setting as tax authorities seek more predictable <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues.</b> However, they can also make tax revenues procyclical by increasing the correlation between aggregate <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues</b> and aggregate economic activity. We argue that accruals shape the distribution of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues,</b> which leads regulators to incorporate accruals into the definition of taxable income to balance the portfolio of government revenues and expenditures. Using a sample of 26 OECD countries, we find support for several theoretically motivated factors explaining the use of accruals in tax codes. We first provide evidence that <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues</b> are less volatile in high accrual countries, but high accrual countries collect relatively higher (lower) tax <b>revenues</b> when the <b>corporate</b> sector grows (contracts). Critically, we then show that accruals and smoother tax revenues are favored by countries with higher levels of government spending on public services and uncertain future expenditures, while countries with procyclical other tax collections favor cash rules and lower procyclicality of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues...</b>|$|R

In order to assess the outcome of corporate tax competition as it is reflected by the firms’ behavioural responses, a panel data for EU countries was used.

5000|$|Third: The Illinois Watch Company. The Illinois Springfield Watch Company was reorganized in {{the autumn}} and winter of 1878, and was renamed the [...] "Illinois Watch Company" [...] (the final name of the corporation). Chief {{executive}} leadership of the corporation was assumed by Jacob Bunn, Sr. (1814-1897), an Illinois industrialist, railroad financier, railroad reorganizer, wholesale grocer, commission merchant, newspaper publisher, land developer, coal operator, political advisor and financier, banker, and rope manufacturer. Jacob Bunn was the older brother of John Whitfield Bunn, and both men were among the closest friends and political allies of Illinois lawyer and statesman Abraham Lincoln, whose political career was largely financed and managed by the Bunn brothers. Jacob Bunn, Sr., oversaw the steady growth of the new corporation, and under his administration the corporate employment grew from 260 in the year 1879 to 400 in the year 1880. Jacob Bunn led corporate sales along a certain and definite trajectory of growth in both volume of manufacture and <b>corporate</b> <b>revenue.</b> In 1879, the corporation manufactured 33,285 watch movements. In 1880, the corporation manufactured 47,065 watch movements. By 1890 the concern had established corporate offices in Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. The corporation helped pioneer the logistical technology that served the enforcement of standard time for railroads throughout the world. At its apex of profitability, the Illinois Watch Company employed approximately 1,200 people.|$|E

Bunn acted as {{a founding member of}} the shoe and boot manufacturing firm of M. Selz & Company, and held the executive position of Vice President with the shoe manufacturer for several years prior to his death. The Chicago firm, known later as Selz, Schwab & Company, rapidly achieved international scope in its markets, and extraordinary magnitude and profitability in its manufacturing business. The Selz, Schwab Company at one time owned and operated eleven factories, and after the company dissolved and ceased to exist, during the Great Depression, one of the factories was transferred to five employees who had begun their careers with the firm as office boys. Prior to 1894, the Selz, Schwab Company had generated annual revenues in excess of $2 million. The Selz, Schwab Shoe Company once enjoyed the status of being one of the largest shoe and boot manufacturers, if not the largest shoe and boot manufacturer, in the world, and was known to have filled individual foreign country orders to the scale of 1 million pairs of shoes, and 500,000 pairs of shoes. The <b>corporate</b> <b>revenue</b> was a multimillion-dollar figure in the early twentieth century, and the corporation rapidly grew to be one of the largest manufacturing concerns in the United States.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the response of}} <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues</b> to the business cycle, the so called ‘cyclicality of corporate tax revenues’. It distinguishes between {{the impact of the}} business cycle in recessions and booms and calculates the asymmetry in tax revenues response. It also explains the heterogeneous nature of the asymmetries using a new index of loss offset generosity provisions. We find that the short run contemporaneous impact of business cycle on <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues</b> is quite strong in normal times, but much lower in booms. The asymmetry of cyclicality between booms and recessions is persistent and points to larger responses in recessions. We also show how sensitive tax revenue responses are to different recession and boom thresholds. Importantly, we find that loss offset generosity provisions enhance this asymmetry in the cyclicality of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues.</b> Countries that are more generous in terms of loss offset provisions experience much more volatile response of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>revenues</b> to business cycle during recessions, magnifying the asymmetry of cyclicality. As a result the automatic stabilizer impact of corporation tax will differ between booms and recessions, being stronger and more effective in the latter, especially in countries that offer more generous loss-offset provisions...|$|R
