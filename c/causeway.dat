5|$|In 1937, {{work had}} progressed on {{extending}} Berwick Street eastwards, {{and it had}} been extended to Alday Street by November 1938. A new <b>causeway</b> to extend Berwick Street north over the Swan River, and make it a truck route, was considered by the state government in 1940. The existing <b>Causeway,</b> from which Albany Road commenced, had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939. However, the new <b>Causeway</b> was eventually constructed adjacent to old <b>Causeway,</b> which was then demolished.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new bridge at The Narrows {{downstream}} from the <b>Causeway</b> in the aftermath of World War II were put on hold while a new <b>Causeway</b> could be constructed. Vehicle traffic using the <b>Causeway</b> had almost doubled between 1930 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad <b>causeway</b> result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the <b>causeway</b> a greenish color. North of the <b>causeway,</b> the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the <b>causeway.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also {{related to}} ring ditches, is the <b>causewayed</b> ring ditch, {{which is a}} roughly {{circular}} ditch with a central area and multiple <b>causeways</b> which cross it. The <b>causewayed</b> ring ditch is a subcategory of the ring ditch.|$|R
50|$|Whitehawk Camp is a Neolithic <b>causewayed</b> camp of the Windmill Hill culture {{inhabited}} {{sometime around}} 2700 BC. It is a scheduled ancient monument {{and is one}} of three <b>causewayed</b> camps known to have existed in the South Downs.|$|R
50|$|It {{comprises}} {{a roughly}} circular ditch, segmented by several <b>causeways</b> which cross it. Within the ditch {{is a central}} area used for inhumations and cremations, usually covered beneath a barrow. They are considerable smaller than the <b>causewayed</b> enclosures they resemble.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Causeway</b> Bay Books disappearances are {{a series}} of {{international}} disappearances concerning five staff members of <b>Causeway</b> Bay Books, located in <b>Causeway</b> Bay, Hong Kong. Between October and December 2015, five staff of <b>Causeway</b> Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to have crossed the border through legal channels.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the <b>Causeway</b> had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the <b>Causeway</b> continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the <b>Causeway</b> from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the <b>Causeway.</b>|$|E
2500|$|All of the Norfolk <b>Causewayed</b> {{enclosure}} sites {{appear to}} be approximately circular, defined by relatively narrow ditches and pit sections, interspersed with narrow <b>causeways.</b> These enclosures are generally defined by single ditches, however the recently published plot of Roughton (Oswald et al., 2001: fig. 6.7), has identified a second, more ephemeral, inner ditch or feature. The three possible Norfolk examples are relatively small and have a marked circularity in comparison to many other <b>causewayed</b> enclosure sites in England ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Causewayed</b> {{enclosures}} {{are often}} located on hilltop sites, encircled by {{one to four}} concentric ditches with an internal bank. Enclosures located in lowland areas are generally larger than hilltop ones. Crossing the ditches at intervals are <b>causeways</b> which give the monuments their names. It appears that the ditches were excavated in sections, leaving the wide <b>causeways</b> intact in between. They {{should not be confused}} with segmented, or <b>causewayed</b> ring ditches, which are smaller and are thought to relate only to funerary activity, or with hillforts, which appeared later and had a definite defensive function. With regard to defensive functionality, however, evidence of timber palisades has been found at some sites such as Hambledon Hill.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{excavations}} by the National Roads Authority for the Inner Relief Road {{route in}} Magheraboy near Sligo - three kilometers from Carrowmore - {{have shown that}} a <b>causewayed</b> enclosure existed {{at the same time}} as Carrowmore. <b>Causewayed</b> enclosures are diagnostic of Neolithic activity in Europe.|$|R

5|$|Originally {{the site}} of mudflats which {{restricted}} river navigation, the Colony Government constructed a <b>causeway</b> and bridge across the site. The project was first planned in 1834 and opened in 1843. When floods in 1862 almost destroyed it, the structure was rebuilt using convict labour, and raised to better withstand future floods. Governor John Hampton officially opened the new <b>Causeway</b> on 12 November 1867. Over the following decades, the three bridges making up this second <b>Causeway</b> were widened several times, and they were eventually replaced in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Author Michael Scott Rohan drew on {{the legend}} of Wade's <b>Causeway,</b> as well as wider English, Germanic and Norse mythology, when he wrote his Winter of the World trilogy while living in Yorkshire. The books feature mention of a legendary giant, Vayde, who ordered to be built a <b>causeway</b> across the marshes.|$|E
500|$|By the Late Classic, {{a network}} of sacbeob (<b>causeways)</b> linked {{various parts of the}} city, running for several {{kilometres}} through its urban core. These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 (located about [...] to the west) and the Temple of the Inscriptions (about [...] to the southeast). These broad <b>causeways</b> were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists; the Maler, Maudslay, Tozzer and Méndez <b>causeways.</b> They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams.|$|R
50|$|The arduous {{assignment}} of the combat demolition units {{was only the}} beginning of the Seabees' work on Normandy's beaches. After the invasion fleet had arrived off the coast, The approximately 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began manhandling their pontoon <b>causeways</b> onto the beach. It was over these <b>causeways</b> that the infantry charged ashore. Under constant German fire, directed at slowing or stopping the landings, the Seabees succeeded in placing large numbers of these pontoon <b>causeways.</b> Allied troops and tanks subsequently swept ashore in ever greater numbers and pushed the German defenders inland.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Causeway</b> is an {{arterial}} traffic crossing in Perth, Western Australia, {{linking the}} inner-city suburbs of East Perth and Victoria Park. It {{is composed of}} two bridges either side of Heirisson Island that cross the Swan River at {{the eastern end of}} Perth Water. The current <b>Causeway</b> is the third structure to have been built across the river at this point.|$|E
5|$|The Maler <b>Causeway</b> runs {{north from}} behind Temple I to Group H. A large {{bas-relief}} is carved onto limestone bedrock upon {{the course of}} the <b>causeway</b> just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Tozzer <b>Causeway</b> runs {{west from}} the Great Plaza to Temple IV.|$|E
5000|$|Canals and <b>causeways</b> often {{connected}} {{areas of}} human settlement, radiating outwards {{from the large}} mounds. They served multiple functions: transportation, drainage, boundary markers, and enhancing fishery resources. Zigzag <b>causeways</b> in some areas are interpreted as being fish weirs. Fish were probably {{the main source of}} protein for the pre-historic inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Causeways</b> {{are also}} common in Florida, where low bridges may connect several {{man-made}} islands, {{often with a}} much higher bridge (or part of a single bridge) in the middle so that taller boats may pass underneath safely. <b>Causeways</b> are most often used to connect the barrier islands with the mainland.|$|R

5|$|The {{previous}} <b>Causeway</b> {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new <b>Causeway</b> would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the <b>Causeway</b> were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|Along the <b>causeway</b> {{east of the}} extension, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) {{estimated}} that 37,500cars drove on the route each day.|$|E

5|$|In Johor Bahru, the Malay Peninsula railway {{extension}} {{was completed}} in 1909, and {{the completion of the}} Johor–Singapore <b>Causeway,</b> a <b>causeway</b> in 1923 that linked the railway and road systems between Singapore and the Malay Peninsula. Johor Bahru developed at a modest rate between the First and SecondWorldWars. The secretariat building—Sultan Ibrahim Building—{{was completed in}} 1940 as the British colonial government attempted to streamline the state's administration.|$|E
5|$|In Perth, a {{roundabout}} {{was constructed}} at the north-western end of Albany Highway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic onto and off The <b>Causeway.</b> It opened in 1952, with guides on the usage of the roundabout published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began to upgrade the intersection to a partial cloverleaf interchange at {{the eastern end of}} The <b>Causeway.</b> The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
