40|$|The major {{aspects of}} this project are {{proceeding}} toward completion. Prior to this quarter, design criteria, tentative site selection, facility layout, and preliminary facility cost estimates have been completed and issued for review. Processing of bio-solids was completed, providing material for the pilot operations. Pilot facility design, equipment selection, and modification were completed during {{the fourth quarter of}} 2000. Initial pilot facility shakedown was completed during the fourth quarter. After some unavoidable delays, a suitable representative supply of municipal solid waste (MSW) feed material was procured. During this quarter (first quarter of 2001), shredding of the feed material was completed and final feed conditioning was completed. Pilot facility hydrolysis production was completed to produce lignin for <b>co-fire</b> testing. Pilot facility modifications continued to improve facility operations and performance during the first quarter of 2001.

5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the <b>co-firing</b> of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the {{electricity}} more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E

This research describes {{the development of a}} design methodology and the processing for fabrication of MEMS devices in LTCC. To demonstrate the capabilities of Ceramic MEMS, an Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS) sensor was designed and fabricated using Low Temperature <b>Co-Fired</b> Ceramic (LTCC) materials. The IMS measures the time of flight of an ion through an electric field at atmospheric pressure and correlates this time to a distinct chemical species. Current instruments are large, expensive, and have sizable power requirements. The LTCC IMS was designed for permanent deployment below ground to continuously conduct groundwater analysis. The reduction in size of the instrument was made possible by the novel use of LTCC packaging technology...|$|R
500|$|The station tested <b>co-firing</b> biomass in {{the summer}} of 2004, and in doing so was the first power station in the UK to be fuelled by wood. The initial trial of 14,100 tonnes of willow was locally sourced from nearby Eggborough. Since the trial, the station's use of biomass has continued. It uses direct {{injection}} for firing the biomass, whereby it bypasses the pulverising mills and is either injected directly into the boiler or the fuel line, for greater throughput. In 2009 a target was set for 12.5% of the station's energy to be sourced from biomass, and the shift to biomass was intended to contribute to the aim of cutting [...] emissions by 15%. The station burns a large range of biomass, mostly wood pellets, sunflower pellets, olive, peanut shell husk and rape meal. The majority comes from overseas. A 100,000 tonne pa capacity straw pelletization facility was constructed at Capitol Park, Goole in 2008, opened 2009. Construction of specialised biomass handling facilities began in 2009 at the Port of Tyne and at Drax.|$|E
2500|$|Longannet {{power station}} [...] {{is a large}} closed {{coal-fired}} power station in Fife. It was the last coal-fired power station in Scotland.

2500|$|Landfill gas {{cannot be}} {{distributed}} through utility natural gas pipelines {{unless it is}} cleaned up to less than 3 per cent , and a few parts per million , because [...] and [...] corrode the pipelines. The presence of [...] will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline. [...] Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners {{and need to be}} removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site. [...] If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, siloxanes can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet emission standards, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. <b>Co-firing</b> landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.|$|E

50|$|The Studstrup Power Station (Studstrupværket) is an oil and {{coal-fired}} {{thermal power}} plant at Studstrup, Denmark. It is operated by DONG Energy. It has an electrical generation capacity of 700 MW and went in service in 1968. The chimney of the power plant is 189.89 m tall. The plant can partially <b>co-fire</b> biomass {{in the form of}} straw. Waste heat from the plant is directed via pipes into Århus and used for district heating.|$|R
50|$|Indirect <b>co-firing</b> systems imply {{usually more}} complex and {{expensive}} solutions, but they reduce usually problems related with corrosion, fouling, slagging, etc. This, a priori, allows <b>co-firing</b> rates larger than direct systems, that is, larger percentages of coal substituted by biomass or waste. In addition, indirect <b>co-firing</b> systems are in general better for fuel mixtures where secondary fuel may include potential contaminants like heavy metals or other dangerous inorganic compounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Co-firing</b> is the {{combustion}} {{of two different}} types of materials at the same time. One of the advantages of <b>co-firing</b> is that an existing plant can be used to burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For example, biomass is sometimes co-fired in existing coal plants instead of new biomass plants. <b>Co-firing</b> {{can also be used to}} improve {{the combustion}} of fuels with low energy content. For example, landfill gas contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which is non-combustible. If the landfill gas is burned without removing the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or emissions of pollutants may increase. <b>Co-firing</b> it with natural gas increases the heat content of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance. As long as the electricity or heat produced with the biomass and landfill gas was otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are essentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also, <b>co-firing</b> can be used to lower the emission of some pollutants. For example, <b>co-firing</b> biomass with coal results in less sulfur emissions than burning coal by itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Co-firing</b> (also {{referred}} to as complementary firing or co-combustion) is the combustion of two different fuels in the same combustion system. Fuels can be solid fuels, liquid fuels or gaseous, and its source either fossil or renewable. Therefore, use of heavy fuel oil assisting coal power stations may technically be considered <b>co-firing.</b> However the term <b>co-firing</b> {{is used in the}} present technological framework to designate combined combustion of two (or more) fuels sustained in time, as a normal daily practice.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>co-firing</b> is quite simple. It {{consists}} {{in the use}} of two or more fuels inside the same combustion device. It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation (pulverized fuel, fluidized bed combustion and grate firing). <b>Co-firing</b> in cement kilns is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of waste materials mostly, as well as for biomass. The iron industry (blast furnace) and domestic sector (coal stoves) are also sectors where <b>co-firing</b> could be implemented.|$|E
50|$|The <b>co-firing</b> systems, {{according}} to {{the current state of}} the art and the future perspectives, can be classified into direct and indirect <b>co-firing</b> technologies. The former refer to those systems where combustion of both fuels takes place at the same combustion device or into the same boiler simultaneously. The secondary fuel (biomass, waste) may be either mixed with coal before the combustion starts or fed by a separate device, e.g. specific biomass burners. Indirect <b>co-firing,</b> on the contrary, separates the combustion of both solid fuels, though Combustion Gasses may be mixed afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Direct biomass <b>co-firing</b> systems entail {{advantages}} of simplicity and economics. However direct <b>co-firing</b> systems {{are also more}} sensitive to variations in fuel quality and heterogeneity. Additionally other problems limit the rate of secondary fuel replacing the original fossil fuels.
