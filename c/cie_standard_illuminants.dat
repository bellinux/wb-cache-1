B {{served as a}} representative of noon sunlight, with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4874 K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774 K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B & C were deprecated in favor of the D series:.

This {{standard}} defines the spectral power distribution of the two fundamental colorimetric illuminants, Illuminant A and D 65 at 1 nm intervals to six significant digits. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of CIE Standard Illuminat A is based on Planck's law, the relative spectral power distribution has been calculated using Plank's formula at every nanometer between 300 nm and 830 nm. Although the SPD could be calculated also at intermediate wavelength directly from Planck's formula, the standard states that for such wavelengths linear interpolation should be used. The difference between the linearly interpolated value and the exact SPD calculated from Planck's formula is at 300 nm of the order of 10 - 4, at longer wavelength it becomes even less significant.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an effective approach for the optimization of multiband spectra to produce prospective white-light spectra having specific color temperatures. The optimization process employs a genetic algorithm known as differential evolution, {{which aims to}} minimize the color rendering differences between a prospective white-light spectrum and its corresponding reference illuminant. Color rendering is assessed by calculating the CIEDE 2000 color difference (ΔE 00) for 14 CIE test colors under the two sources. Optimized white-light spectra were matched to three <b>CIE</b> <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants,</b> that is, A (2856 [*]K), D 50 (5003 [*]K), and D 65 (6504 [*]K). Optimal solutions for three- and four-band 25 and 50 [*]nm Gaussian spectra are presented and analyzed, together with mixed 4 -LED spectra that were optimized in the same way.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel spectral LED-based tunable light source used for customized lighting solutions, {{especially for the}} reconstruction of CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage) standard illuminants. The light source comprises 31 spectral bands ranging from 400 to 700 nm, an integrating cube and a control board with a 16 -bit resolution. A minimization algorithm to calculate the weighting values for each channel was applied to reproduce illuminants with precision. The differences in spectral fitting and colorimetric parameters showed that the reconstructed spectra were comparable to the standard, especially for the D 65, D 50, A and E illuminants. Accurate results were also obtained for illuminants with narrow peaks such as fluorescents (F 2 and F 11) and a high-pressure sodium lamp (HP 1). In conclusion, the developed spectral LED-based light source and the minimization algorithm are able to reproduce any <b>CIE</b> <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants</b> with a high spectral and colorimetric accuracy able to advance available custom lighting systems useful in the industry and other fields such as museum lighting.

40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, it {{is often}} required that weighting tables were prepared in advance and tristimulus values can then be directly computed using summation of {{the products of the}} weights and measured reflectance values. The CIE has never provided precise procedure to calculate the weighting tables, and various discrepant methods have been used. Hence it is possible to obtain significantly different tristimulus values from the same set of spectral data. In order to overcome this problem, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM Intl.) has published two sets of weighting tables known as Table 5 and Table 6 respectively. Each set includes 36 weighting tables covering 9 illuminants and two standard colorimetric observers at two wavelength intervals (10 -nm and 20 -nm). The weighting tables of Table 5 must be used with the reflectance corrected using the Steams and Steams (SS) method, and weighting tables of Table 6 must be used with the measured reflectance values without the SS correction. In practice, the illuminant used may be different from the <b>CIE</b> <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants</b> and users have to prepare their own weighting tables corresponding to the illuminant actually used. ASTM Intl. E 2022 - 99 provided a standard calculation method to generate weighting tables of Table 5 for a non-standard illuminant. No standard procedure is given to calculate weighting tables of Table 6 since it consisted of Venable and Steams correction weights, and the Venable optimum weight is computed by an iterative procedure. In this artical, we will report some recent progress in generating weighting tables; compare the performances among the weighting tables such as ASTM Intl. Tables of Table 5 and Table 6, Optimum weighting tables, Least Square weighting tables, and Direct selection tables; quantify the possible colorimetric errors for each of the tables; and finally recommend for standardization of a method for generating weighting tables.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to camera-based systems, the human visual system’s {{perception of the}} colour of an object is largely independent of the illuminant. Several approaches to replicating the colour constancy achieved by the human visual system have been proposed [6]. However, many of these algorithms assume that scene is illuminated uniformly and shadows mean that this assumption is not always valid for outdoor scenes. The assumption that a scene is uniformly illuminated is avoided by those colour constancy algorithms that only use pixel-level information. Marchant and Onyango [7], Finlayson and Hordley [8] and Romero et al. [9] have all proposed methods for obtaining a single illuminant invariant feature from pixel data under daylight based on the assumptions that the spectral responses of the sensors are infinitely narrow and that the power spectral density of the illuminant can be approximated by the power spectral density of a blackbody illuminant. However, a single feature potentially leads to confusion between some perceptually different colours [6]. This confusion can be avoided using the method proposed by Finlayson and Drew [10] that obtains two illuminant independent features from the responses of four sensors with different spectral responses. Based on the same assumptions of infinitely narrow band sensors and the blackbody model of the illuminant, Ratnasingam and Collins [11] proposed a simple method of obtaining two illuminant independent features from the responses of four sensors. Since neither of the assumptions upon which all these methods is strictly applicable, Ratnasingam and Collins [11] also proposed a method for determining {{the quality of the}} spectral information that can be obtained from the features obtained using these methods. One important conclusion from their work was that pixel-level colour constancy algorithms extract useful information from the responses of sensors whose spectral response covers a wavelength range of 80 nm or less [11]. Subsequently, Ratnasingam et al. [12] investigated the possibility of optimising the spectral responses of the image sensors {{to improve the quality of}} the illuminant invariant features that can be obtained from daylight illuminated scenes using pixel-level colour constancy algorithms. The conclusion of this study was that the widely available International Commission on Illumination (<b>CIE)</b> <b>standard</b> <b>illuminants</b> was not representative enough to the actual daylight measurements obtained under widely varying weather conditions to be used to reliably optimise the spectral responses [12].|$|E
