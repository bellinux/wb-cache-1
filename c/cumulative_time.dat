5|$|The 2015 Vuelta a España {{included}} four principal classifications. The {{first of}} these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the rider in second, and 4 seconds for the rider in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds {{for the first three}} riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The rider with the lowest <b>cumulative</b> <b>time</b> was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey.|$|E
5|$|The race {{included}} three individual classifications {{and a team}} classification. The {{most important of these}} was the general classification. This was calculated by adding up each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Bonus seconds were awarded for top-three placings in each stage (10 seconds for the first rider, 6 seconds for the second, 4 seconds for the third) and for placings in intermediate sprints (3 seconds for the first rider, 2 seconds for the second, 1 second for the third). The rider with the lowest <b>cumulative</b> <b>time</b> after taking bonus seconds into account was the leader of the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey. (Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire.) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E
25|$|Prizes {{and bonuses}} are awarded for daily {{placings}} and final placings {{at the end}} of the race. In 2009, the winner received €450,000, while each of the 21 stage winners won €8,000 (€10,000 for the team time-trial stage). The winners of the points classification and mountains classification each win €25,000, the young rider competition and the combativity prize €20,000, and €50,000 for the winner of the team classification (calculated by adding the <b>cumulative</b> <b>times</b> of the best three riders in each team).|$|R

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is to study periodic modeling of 15 days <b>cumulative</b> rainfall <b>time</b> series. The study was undertaken using 25 years (1977 – 2001) data of Purajaya region. The series of the daily rainfall data assumed was trend free. The periodic component of 15 days <b>cumulative</b> rainfall <b>time</b> series could be represented by using 253 harmonic expressions. The stochastic component of the 15 days cumulative rainfall was using the 3 rd order autoregressive model. Validation of generated 15 days cumulative rainfall series was done by comparing between the generated with the measured rainfall series. The correlation coefficient between the generated or synthetic rainfall series with the measured rainfall series with the number of the data N is equal to 512 days for 25 years was found to be 0. 99996.

5|$|There {{was also}} a points classification. On each road stage the riders were awarded points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 places, with other points awarded for intermediate sprints.

The combativity classification was based solely on points won at the intermediate sprints; the leading rider won the green jersey. The final stage was a team classification: on each stage the times of the best three riders on each team were added up.

40|$|Diastolic blood {{pressure}} {{was viewed as a}} generic indicator of aging, and its association with <b>cumulative</b> work <b>time</b> was studied after controlling for age as a potential confounding factor.

The association between diastolic {{blood pressure}} and <b>cumulative</b> work <b>time</b> was verified by fitting a second-order linear regression model, where diastolic {{blood pressure was}} a function of worker's age and <b>cumulative</b> work <b>time.</b> By fitting the model, one can predict that, in the beginning of working life at the tannery, on average each 1 -year period is associated with an increase of about 1. 5 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure.

40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{promising}} potentials of tremendous distributed resources, {{effective and efficient}} scheduling algorithms are fundamentally important. Unfortunately, scheduling algorithms in traditional parallel and distributed systems, which usually run on homogeneous and dedicated resources, e. g. computer clusters, cannot work well in the new circumstances. In this research paper, we introduce a New Grid Job Scheduling algorithm MJ_CDT min (multiple jobs based on the minimum <b>cumulative</b> departure <b>time).</b> The MJ_CDT min {{is based on the}} rule that the <b>cumulative</b> arrival <b>time</b> of the next job arriving at the processor is compared with the minimum <b>cumulative</b> departure <b>time</b> of the processor. The main aim of proposed scheduling algorithm is to increase the system efficiency and to satisfy the job requirements from the available resources. In this research work the proposed algorithm has been implemented and validated. To demonstrate the usability of proposed techniques, a Simulation test bench was implemented using the Turbo C platform and successful simulation was achieved. The experimental results showed a significant improvement in terms of a smaller makespan time as compared to the already existing FCFS scheduling algorithm...|$|R
