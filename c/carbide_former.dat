He made his discovery while experimenting with molten iron and magnesium. The original intent was to find another element that would cause all the carbon in the cast iron alloy to be combined as carbide. Magnesium was a known <b>carbide</b> <b>former.</b> Instead, the graphite in the iron formed into spheroidal shapes, and the cast iron had high tensile strength plus it exhibited ductility.

50|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is dependent on}} slowing the speed of dislocation motion within a crystal structure. In modern Ni based superalloys, the γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) phase present acts {{as a barrier to}} dislocation motion. For this reason, this γ’ intermetallic phase, when present in high volume fractions, drastically increases the strength of these alloys due to its ordered nature and high coherency with the γ matrix. The chemical additions of aluminum and titanium promote the creation of the γ’ phase. The γ’ phase size can be precisely controlled by careful precipitation strengthening heat treatments. Many superalloys are produced using a two-phase heat treatment that creates a dispersion of cuboidal γ’ particles known as the primary phase, with a fine dispersion between these known as secondary γ’. In order to improve the oxidation resistance of these alloys, Al, Cr, B, and Y are added. The Al and Cr form oxide layers that passivate the surface and protect the superalloy from further oxidation while B and Y are used to improve the adhesion of this oxide scale to the substrate. Cr, Fe, Co, Mo and Re all preferentially partition to the γ matrix while Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, and V preferentially partition to the γ’ precipitates and solid solution strengthen the matrix and precipitates respectively. In addition to solid solution strengthening, if grain boundaries are present, certain elements are chosen for grain boundary strengthening. B and Zr tend to segregate to the grain boundaries which reduces the grain boundary energy and results in better grain boundary cohesion and ductility. Another form of grain boundary strengthening is achieved through the addition of C and a <b>carbide</b> <b>former,</b> such as Cr, Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Ti, or Hf, which drives precipitation of carbides at grain boundaries and thereby reduces grain boundary sliding.|$|E

This paper presents an overview of the modification of alloying elements in tool steel for high thermal conductivity properties by transition metal elements addition.

The target detection rate was set to 5 ions per 1000 pulses. Based on a statistical analyses of the data obtained from the volume of 59 × 59 × 33 nm 3, homogeneous {{distributions of}} alloying elements in nano-scales were concluded.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the magnesium content on the mechanosynthesis of ZrB 2 –SiC–ZrC composite in the Mg/ZrSiO 4 /B 2 O 3 /C mixture was investigated. Thermodynamic evaluations revealed {{that the amount of}} Mg played a main role and, as a consequence, the overall reaction enthalpy and adiabatic temperature (Tad) changed by the variation of the magnesium content. According to the differential thermal analysis (DTA) results, after 45 min of milling, the temperature of the combustion reaction decreased to 576 ◦C and all the reactions occurred simultaneously. The experimental findings indicated that the type of reactions in the mixture powder with stoichiometric ratio (7 mol Mg) was mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR). When the Mg content was within the range of 6 - 7 mol, the magnesiothermic reduction occurred in the MSR mode and the carbothermal reaction was activated; hence, the carbon acted not only as a <b>carbide</b> <b>former</b> agent but also as a reductant. The MSR mode magnesiothermic reduction and gradual carbothermal reduction occurred when the Mg value was 11 / 2 - 6 mol. At lower Mg contents in the mixture (5 mol), the reduction reaction proceeded through a gradual mode and no carbothermal reaction occurred. Keywords: Mechanochemical processin...|$|E

Such a material can theoretically exhibit a yield strength/density ratio around 500 compared to ~ 200 for Ti 6 Al 4 V and ~ 125 for Al 2024 -T 6. This composite {{is thought to be}} especially promising for aeronautics if interaction between fibres and magnesium can be controlled and optimized. The strategy studied to enhance interaction between matrix and fibres consists in covering a thin layer of <b>carbide</b> <b>former</b> metal (Zr, Ti) by PVD as a primary treatment of carbon weaves. This intermediate product can then be heated up between 300 - 700 °C in an argon atmosphere in order to form stable carbides. The wetability of treated weaves by liquid magnesium is potentially higher because carbides are not fully covalent (partially metallic) and so they can have more interface interaction with liquid metals. Further crystal lattice parameters of particular carbides can be close to the ones of metal crystal lattices and interface energy can consequently be reduced when they form carbide-metal bonds. Furthermore magnesium is known for its high oxygen attraction and is able to reduce a lot metallic oxides. It is a key fact because liquid magnesium easy wets its oxide in certain conditions...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{properties in}} die material {{are very important}} in hot press forming (HPF) processes. High composition of thermal conductivity in die material can contribute to high cooling rate, which is indirectly can produce fully martensitic in microstructure that would change the blank properties into high hardness and strength, up to 1500 MPa. Powder metallurgy method {{has been used to}} produce high conductive steel with homogenous carbide distribution with less segregation and porosity. Thus, die defect such as thermal fatigue can be reduced and help to extend the die’s life. There are other methods that are being used to produce new die materials properties, like cast alloy with new composition, direct metal deposited (DMD), selective laser melting (SLM), direct metal laser sintering (DMLT) and spray forming. Among of the factors that contribute to increase the thermal conductivity in steel is the composition of metal in that steel itself. Elements like manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) and chromium (Cr) can increase the thermal conductivity by producing carbide network. The carbide network can increase the thermal conductivity among the microstructure in the steel. Thermochemical software was used to simulate and model phase diagram and thermodynamic properties for new materials.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{nanocomposite}} materials {{for use in}} high performance electrical contacts are tested. Self mating silver as coatings on cupper substrates are the most used material combination in power connectors today. In this work two new concepts were tested. The first one was to change one of the mating surfaces to a hard thin coating and keep the other surface made of silver. Tested coatings were nanocomposites with hard carbides in a matrix of amorphous carbon. TiC/a-C and  Ti-Ni-C/a-C were tested both electrically and tribologically. The total amount of carbon {{and the amount of}} carbon matrix was important, both for the electrical and the tribological properties. The Ti-Ni-C coating also showed that substituting Ti in TiC with the weak <b>carbide</b> <b>former</b> Ni changed the stability of the carbides. The substitution resulted in more a-C matrix and less C in the carbides. Thin coatings of nc-TiC/a-C and  Ti-Ni-C/a-C showed high potential as material candidates for use in electrical contacts. The other tested concept was to modify the used silver instead of replacing it. This was done by embedding nanoparticles of solid lubricant IF-WS 2 in the silver. The results from reciprocating sliding displayed low friction and high wear resistance. The modified silver surfaces lasted for 8000 strokes with a friction of about 0. 3 {{while at the same time}} allowing for a low contact resistance. The results for surfaces of pure silver coating displayed a friction of 0. 8 - 1. 2 and that the silver was worn through already after 300 strokes. A new method to investigate inherent hardness and residual stress of thin coatings, on complex geometries or in small areas, was also developed.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are known to}} combine interesting properties of different materials. This research concerns magnesium alloys reinforced by carbon fibre weaves. Such a material can theoretically exhibit a high yield strength/density ratio. This composite {{is thought to be}} especially promising for aeronautics. A pre-treatment of carbon weaves ensure two fundamental functions. The first is to provide stiffness and cohesion. It helps keeping fibres aligned and well placed in the mould during casting to ensure optimal properties of the final part in the main load directions. This is imperative when the composite is formed with thixomolding for which semi liquid metal is injected with a very high speed. Nevertheless the problem of geometrical carbon weaves stability is also encountered with squeeze casting. The second objective of the pre-treatment is to provide a porous network in the weaves to enhance infiltration by the capillary action. The two functions can be assumed by coating fibres with Al(H 2 PO 4) 3, SiO 2 combined with starch, or some other oxide containing mixtures. The general process is to assemble carbon weaves, infiltrate them in an aqueous solution or dispersion of oxides and lastly heat them at high temperature to promote covalent bonds with fibres and vaporize or crack carbonaceous agents to let a porous medium. Further the chemical interaction between the coated fibres and the liquid metal during infiltration can influence the species which are present at the interfaces. As magnesium oxide is stable magnesium can react with oxides. This could lead to better wettability of treated weave. However such chemical reactions seem to be thermally activated and take many seconds to initiate, whereas solidification of magnesium is achieved faster. Furthermore the addition of some <b>carbide</b> <b>former</b> elements (Si, Ti, Zr) to a magnesium based alloy can also influence chemical affinity. In conclusion CMg-MMC research concerns composites with low density, high potential mechanical properties and possibility of processing through thixomolding. Firstly the reach of the theoretical performance of the composite includes the ability of dealing with the interaction between fibres and liquid metal. Secondly primary treatment could help to form bonds between matrix and fibres, make rigid weaves and promote a further infiltration. Thirdly chemical affinity between the fibres, magnesium alloy and coating can influence the infiltration. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Rail steels rely {{primarily}} on possessing adequate wear and rolling contact fatigue resistance. These properties, {{together with the}} toughness, can in principle be optimized by implementing thermomechanical processing assisted by controlled niobium additions. The {{purpose of the current}} work is to develop a Nb-microalloying strategy in the context of high-carbon pearlitic and cementite-free bainitic steels. The conventional methods do not leave the critical regions of a rail section in a suitably processed state. An attempt has been made for the first time, to create a pancaked austenite grain structure, with an examination of the consequences on the final product. One of the major difficulties is to ensure that niobium does not segregate during manufacturing, since niobium is a strong <b>carbide</b> <b>former</b> and rail steels traditionally contain large carbon concentrations. Niobium solubility in austenite has been assessed critically and thermodynamic calculations for microsegregation have been taken into account. The aim is to ensure that any primary niobium carbide precipitated from solute-enriched liquid during non-equilibrium solidification, can be taken into solution in austenite during reheating, to mitigate potential effects of coarse precipitates on the final mechanical properties. Rail steels containing 0. 01 - 0. 02 wt% Nb have been designed and characterised. In as-cast condition, primary niobium carbides as large as ~ 10 µm can be observed, which dissolve slowly during reheating. An attempt has been made to develop a model to estimate the dissolution kinetics of the carbides. Dissolved niobium in reheated austenite precipitates during hot deformation as fine niobium carbides (< 50 nm) which inhibit austenite recrystallisation by pinning the austenite grain boundaries. Nb-microalloying increases the ‘no-recrystallisation temperature’ of deformed austenite during multi-pass compression tests. The topology of grain deformation has been analysed in terms of stereological calculations and dilatometric experiments have shown that transformation kinetics tend to accelerate when the austenite is deformed below the no-recrystallisation temperature, however the effect is relatively small. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-rolled Nb-microalloyed steels have been characterised along with their rolling-sliding wear performance and compared with their non-microalloyed counterparts. Increased austenite grain boundary area and increased dislocation activity due to pancaking, hinder bainite growth which leads to an increased retained austenite volume fraction. This in turn, leads to slightly improved ductility, improved toughness and improved wear resistance in Nb-microalloyed bainitic alloys. Microstructural refinement in Nbmicroalloyed pearlitic alloys does not have any significant effect on tensile and toughness properties, but wear resistance improves significantly. A Bayesian neural network model has been developed to estimate the wear of rails. Predicted trends have been found consistent with metallurgical experience and the perceived noise levels are consistent with reasonable repeatability of the wear testing method used. The model can be applied widely to estimate wear because of its capacity to indicate uncertainty, including both the perceived level of noise in the output, and an uncertainty associated with fitting the function in the local region of input space...|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of wheel skids, the cooling rate is usually high due to the {{quenching}} of the surrounding cold metal. If the temperature is high enough to cause re-austenitisation, martensite will result. The kinetics of microstructural degradation due to martensite formation are therefore determined by the kinetics of re-austenitisation during which the cementite lamellae within the pearlite are fully or partially taken into solution. The kinetics of this process {{are influenced by the}} time–temperature history during the skid event, composition and the condition of the pre-existing microstructure. For example, at elevated temperatures, the presence of <b>carbide</b> <b>formers</b> such as chromium will retard carbide dissolution [14], while carbide dissolution occurs at a greater rate in pearlitic microstructures that have sustained plastic deformation as a result of normal service conditions [2]. This is further complicated by the severe local plastic deformation, which itself can cause the dissolution of cementite [15, 16, 17, 18]. As a result, the plastically deformed wheel surface layer may already be super-saturated with carbon during service. This layer will readily transform to martensite under a severe thermal loading event.|$|R

An induction time prior to the onset of significant diamond nucleation was observed on the refractory metals as well as on silicon and may be reliant upon the formation of a critical carbide thickness. Shorter induction times were observed for silicon which may be explained since this material forms a carbide of typically only several nanometers in thickness as opposed to the refractory metals which may form carbides on the order of several microns in thickness. Also, a strong correlation was observed between the carbide heat of formation and the nucleation densities at 60 min of BEN.

Austenitic iron-base alloys, containing 25 wt % or less nickel and tested at 800 {deg}C for up to 4000 hr, showed little or no evidence of carbon transfer from stoichiometric or hyperstoichiometric (U{sub 0. 8 }Pu{sub 0. 2 }) C that contained up to 20 vol % (U,Pu) {sub 2 }C{sub 3 }. Three austenitic alloys containing more than 30 wt % nickel reacted with stoichiometric and hyperstoichiometric (U{sub 0. 8 }Pu{sub 0. 2 }) C to form intermetallic compounds at the fuel-cladding interface and precipitates in the cladding at 700 and 800 {deg}C. Vanadium-base alloys containing 15 - 20 wt % titanium were carburized by (U{sub 0. 8 }Pu{sub 0. 2 }) C and reduced (U,Pu) P{sub 2 }C{sub 3 } to (U,Pu) C at 800 {deg}C.

40|$|Diamond grits held {{in metal}} matrix (sintered or electroplated) are {{retained}} primary by mechanical locking. Because of this weak attachment, the pullouts of diamond from matrix are inevitable during the cutting process. Moreover, the working grits have low protrusion heights, so the cutting {{speed of the}} tool is limited. Furthermore, the rubbing of metal matrix and the work object can cause thermal damages of diamond and other materials, and power increase for the operation. Diamond can be firmly held in a metal matrix by brazing. Because {{of the presence of}} strong chemical bonding, diamond grits can protrude twice as high without being knocked off from the matrix. As a result, the cutting speed of the tool may be doubled. When thebraze melts, the <b>carbide</b> <b>formers</b> will migrate toward diamond to form carbide at the interface. This reaction may be excessive as to degrade diamond significantly. In this case, a coating on diamond may be needed to moderate the reaction. When diamond is brazed on the surface of a substrate, the melt tends to pull the grits closer together that may thicken the braze layer locally. The clustering of grits can reduce the cutting effectivenessof the diamond tool. A diamond grid design isnecessary to maintain the uniform thickness of the braze layer. Moreover, the controlled melting of braze alloy can form a gentle slope around each diamond grit. Such a massive support can allow aggressivecutting of the diamond tool with a low power consumption...|$|R
30|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels {{are widely used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications such as steam generating plants (as piping and superheating tube materials), chemical reactors, and nuclear plants due to their excellent corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties, and good weldability at elevated temperatures. Austenitic {{stainless steels}} possess excellent resistance to general corrosion; however, when they are subjected to a treatment like welding in the temperature range between 500 °C and 800 °C, they suffer from corrosion in forms of intergranular corrosion and intergranular stress corrosion cracking. This is generally attributed to sensitization as a result of chromium depletion which in turn is due to the chromium carbide precipitation in the grain boundaries[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Sensitization as a serious and momentous problem during welding of stainless steel has not been completely prevented by conventional techniques such as reduction of carbon content (below 0.03 wt.%), addition of strong <b>carbide</b> <b>formers</b> (such as titanium, niobium or zirconium), and solution heat treatment. Although these methods have met with various degrees of success, they have increased the cost of the materials without producing sensitization-free materials[6, 7]. Recent investigations have revealed that the degree of sensitization (DOS) of austenitic stainless steels depends strongly on the grain size and nature of the grain boundary. Moreover, studies about the grain boundary design and control have shown that materials characterized by a high frequency of low-energy grain boundaries such as coincidence site lattice boundaries are strongly resistant to intergranular precipitation and corrosion[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. It has also been reported that the DOS is inversely related to the grain size and shows a nearly exponential decrease with increasing grain boundary surface area (decreasing grain size)[5]. Surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) is a new and potentially effective method to produce nanostructured surface layers in bulk materials. Investigations indicate that the grain refinement via SMAT process can cause the formation of twins in the materials with low-stacking fault energy, for example, in 304 stainless steel[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. So, in this paper an attempt was made to evaluate the effect of nano grains and twins formation in the 304 stainless steel (by using SMAT) on the prevention of weld-decay.|$|R
40|$|Unique {{electrical}} and mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) {{have made them}} {{one of the most}} promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics. Efficient utilization of the exceptional properties of SWNTs requires controlling their growth direction (e. g., vertical, horizontal) and morphologies (e. g., straight, junction, coiled). ^ In this dissertation, the catalytic effect on the branching of SWNTs, Y-shaped SWNTs (Y-SWNTs), was investigated. The formation of Y-shaped branches was found to be dependent on the composition of the catalysts. Easier <b>carbide</b> <b>formers</b> have a strong tendency to attach to the sidewall of SWNTs and thus enhance the degree of branching. Y-SWNTs based field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated and modulated by the metallic branch of the Y-SWNTs, exhibiting ambipolar characteristics at room temperature. A subthreshold swing of 700 mV/decade and an on/off ratio of 105 with a low off-state current of 10 - 13 A were obtained. The transport phenomena associated with Y- and cross-junction configurations reveals that the conduction mechanism in the SWNT junctions is governed by thermionic emission at T 3 ̆e 100 K and by tunneling at T 3 ̆c 100 K. ^ Furthermore, horizontally aligned SWNTs were synthesized by the controlled modification of external fields and forces. High performance carbon nanotube FETs and logic circuit were demonstrated utilizing the aligned SWNTs. It is found that the hysteresis in CNTFETs can be eliminated by removing absorbed water molecules on the CNT/SiO 2 interface by vacuum annealing, hydrophobic surface treatment, and surface passivation. SWNT “serpentines” were synthesized by utilization of the interaction between drag force from gas flow and Van der Waals force with substrates. The curvature of bent SWNTs could be tailored by adjusting the gas flow rate, and changing the gas flow direction with respect to the step-edges on a single-crystal quartz substrate. Resistivity of bent SWNTs was observed to increase with curvature, which can be attributed to local deformations and possible chirality shift at curved part. ^ Our results show the successful synthesis of SWNTs having controllable morphologies and directionality. The capability of tailoring the electrical properties of SWNTs makes it possible to build an all-nanotube device by integrating SWNTs, having different functionalities, into complex circuits. ...|$|R
40|$|Low carbon {{bainitic}} steels microalloyed with Nb, Ti and V {{are widely}} used for the pipeline, construction and automobile industries because of their excellent combination of strength, toughness and weldability. Boron as another major alloying element has been also frequently used {{in this type of}} steels since the 1970 s. The purpose of adding boron is to improve the hardenability of the steel by promoting bainite formation. It has been realized that Boron can only be effective as a strengthening element when it is prevented from forming BN and/or Fe 23 (C, B) 6 precipitates. Therefore, Boron is always added together with other alloying elements which are stronger Nitride or <b>Carbide</b> <b>formers,</b> such as Ti and Nb. However, the formation of complex bainitic structures and the interaction with precipitates at industrial coiling temperature are not adequately understood. In this study, the effect of boron on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a low carbon Nb-B steel was studied by a hot compression test (50 % reduction at 850 °C) followed by quenching samples into a salt bath. The microstructures of the tested samples were examined through optical microscopy and SEM; and the mechanical properties of these samples were investigated by micro-hardness and shear punch tests. The results indicate that during thermo-mechanical controlled rolling (TCR), the final properties of the products not only depend on the applied deformation but also depend on the coiling temperature where phase transformation takes place. According to the investigation, two strengthening mechanisms are responsible for the strength of the steel at the coiling temperature: phase transformation and precipitation. Under optical microscopy, the microstructures of all specimens appear to be bainite in a temperature range from 350 °C to 600 °C without distinct differences. However, the SEM micrographs revealed that the microstructures at 550 °C are very different from the microstructures transformed at the other holding temperatures. Two strength peaks were observed at 350 °C and 550 °C in the temperature range studied. It is believed that the NbC precipitates are the main contributor to the peak strength observed at 550 °C because the kinetics of NbC is quite rapid at this temperature. The strength peak at 350 °C is mainly due to the harder bainitic phase, which formed at relatively lower temperature...|$|R
