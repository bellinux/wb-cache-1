40|$|X-ray {{undulator}} beamlines at third-generation synchrotrons facilities {{use either}} a monochromator or a mirror {{as the first}} optical element. In this paper, the thermal and optical performance of an optimally designed <b>contact-cooled</b> high-heat-load x-ray mirror used as the first optical element on the 2 ID undulator beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) is reported. It is shown that this simple and economical mirror design can comfortably handle the high heat load of undulator beamlines and provide good performance with long-term reliability and ease of operation. Availability and advantages of such mirrors can make the mirror-first approach to high-heat-load beamline design an attractive alternative to monochromator-first beamlines in many circumstances...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, several third-generation synchrotrons x-ray sources have been {{constructed}} and commissioned around the world. Many of the major problems {{in the development and}} design of the optical components capable of handling the extremely high heat loads of the generated x-ray beams have been resolved. It is expected, however, that {{in the next few years}} even more powerful x-ray beams will be produced at these facilities, for example, by increasing the particle beam current. In this paper, the design of a next generation of synchrotron x-ray mirrors is discussed. The author shows that the design of <b>contact-cooled</b> mirrors capable of handing x-ray beam heat fluxes in excess of 500 W/mm{sup 2 } - or more than three times the present level - is well within reach, and the limiting factor is the thermal stress rather then thermally induced slope error...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, expected performance, and preliminary test {{results of a}} <b>contact-cooled</b> monochromator for use on high heat load x-ray beamlines. The monochromator has a cross section {{in the shape of}} the letter U. This monochromator should be suitable for handing heat fluxes up to 5 W/square millimeter. As such, for the present application, it is compatible with the best internally cooled crystal monochromators. There are three key features in the design of this monochromator. First, it is contact cooled, thereby eliminating fabrication of cooling channels, bonding, and undesirable strains in the monochromator due to coolant-manifold-to-crystal-interface. Second, by illuminating the entire length of the crystal and extracting the central part of the reflected beam, sharp slope changes in the beam profile and thus slope errors are avoided. Last, by appropriate cooling of the crystal, tangential slope error can be substantially reduced...|$|E
40|$|At the Advanced Photon Source (APS), {{undulator}} insertion {{devices are}} capable of producing x-ray beams with total power of about 5 kW and normal incidence heat fluxes of about 170 W/mm{sup 2 } at 30 m from the source. On beamlines in which the first optical element is a mirror, the reflected beam from the mirror still carries considerable power and power density. Depending on its location, the monochromator downstream of the mirror might be subject to 300 W total power and 5 W/mm{sup 2 } normal incidence heat flux. Thus, it is still necessary to carefully design a monochromator that provides acceptable performance under these heat loads. A <b>contact-cooled</b> u-shaped monochromator {{may be used in}} this case. The main feature of the u-shaped monochromator is that, by carefully selecting the geometry and cooling locations, is passively corrects for some of the thermally induced crystal distortions. We present experimental and computational results of a contact cooled u-shaped monochromator tested on an APS undulator beamline. The results are encouraging and compare favorably with liquid-gallium internally cooled crystals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} of second-generation high-temperature superconductors (HTS) made from YBCO coated conductors in accelerator magnet technology was demonstrated by a consortium under {{the lead of}} Danfysik. A 3 T demonstrator dipole magnet was designed, built and tested by the consortium. In total 2. 5 km HTS tape was manufactured and tested by SuperPower. The tape was delivered in spool lengths 0 varying from 93 m to 172 m and had a minimum Ic of 115 A or more. The tape was insulated with a 0. 025 mm thin epoxy film before winding in total 14 saddle coils and 4 racetrack coils and subsequent impregnation with epoxy. All coils were azimuthally arranged in an ellipse configuration {{in order to achieve}} a cosine-theta-like current distribution around a circular good field with a diameter of 52 mm and a magnetic field length of 250 mm. The cold-mass consisting of the coil arrangement clamped in between a steel substrate and an aluminum collar and a surrounding laminated iron yoke, was mounted in a cryostat. The cold-mass is <b>contact-cooled</b> by two GM cryocooler...|$|E

The present work details the thermal and structural analyses and parameterization of the water-cooled, U, O, and H-shaped monochromators used to achieve narrow energy band photon beams from synchrotron radiation sources. Physical dimensions and cooling placement on the monochromators were parameterized and thermal deformation correlations were made for each design parameter. Stress and deformation for the parameterized model were analyzed to understand the thermal and physical consequence of each parameter change. The goals of the work were to achieve an understanding of <b>contact-cooled</b> monochromator deformation and slope error in order to achieve monochromator designs which would reduce slope error to an acceptable level under a variety of photon beam sizes and heat fluxes. Criteria for when a fully illuminated vs. partially illuminated monochromator should be selected are given with respect to beam size and heat flux. Results show there is not an optimal design which works for all beam fluxes and types; however, it is possible to tailor the monochromator design for a particular range of beam sizes, and guidelines for monochromator design, customization, and adjustment are explained throughout the report...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} thermal contact {{resistance}} across metallic interfaces {{has been investigated}} for many situations {{over the past several}} decades. The application in the present case is contact cooling of high heat load optical substrates. High heat load x-ray mirrors and other optical components used at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) are either internally cooled or contact cooled. In the internally cooled mirrors, a coolant flows through passages configured in the optical substrate. In the <b>contact-cooled</b> case, cooling is provided by placing cooling plates in contact with the mirror to extract the heat. Here, an experimental setup to measure the thermal contact conductance across a silicon-copper (Si-Cu) interface is described, and the results obtained are presented. The resulting thermal contact resistance data are used in estimating the thermo-mechanical and optical performance of optical substrates cooled by interfaced copper cooling blocks. Several factors influence the heat transfer across solid interfaces. These include the material properties, interface pressure, flatness and roughness of the contacting surfaces, temperature, and interstitial material, if any. Results presented show the variation of thermal contact conductance as a function of applied interface pressure for a Cu-Si interface. Various interstitial materials investigated include indium foil, silver foil and a liquid eutectic (Ga-In-Sn). As expected, thermal contact resistance decreases as interface pressure increases, except {{in the case of the}} eutectic, in which it was nearly constant. The softer the interstitial material, the lower the thermal contact resistance. Liquid metal provides the lowest thermal contact resistance across the Cu-Si interface, followed by the indium foil, and then the silver foil...|$|E
