5|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} of smallpox. However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug <b>cidofovir</b> might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cidofovir</b> {{has limited}} data and is highly nephrotoxic.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{therapeutic}} {{options include}} Leflunomide, <b>Cidofovir,</b> IVIG, and the fluoroquinolones. [...] Leflunomide, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor is now generally accepted {{as the second}} treatment option behind reduction of immunosuppression.|$|E
2500|$|Antibiotics are {{commonly}} used to prevent secondary bacterial infection. [...] There are no specific antiviral drugs in common use at this time for FVR, although one study has shown that ganciclovir, PMEDAP, and <b>cidofovir</b> hold promise for treatment. More recent {{research has indicated that}} systemic famciclovir is effective at treating this infection in cats without the side effects reported with other anti-viral agents. [...] More severe cases may require supportive care such as intravenous fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, or even a feeding tube. [...] Conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers are treated with topical antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cidofovir</b> is only {{available}} as an intravenous formulation. <b>Cidofovir</b> {{is to be}} administered with probenecid which decreases side effects to the kidney. Probenecid mitigate nephrotoxicity by inhibiting organic anion transport of the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney. In addition, hydration must be administered to patients receiving <b>cidofovir.</b> 1 liter of normal saline is recommended in conjunction with each dose of <b>cidofovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its only {{indication}} {{that has received}} regulatory approval worldwide is cytomegalovirus retinitis. <b>Cidofovir</b> has also shown efficacy {{in the treatment of}} aciclovir-resistant HSV infections. <b>Cidofovir</b> has also been investigated as a treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with successful case reports of its use. Despite this, the drug failed to demonstrate any efficacy in controlled studies. <b>Cidofovir</b> might have anti-smallpox efficacy and might be used on a limited basis {{in the event of a}} bioterror incident involving smallpox cases. Brincidofovir, a <b>cidofovir</b> derivative with much higher activity against smallpox that can be taken orally has been developed. It has inhibitory effects on varicella-zoster virus replication in vitro although no clinical trials have been done to date, likely due to the abundance of safer alternatives such as aciclovir. <b>Cidofovir</b> shows anti-BK virus activity in a subgroup of transplant recipients. <b>Cidofovir</b> is being investigated as a complementary intralesional therapy against papillomatosis caused by HPV.|$|E
5000|$|Brincidofovir (CMX001) is an {{experimental}} antiviral drug {{being developed by}} Chimerix of Durham, NC, {{for the treatment of}} cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, smallpox, and ebolavirus infections. Brincidofovir is a prodrug of <b>cidofovir.</b> [...] Conjugated to a lipid, the compound is designed to release <b>cidofovir</b> intracellularly, allowing for higher intracellular and lower plasma concentrations of <b>cidofovir,</b> effectively increasing its activity against dsDNA viruses, as well as oral bioavailability.|$|E

50|$|In June 1996, Gilead {{launched}} Vistide (<b>cidofovir</b> injection) for {{the treatment}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cidofovir</b> was {{discovered}} at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Prague, by Antonín Holý, and developed by Gilead Sciences and is marketed with {{the brand name}} Vistide by Gilead in the USA, and by Pfizer elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{uncommon}} {{side effects}} include: anaemia and elevated liver enzymes and rare side effects include: tachycardia and Fanconi syndrome. Probenecid (a uricosuric drug) and intravenous saline {{should always be}} administered with each <b>cidofovir</b> infusion to prevent this nephrotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Its active metabolite, <b>cidofovir</b> diphosphate, {{inhibits}} {{viral replication}} by selectively inhibiting viral DNA polymerases. It also inhibits human polymerases but this action is 8-600 times weaker than its actions on viral DNA polymerases. It also incorporates itself into viral DNA hence inhibiting viral DNA synthesis during reproduction.|$|E
50|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} of smallpox. However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug <b>cidofovir</b> might be useful as a therapeutic agent.

50|$|There are no {{pharmaceuticals}} approved {{specifically for}} treating HHV-6 infection, although {{the usage of}} Cytomegalovirus treatments (valganciclovir, ganciclovir, <b>cidofovir,</b> and foscarnet) have shown some success. These drugs are given {{with the intent of}} inhibiting proper DNA polymerization by competing with deoxy triphosphate nucleotides or specifically inactivating viral DNA polymerases.|$|E
50|$|Topical steroids {{should be}} avoided because they prolong viral replication, {{frequently}} lead to long-lasting dry eye symptoms, and corneal opacities almost always recur after discontinuation of topical steroids. There is currently no effective and clinically applicable topical antiviral agent {{for the treatment of}} the acute phase of AKC. Topical <b>cidofovir</b> is the first antiviral agent which has effectively reduced the incidence of corneal opacities, but local toxicity rules out its clinical application. Recently, NMSO3, a sulfated sialyl lipid, has demonstrated a greater antiviral potency against adenovirus in vitro than <b>cidofovir</b> exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. Topical cyclosporin A (CsA) appears to be effective in the treatment of persistent corneal opacities. Topical interferon might be effective as a prophylaxis of infection. Topical interferon is currently not commercially available due to unsettled patent issues.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleoside analogs are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that work by inhibiting viral nucleic acid synthesis. The nucleoside analogs acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), trifluridine, <b>cidofovir,</b> adefovir, and tenofovir (TDF) [...] are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. This may result in the buildup of these drugs in the proximal tubule cells. At high concentrations, these drugs inhibit DNA replication. This, in turn, may impair the function of these cells and may {{be the cause of}} antiviral induced Fanconi syndrome. The use of stavudine, didenosine, abacavir, adefovir, <b>cidofovir</b> [...] and tenofovir has been associated with Fanconi syndrome. Clinical features of tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome include glycosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose levels, phosphate wasting with hypophosphatemia, proteinuria (usually mild), acidosis, and hypokalemia, with or without acute renal failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{treatment}} of cytomegalovirus retinitis, oral valganciclovir, intravenous ganciclovir, IV foscarnet, and IV <b>cidofovir</b> are all efficient {{in the treatment of}} this condition. Also intravitreal injections,an injection of medicine into the vitreous near the retina, of foscarnet in concomitance with oral valganciclovir can be used for treatment as well.|$|E
50|$|Eczema vaccinatum is {{a serious}} medical {{condition}} that requires immediate and intensive medical care. Therapy has been supportive, such as antibiotics, fluid replacement, antipyretics and analgesics, skin healing, etc.; vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) could be very useful but supplies may be deficient as of 2006. Antiviral drugs have been examined for activity in pox viruses and <b>cidofovir</b> is believed to display potential in this area.|$|E
50|$|Drugs that {{inhibit the}} MRP2 {{transporter}} {{can cause a}} buildup of organic anions inside renal proximal tubule cells. If some of these organic anions inhibit mitochondrial DNA synthesis, it may cause iatrogenic Fanconi syndrome. The nucleoside phosphonate adefovir is a MRP2 inhibitor that {{has been linked to}} kidney disease. Tenofovir and <b>cidofovir</b> are also nucleoside phosphonates that inhibit MRP2 and have been associated with Fanconi syndrome.|$|E
50|$|While orf {{is usually}} a benign {{self-limiting}} illness, {{it can be very}} progressive and even life-threatening in the immune-compromised host. One percent topical <b>cidofovir</b> has been successfully used in a few patients with progressive disease. Serious damage may be inflicted on the eye if it is infected by orf, even among healthy individuals. The virus can survive in the soil for at least six months.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} too few cases of TS {{reported}} for a standard treatment to be established. In some cases, improvement in immune function has been noted to produce spontaneous improvement in TS symptoms. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} behavior of other viral diseases found in immunocompromised patients, most relevantly with the nephropathy associated in kidney transplant recipients with the polyomavirus BK virus. Antiviral drugs such as valganciclovir and <b>cidofovir</b> have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports.|$|E
