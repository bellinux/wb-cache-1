However, these duties would expand to include more traditionally male jobs such as driving trucks and ambulances, and working as mechanics and radar operators. While most CWACs served in Canada, three companies of female soldiers were posted overseas in 1943.|$|R
2500|$|In 1950, Goldsmith {{found work}} at CBS as a <b>clerk</b> <b>typist</b> in the network's music {{department}} under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as CBS Radio Workshop, Frontier Gentleman, and Romance. [...] In {{an interview with}} Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated, [...] "It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. But {{you had to be}} an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew someone there who said I'd be great for this. I'd just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. Then I could do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, and gave me a job." [...] He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as Climax! and Playhouse 90. [...] He also scored multiple episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to MGM Studios for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live television and would later compose music for such television shows as Dr. Kildare and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..|$|E

50|$|The Service {{recruited}} {{women between}} the ages of 18 and 45 and it was initially envisaged they would serve in a variety of roles including <b>clerks,</b> <b>typists,</b> cooks and drivers. During the war a total of 24,026 women enlisted (with a maximum strength of 20,051 in January 1944). The AWAS had 71 barracks around the country. They were paid wages equal to two-thirds that of their male equivalents.|$|R
50|$|Large open office environments {{have existed}} {{for a long}} time. However, these {{frequently}} consisted of many identical rows of desks or long tables where <b>clerks,</b> <b>typists,</b> or engineers performed repetitive functions. This layout was rooted {{in the work of}} industrial engineers and efficiency experts such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford. The office landscape approach to space planning was pioneered by the Quickborner Team led by Eberhard and Wolfgang Schnelle based in the Hamburg suburb of Quickborn. It was intended to provide a more collaborative and humane work environment.|$|R

Initially, most WAACs and WACs worked as file <b>clerks,</b> <b>typists,</b> stenographers, or motor pool drivers.

50|$|Prior to the 1950s open-plan offices mostly {{consisted}} of large regular rows of desks or benches where <b>clerks,</b> <b>typists,</b> or technicians performed repetitive tasks. Such designs were {{rooted in the}} work of industrial engineers or efficiency experts such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford. In the 1950s a German team named Quickborner developed the office landscape, which used conventional furniture, curved screens, large potted plants, and organic geometry to create work groups on large, open floors. Office landscape was quickly supplanted by office-furniture companies which developed cubicles based on panel-hung or systems furniture. Many terms (mostly derisive) have been used over time for offices using the old-style, large arrays of open cubicles.|$|R

In the months following the Allied victory, hundreds more CWACs served in Europe working on the complex task of repatriating the army to Canada. Others served with Canadian occupation forces in Germany. In all, approximately 3000 served Canada overseas. While no members of the CWAC were killed due to enemy action, four were wounded in a German V-2 missile attack on Antwerp in 1945.|$|R
50|$|Attention to Hall's Special Forces claims arose due to {{a profile}} written in 2008 by NBC Sports writer Mike Chiappetta.

The FOIA report clearly stated Hall did not serve in the U.S. Army Special Forces, nor did he ever deploy to Vietnam as he had claimed for years.

2500|$|The AAF {{showed no}} {{reluctance}} in opening up its noncombat jobs to women, even jobs which required [...] "unwomanly" [...] mechanical skills. Toward {{the end of}} the war there was an increase in the number of women on technical assignments, when it became difficult to obtain enlisted men in the top intelligence brackets required by some of the work. At the peak of WAC enrollment, in January 1945, more than 200 different job categories were filled by enlisted women, while WAC officers held more than 60 different types of jobs in addition to that of company officer. A flexible system of assignment enabled the AAF to use Wacs with special skills found in only a very few women, like those who were skilled as chemists, cartographers, geodetic computers, topographers, sanitary inspectors, and even dog-trainers. [...] But as might be expected, a high percentage—about 50 percent—of the Air Wacs held administrative or office jobs. These <b>clerks,</b> <b>typists,</b> and stenographers were doing only what they had been doing in civilian life.|$|R
