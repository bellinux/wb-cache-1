25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he dies.|$|E
500|$|In Harper's office, Michael confronts {{her about}} her {{involvement}} in his accident, pulling out his gun to shoot her. However, he instead lets Bird and another detective arrest her. Later, Dr. Evans applauds Michael's apparent rejection of the [...] "red reality" [...] and, when Michael suggests his fantastic experiences may have simply been a dream of the [...] "red reality," [...] Dr. Evans warns him not to create a third reality. She suddenly goes still. Michael, confused, goes through her office door and finds himself in his bedroom. He goes downstairs and finds both his son, Rex (Dylan Minnette), and wife alive. Concerned about Michael's odd behavior, Hannah asks if he is okay. He replies, [...] "I'm perfect," [...] and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{on a school}} bus with {{children}} playing and throwing things, and features a young boy who then selects the track [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] on his iPod and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He then dreams about a school concert for a band called [...] "Littlefinger", a parody of the band {{for which he is}} the lead singer [...] "Bernie", a parody of Bernard Fanning. The band and audience are composed of primary school students. Children are seen offering a chocolate milk called smilo, a take on Milo, and a camera crew for [...] "Channel [...] " [...] and reporter [...] "Su-Mi". This is a parody of Yumi Stynes, a presenter from Australian music station Channel V. The end of the clip shows that it was a dream being had by the student who played the lead singer for [...] "Littlefinger".|$|E
25|$|He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as <b>his</b> world went dim.|$|R
60|$|The man settled himself comfortably again, and <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Adrian, {{overcome}} by the fearful crash, <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and sighed.|$|R
500|$|Details {{surrounding}} the accident are slowly revealed as the series progresses. Shortly after the crash, Michael's commanding officers (Tricia Harper and Carl Kessel) meet {{to talk about}} the accident and how they set up a [...] "short" [...] guy. Later a microphone at Ricky's Tacos speaks to Michael, claiming that if he moved to Portland he would [...] "never know the truth". Michael slowly begins to remember what happened in the accident; after realizing that Ed caused it, he speaks with Dr. Evans and Dr. Lee. His therapists insist that he is imagining it all to help cope with the pain. However, when Michael later breaks into Ed's house Ed admits that he and an accomplice were hiding heroin at the Westfield Distribution Center; [...] "they decided he had to go", after Michael began to uncover it. Michael does not know who [...] "they" [...] are, demanding that Ed tell him. Ed asks for protection before telling him, and attacks Michael when he is distracted. During the struggle Michael kills Ed, and Bird comes into the house after speaking to Dr. Evans. Michael later discovers that Carl and Tricia are involved in the setup. Tricia shoots Carl in the [...] "green reality" [...] (in an attempt to hide her involvement in the accident), but is later imprisoned. At the end of the series finale ("Turtles All the Way Down"), Michael sees Hannah and Rex together. Concerned about his odd behavior, they ask if he is all right. Michael replies, [...] "I'm perfect," [...] and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel's {{films were}} {{famous for their}} surreal imagery, [...] {{including}} scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. [...] Some critics {{have pointed out that}} one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. [...] As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: [...] "In Mexico, it's believable", while {{one of the founders of}} Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, [...] "the most surrealist country in the world." [...] Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism; [...] Buñuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in Cet obscur objet du désir, when Mathieu <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.|$|E
60|$|He {{stares at}} his daughter, stares all around him, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and lies slumbering on her arm.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Cyrus Pym <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to {{indicate}} a courteous assent.|$|R
60|$|Tom <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and shuddered at the dark, atheistic words.|$|R
60|$|Then Percy Cuthfert <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and dropped}} off to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sudden, {{repeated}} {{flashes of}} lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{his right hand}} pressed hard upon them.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... (ASHER {{starts to}} pull up an armchair, but AUGUSTA looks at him and [...] shakes her head, and pulls it up herself. GEORGE sinks into the [...] chair, leans {{back his head and}} <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> AUGUSTA hovers over [...] him, {{smoothing}} his hair.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure, a {{man must}} {{like to take}} a kind leave of his own wife before he <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for ever; and I dare say {{it would be a great}} relief to you to tell him that you have {{forgotten}} his desertion of you, and all the hardships it has brought upon you in searching for him, and in earning your own livelihood as a common sailor." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{he began}} trying to cross his legs again.|$|R
60|$|Burton shivered {{a little}} as he leaned back and <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{as though}} he had heard a discord.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the back}} of the tent drops into place, and all is {{darkness}} again--whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears it creeping close to him--now it is beside him. He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his name.|$|E
60|$|Overpowered by his exertions, he lays {{his head}} back on his pillows and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for not more than a minute, when he again resumes his {{watching}} of the weather and {{his attention to the}} muffled sounds. In the rendering of those little services, and in the manner of their acceptance, the trooper has become installed as necessary to him. Nothing has been said, but it is quite understood. He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his mother's chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in a treasure that fastens upon a man's mind. He will pray and blaspheme and still persevere, and will curse the day he ever heard of it, and will let his last hour come upon him unawares, still believing that he missed it only by a foot. He will see it every time he <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He will never forget it till he is dead--and even then----Doctor, {{did you ever hear}} of the miserable gringos on Azuera, that cannot die? Ha! ha! Sailors like myself. There is no getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon your mind." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sighed and}} <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> In {{a few minutes}} he was asleep.|$|R
60|$|His voice sank {{to a low}} mumble, and he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wearily.|$|R
60|$|Reinhart staggered, {{holding on}} {{tight to the}} desk. He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> gasping.|$|R
60|$|The {{ponderous}} {{woman looked}} through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and opens them, and seeing the brass candlestick again, finally starts broad awake {{and stares at the}} candlestick with all his powers. So the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower bed, and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying. She stood there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers. Then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} is taken by surprise, never having dreamt {{of a state}} of {{existence}} where existence itself seems suspended. He shakes himself in his coat, to see whether it be empty or no. He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> to test the reality of the glassy expanse. He fetches a deep breath, by way of experiment, {{and for the sake of}} witnessing the effect. If a reader of books, Priestley on Necessity occurs to him; and he believes in that old Sir Anthony Absolute to the very last chapter. His faith in Malte Brun, however, begins to fail; for the geography, which from boyhood he had implicitly confided in, always assured him, that though expatiating all over the globe, the sea was at least margined by land. That over against America, for example, was Asia. But it is a calm, and he grows madly skeptical.|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: (Bloom trickleaps to the {{curbstone}} and halts again. He brushes a mudflake {{from his}} cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day {{the wheel of}} the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> an instant) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow! ...|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and I did not further disturb him.|$|R
60|$|Then, hearing Markey {{open the}} door, he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and feigned sleep.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned over}} and <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> as if to reflect on its enormity.|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. That was old Walpole, I know. Don't grieve, Walpole. I'm {{perfectly}} happy. I'm not in pain. I don't want to live. Ive {{escaped from}} myself. I'm in heaven, immortal {{in the heart}} of my beautiful Jennifer. I'm not afraid, and not ashamed. [Reflectively, puzzling it out for himself weakly] I know that in an accidental sort of way, struggling through the unreal part of life, I havnt always been able to live up to my ideal. But in my own real world I have never done anything wrong, never denied my faith, never been untrue to myself. Ive been threatened and blackmailed and insulted and starved. But Ive played the game. Ive fought the good fight. And now it's all over, theres an indescribable peace. [He feebly folds his hands and utters his creed] I believe in Michael Angelo, Velasquez, and Rembrandt; in the might of design, the mystery of color, the redemption of all things by Beauty everlasting, and the message of Art that has made these hands blessed. Amen. Amen. [He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and lies still].|$|E
60|$|Of course if {{you come}} to the place fresh from New York, you are deceived. Your {{standard}} of vision is all astray, You do think the place is quiet. You do imagine that Mr. Smith is asleep merely because he <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he stands. But live in Mariposa for six months or a year and then you will begin to understand it better; the buildings get higher and higher; the Mariposa House grows more and more luxurious; McCarthy's block towers to the sky; the 'buses roar and hum to the station; the trains shriek; the traffic multiplies; the people move faster and faster; a dense crowd swirls to and fro in the post-office and the five and ten cent store--and amusements! well, now! lacrosse, baseball, excursions, dances, the Fireman's Ball every winter and the Catholic picnic every summer; and music--the town band in the park every Wednesday evening, and the Oddfellows' brass band on the street every other Friday; the Mariposa Quartette, the Salvation Army--why, after a few months' residence you begin to realize that the place is a mere mad round of gaiety.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} but admire the coolness and conduct of Marble {{even at that}} terrific moment! In the first place, he put the helm hard down, and lashed the wheel, the wisest thing {{that could be done}} by men in our situation. This he did by means of that {{nautical}} instinct, which enables a seaman to act, in the direst emergencies, almost without reflection, or, as one <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to avoid danger to the pupils. Then he gave one glance at the state of things in-board, running forward with the end of a rope to throw to Diogenes, should the cook rise near the ship. By the time he was satisfied the hope of doing anything in that way, was vain, I was on deck, and we two stood facing each other, {{in the midst of the}} scene of desolation and ruin that was around us. Marble caught my hand with a look that spoke as plainly as words. It told me the joy he felt at seeing I was spared, his determination to stick by me to the last; yet, how low were his hopes of ultimate preservation! It was such a look as any man would be glad to receive from a comrade in the heat of battle; nevertheless, it was not a look that promised victory.|$|E
60|$|He <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> languidly, {{and kept}} them closed until {{the men had}} departed.|$|R
60|$|The detective <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and smiled}} <b>his</b> quiet smile again. He opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and fixed them on Mrs. Pett.|$|R
60|$|The door opened, and {{the doctor}} entered softly. Hill <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Courtlaw stood up.|$|R
