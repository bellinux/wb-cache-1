What better authority on the pronunciation of her name than Clark and Shannon who traveled with her and constantly heard the pronunciation of her name? We do not believe it is a Minnetaree (Hidatsa) word for her name. Sacajawea was a Lemhi Shoshone not a Hidatsa.|$|E

60|$|In these days, {{the duties}} of Miss Brown as Peter Ruff's {{secretary}} had become multifarious. Together with the transcribing of {{a vast number of}} notes concerning cases, some of which he undertook and some of which he refused, she had also to keep his <b>cash</b> <b>book,</b> a note of his investments and a record of his social engagements. Notwithstanding all these demands upon her time, however, there were occasions when she found herself, of necessity, idle. In one of these she broached the subject which had often been in her mind. They were alone, and not expecting callers. Consequently, she sat upon the hearthrug and addressed her employer by his Christian name.|$|E

6000|$|The {{three men}} {{are all of}} that staid middle age which begins early and lasts late in the profession. They are none of them famous, yet each is of good repute, and a fair type of his {{particular}} branch. The portly man with the authoritative manner and the white, vitriol splash upon his cheek is Charley Manson, chief of the Wormley Asylum, {{and author of the}} brilliant monograph--Obscure Nervous Lesions in the Unmarried. He always wears his collar high like that, since the half-successful attempt of a student of Revelations to cut his throat with a splinter of glass. The second, with the ruddy face and the merry brown eyes, is a general practitioner, a man of vast experience, who, with his three assistants and his five horses, takes twenty-five hundred a year in half-crown visits and shilling consultations out of the poorest quarter of a great city. That cheery face of Theodore Foster is seen at the side of a hundred sick-beds a day, and if he has one-third more names on his visiting list than in his <b>cash</b> <b>book</b> he always promises himself that he will get level some day when a millionaire with a chronic complaint--the ideal combination--shall seek his services. The third, sitting on the right with his dress shoes shining {{on the top of the}} fender, is Hargrave, the rising surgeon. His face has none of the broad humanity of Theodore Foster's, the eye is stern and critical, the mouth straight and severe, but there is strength and decision in every line of it, and it is nerve rather than sympathy which the patient demands when he is bad enough to come to Hargrave's door. He calls himself a jawman [...] "a mere jawman" [...] as he modestly puts it, but in point of fact he is too young and too poor to confine himself to a specialty, and there is nothing surgical which Hargrave has not the skill and the audacity to do.|$|E
50|$|A petty <b>cash</b> <b>book</b> is {{a record}} of small-value {{purchases}} before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of <b>cash</b> <b>book</b> usually uses the imprest system: {{a certain amount of}} money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{it may be}} easy to {{reconcile}} the difference by looking at very recent transactions in the bank statement and the organization's own accounting records (<b>cash</b> <b>book)</b> and seeing if some combination of them tallies with the difference to be explained. Otherwise {{it may be necessary}} to go through and match every transaction in both sets of records since the last reconciliation, and see what transactions remain unmatched. The necessary adjustments should then be made in the <b>cash</b> <b>book,</b> or reported to the bank if necessary, or any timing differences recorded to assist with future reconciliations.|$|E

50|$|The {{bookkeeping}} process primarily {{records the}} financial effects of transactions. The {{difference between a}} manual and any electronic accounting system results from the former's latency between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay—absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting into relevant accounts—is a basic characteristic of manual systems, thus giving rise to primary books of accounts such as <b>Cash</b> <b>Book,</b> Bank Book, Purchase Book, and Sales Book for recording the immediate effect of a financial transaction.|$|E

Feeling inspired, Perkins wrote the song, [...] "Daddy Sang Bass" [...] in 1967.

50|$|For {{the next}} 25 years, Cache County Library grew and expanded. Local {{businesses}} and {{individual members of}} the community donated <b>cash,</b> <b>books,</b> and furniture. The library had a large and popular genealogy collection, a space used as headquarters for the local Boy Scouts, and hosted art shows and concerts. The building and its contents became a source of pride for Cache County citizens. Unfortunately, after a few years, problems with the structure itself were evident: the roof leaked, there were issues with the boiler, and the lighting was considered inadequate. Most of these problems were handled in temporary fashion until funds could be procured for more permanent solutions.|$|R
