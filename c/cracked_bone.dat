5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer him a new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E
500|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after his return, Bourque was again sidelined when he {{suffered}} a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his ankle on December 31, 2006. He returned to action on February 21, 2007, after missing nearly two months. [...] Injuries again hampered Bourque in 2007–08. [...] He missed time {{early in the season}} with a groin pull, then was knocked out of the line-up for a month after breaking his thumb in a November game against the Detroit Red Wings. He remained healthy upon his return, finishing the season with 10goals and 14assists in 62games for Chicago.|$|E
500|$|The NHL All-Star Game {{format of}} the time had the {{defending}} champion face a team of the all-stars formed from the remaining teams. The 1950 All-Star Game was played {{prior to the start}} of the 1950–51 season and Pronovost played in the contest, a 7–1 victory by Detroit. [...] It was the first of 11 All-Star Games which he would ultimately play. The Red Wings had been promoting Pronovost as their next great defenceman, but he suffered a broken cheekbone and a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his ankle in separate incidents during the pre-season. [...] Not wanting to let the team down, he tried to play through the injuries but his performance suffered and by December 1950, the Red Wings demoted him to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Indianapolis Capitals. Pronovost scored 32 points in 34 games with Indianapolis before the Red Wings recalled him back to the NHL. [...] Though he played only a half season with the Capitals, he was named an AHL Second Team All-Star on defence. He finished with seven points in 37 games with Detroit and scored his first NHL goal on February 19, 1951, on goaltender Jack Gelineau. It was a last-minute goal that salvaged a 2–2 tie against the Boston Bruins.|$|E
25|$|Bone glue {{can be made}} by {{prolonged}} boiling {{of ground}} or <b>cracked</b> <b>bones,</b> followed by filtering and evaporation to thicken the resulting fluid. Historically once important, bone glue and other animal glues today have only a few specialized uses, such as in antiques restoration. Essentially the same process, with further refinement, thickening and drying, is used to make gelatin.|$|R
50|$|Tooth {{breakage}} is {{a frequent}} result of carnivores' feeding behaviour. Carnivores include both pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter depends on a powerful bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to <b>crack</b> <b>bones</b> with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf and the red wolf (C.rufus) possess greater buttressing than all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that these are both better adapted for <b>cracking</b> <b>bone</b> than other canids.|$|R
25|$|Divination—to predict and/or {{influence}} the future—was yet {{another form of}} religious practice. An ancient practice that was common during the Qin dynasty was <b>cracking</b> <b>bones</b> or turtle shells to gain knowledge of the future. The forms of divination which sprang up during early imperial China were diverse, though observing natural phenomena was a common method. Comets, eclipses, and droughts were considered omens of things to come.|$|R

50|$|At the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, Petrovic {{was one of}} ten European actors — {{including}} Andrea Riseborough, Clara Lago, Alexander Fehling, and Domhnall Gleeson — {{that were}} presented the Shooting Stars Award by the European Film Promotion. American magazine Variety also named her {{as one of the}} most promising actresses today. In 2011, Petrovic made her stage debut as Célimène in The Misanthrope by Molière. The same year, she played Elikia in The Sound of <b>Cracking</b> <b>Bones</b> by Suzanne Lebeau.|$|R
5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth {{to enable them to}} <b>crack</b> <b>bones</b> with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf possesses greater buttressing when compared to all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that the gray wolf is better adapted for <b>cracking</b> <b>bone</b> than other canids. In comparison to extant North American gray wolves, Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture in wolves ranged from a minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey.|$|R
50|$|Harpagolestes (hooked thief) is an extinct genus of hyena like, bear sized mesonychid mesonychian {{that lived}} in middle and eastern Asia during the middle to late Eocene. Fossil {{specimens}} have been recovered in Mongolia, China, {{and at least one}} species in Korea and possibly North America. Harpagolestes exhibits strong, curved canine teeth, a deep lower jaw, massive skull, and heavy wear on the molars. This along with stout limb bones suggest that Harpagolestes was a scavenger and did not pursue its prey. The wear on the molars suggests it regularly <b>cracked</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003-2004, Carney showed {{improvement}} in his stats. He needed surgery after {{suffering from a}} <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> above his eye, but he missed only two games.

50|$|After Gronkowski {{was placed}} on the injured reserve list in early December, Bennett became the Patriots No. 1 tight end. He {{finished}} the regular season playing in all 16 games with 12 starts recording 55 receptions for 701 yards and a career-high seven touchdowns. His 397 yards after the catch ranked No. 2 among NFL tight ends in 2016. During the season, he was forced to play hurt, while battling ankle and shoulder injuries, which required him to undergo offseason ankle surgery to repair a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the lockout}} {{shortened}} 1994-95 season, Brown appeared in 33 games with Vancouver, scoring eight goals and 31 points, finishing fourth in overall team scoring, despite missing 15 games {{due to a}} <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his wrist after being slashed by Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings, and a separated shoulder late in the season. Brown appeared in only five of eleven playoff games for Vancouver due to a thigh injury, scoring a goal and four points, as the Canucks were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs.|$|E

As often happens at such midnight symposiums, the two friends found themselves in a more kindly and confidential vein than had happened before, great as had been the kindness and confidence already grown up between them. Redclyffe told his friend of Lord Braithwaite's invitation, and of his own resolution to accept it.|$|R

At first Crowther {{did not appear to}} be seriously injured, apart from being shaken up and sustaining a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his neck. He was able to tell the police his personal details, including his home telephone number and what tablets he was taking for his heart condition; he had been diagnosed with heart trouble three years earlier when he complained of feeling breathless. In his autobiography, he claimed the stress of the media harassment over his alcoholism in late 1988 and early 1989 had brought it on.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, Westhoff was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the femur in his left leg. Originally, the condition was misdiagnosed and Westhoff was nearly fatally wounded after the doctor accidentally cut one of his arteries. Once the correct diagnosis was made Westhoff underwent ten surgeries to remove the cancer and the bone replacing it with bone grafts, plates, screws and pins. A <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> graft in 2007, caused Westhoff to announce his departure from the Jets. In 2008, Westhoff entered the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to undergo a procedure to replace the missing femur with a titanium rod. After vigorous rehabilitation, Westhoff was able to walk again and returned to the Jets' sidelines in September 2008.|$|E

50|$|Boucha {{was drafted}} in the 2nd Round, 16th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft (he was also drafted first overall by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the rival World Hockey Association but chose not to defect to the WHA). Boucha scored a goal in his first NHL game after the Olympics and was voted Detroit {{rookie of the year}} in his first full NHL season. The Red Wings sent him to the Minnesota North Stars in {{exchange}} for Danny Grant in 1974. Boucha was enjoying a solid year in his home state; on January 4, 1975, he was assaulted in a highly publicized stick incident by Dave Forbes of the Boston Bruins. The attack left Boucha with a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> around his eye and blurred vision. Forbes was prosecuted for aggravated assault. His trial resulted in a hung jury.|$|E

5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for <b>cracking</b> <b>bones</b> and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|R

5000|$|The Packers re-signed Pederson to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} on March 13, 2001, to replace backup Matt Hasselbeck, who {{was traded to the}} Seattle Seahawks. [...] Pederson was the primary backup to Favre for the entire 2001 season, and was the primary placekick holder in every game. He was re-signed to a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Packers on April 2, 2002. Pederson again was the backup quarterback and primary holder in all 16 games in 2002. In a week 7 game against the Washington Redskins, Favre suffered a sprained knee and Pederson took most of the snaps in the second half, going 9-for-15 for 78 yards to help win the game 30-9. Pederson also played in games against the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and New York Jets. He re-signed with the Packers to a one-year, $750,000 contract on April 29, 2003. [...] For the third consecutive season, Pederson backed up Favre in all 16 games and held placekicks. He completed both of his passes during the regular season for a total of 16 yards. The Packers re-signed Pederson to {{a one-year contract}} on April 28, 2004. [...] Tim Couch was signed to compete for the backup quarterback job, but lost out to Pederson and was released on September 5, 2004. [...] In a week 3 game against the Indianapolis Colts, Pederson replaced Favre in a blowout loss and went 4-of-6 for 34 yards and an interception. The next week, a week 4 game against the New York Giants, Favre sustained a concussion in the third quarter, and Pederson replaced him at quarterback. Pederson went 7-of-17 for 86 yards and an interception in the loss before he suffered a hit to his side in the third quarter that resulted in a <b>cracked</b> <b>bone</b> in his back, a torn muscle in his side, and a broken rib. [...] He stayed in the game up until the last snap, when he was replaced by third-string quarterback Craig Nall. Pederson was placed on injured reserve on October 7, ending his season. [...] He retired in March 2005 to become a head coach at Calvary Baptist Academy.|$|E
50|$|Debates {{over the}} {{frequency}} of cannibalism in ancient humanity have been sporadic, usually erupting on the discovery of human with cut and break marks reflective of being processed as food. Evidence of cannibalism has been tied to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. Many theories of cannibalism amongst humans rely on a lack of available prey, crowding and fears of potential starvation. There are clear biological drawbacks of cannibalism including disease, and in addition instances of ritual cannibalism {{that have nothing to}} do with nutrition drawn from the ethnographic record (Nishimura 2004). Evidence from Neanderthal remains in Belgium features <b>cracked</b> <b>bones,</b> cut marks and other indicators of processing for food. Notably, reindeer remains from the same site have the same types of butcher marks. The degree to which these remains reflect a ritual behavior, regular diet or isolated instances of dietary distress is not known (Rougier et al 2016).|$|R
