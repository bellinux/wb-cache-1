40|$|AbstractIn this paper, new {{tethered}} aerial robots including roaming tethered aerial robots (RTARs) for {{radioactive material}} sampling and stationary tethered aerial robots (STARs) for environment monitoring are proposed to meet extremely-long-endurance missions {{of nuclear power}} plants. The flight of the proposed tethered aerial robots may last {{for a few days}} or even a few months as long as the tethered cable provides continuous power. A high voltage AC or DC power system was newly adopted to reduce the mass of the tethered cable. The RTAR uses a tethered <b>cable</b> <b>spooled</b> from the aerial robot and an aerial tension control system. The aerial tension control system provides the appropriate tension to the tethered cable, which is accordingly laid down on the ground as the RTAR roams. The STAR includes a tethered <b>cable</b> <b>spooled</b> from the ground and a ground tension control system, which enables the STAR to reach high altitudes. Prototypes of the RTAR and STAR were designed and successfully demonstrated in outdoor environments, where the load power, power type, operating frequency, and flight attitude of the RTAR and STAR were: 180  W, AC 100  kHz, and 20  m; and 300  W, AC or DC 100  kHz, and 80  m, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the {{intended}} purpose of the narrow gauge railroad below the telephone cables was limited to hauling out excavation debris and hauling <b>cable</b> <b>spools</b> during the installation of telephone lines, but in 1903, the company renegotiated its franchise to allow {{the use of this}} railroad for freight and mail service. In early 1905, the system was taken over by the Illinois Tunnel Company. By this time, 26 mi of a projected 60 mi of tunnel had been completed. [...] The actual construction work was subcontracted to the Illinois Telephone Construction Company, under the management of George W. Jackson (1861-1922).|$|R

50|$|The coffeehouse in the {{basement}} was a hit, often selling out of lunch and packing the room for evening music. Student volunteers made daily runs to Chicago’s South Water Market for fresh produce. Patrons {{sat on the floor}} at <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> tables to eat granola, chicken soup and soy loaf. Anyone with a good recipe that could serve 400 cheap was invited to take a turn at cooking.|$|E
50|$|The tether {{management}} system (TMS) weighs 2.5 tons, while the <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> with steel cables weighs over 40 tons. To avoid {{the loss of}} ROUV in bad weather {{as in the case}} of Kaikō in 2003, a specially designed mechanism was incorporated to prevent such mishaps. On July 29, 2004, Sea Dragon-1 ROUV begun its final sea trials and after the completion, it subsequently entered Chinese service in the same year.|$|E

5000|$|The city of Chicago {{granted the}} newly formed Illinois Telephone and Telegraph company the rights to {{construct}} utility tunnels under the streets of Chicago in 1899 to carry its planned network of telephone cables. Initial plans for the tunnels called for filling them with phone cables, leaving a 6 ft by 14 in passage for maintenance. When the city refused to permit manholes through which cable could be unreeled into the tunnels, the plans were changed to include rails for hauling <b>cable</b> <b>spools</b> through the tunnels. [...] The city was largely unaware {{of the nature of}} the tunneling, and the first 16 mi of tunnel were excavated somewhat covertly, working from the basement of a saloon and carting away the spoil after midnight.|$|R

The new owner complains to Virginia about her father's behavior. Frustrated by her father's erratic behavior, Virginia decides {{to put him in}} a retirement home. Later that day Aldo and Virginia make love in an open field partially hidden by large wooden <b>cable</b> <b>spools</b> while Rosina plays nearby. When Rosina discovers them in their passion, she runs off upset. Back at the house, Virginia suggests they can no longer take care of Rosina, and soon Aldo puts her on a bus back to her mother. As the bus pulls away Aldo runs after her saying, [...] "I won't forget you ... remember that I love you. I'll always love you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of four reels anchored at high fixed points at corners of the stadium or arena (the cables are attached to fixed spars formed by tall extensible lift platforms when permanent anchors are not available).

5000|$|... an {{experimental}} observation version {{based on the}} T-26T artillery tractor chassis and intended for reconnaissance of front lines and enemy firing-points; also for correction of artillery fire. Developed by the Design Office of the Military Supply Depot No. 37 in Moscow in September 1934. The single vehicle was built by the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov in Leningrad and tested with some success in 1935 (nevertheless, the further work was stopped). The TN had an armoured cabin instead of a tank turret, armed with a bow DT tank machine gun (4,980 rds.). Equipment consisted of a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the cabin, a Zeiss optical rangefinder (with a 500 mm base length), a PTK tank commander panoramic sight, gyrocompass, course plotter, field dead-reckoning analyzer, predictor, map-board, SPVO signalling lamp and two UNAF telephones with a <b>cable</b> <b>spool.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Leader (AM-490) {{was laid}} down by J. M. Martinac Shipbuilding Corp., Tacoma, Washington, 22 September 1953; {{launched}} 15 September 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Norman Wordlund; reclassified MSO-490 7 February 1955, and commissioned 16 November 1955, Lt. Comdr. Harvey E. Toponce in command. This MSO class of minesweeper was constructed of non-magnetic materials, including a wooden hull and aluminum engines, and had a degaussing system to reduce the magnetic field of the vessel, {{so that it could}} move over magnetic mines without detonating them. It was equipped with a [...] "magnetic tail", two thick <b>cables</b> <b>spooled</b> on a large reel aft of the superstructure. The power-generation system could send current through this split tail after it was streamed behind the ship, creating a magnetic field designed to set off magnetic mines after the ship passed over them. It carried conventional mine-sweeping gear as well.|$|R
5000|$|Downriggers {{consist of}} four major components, the weight, cable, pole or boom, and the spool. A fishing line is {{attached}} to the downrigger cable by means of a [...] "line release."

5000|$|The TN, {{stored at}} the Factory No. 185, was {{subsequently}} rebuilt as the BSNP (bronirovanniy samokhodniy nablyudatel'niy punkt - [...] "armoured self-propelled observation post"), {{developed by the}} Artillery Advanced Courses for Command Staff and the Research Institute No. 22 in 1939. The BSNP was equipped with a 71-TK radio station, an Invert optical rangefinder (with 700 mm base length), PTK tank commander panoramic sight, tank magnetic compass, PDN retractable periscope of long-range observation (with 10x optical magnification and 5° angle), two field telephones with two <b>cable</b> <b>spools</b> and a real-time course plotter developed by the Research Institute No. 22. The vehicle was tested in summer 1939 at the Luga Artillery Proving Ground. The inspection commission {{came to the conclusion}} that the BSNP was a very useful vehicle for artillery general-purpose reconnaissance and for co-ordination of artillery with tank and infantry units on the battlefield, but that the quality of equipment and its installation was not a successful use of the vehicle. It was recommended to improve the vehicle but all further work was stopped.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to study the}} static pressure distribution among the layers of an optical fiber <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> based on the force analysis of the cable system. Using the distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technique, the static pressures within the fiber cable layers of the spool were measured according to the Bragg wavelength shifts of the FBGs embedded in the cable. The effects of the <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> shrinkage owing to the pressure from outer fiber cable layers on the cable tension and the radial pressure were analyzed in detail. As a result, {{the relationship between the}} applied static pressure upon the fiber and the resulted Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG was deduced. The static pressure distribution of the fiber optical <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> is obtained both in theory and experiment. Theoretical simulations coincide with experimental results.

40|$|Based on {{the force}} analysis, we {{establish}} a theoretical model to study the static pressure distribution of the fiber <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> for the fiber optic guided missile (FOG-M). Simulations indicate that for each fiber layer in the fiber <b>cable</b> <b>spool,</b> the applied static pressure on it asymptotically converges {{as the number of}} fiber layers increases. Using the distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technique, the static pressure of fiber cable layers in the spool on the cable winding device was measured. Experiments show that the Bragg wavelength of FBG in every layer varies very quickly at the beginning and then becomes gently as the subsequent fiber cable was twisted onto the spool layer by layer. Theoretical simulations agree qualitatively with experimental results. This technology provides us a real-time method to monitor the pressure within the fiber cable layer during the cable winding process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} static pressure distribution of fiber cable layer in an optical fiber <b>cable</b> <b>spool,</b> we establish a theoretical model of the force in the cable winding system. Simulations indicate that {{with the increase of}} the twining layers, the pressure of every layer in the spool increases very quickly at the beginning and mildly then. The static pressure of fiber cable layers in the spool on cable winding device is sensed by use of distributed fiber Bragg gratings (FBG). The quantitative relationship between the variation of FBG center wavelength and the system pressure is given theoretically. It is shown experimentally that with the increase of the twining layers, the variation pace of FBG center wavelength in every layer is very quick at the beginning and gentle then [...] Theoretical simulations coincide with experimental results very well.

50|$|Straight coiling, or the {{practice}} of coiling a cable {{in the same direction}} coil after coil, has the similar result to coiling <b>cable</b> on a <b>spool.</b> If the <b>cable</b> comes off the spool the same way it goes on, the internal 'lay' is preserved, and the cable isn't damaged or twisted internally. If a cable is straight coiled and then pulled from the coil, it has the effect as coiling <b>cable</b> on a <b>spool</b> and then pulling the cable {{off the top of the}} spool, imparting a twist in the cable with every coil that is removed. To make it lie flat, the twist will need to be removed. The advantages of straight coiling cable are that it will not produce knots when uncoiling and is easily taught and therefore can be accomplished easily by assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the simplicity, {{some models}} and their liveries {{could be quite}} clever, and Morestone/Budgie's forte {{seemed to be in}} {{selecting}} unique subjects not manufactured by other companies (Rixon 2005, p. 38). Distinct cars and smaller vehicles were wheeled air compressors, a tandem bicycle with two metal 'riders' and sidecar, a 1953 Packard Clipper convertible, a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere convertible, and a 1967 Oldsmobile 98 'town sedan' (Ragan 2000, pp. 46, 79-80). In trucks and construction, notable were the Morris [...] "Budgie Service" [...] breakdown lorry, the ERF low loader with electrical <b>cable</b> <b>spools</b> on the trailer, the strangely shaped ERF-articulated, mobile traffic [...] "Jumbo" [...] control unit, the Leyland tanker truck labeled with the phrase [...] "You'll feel a lot better if you drink milk", or the R.E.A. Express Commer van with appropriate budgerigar illustrated on the van's sides (Ragan 2000, p. 71; Rixon 2005, p. 114, 143). One intriguing model was the Thornycroft Amazon salvage lorry with crane which raises and swivels - the model also features a separate auxiliary engine (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Another would be the early-1960s GMC delivery van with Hertz markings or the Bedford tipper truck with [...] "Ham River Grit" [...] written on the sides (Rixon 2005, p. 6).One assembly detail different on Morestone/Budgie models, compared to other manufacturers, is the painting of wheels after they have been attached to axles. The appearance of painted 'hubs' at times makes a buyer wonder if the model has been 'retouched' by a collector, but this is factory spec (Ragan 2000, p. 27; Rixon 2005, p. 39).|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this project {{was to develop a}} purpose {{designed}} communication platform for subsea applications. The company Wireless Instrumentation Systems (WINS) AS has a pilot project with Statoil ASA on the production fields Gullfaks and AAsgard. WINS will install retrofit autonomous well-sensors that will transmit data wirelessly from the well to the seabed. This project outlines the development phase of this communication system providing the ?last mile? of signal transmission from the seabed to the topside platform or production center. The main concern for this platform is the subsea currents as they might induce vibrations to the frame structure. This will disable the platforms ability to receive signals from the well-sensors as the principle of communication is very weak electromagnetic waves. To receive these signals, hypersensitive magnetometers are used in a 3 D array. As a pilot project WINS will also test the reception principle of measuring electric potential on the seabed by the use of electrodes. A deployment system for this must be incorporated in the design. Several concepts were conceived and discarded as they failed the requirement specifications during analysis. However, this data gained knowledge to design the final concept, with success. The final concept has a very rigid frame with a tetrahedron shape. All materials are non-magnetic as this would distort the signal reception. An interconnected pressure vessel system contains the magnetometers and the data acquisition unit. Each magnetometer is firmly attached to the rigid frame structure to avoid vibrations. The electrodes will be deployed by the use of purpose built <b>cable</b> <b>spool</b> frames, which will be performed by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). This report describes in detail the integrated concepts of the final product and how it addresses the requirement specifications given by WINS and Statoil ASA...|$|E
