5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum <b>called</b> tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum <b>called</b> fa‘atete, a single-headed hand drum <b>called</b> pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed bass drum <b>called</b> tariparau.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements <b>called</b> morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually <b>called</b> words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are <b>called</b> affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are <b>called</b> morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are <b>called</b> syntax.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to inscriptions, chronicles <b>called</b> Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties.

5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains <b>called</b> peptides or longer chains <b>called</b> either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is <b>called</b> translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is <b>called</b> a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E

The outer nasal (near the snout) is <b>called</b> the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is <b>called</b> the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales <b>called</b> internasals.
