5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination {{of concrete and}} stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the <b>cross-bracing</b> structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As with the other underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E
25|$|In May 1960, the {{obsolete}} {{control tower}} at Eglin's Main base, a glass-enclosed cab, 15 feet square, supported by steel legs about 50 feet long, with steel <b>cross-bracing,</b> ladders and hand rails, was {{offered for sale}} to the highest bidder, announced by the U.S. Army District Engineer at Mobile, Alabama. The structure, offered on an as-is, where-is basis, was {{to be removed from}} the site not later than August 12.|$|E
25|$|The inner ditch was of V-section, 3.5 metres {{deep and}} 8.8 metres wide. Postholes for upright beams {{were found at}} the front of the inner rampart. These posts would have held {{horizontal}} timbers forming a wooden revetment to the front of the rampart. The rampart was composed of sand and gravel dug from the ditches, together with a wall of cut and laid turf into which the posts had been recessed. Additional postholes were discovered 5.8 metres behind the front postholes. These presumably held anchor timbers for the front wall, although the 5.8 metre distance between the rows is thought somewhat excessive for simple <b>cross-bracing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pentachlorophenol {{is banned}} in some {{countries}}, {{and its use}} in other countries is receiving increased resistance. Also, the increased emphasis on hardwood utilization requires that more information be obtained {{on the performance of}} preservatives applied to hardwoods. Several fungicides applied as brush treatments were evaluated as alternatives to chlorinated phenols for protection of wood above ground. <b>Cross-brace</b> and L-joint test units, constructed of southern pine, Douglas-fir, maple, or red oak, were treated just before assembly and exposed outdoors from 5 to 12 years at two sites. After 12 years at the Wisconsin site, untreated pine and maple <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, red oak had only limited decay, and Douglas-fir had no decay. After 12 years at the Mississippi site, untreated pine, maple, and red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, and Douglas-fir had no decay. The two hardwood species were more difficult to protect from decay than were the softwood species. No treatment completely prevented decay in maple <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed for 9 to 12 years in Mississippi. Most treatments only slightly reduced decay development in red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed in Mississippi; many treatments protected pine <b>cross-brace</b> units. The L-joint units were exposed for only 5 and 6 years at the Mississippi site but were more difficult to protect from decay than were the <b>cross-brace</b> units. Several alternative treatments were as effective or more effective than the chlorinated phenols in preventing decay in both types of test units...|$|R

25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a Warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin <b>cross-bracing,</b> which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.|$|E
25|$|The Fury's unstaggered wings {{comprised}} the 3-bay lower wings, mounted {{near to the}} top of the hull, and a pair of 4-bay upper wings of larger span; all were supported by pairs of vertical struts and diagonal <b>cross-bracing.</b> The original design specified three 600hp (447kW) Rolls Royce Condor engines, but these were not available and five 334hp (249kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VII engines were fitted instead. These were mounted on the middle wing and supported by additional struts, configured as two outboard tandem tractor/pusher (push-pull) pairs and one central pusher. In addition to its triplane configuration, the Fury had a biplane tailplane with a triple rudder, mounted on a single vertical fin similar to the Curtiss triplane. Not unlike the Model T the Fury was initially provided with servo-motors for the main flight control surfaces, designed by Major Arthur Quilton Cooper, but these were removed later without compromising the pilot's ability to control this large aircraft. At some point the engines were replaced with the more powerful 334hp (249kW) Eagle VIIIs.|$|E

In 1908 the two spans nearest Saltash station were replaced with wider ones {{to accommodate a}} new track layout. The remaining approach spans were replaced {{on both sides of}} the river during 1928 and 1929. During the 1930s new <b>cross-bracing</b> and diagonal sway-bracing were added between the vertical standards to further strengthen the bridge and keep the suspension chains hanging in the correct shape.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intrinsic}} engineering {{issue is}} the need to avoid fenestration punctures in stonework barrel vaults. Such openings could compromise the integrity of the entire arch system. [...] Thus the Romanesque medieval builders had to resort to techniques of small windows, large buttresses, or other forms of interior wall <b>cross-bracing</b> to achieve the desired lighting outcomes. [...] In many of the monasteries, a natural solution was cloisters which could have high barrel-vaulted construction with an open courtyard to allow ample lighting.|$|E
2500|$|The two spans are {{lenticular}} trusses {{with the}} top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the bottom chord comprises a pair of chains. Each of the trusses is simply supported and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial {{in view of the}} curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting <b>cross-bracing</b> members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also seventeen much shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , , , , , , , , , , and seven on the Devon side of (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , , , , [...] This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The spire is both {{twisted and}} leaning, {{twisting}} 45 degrees and leaning [...] from its true centre. Folklore recounts that a Bolsover blacksmith mis-shod the Devil, who leapt over the spire in pain, knocking {{it out of}} shape. In reality the leaning characteristic {{has been attributed to}} various causes, including the absence of skilled craftsmen (the Black Death having been gone only twelve years prior to the spire's completion), the use of unseasoned timber, and insufficient <b>cross-bracing.</b> According to the curators of Chesterfield Museum, it is now believed that the bend began when the original wooden roof tiles were replaced by heavier slate and lead. The bend in the spire (the twist being deliberate) follows the direction of the sun and has been caused by heat expansion and a weight it was never designed for. There is also no record of a bend until after the slate change. The tower which the spire sits upon contains 10 bells. These bells were cast in 1947 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London, replacing a previous ring. The heaviest weighs [...]|$|E

2500|$|The fuselages of the Types 20 and 22 {{were similar}} flat-sided {{structures}} based on four cross-braced longerons, {{each of three}} parts. [...] Since {{the nose of the}} 22 did not terminate in a propeller, the high cockpit of the 20 was replaced with a blunt-nosed cabin, curved in planform, for the pilot. [...] Behind him the passenger seats in the Type 22 were in pairs, each with their own window. Boarding and disembarking were reported as a little difficult. The wing-mounted engines led to revised wing plans and structures. The Breguet 22 had equal-span, unstaggered wings of rectangular plan and three bays. [...] The innermost bay was defined by the engine by the engine mountings, which placed the U.16s with their four-blade tractor propellers on multiple struts midway between the two wings. Radiators were mounted {{on the sides of the}} engine cowling. [...] The outer bays were formed by single interplane struts with forked junctions into the wings, assisted by <b>cross-bracing.</b> [...] At the rear the tail was, like that of the Type 20, quite small and conventional with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage but now carrying a pair of small additional fins. [...] The landing gear was also conventional, with each fixed mainwheel mounted on a pair of substantial V-form legs from the wing spars under the inner bay.|$|E

50|$|A {{square frame}} made of solid bars is not rigid but tends to bend at the corners. Bracing {{it with an}} extra {{diagonal}} bar would be heavy.
