5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. An EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees but not {{substantial}} structures. An EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (<b>cycloidal</b> marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A <b>cycloidal</b> propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} scales for rating the {{strength}} of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (<b>cycloidal</b> marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (<b>cycloidal</b> marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
25|$|For <b>cycloidal</b> gears (as used in BS978-2 Specification {{for fine}} pitch gears) and cycloidal-type gears each module, ratio {{and number of}} teeth in the pinion {{requires}} a different hobbing cutter, so the technique is only suitable for large volume production.|$|E
25|$|Tornado {{intensity}} can {{be measured}} by in situ or remote sensing measurements, but since these are impractical for wide scale use, intensity is usually inferred via proxies, such as damage. The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale rate tornadoes by the damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by expert elicitation) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (<b>cycloidal</b> marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
2500|$|Just [...] west of this marker, {{the site}} of the <b>cycloidal</b> {{inclined}} plane on the steep western slope of Falling Creek Valley is still recognizable and juxtaposes the remains of the railroad bridge at Falling Creek. The location is about [...] east of the Village of Midlothian on U.S. Route 60.|$|E
2500|$|To {{circumvent}} {{this problem}} a special war-time emergency circular arc gear standard was produced giving {{a series of}} close-to-cycloidal forms which could be cut with a single hob for each module for eight teeth and upwards to economize on cutter manufacturing resources. [...] A variant on this is still included in BS978-2a (Gears for instruments and clockwork mechanisms. <b>Cycloidal</b> type gears. Double circular arc type gears).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} features was a <b>cycloidal</b> inclined plane, a drum and rope device by which loaded coal-carrying cars lowered down the steep western slope of Falling Creek Valley pulled by two empty cars traveling up the slope. On the eastern side, the loaded cars were then raised [...] over a [...] distance, with power supplied by animals. After completing that movement, the roadbed was mostly a gradual downhill slope over relatively level terrain towards Manchester.|$|E
2500|$|... At p. 303, [...] "The hobbing process {{conceived}} in 1856 by Christian Schiele became a practical one for production work {{as soon as}} involute-shaped gear teeth superseded the <b>cycloidal</b> type in the 1880s, since the involute hob, like the involute rack, has straight sides (for the worm {{is a form of}} continuous rack) so that to make a hob from a worm all one has to do is to gash some teeth in the worm so that it will cut the blank as it is rotated." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{tooth profile}} {{which is a}} {{theoretical}} involute, the fundamental rack is straight-sided, with sides inclined at the pressure angle of the tooth form, with flat top and bottom. The necessary addendum correction to allow the use of small-numbered pinions can either be obtained by suitable modification of this rack to a <b>cycloidal</b> form at the tips, or by hobbing at other than the theoretical pitch circle diameter. [...] Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle, but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.|$|E

He picked up the books one by one, commenting on them as he lifted them. 'Conic Sections he does not mind, nor <b>Cycloidal</b> Oscillations, nor the Principia, nor Quaternions, nor Thermodynamics. Now for the book that fetched him!' Malcolmson took it up and looked at it. As he did so he started, and a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and shivered slightly, as he murmured to himself: ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{now using}} the term beauty in its most {{comprehensive}} sense, as including expression and artistic interest,--that is, I consider not only the living balance, but likewise all the accompaniments that even by disturbing are necessary to the renewal and continuance of the balance. And in this sense I proceed to show, that the beautiful in the object may be referred to two elements,--lines and colours; the first belonging to the shapely ('forma, formalis, formosus'), and in this, to the law, and the reason; and the second, to the lively, the free, the spontaneous, and the self-justifying. As to lines, the rectilineal are in themselves the lifeless, the determined 'ab extra', but still in immediate union with the <b>cycloidal,</b> which are expressive of function. The curve line is a modification of the force from without by the force from within, or the spontaneous. These are not arbitrary symbols, but the language of nature, universal and intuitive, {{by virtue of the}} law by which man is impelled to explain visible motions by imaginary causative powers analogous to his own acts, as the Dryads, Hamadryads, Naiads, &c.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{suppose that}} in tracing its <b>cycloidal</b> curves through the unthinkable reaches of space traversed by {{the solar system}} our planet should pass through a [...] "belt" [...] of {{attenuated}} matter having the property of dementing us! It is a conception easily enough entertained. That space is full of malign conditions incontinuously distributed; {{that we are at}} one time traversing a zone comparatively innocuous and at another spinning through a region of infection; that away behind us in the wake of our swirling flight are fields of plague and pain still agitated by our passage through them,--all this is as good as known. It is almost as certain as it is that in our little annual circle round the sun are points at which we are stoned and brick-batted like a pig in a potato-patch--pelted with little nodules of meteoric metal flung like gravel, and bombarded with gigantic masses hurled by God knows what? What strange adventures await us in those yet untraveled regions toward which we speed?--into what malign conditions may we not at any time plunge?--to the strength and stress of what frightful environment may we not at last succumb? The subject lends itself readily enough to a jest, but I am not jesting: it is really altogether probable that our solar system, racing through space with inconceivable velocity, will one day enter a region charged with something deleterious to the human brain, minding us all mad-wise.|$|E
60|$|The {{instances}} of new theories agreeing with and explaining old empiricisms, are innumerable. All the just remarks made by experienced persons on human character and conduct, {{are so many}} special laws, which the general laws {{of the human mind}} explain and resolve. The empirical generalizations on which the operations of the arts have usually been founded, are continually justified and confirmed on the one hand, or corrected and improved on the other, by the discovery of the simpler scientific laws on which the efficacy of those operations depends. The effects of the rotation of crops, of the various manures, and other processes of improved agriculture, have been for the first time resolved in our own day into known laws of chemical and organic action, by Davy, Liebig, and others. The processes of the medical art are even now mostly empirical: their efficacy is concluded, in each instance, from a special and most precarious experimental generalization: but as science advances in discovering the simple laws of chemistry and physiology, progress is made in ascertaining the intermediate links in the series of phenomena, and the more general laws on which they depend; and thus, while the old processes are either exploded, or their efficacy, in so far as real, explained, better processes, founded on the knowledge of proximate causes, are continually suggested and brought into use.(155) Many even of the truths of geometry were generalizations from experience before they were deduced from first principles. The quadrature of the cycloid {{is said to have been}} first effected by measurement, or rather by weighing a <b>cycloidal</b> card, and comparing its weight with that of a piece of similar card of known dimensions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cycloidal</b> {{drive or}} <b>cycloidal</b> speed reducer is a {{mechanism}} for reducing the speed of an input shaft by a certain ratio. <b>Cycloidal</b> speed reducers are capable of relatively high ratios in compact sizes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cycloidal</b> rotor: {{a set of}} {{horizontal}} lifting aerofoils rotating around the rim of a supporting horizontal-axis rotor. (May be powered or unpowered.) An aircraft with a <b>cycloidal</b> rotor wing is called a Cyclogyro.|$|E
50|$|The {{reduction}} {{rate of the}} <b>cycloidal</b> drive is obtained from the following formula, where P means {{the number of the}} ring gear pins and L is the number of lobes on the <b>cycloidal</b> disc.|$|E
50|$|The {{input shaft}} drives an {{eccentric}} bearing {{that in turn}} drives the <b>cycloidal</b> disc in an eccentric, <b>cycloidal</b> motion. The perimeter of this disc is geared to a stationary ring gear and has a series of output shaft pins or rollers placed through {{the face of the}} disc. These output shaft pins directly drive the output shaft as the <b>cycloidal</b> disc rotates. The radial motion of the disc is not translated to the output shaft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cycloidal</b> disc has {{holes that}} are {{slightly}} larger than the output roller pins that go inside them. The output pins will move around in the holes to achieve steady rotation of the output shaft from the wobbling movement of the <b>cycloidal</b> disc.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{eccentric}} {{nature of the}} drive, if the <b>cycloidal</b> disk is not balanced by a second disk or a counterweight, it will generate vibration which will propagate through the driven shafts. This will cause increased wear on the exterior teeth of the <b>cycloidal</b> disk, as well as component bearings.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 a {{team at the}} University of Singapore built {{a working}} model of cyclogyro, {{although}} it has only flown in tethered flight. Their <b>cycloidal</b> model was a modified helicopter, with the rotor replaced with two sideways <b>cycloidal</b> rotors, each with three blades sticking out {{of them in the}} perpendicular.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} pins {{on the ring}} gear {{is larger than the}} number of pins on the <b>cycloidal</b> disc. This causes the <b>cycloidal</b> disc to rotate around the bearing faster than the input shaft is moving it around, giving an overall {{rotation}} in the direction opposing the rotation of the input shaft.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{many other}} drive {{mechanisms}} the <b>cycloidal</b> drive is not typically backdrivable.|$|E
50|$|The {{input shaft}} is mounted {{eccentrically}} to a Rolling-element bearing (typically a cylindrical roller bearing), causing the <b>cycloidal</b> disc {{to move in}} a circle. The <b>cycloidal</b> disc will independently rotate around the bearing as it is pushed against the ring gear. This is similar to planetary gears, and the direction of rotation is opposite {{to that of the}} input shaft.|$|E
