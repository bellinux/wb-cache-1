40|$|The {{responsibilities}} of {{a department of}} Obstetrics and Gynaecology of a medical school are the following: patient care, teaching and training, research, administration and, lastly, official duties. These tasks should be performed {{in an atmosphere of}} characterbuilding and continuous stimulation; THINK should be the motto of all times. Other essentials include good management and a team approach, which should be combined with proper planning, consultation and contact - nationally as well as internationally - with scientists in this particular field. The cost-benefit factor should always feature prominently in all departmental activities, and of particular importance in this connection would be periodical analyses of the departmental activities aimed at ensuring that objectives are being fulfilled. Patient care should have a high priority rating in departmental objectives. A comparison of the departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the three Afrikaans-language medical schools in the country shows that this university attends to approximately 48 % {{of the total number of}} out-patients and 47 % of the total number of deliveries handled by these three units annually, while having only 22 % of the total personnel complement. Moreover, as regards apparatus facilities, this department has only 15 % of the total number of <b>colposcopes</b> and 23 % of fetal heart monitors at its disposal. Specific facilities for which provision should be made include a reproductive biology unit including a gynaecological endocrinology and infertility department, preconception clinic, family planning unit and mature-women clinic; a gynaecological oncology unit including a clinic for colposcopy and cytology and a trophoblastic disease unit; a perinatalogy unit including an intensive-care unit, facilitites for ante-natal fetal monitoring, fetoscopv and pre-natal diagnosis and genetic advisory clinics; uro-gynaecological unit; an ultra-sound unit; and a comprehensive service in the form of social workers and psycologists who must be part of the team. It should also be the responsibility of the department to convey information to patients by every possible means, such as symposia and publications in the lay press. Training on a pre- and postgraduate level is a specific responsibility of this department, and once again when comparing the three Afrikaans universities it appears that this department provides training to 43 % of the total number of students but has only 33 % of the lecturing staff and 16 % of the administrative staff of the three medical schools combined. A specific aim should be to increase the retention of medical scientists by stimulating interest in research and academical medicine. Ongoing training should also be encouraged in order to maintain the standard of practice of medicine at an optimal level in this country. The training of nurses and paramedical staff should also be maintained at a high level, since these people have an important role in the team approach of this department. The value of research cannot be overestimated. Such research should not only be clinically orientated but should include experimental animal and laboratory research as well. The newly established in vitro fertilization research programme of the department is discussed at length, and reference is made to the ethical consequences of this new technique. p. 33 - 39 : Publikasies van die Universiteit van Pretoria (Nuwe Reeks) [URL]...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{recently}} reported, using {{a receiver}} operating characteristic area metric, the first meta-analytic comparison of the relative accuracy of cervical and anal cytology in detecting moderate or severe histopathologic lesions by magnification directed punch biopsy. The aim of the present research was to meta-analytically examine cut-point specific operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) of cervical and anal cytology in detecting high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) histopathology by <b>colposcope</b> directed punch biopsy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The primary eligibility requirement was availability of tabulated cytology (normal, atypical cells of unclear significance [ASCUS], low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL or atypical squamous cells cannot rule out high grade [ASC-H]) and biopsy (<HSIL, ≥ HSIL) counts. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of diagnostic accuracy was performed with examination of study quality criteria and heterogeneity. Thirty-three cervical and 11 anal publications were eligible between 1990 and 2010. Meta-analytically cut-point analysis showed that using a cut-point of ASCUS the sensitivity in both settings is similar while anal cytology is less specific than cervical cytology (specificity [95 % confidence interval] 0. 33 [0. 20 - 0. 49] vs. 0. 53 [0. 40 - 0. 66], p =  0. 04) {{for the detection of}} HSIL histopathology by <b>colposcope</b> directed punch biopsy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The gynaecological {{environment}} can become contaminated by human papillomavirus (HPV) from healthcare workers' hands and gloves. This study aimed {{to assess the}} presence of HPV on frequently used equipment in gynaecological practice. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 179 samples were taken from fomites (glove box, lamp of a gynaecological chair, gel tubes for ultrasound, <b>colposcope</b> and speculum) in two university hospitals and in four gynaecological private practices. Samples were collected with phosphate-buffered saline-humidified polyester swabs according to a standardised pattern, and conducted twice per day for 2  days. The samples were analysed by a semiquantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's χ(2) test and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two (18 %) HPV-positive samples were found. When centres were compared, there was {{a higher risk of}} HPV contamination in gynaecological private practices compared with hospitals (OR 2. 69, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 6. 86). Overall, {{there was no difference in}} the risk of contamination with respect to the time of day (OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 4. 69).

Cryosurgery and carbon dioxide laser surgery were introduced as out-patient treatments for precursors of cervical cancer because by using colposcopy the physician is able to accurately diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Colposcopy has also been an important tool in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human papillomavirus infections in men and women...|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{research}} has addressed the types {{and meaning of}} genital injury in South African rape victims. In South Africa, rape victims in private practice are examined using gross visualisation and a light source only. Research {{has shown that the}} use of toluidine blue and/ or a <b>colposcope</b> increases the number of injuries seen. Objective: To determine rape victim demographics and describe the genital injuries and other associated injuries reported during medico-legal examination of female rape victims older than 15 in four private Johannesburg hospitals between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, as well as to determine any associations between these variables and the race or age of the victim. Method: A retrospective chart review of 310 sexual assault victims seen at these hospitals. Results: Black victims made up 62...|$|E
40|$|As {{the fourth}} most common cancer among women worldwide, {{cervical}} cancer has a high mortality rate. The implementation of screening methods has decreased mortality by 50 % and thus has been key to decrease {{the burden of the}} disease. The current screening system aims to detect precancerous lesions that are easily treatable. In developed areas, these screening tests include a Papanicolau or human papilomavirus (HPV) test followed by an examination for positive cases where the cervix is viewed using a <b>colposcope</b> to identify any regions of concern for biopsy. However, these are currently too resource-intensive for many developing countries and improvement is needed in the accuracy to detect the result of a biopsy (considered the gold standard) and reproducibility. A newly developed device, a multispectral digital <b>colposcope</b> (MDC), may aid in the screening of cervical cancer by taking pictures of the cervix similar to what a colposcopist views for their examination. The images are acquired using varying levels of processing and using both fluorescence and reflectance filters and thus the high-dimensionality poses a challenge for traditional modeling strategies. This study is a comparative study of different machine learning methods using features derived from these images to predict whether the patient has a high-grade biopsy. Using data on 470 patients recruited at two sites (El Paso, Texas and Vancouver, BC), we trained and tested support vector machines, k-Nearest-neighbors, random forests, lasso, and logistic regression. Accuracy was estimated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in independent data. Several algorithms had very good accuracy in the training set, including perfect separation using random forest, but no algorithm had an AUC greater than 0. 7 in the test set. Random forests and logistic regression, with stepwise variable selection, generally had the highest AUCs in the test set (0. 65). This study suggests that the technology needs further development and research before its implementation is feasible. ...|$|E
