40|$|Different {{processes}} like phase separation, interfacial deformations, coalescence and break-up {{often occur}} simultaneously during industrial processing. It {{is clear that}} the influence of a final morphology on the mechanical properties is of great interest in many applications. Apart from the characteristics of phase separation, the influence of flow which is imposed to create a structure with desired properties during a processing step, such as mixing, injection moulding or extrusion on the final morphology, is a subject of study for quite some time now. In this paper two approaches which can be applied to study structure development in mixing flows are discussed. The first model is based {{on the use of the}} mapping method and can be applied to study distributive mixing in <b>complex</b> <b>mixers.</b> The second approach is based on a coupling of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conservation laws and! makes it possible to study details of interfacial deformations, including coalescence and break-up in prototypical mixing flow...|$|R

Presumably, this resampling was done to ease interfacing with then-contemporary integrated sound controllers which had limited output sample rate and mixing logic, as the PCB real estate inside laptops and PCMCIA devices may be insufficient to implement a more <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> and/or filtering circuit. However, the linear interpolator does not remove all artifacts, and the pitch of the output is subtly lower than the YMF262's as well.|$|E

40|$|Laminar {{heat and}} mass {{transfer}} {{is central to}} a wide range of industrial processes, encompassing (thermal) processing of viscous fluids, compact equipment for process intensification and emerging micro-fluidic devices. Many of these applications incorporate the 2 ̆ 2 static-mixing principle 2 ̆ 2 (stirring of a throughflow by internal elements) for mixing and heat-transfer enhancement. Investigations on static mixers primarily concern numerical simulations. Experimental studies, on the other hand, are relatively rare and to date restricted to visualization of mixing patterns or integral quantities as e. g. pressure drop and heat-transfer coefficients. The present study expands on this by quantitative experimental analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) flow fields and streamline patterns in a representative static mixer using 3 D Particle-Tracking Velocimetry. This necessitates tackling of (internal) refractions and reflections caused by the <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> geometry. Comparison of experimental results with numerical predictions reveals a good agreement...|$|E
40|$|In {{microfluidics}} {{mixing of}} different fluids {{is a highly}} non-trivial task due {{to the absence of}} turbulence. The dominant process allowing mixing at low Reynolds number is therefore diffusion, thus rendering mixing in plain channels very inefficient. Recently, passive chaotic micromixers such as the staggered herringbone mixer were developed, allowing efficient mixing of fluids by repeated stretching and folding of the fluid interfaces. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of such mixer devices is often performed by time consuming and expensive trial and error experiments. We demonstrate that the application of the lattice Boltzmann method to fluid flow in highly <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> geometries together with standard techniques from statistical physics and dynamical systems theory can lead to a highly efficient way to optimize micromixer geometries. The strategy applies massively parallel fluid flow simulations inside a mixer, where massless and noninteracting tracer particles are introduced. By following their trajectories we can calculate finite time Lyapunov exponents in order to quantify the degree of chaotic advection inside the mixer. The current report provides a review of our results published in [1] together with additional details on the simulation methodology...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel, single step method for the {{production}} of polyacrylamide hydrogels with a gradient in mechanical properties. In contrast to already existing techniques such as UV photo-polymerization with photomasks (limited penetration depth) or microfluidic gradient <b>mixers</b> (<b>complex</b> microfluidic chip), this technique is not suffering such limitations. Young's modulus of the hydrogels was varied by changing the total monomer concentration of the hydrogel precursor solution. Using programmable syringe pumps, the total monomer concentration in the solution fed to the hydrogel mold was varied from 16 wt% down to 5 wt% over the feeding time to obtain a gradient in compliance ranging from 150 kPa down to 20 kPa over a length of 10 mm down to 2. 5 mm. Polymerization was achieved with the dual initiation system composed of ammonium persulfate and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, which were both fed through separate capillaries to avoid premature polymerization. Functionalized with the model ligand collagen I, the substrates were bioactive and supported the attachment of human foreskin fibroblasts (around 30 % of the cells seeded attached after 1 h). A kinetic morphology study on homogeneous hydrogels of different stiffness's indicated that fibroblasts tend to spread to their final size within 2 h on stiff substrates, while the spreading time was much longer (ca. 4 - 5 h) on soft substrates. These trends were confirmed on hydrogels with compliance gradients, showing well spread fibroblasts on the stiff end of the hydrogel after 2 h, while the cells on the soft end still had small area and rounded morphology...|$|R
40|$|Multi-Gigabit {{per second}} {{wireless}} communication and atmospheric remote sensing for weather forecasts are new {{applications in the}} mm-wave frequency spectra. The High Electron Mobility Transistor is an excellent technology for high frequency mm-wave applications. Its low noise and linear performance makes a 0. 15 μm GaAs metamorphic HEMT technology the basis for three MMIC circuit designs at mm-wave frequencies. The wireless data traffic has increased exponentially {{over the last years}} due to more network subscribers and their fast adaptation to use high datarate mobile services. In order for the operators to evolve and accommodate higher data-rates at affordable prices, new microwave bands for point-to-point communication is a cost effective solution for increasing the backhaul capacity and deliver higher data rates to the network users. Two mm wave mixers for wideband E-band communications, specially focusing on direct modulation and demodulation solutions have been designed, fabricated and characterized. Direct modulators requires added functions such as quadrature signals and LO-RF isolation to be compatible with e. g. QAM modulated signals. <b>Complex</b> high performance <b>mixers</b> with novel solutions have been designed to cope with cost, function and performance. Since cost is a driving factor, a novel differential branchline coupler has been introduced to reduce size while maintaining function and performance. The design rely on differential modes to accomplish this, something that is common in CMOS or BiCMOS due to the lossy substrate but not in GaAs. Utilizing the properties of common and differential modes, the LO-RF isolation has been further improved by the use of a mode selective filter. The design covers the whole E-band frequency span with measured 13 dBm OIP 3, conversion loss of 11 dB, LO-RF isolation > 30 dB and IF bandwidth of 5 GHz. Remote mm and sub-mm wave sensing in Geostationary Earth Orbit has become an alternative solution for providing more accurate short term (nowcasting) weather predications. The advantage of being in geostationary orbit is the continuous coverage over a relatively large area. One of four frequency band of interest for this is 53 GHz, where a complete single chip MMIC receiver with integrated low noise amplifier, frequency multiplier and image reject mixer was designed, manufactured and measured. The Noise Figure (NF) of the receiver was measured to be 4. 6 dB, with a total power consumption of 140 mW, conversion gain and image rejection measured to be 10 dB and > 47 dB respectively. The NF is the lowest reported for a single chip receiver at 53 GHz...|$|R
40|$|The digital {{in-phase}} and quadrature (I and Q) carrier demodulation for the Deep Space Network's (DSN) Advanced Receiver {{is described}} and analyzed. The system provides coherent demodulation {{for a variety}} of modulation formats including Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), BPSK with a carrier residual, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), Offset-QPSK (OQPSK), and Minimum Shift Keying (MSK). The focus is on the theory and hardware design of the halfband filters which are the integral part of the demodulator. The underlying theory of the filters is summarized, a breadboard hardware design is described, and a VLSI implementation is proposed which significantly decreases the hardware. A second important problem analyzed is DC-offset in the demodulator. This is a serious problem which translates into bias error in the residual carrier phase detector. The dynamic range of the <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> is analyzed using a probabilistic approach. It is deduced that the resulting static phase error is less than 0. 2 deg when the ratio of carrier power to noise power in the demodulator input bandwidth is - 72 dB or higher. Thus, the static phase error is negligible at a carrier power to noise spectral density of 0 dB-Hz for a 15 MHz bandwidth demodulator...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive radio (CR) can {{effectively}} increase the spectral efficiency. However, {{there is an}} inevitable interference problem between the primary licensed users and the unlicensed CR devices. A detection technique utilizing the local oscillator (LO) leakage signal coming from a nearby mobile terminal is proposed and evaluated for short-range wireless communication systems, such as an ultra-wide band (UWB) system. Due to the low-level LO leakage, the detection sensitivity is a great concern. Local oscillator phase noise of the detector can degrade the detection sensitivity. Spectrum broadening of the LO phase noise interaction with an adjacent channel signal through a multiplier is analyzed and the degradation in detection performance is evaluated. Spectrum broadening {{is applied to the}} cognitive radio (CR) device operation in UHF bands. A strong TV signal transmitted by a nearby TV station can interact with LO phase noise of a CR receiver, and induce serious in-band interference which possible degrades the receiver performance. In order to suppress strong TV signals, a wide dynamic range low-power CMOS-based RF tunable filter with image cancellation is presented using a balanced passive <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> and frequency dependent loads. The tunable RF notch filter with 17 dB attenuation and 1. 6 dB insertion loss is achieved using parallel LC tank loads.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The goal of the present work is a detailed and comprehensive study to assess {{the accuracy of the}} numerical simulation of the mixing processes in a lobed mixer flow field via a Reynolds-averaged solution method. To meet this goal, the first objective of the current work was to establish the suitability of various meshing strategies that would allow the <b>complex</b> <b>mixer</b> geometries found in current gas-turbine engine designs to be captured, together with the associated convoluted shear layers. A second objective was targeted at providing further insight and understanding of the capability of eddy-viscosity-based turbulence models in capturing the convoluted shear layers. Simplified mixer configurations selected from the literature were studied under incompressible isothermal flow conditions. Two solution algorithms were employed to model the mixer flow fields. The first consisted of a pressure-based structured grid methodology developed for incompressible flows. A density-based mixed-unstructured grid algorithm for compressible flows was also used, with extensions to low Mach number flows made possible through a low Mach number preconditioner. The effects of turbulence were modelled using ak-e turbulence model. The absence of this model in the code made available for the unstructured algorithm necessitated its implementation as a first step in the current work. The effects of unstructured mesh type on the prediction of flows with internal mixing layers were first assessed for an incompressible planar mixing layer. This simplified case was used as a benchmark case to help understand the effects on the convoluted shear layers arising within the lobed mixer flows. To quantify the capability of a Reynolds-averaged approach in simulating the turbulent mixer flow field, two variants of the two equation k-e model were employed. The first constituted the standard linear high Reynolds number k-e model of Launder and Spalding [62]. The second model was a quadratic non-linear version developed by Speziale [99] for the prediction of secondary flows in non-circular ducts. The relative merits of these two models was assessed through detailed comparisons with experimental data taken from the literature. Of particular importance in the mixer flow was the formation and subsequent evolution of the vorticity field. Consequently, this motivated a detailed study of the evolving vorticity field. The investigations thus far were based on a simplified mixer configuration with no temperature differences between the two streams. Therefore, as a final step, a realistic scarfed mixer was modelled in an attempt to model the temperature mixing. The main contribution of the present work is the assessment of a grid-based Reynolds-averaged solution procedure for the prediction of lobed mixer flows. The study revealed that capturing the initial mixing region proved to be most difficult. Firstly, unstruc-tured meshes employing non-hexahedral elements were very inefficient at simulating the mixing layer in the early stages. Secondly, the initial mixing region presented significant difficulties for the Reynolds-averaged solution method in which neither turbulence model was capable of correctly reproducing the turbulence field. Despite this, global parameters such as momentum thickness and streamwise circulation were well captured in the predictions...|$|E
