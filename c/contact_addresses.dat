50|$|In {{addition}} to government issues, Komarov and other security firms {{warned that the}} data from this breach {{can be used to}} attempt access to other accounts, since it included backup email <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> and security questions.

Hold Security, another cybersecurity firm, observed that some darkweb sellers were still selling this database for up to $200,000 as late as October 2016; Komarov found that the data continues to be available at a much lower price since the passwords have been forced changed, but the data can still be valuable for phishing attacks and gaining access to other accounts.|$|E
50|$|In September 1994, Deutsche Welle was {{the first}} public {{broadcaster}} in Germany with a World Wide Web presence, initially www-dw.gmd.de, hosted by the GMD Information Technology Research Center. For its first two years, the site listed little more than <b>contact</b> <b>addresses,</b> although DW's News Journal was broadcast in RealAudio from Real's server beginning in 1995, and Süddeutsche Zeitung's initial web presence, which included news articles from the newspaper, shared the site. Around 1998, it evolved into a news website using the URL dwelle.de; in 2001, the URL changed to www.dw-world.de, and was changed again in 2012, to www.dw.de. Deutsche Welle purchased the domain dw.com, which previously belonged to DiamondWare, in 2013; DW had attempted to claim ownership of the address in 2000, without success. DW eventually moved to the www.dw.com domain on 22 June 2015.|$|E

5000|$|The {{series was}} {{intended}} to provide an outlet {{for any kind of}} music from any country in the world. Most artists who appeared were not signed to a record label, but had released their music privately on cassettes sold via mail, and these were often the source of the material that appeared on the compilations. All volumes came with a list of <b>contact</b> <b>addresses,</b> with the exception of artists from [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] or Soviet Union countries whose addresses were not published, to protect them from government persecution, as the [...] "importation" [...] of Western culture and influences, and communication with artists outside the Soviet Union, without government approval were generally illegal. In those cases, a contact address for an associate outside of the Soviet Union was provided. As stated on the inserts, [...] "All bands and individuals featured on I.S.C. comps have more music available, so get in touch now!" [...] A slogan, [...] "Communicate to Create" [...] often appeared.|$|E
5000|$|The Free Evangelical Fellowship (Norwegian: [...] De Frie Evangeliske Forsamlinger, DFEF), {{formerly}} called [...] "The Free Friends" [...] (De frie venner) {{is one of}} the Free Church congregations in Norway. The Free Evangelical Fellowship is {{a nationwide}} movement with sixty seven parishes and <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> in Norway. The churches are legally independent. It is estimated that the local churches comprise a total of 8,000-10,000 members. Churches are mainly in the south and west of the country. Its origins date from the 1880s, but it became an established organization after 1900 under the leadership of preacher Erik A. Nordquelle (1858-1938). Its [...] "Home and Mission Committee" [...] is a joint mission conducted in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. The Free Evangelical Fellowship believe in baptism of the Holy Spirit through speaking in tongues and healing by prayer. They also practice baptism and Holy communion (open to non-members). The movement's theological standing is seen as near Pentecostal, but they had historically separated themselves out to be opponents of the member registers. The Free Evangelical Fellowship is therefore not registered as a separate religious branch in Norway.|$|E
50|$|While many {{systems are}} {{in place by the}} card {{provider}} to identify fraud, the card holder is left with the ultimate responsibility. Preemptive steps to reduce chances of fraud include installing anti-virus software, keeping and maintaining current records, and reviewing statements and charges regularly. The objective is to provide a first defense in spotting fraudulent charges. Exercising caution on online sites, especially suspicious or non-established sites, as well as in foreign countries is also advisable. The legitimacy of websites should be verified. Checking with the Better Business Bureau is a first step to see how that company has established themselves. Once on a website, the user can check what security or encryption software the website utilizes. A padlock {{to the left of the}} URL, can sometimes be found to signify additional security is being implemented. A physical address for the company, or sending an email to one of the <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> can further verify the reliability of the company. Even on trusted sites, it is important to be diligent that one has not navigated away from that site. Other safe practices include being cautious of account number distribution, keeping credit cards separate from a wallet or purse, keeping constant sight of credit cards, and never signing receipts with blank spaces above the total. On accounts in which one has saved card information, it is important to have a strong password with a mix of numbers and symbols. Using different passwords for different sites, is also strongly encouraged.|$|E

40|$|In Globe, a {{distributed}} shared object provides {{one or more}} <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> to {{processes that}} want to bind to the object. <b>Contact</b> <b>addresses</b> are maintained by the Globe location service, and specify where and how an object can be contacted. As such, a contact address is location dependent. Whenever a process wants to bind to an object, it provides the location service with a globally unique, and location-independent object handle. The location service is capable of returning addresses that are nearest to the process that requested them. In this report, we describe the basic architecture and the algorithmic design of the Globe location service. We concentrate on the algorithms for updating the set of <b>contact</b> <b>addresses,</b> i. e., basic algorithms for inserting and deleting <b>contact</b> <b>addresses.</b> The algorithms are basic {{in the sense that}} they do not take optimizations into account. With respect to fault-tolerant behavior, the algorithms discussed in this report can handle failures caused by network partitions, but cannot recover the service from node crashes. vrije Universitei...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present ad hoc {{distributed}} servers, {{which are}} groups of unreliable nodes scattered over a wide-area network that cooperate {{to create the}} illusion of being a single reliable server. Maintaining such an illusion requires an ad hoc distributed server to provide stable <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> and enable its member nodes to transparently handoff client requests among each other. We propose to implement stable <b>contact</b> <b>addresses</b> and wide-area client handoffs using Mobile IPv 6. We demonstrate that the overhead due to contacting the server via its stable contact address can be estimated as the latency between the server’s member nodes. The client-perceived handoff time is also shown to be a linear function of the latencies between the client and the member nodes participating in the handoff...|$|E
