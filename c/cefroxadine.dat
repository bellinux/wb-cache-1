50|$|<b>Cefroxadine</b> (INN, {{trade names}} Oraspor and Cefthan-DS) is a {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic. It is structurally related to cefalexin, and both drugs share a similar spectrum of activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefroxadine</b> can be {{prepared}} by several routes, including {{one in which the}} enol is methylated with diazomethane as a key step. A rather more involved route starts with compatively readily available phenoxymethylpenicillin sulfoxide benzhydryl ester (1).This undergoes fragmentation when treated with benzothiazole-2-thiol to give 2. Ozonolysis (reductive work-up) cleaves the olefinic linkage and the unsymmetrical disulfide moiety is converted to a tosyl thioester (3). The enol moiety is methylated with diazomethane, the six-membered ring is closed by reaction with 1,5-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-5-ene (DBU), and the ester protection is removed with trifluoroacetic acid to give 4. The amide side chain is removed by the usual PCl5/dimethylaniline sequence followed by reamidation with the appropriate acid chloride to give <b>cefroxadine</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|Thirteen oral cephems (cefprozil, loracarbef, cefaclor, {{cefuroxime}} axetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefetamet pivoxil, cefixime, cefdinir, cefadroxil, cephradine, cephalexin, cefatrizine, and <b>cefroxadine),</b> the cephalosporin {{class representative}} cephalothin, cefazolin, and the macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were compared for their antibacterial activities against 790 recent clinical isolates. These oral agents differed in their spectra and antibacterial potencies against community-acquired pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Cephalosporins are antibiotics widely {{used to treat}} infections in the skin, soft tissues, and respiratory and urinary tracts. Aplastic anemia (AA) has not previously been reported in patients treated with cephalosporins. We describe here a 50 year-old woman who experienced AA after treatment with <b>cefroxadine.</b> In November 2009, a 50 -year-old woman was referred to our medical center for further treatment of AA. In October 2009, the patient had received a 3 -day course of <b>cefroxadine,</b> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antihistamines to treat symptoms of a common cold. The symptoms were relieved, but 1 week after treatment she developed a fever and sore throat. The patient visited a primary clinic, where a blood examination showed evidence of neutropenia. The patient had taken no other medications in the 6 {{months prior to the}} illness and had no underlying disease. Physical examination showed oropharyngeal injection and soft palate swelling. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level was 9. 9 g/dL, WBC count was 300 /mm 3, with 3. 1 % neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count 10 /mm 3), and platelet count was 34, 000 /mm 3. A marrow aspirate revealed severe hypoplasia, with almost complete disappearance of cells of the granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages, and few cells of the erythroid lineage. A marrow biopsy showed severe AA (15 % cellularity), affecting all hematopoietic lineages (Fig. 1). She was treated supportively with broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefroxadine</b> (GCP- 9000; CXD), 7 beta[D- 2 -amino- 2 -(1, 4 -cyclohexadienyl) -acetamido]- 3 -methoxy-ceph- 3 -em-carboxylic acid, {{is a new}} orally active {{cephalosporin}} derivative. The {{spectrum of}} antibacterial activity of CXD is identical with that of cephalexin (CEX), but CXD was twofold more effective than CEX against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, CXD was as stable to penicillinase as CEX, but it was hydrolyzed by cephalosporinase, with a relative rate of hydrolysis {{similar to that of}} CEX. The affinities of CXD and CEX to penicillin-binding proteins of E. coli were estimated; the affinity of CXD to penicillin-binding protein 1 Bs was higher than that of CEX. Consistent with this, CXD had more intensive lytic activity than CEX. In vivo antibacterial activities of CXD and CEX were compared using systemic infections of mice with E. coli and K. pneumoniae; CXD was consistently more active than CEX...|$|E
