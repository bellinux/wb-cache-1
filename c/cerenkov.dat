25|$|The first {{proposal}} {{concerning the}} effect of space radiation on the CNS was made by Cornelius Tobias in his 1952 description of light flash phenomenon caused by single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina. Light flashes, such as those described by Tobias, were observed by the astronauts during the early Apollo missions {{as well as in}} dedicated experiments that were subsequently performed on Apollo and Skylab missions. More recently, studies of light flashes were made on the Russian Mir space station and the ISS. A 1973 report by the NAS considered these effects in detail. This phenomenon, which is known as a Phosphene, is the visual perception of flickering light. It is considered a subjective sensation of light since it can be caused by simply applying pressure on the eyeball. The traversal of a single, highly charged particle through the occipital cortex or the retina was estimated to be able to cause a light flash. Possible mechanisms for HZE-induced light flashes include direction ionization and <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation within the retina.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{realized}} that a large water <b>Čerenkov</b> detector could be an ideal neutrino detector, for several reasons. First, the enormous volume possible in a water <b>Čerenkov</b> detector can overcome {{the problem of the}} very small cross section of the 5-15 MeV solar neutrinos. Second, water <b>Čerenkov</b> detectors offer real time event detection. This meant that Individual neutrino-electron interaction candidate events could be studied on an event-by-event basis, starkly different from the month-to-month observation required in radiochemical experiments. Third, in the neutrino-electron scattering interaction the electron recoils in roughly the direction that the neutrino was travelling (similar to the motion of billiard balls), so the electrons [...] "point back" [...] to the sun. Fourth, neutrino-electron scattering is an elastic process, so the energy distribution of the neutrinos can be studied, further testing the solar model. Fifth, the characteristic [...] "ring" [...] produced by <b>Čerenkov</b> radiation allows discrimination of the signal against backgrounds. Finally, since a water <b>Čerenkov</b> experiment would use a different target, interaction process, detector technology, and location {{it would be a very}} complementary test of Davis's results.|$|E

50|$|The CLEO III upgrade {{included}} {{the addition of}} the RICH subdetector, a dedicated particle identification subdetector. The RICH detector was required to be less than 20 cm in the radial direction, between the drift chamber and the calorimeter, and less than 12% of a radiation length. The RICH detector used the <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation of charged particles to measure their velocity. Combined with the momentum measurement from the tracking detectors, the mass of the particle, and therefore its identity, could be determined. Charged particles produced <b>Cerenkov</b> light as they pass through a LiF window. Fourteen rings of thirty LiF crystals comprised the radiator of the RICH, and the four centermost rings had a sawtooth pattern to prevent total internal reflection of the <b>Cerenkov</b> photons. The photons traveled through a nitrogen expansion volume, which allowed the cone angle to be precisely determined. The photons were detected by 7.5 mm × 8.0 mm cathode pads in a multi-wire chamber containing a methane-triethylamine gas mixture.|$|E

50|$|The outer {{portion of}} the CLEO {{detector}} was divided into independent octants that were primarily dedicated to charged particle identification. No clear consensus was reached on the choice of technology for particle identification, therefore two octants were equipped with dE/dx ionization chambers, two octants were equipped with high pressure gas <b>Cerenkov</b> detectors, and four octants were equipped with low pressure gas <b>Cerenkov</b> detectors. The dE/dx system demonstrated superior particle identification performance and aided in tracking, therefore in September 1981 all eight octants were equipped with dE/dx chambers. The dE/dx chambers measured the ionization of charged particles as they passed through a multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC). Each dE/dx octant was made with 124 separate modules, and each module contained 117 wires. Groups of ten modules were ganged together to minimize the number of readout channels. The first two and last two modules were not instrumented, therefore each octant had twelve cells.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the HEAO C-3 {{experiment}} was to measure the charge spectrum of cosmic-ray nuclei over the nuclear charge (Z) range from 17 to 120, in the energy interval 0.3 to 10 GeV/nucleon; to characterize cosmic ray sources; processes of nucleosynthesis, and propagation modes. The detector consisted of a double-ended instrument of upper and lower hodoscopes and three dual-gap ion chambers. The two ends were separated by a <b>Cerenkov</b> radiater. The geometrical factor was 4 sq cm-sr. The ion chambers could resolve charge to 0.24 charge units at low energy and 0.39 charge units at high energy and high Z. The <b>Cerenkov</b> counter could resolve 0.3 to 0.4 charge units. Binns et al. give more details.The experiment was proposed and managed by the Space Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), {{under the direction of}} Principal Investigator Prof. Edward C.

5000|$|The {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem was finally experimentally determined by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The radiochemical experiments were only sensitive to electron neutrinos, and the signal in the water <b>Cerenkov</b> experiments was dominated by the electron neutrino signal. The SNO experiment, by contrast, had sensitivity to all three neutrino flavours. By simultaneously measuring the electron neutrino and total neutrino fluxes the experiment demonstrated that the suppression {{was due to the}} MSW effect, the conversion of electron neutrinos from their pure flavour state into the second neutrino mass eigenstate as they passed through a resonance due to the changing density of the Sun. The resonance is energy dependent, and [...] "turns on" [...] near 2MeV. The water <b>Cerenkov</b> detectors only detect neutrinos above about 5MeV, while the radiochemical experiments were sensitive to lower energy (0.8MeV for chlorine, 0.2MeV for gallium), and {{this turned out to be}} the source of the difference in the observed neutrino rates at the two types of experiments.|$|E

50|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} measure precisely the momentum of charged particles emerging from high energy hadron interactions and identify these particles over a large range of momenta. Experimental setup consists of two large spectrometer magnets, 48 planes of drift chambers arranged in several arms and 4 multicell threshold <b>Cerenkov</b> counters.

50|$|The {{first of}} the Kamioka {{experiments}} was named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment. It was a large water <b>Čerenkov</b> detector designed to search for proton decay. To observe the decay of a particle with a lifetime {{as long as a}} proton an experiment must run {{for a long time and}} observe an enormous number of protons. This can be done most cost effectively if the target (the source of the protons) and the detector itself are made of the same material. Water is an ideal candidate because it is inexpensive, easy to purify, stable, and can detect relativistic charged particles through their production of <b>Čerenkov</b> radiation. A proton decay detector must be buried deep underground or in a mountain because the background from cosmic ray muons in such a large detector located on the surface of the Earth would be far too large. The muon rate in the KamiokaNDE experiment was about 0.4 events per second, roughly five orders of magnitude smaller than what it would have been if the detector had been located at the surface.|$|E

50|$|In 1949 John Gatenby Bolton, Bruce Slee and Gordon Stanley {{localize}} NGC 5128 {{as one of}} {{the first}} extragalactical radio sources. Five years later, Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski suggested that the peculiar structure is the result of a merge event of a giant elliptical galaxy and a small spiral galaxy. The first detection of X-ray emissions, using a sounding rocket, was performed in 1970. In 1975-76 gamma-ray emissions from Centaurus A were observed through the atmospheric <b>Cerenkov</b> technique.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescope}} {{is named after}} the Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov, who predicted that charged particles moving at high speeds in a medium emit light. The high-energy gamma rays emitted from black holes, centers of galaxies and pulsars do not reach the land as they get absorbed in the atmosphere. Upon interaction with the atmosphere, these photons produce electron-positron pairs, leading to a cascade of particles which while moving at very high speed give rise to <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation.|$|E
50|$|IACT {{stands for}} Imaging Atmospheric (or Air) Cherenkov Telescope or Technique. It is a device or method to detect very-high-energy gamma-ray photons, in the photon energy range of 50 GeV to 50 TeV. There are {{currently}} three operating IACT systems: H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS. Set {{to be the}} world's largest telescope at the highest altitude, the Major Atmospheric <b>Cerenkov</b> Experiment Telescope (MACE) is currently being established at Hanle, Ladakh, India. Also, currently under design is the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).|$|E
50|$|The {{distinct}} pattern {{produced by}} <b>Čerenkov</b> radiation allows for particle identification, {{an important tool}} both understanding the potential proton decay signal and for rejecting backgrounds. The ID is possible because the {{sharpness of the edge}} of the ring depends on the particle producing the radiation. Electrons (and therefore also gamma rays) produce fuzzy rings due to the multiple scattering of the low mass electrons. Minimum ionizing muons, in contrast produce very sharp rings as their heavier mass allows them to propagate directly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{supernova}} {{was discovered}} by Charles Kowal, about 56 arc seconds west and 85 arc seconds south {{of the center of}} NGC 5253. [...] The position in the periphery of the galaxy aided observation, minimizing interference by background objects. [...] Well-positioned for Southern Hemisphere observers, it was quite observable from Northern Hemisphere observatories as well. Attempts made to observe it in X-rays with UHURU and OSO-7 and to detect gamma rays from it via <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation showers gave at best equivocal results.|$|E
5000|$|IMB {{consisted}} of a roughly cubical tank about 17 &times; 17.5 &times; 23 meters, filled with 2.5 million gallons of ultrapure water which was surrounded by 2,048 photomultiplier tubes. [...] IMB detected fast-moving particles such as those produced by proton decay or neutrino interactions by picking up the <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation generated when such a particle moves faster {{than the speed of}} light in water. Since directional information was available from the phototubes, IMB was able to estimate the initial direction of neutrinos.|$|E
50|$|Radio Ice <b>Cerenkov</b> Experiment (RICE) is an {{experiment}} designed {{to detect the}} Cherenkov emission in the radio regime {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} from the interaction of high energy neutrinos (greater than 1 PeV) with the Antarctic ice cap. The goals of this experiment are to determine the potential of the radio-detection technique for measuring the high energy cosmic neutrino flux, determining the sources of this flux, and measuring neutrino-nucleon cross sections at energies above those accessible with existing accelerators. Such {{an experiment}} also has sensitivity to neutrinos from gamma ray bursts, as well as highly ionizing charged particles (monopoles, e.g.) traversing the Antarctic icecap.|$|E
50|$|The Gamma-1 {{telescope}} {{was the main}} telescope. It consisted of 2 scintillation counters and a gas <b>Cerenkov</b> counter. With an effective area of around 0.2 m2, it operated in the energy range of 50 MeV to 6 GeV. At 100 MeV it initially had an angular resolution of 1.5 degrees, with a field of view of 5 degrees and an energy resolution of 12%. A Telezvezda star tracker increased the pointing position accuracy of the Gamma-1 telescope to 2 arcminutes by tracking stars up to an apparent magnitude of 5 within its 6 by 6 degree field of view. However, due {{to the failure of}} power to a spark chamber, for most of the mission the resolution was around 10 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The HEAO C-2 {{experiment}} {{measured the}} relative {{composition of the}} isotopes of the primary cosmic rays between beryllium and iron (Z from 4 to 26) and the elemental abundances up to tin (Z=50). <b>Cerenkov</b> counters and hodoscopes, together with the Earth's magnetic field, formed a spectrometer. They determined charge and mass of cosmic rays to a precision of 10% for the most abundant elements over the momentum range from 2 to 25 GeV/c (c=speed of light). Scientific direction was by Principal Investigators Prof. Bernard Peters and Dr. Lyoie Koch-Miramond. The primary data base has been archived at the Centre Etudes Nuclearires de Saclay and the Danish Space Research Institute. Information on the data products is given by Engelman et al. 1985.|$|E
50|$|The nonradiation {{condition}} went {{largely ignored}} for many years. Philip Pearle reviews {{the subject in}} his 1982 article Classical Electron Models. A Reed College undergraduate thesis on nonradiation in infinite planes and solenoids appears in 1984. An important advance occurred in 1986, when Hermann Haus derived Goedeke’s condition in a new way. Haus finds that all radiation is caused by Fourier components of the charge/current distribution that are lightlike (i.e. components that are synchronous with light speed). When a distribution has no lightlike Fourier components, such as a point charge in uniform motion, {{then there is no}} radiation. Haus uses his formulation to explain <b>Cerenkov</b> radiation in which the speed of light of the surrounding medium is less than c.|$|E
