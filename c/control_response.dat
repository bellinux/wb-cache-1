5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability <b>control</b> <b>response</b> to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new <b>control</b> <b>response</b> simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E

40|$|Present {{study focused}} on the active {{behavior}} as a <b>controlling</b> <b>response</b> of self-control in everyday life. In survey 1, ninety-two undergraduates reported to open questions that they hoped to control the following six target (<b>controlled)</b> <b>responses</b> : academic performance, money savings, human relations, beauty and health, extracurricular activities, and life as a whole. In survey 2, eighty-nine undergraduates were asked {{what they would do}} or would not do for target responses as acquiring course credits, health maintenance, getting up early, and so on. In both surveys, the students reported not only active responses, but also repressive <b>responses</b> as <b>controlling</b> <b>responses</b> of each targets, although they reported active responses more than repressive responses. The ratio of active response number to repressive response number varied across targets. The present results suggest that not only repressive behaviors but also active ones should be examined and utilized as a <b>controlling</b> <b>response</b> for the cost-effective establishment of self-control...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential regulatory effects of various coping strategies on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It first divided PTSD symptoms and selected coping strategies into cognitive, social/motivational, and emotional types. The study then conceptualized each of the preceding types of coping strategies as being <b>controlled</b> stress <b>responses</b> and the PTSD symptoms as being semiautomatic stress responses. It lastly proposed that coping strategies be further divided into activating <b>controlled</b> stress <b>response</b> and deactivating <b>controlled</b> stress <b>response.</b> <b>Controlled</b> stress <b>responses</b> are coping strategies that are consciously initiated and implemented. Semiautomatic stress responses are PTSD symptoms that spontaneously emerge without conscious intent. Activating <b>controlled</b> stress <b>responses</b> consisted of the following coping strategies: seeking understanding, avoidant actions, and expressing feelings. Deactivating <b>controlled</b> stress <b>responses</b> encompassed: positive cognitive restructuring, emotion-focused support, and physical release of emotions. Semiautomatic stress responses entailed: reexperiencing, numbing, and arousal symptoms. It was proposed that cognitive, social/motivational, and emotional activating <b>controlled</b> stress <b>responses</b> would increas...|$|R

After devising the squeeze mode ER mount, its field-dependent damping forces are evaluated at various exciting frequencies. The ER mounts are then incorporated with a flexible beam structure.

25|$|Several {{technology}} {{research and}} development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger <b>control</b> <b>response),</b> complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These {{may be used in}} many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces.

The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight <b>control</b> <b>response</b> in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was completed}} in early 1928 and made its first flight on 21 February. Its manufacturer's trials were finished by 10 March and the state acceptance trials by 14 April. The pilots of the NII VVS ( [...] – Air Force Scientific Test Institute) criticized the lack of directional stability at high speeds and a slight problem in <b>control</b> <b>response</b> between maneuvers. The area of the vertical tail was increased and the elevators were given horn balances to alleviate the first problem while split ailerons addressed the second problem. Since production had begun before the aircraft was actually approved for service use, the first forty aircraft were completed with the smaller tailplane. A second prototype {{was completed in}} August 1928 and tested a different propeller optimized for high speed which increased the top speed to , although it lengthened the take-off run. The first 39 aircraft completed, plus the two prototypes, used imported engines, but the remainder used the license-built Mikulin M-17.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{cannabinoid}} receptors, CB 1 and CB 2, in immune {{competence and}} modulation by Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC) {{was investigated in}} CB 1 −/−/CB 2 −/− mice. Immunofluorescence analysis of splenic leukocytes showed {{no significant differences in}} the percentage of T cell subsets, B cells, or macrophages between wild-type and CB 1 −/−/CB 2 −/− mice. Lymphoproliferative <b>control</b> <b>responses</b> to PHA, phorbol ester plus ionomycin, or LPS and sensitivity to suppression by Δ 9 -THC showed no profound differences between the two genotypes, although some differences were observed in <b>control</b> baseline <b>responses.</b> Likewise, similar <b>control</b> <b>responses</b> and sensitivity to Δ 9 -THC were observed in mixed lymphocyte responses (MLR) and in IL- 2 and IFN-γ production in both genotypes. Conversely, humoral immune responses showed a markedly different profile of activity. Δ 9 -THC suppressed the in vivo T cell-dependent, anti-sheep RBC (anti-sRBC) IgM antibody-forming cell (AFC) response in wild-type but not in CB 1 −/−/CB 2 −/− mice, and the in vitro anti-sRBC IgM response in CB 1 −/−/CB 2 −/− splenocytes was too low to rigorously assess CB 1 /CB 2 involvement in modulation by Δ 9 -THC. Conversely, comparable in vitro IgM AFC <b>control</b> <b>responses</b> to LPS and CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L) activation were observed in the two genotypes. Interestingly, LPS-induced IgM responses were refractory to suppression by Δ 9 -THC, regardless of genotype, and CD 40 L-induced IgM responses were only suppressed by Δ 9 -THC in wild-type but not in CB 1 −/−/CB 2 −/− B cells. Collectively, we demonstrate differential involvement of CB 1 and/or CB 2 in immune modulation by Δ 9 -THC and in some <b>control</b> <b>responses.</b> Moreover, CB 1 /CB 2 involvement was observed in humoral responses requiring CD 40 -initiated signaling for suppression by Δ 9 -THC...|$|R

500|$|In {{a review}} of the Virtual Console release, Lucas M. Thomas of IGN praised KOF '94 for its graphics, {{including}} fluid animation and vibrant colors, but concluded that buyers might be better off waiting for the improved sequels to arrive on the Virtual Console. According to IGN's Jeremy Dunham, the game [...] "was essentially a cross between Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting," [...] with a faster <b>control</b> <b>response.</b> He added commented that the creation of three-on-three battles was an advanced feature for a game from 1994 and the idea of 'borrowing' characters from other games from the company was also innovative. Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer identified the use of characters from multiple franchises and the Team Battle Mode as the most distinctive points. He concluded the game to be [...] "a solid, technical fighting game that, like most SNK outings, skews more towards the hardcore player than the casual punching aficionado." [...] According to Kyle Knight of Allgame, the graphics and sounds, while better than most games of the time, were subpar by SNK standards. He concluded The King of Fighters '94 is [...] "a very good fighting game, but it lacks some refinements that would have made it great." ...|$|E

The modified D.Va was [...] {{heavier than the}} D.III but the structural problems were not entirely cured. Use of the high-compression 130kW (180hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü engine offset the increased weight of the D.Va. The D.Va also reverted to the D.III aileron cable linkage, running outwards through the lower wing, then upwards to the ailerons {{to provide a more}} positive <b>control</b> <b>response.</b> The wings of the D.III and D.Va were interchangeable. To further strengthen the wing, the D.Va added a small diagonal brace connecting the forward interplane strut to {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing; the brace was also retrofitted to some D.Vs.|$|E
2500|$|By March 1936, a {{total of}} ten flying hours had been {{performed}} by the prototype, covering all major portions of the flight envelope; early flight testing had gone reasonably well, {{especially in light of}} the trial status of the Merlin engine, which had itself yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine. In early 1936, the prototype was transferred to RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader D. F. Anderson. Sammy Wroath, later to be the founding Commandant of the Empire Test Pilot School, was the RAF test pilot for the Hurricane: his report was favorable, stating that: [...] "The aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices" [...] and proceeded to praise its <b>control</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

It was reported as having a heavy <b>control</b> <b>response</b> and poor visibility, although it did fly high and fast. The name also could have caused problems, since Cavalier Aircraft had been modifying surplus North American P-51 Mustangs for civilian use and {{wrote a letter to}} Mooney asking them not to use the name [...] "Mustang".

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new control-on-request (COR) method that improves {{the capability of}} existing shared control interfaces. These COR enhanced interfaces allow users to request on-demand bursts of assistive computer control authority when manual / shared control tasks become too challenging. To enable the approach, we {{take advantage of the}} short duration of the desired <b>control</b> <b>responses</b> to derive an algebraic solution for the optimal switching control for differ-entiable nonlinear systems. These solutions minimize control authority while generating immediate and optimal degrees of improvement in system trajectories. The technique avoids the iterative constrained optimization required to derive traditional finite horizon optimal switching control solutions for nonlinear system and allows optimal <b>control</b> <b>responses</b> on time-frames otherwise infeasible. An interactive example illustrates how users can use COR interfaces to request real-time bursts of control assistance to help stabilize an unstable system. I...|$|R

50|$|Even so, {{the flight}} {{characteristics}} were not totally satisfactory. The aircraft {{was characterized by}} good ground handling, good takeoff and landing, but the pilot’s cockpit was set too low in the fuselage and at an excessive height from the ground, so the visibility was not good.

40|$|To design {{controllers}} {{for complex}} non-linear systems usually {{involves the use}} of expensive computational models. A non-linear thermodynamic model of a gas turbine engine is used to evaluate a selection of designs for a multivariable PI controller configuration. An approach using variable complexity modelling (VCM) is introduced to allow more designs to be evaluated and also to speed up the design process. Response surface methodology (RSM) is a statistical technique in which smooth functions are used to model an objective function. RSM employs statistical methods to create functions, typically polynomials, to model the response or outcome of a numerical experiment in terms of several independent variables.
