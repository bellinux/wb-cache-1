25|$|Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can {{be covered}} with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from sheet material. They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall <b>claddings</b> are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat lock panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat lock panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reveals the}} {{mechanism}} of cracking in the "aerated concrete masonry - plaster coating" system, which causes the reduction of <b>cladding’s</b> durability. The temperature deformations in the structure are analyzed. On this basis the theoretical background to optimize the composition and technological parameters of the plaster was developed. The composition of plaster mixtures based on the expanded clay, carbonate, perlite and other fillers was also developed. The proposition that targeted modification of plaster can ensure optimal operation of the "laying-plaster" system is experimentally confirmed...|$|R
50|$|A Texlon ETFE cushion {{typically}} {{consists of}} two layers, although more layers {{can be added to}} enhance the <b>cladding's</b> insulation properties. Each layer can be modified with a variety of treatments to alter its aesthetic quality, its apparent transparency, and the level of solar gain. The material's innate toughness, resistance to tearing, and ability to work harden over a 300-400% elongation range allow Texlon to endure significant deformation of its support structure. This has allowed the development of unique lightweight structures such as uniaxial cable nets and large scale geodesics.|$|R
50|$|The fuel {{cladding}} material was magnesium-zirconium alloy in the UNGG, {{as opposed to}} magnesium-aluminium in Magnox. As both <b>claddings</b> react with water, they {{can be stored in}} a spent fuel pool for short times only, making short-term reprocessing of the fuel essential, and requiring heavily shielded facilities for this.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} {{fuel level}} sensor using a side-emitting optical fiber is introduced in this paper. This sensor operates on the modulation of the light intensity in fiber, which {{is caused by the}} <b>cladding’s</b> acceptance angle change when it is immersed in fuel. The fiber is bent as a spiral shape to increase the sensor’s sensitivity by increasing the attenuation coefficient and fiber’s submerged length compared to liquid level. The attenuation coefficients of fiber with different bent radiuses in the air and water are acquired through experiments. The fiber is designed as a spiral shape with a steadily changing slope, and its response to water level is simulated. The experimental results taken in water and aviation kerosene demonstrate a performance of 0. 9 [*]m range and 10 [*]mm resolution...|$|R
30|$|Iodine-induced {{stress-corrosion}} cracking (ISCC), a known failure mode for nuclear fuel cladding, occurs when iodine generated during the irradiation {{of a nuclear}} fuel pellet escapes the pellet through diffusion or thermal cracking and chemically interacts with the inner surface of the clad material, inducing a subsequent effect on the <b>cladding’s</b> resistance to mechanical stress. To complement experimental investigations of ISCC, a reactive force field (ReaxFF) compatible with the Zr-I chemical and materials systems has been developed and applied to simulate the impact of iodine exposure on the mechanical strength of the material. We show that the material’s resistance to stress (as captured by the yield stress of a high-energy grain boundary) {{is related to the}} surface coverage of iodine, with the implication that ISCC is the result of adsorption-enhanced decohesion.|$|R
50|$|The system {{utilised}} prefabricated {{light gauge}} steel frames which could be built economically up {{to a maximum of}} 4 storeys.

50|$|Bio-sensor: Chemical {{modification}} of the channel wall changes its interaction with passing particles. Different wall <b>claddings</b> bind to specific molecules and delay their passage. In this sense, the wall recognizes the passing particle. As an example, DNA fragments are selectively bound by their complementary fragments. The attached molecules reduce the channel volume. The induced resistance change reflects the molecule's concentration.|$|E

5000|$|In {{many cases}} <b>claddings</b> {{were not used}} within their {{specifications}} or not installed correctly. Many buildings built in the [...] "Mediterranean" [...] style used these types of cladding and had features such as recessed windows, flat roofs, minimal eaves, multiple stories, complex roofs, solid balustrades, balconies and penetrations of the exterior cladding that increased the likelihood of water infiltrating the structure.|$|E
50|$|Owen Luder's designs {{included}} {{some of the}} most powerful and raw examples of Brutalist architecture, with massive bare concrete sculptural forms devoid of <b>claddings</b> or decoration - other than their inherent shapes. The British climate, with abundant rain and damp winters, is unkind to such unclad concrete buildings which rapidly become a shabby grey-brown colour and streaked with marks where rainwater has run down the façades. Poor maintenance has often exacerbated these problems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{previous}} {{school building}} {{was designed by}} John Bancroft of the Greater London Council's architecture department and was built in 1967-70. It was a noted example of brutalist architecture, constructed of concrete and glass without decorative <b>claddings</b> or ornament, and its appearance had been controversial since it opened. A contemporary critic likened it to a battleship, describing it as a [...] "100-odd metre long, turreted, metallic grey thing lying in its own sunken rectangle".|$|E
50|$|In neo-eclectic {{architecture}} {{the revival}} elements {{are almost always}} decorative, consisting of surface elements such as <b>claddings</b> and windows. The basic construction of neo-eclectic houses is unchanged from previous house styles such as the ranch-style house. An important development leading to the modern neo-eclectic style is the popularity of EIFS, a form of external insulation that is easy to apply and can be coloured and shaped to appear like an array of different materials such as stucco and stone.|$|E
50|$|There was {{a longstanding}} {{belief that the}} red {{limestone}} used in the 1950 redesign of the station consisted of re-used <b>claddings</b> from the interior of Adolf Hitler's Reich Chancellery, which had been standing close to the station. According to the East Berlin newspapers Neues Deutschland and Berliner Zeitung from 19 August 1950, however, the marble for the newly renovated station was delivered directly from quarries in Thuringia. In more recent times, petrographic research confirmed this origin of the material.|$|E
50|$|Moca Cream {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{limestone}} stones in the world, mainly because of its vein and color that giving it a very elegant look. This stone is mainly used in exterior and interior <b>claddings,</b> coverings, and walls. The ease of choosing grain frequency increases the variety of uses and combinations. The uses in stonework for interior decoration and masonry are popular too. Moca Cream is also used in flooring, fireplaces, bathtubs, balusters and columns, garden decoration and many others.|$|E

Many classes of laser designs could benefit from nanomaterial-based laser structures such as amplifies with built-in edge <b>claddings.</b> Nanomaterials could also provide more robust and compact designs for high-peak power, fusion-class lasers for stockpile stewardship, as well as high-average-power lasers for global theater ICBM missile defense systems (e.g. Strategic Defense Initiative SDI, or more recently the Missile Defense Agency.|$|E
50|$|Moleanos {{is a very}} {{versatile}} stone, it {{has many}} uses. Due to the properties of this stone, with enormous hardness for a limestone and with a uniform beige color, it allows a beautiful look wherever applied. This stone is very used in exterior and interior floors with moderate or intense use. It is also very popular in external and internal <b>claddings,</b> mainly due to its resistance. Other uses like fireplaces, street chairs, bathtubs, balusters and columns, window and door frames, garden decoration and fountains are very popular too, {{but there are many}} others.|$|E
50|$|The sizing and {{placement}} of window and door openings satisfied {{the expectation of}} standardisation and simplification that had become an orthodoxy during the war years, and was also well suited to systemised building. Internal linings are very robust, consisting of a 2 in leaf of clinkerblock work, plastered on the inner face, whilst intermediate floors are of concrete on metal lath reinforcement. As a result, the houses {{give the impression of}} being extremely solidly built. The steel frame was designed to accept a number of different <b>claddings,</b> from conventional brickwork to render on a metal lath.|$|E

The mirror loss {{is due to}} photons escaping through the mirrors of the optical resonator. Waveguide losses can be due to absorption in the active, separate confinement, optical cladding materials, and metal contacts (if the <b>claddings</b> are not thick enough), or result from scattering at the ridge sidewalls. The confinement factor is that percentage of the optical energy concentrated in the cascade stages. As with other semiconductor lasers, ICLs have a tradeoff between optical loss in the waveguide and Γ.

50|$|Today, vinyl siding is {{manufactured}} by co-extrusion. Two layers of PVC are {{laid down in}} a continuous extrusion process; the top layer is weatherable and durable material, which comprises up to 25% of the siding thickness. This capstock can include about 10% titanium dioxide, depending on the color, which is a pigment and provides resistance to breakdown from UV light. Vinyl siding that is exposed to the sun will begin to fade over time. However, the fade rate is slower with vinyl than most other <b>claddings.</b> Most manufacturers offer 50 year warranties that their products will not fade much over that period of time. In the past darker colors tended to fade more than lighter ones, but advancements in technology and materials can mean {{this is no longer}} the case.|$|E
50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped <b>claddings</b> are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|E
50|$|Particularly in {{the former}} Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, but to an {{increasing}} extent elsewhere, the stations were built with splendid decorations such as marble walls, polished granite floors and mosaics—thus exposing the public to art in their everyday life, outside galleries and museums. The systems in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tashkent and Kiev are widely regarded {{as some of the}} most beautiful in the world. Several other cities such as Stockholm, Montreal, Lisbon, Naples and Los Angeles have also focused on art, which may range from decorative wall <b>claddings,</b> to large, flamboyant artistic schemes integrated with station architecture, to displays of ancient artifacts recovered during station construction. It may be possible to profit by attracting more passengers by spending relatively small amounts on grand architecture, art, cleanliness, accessibility, lighting and a feeling of safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls to}} the southern section of the house are largely clad in chamferboards, except for a small section on the western facade, which is clad in wide, vertical timber slabs. A square verandah area occupies the south-east corner of {{this section of the}} house. The windows on the eastern facade are casements, except for a fixed pane of glass separating two double doors with upper lights. Two large windows on the southern-most end of this elevation have low sills when compared with the remaining ones. They each have three sashes, which are then divided into 6 lights. The remaining casement windows each have three sashes with only single lights. On the southern facade, the three windows match those described as having comparatively low sill heights, except they feature four sashes rather than three. A wide section of the western facade steps back towards the interior of the structure, separating the chamferboard and slab <b>claddings.</b> This stepped section is clad in wide, vertical timber boards.|$|E

Chassis codes 100-105 were reserved for sedans, with 106-109 for vans, the 110-115 was for the hardtop coupé while 116-119 was for the wagon versions. The 120-series model codes were used for late series face lifted models in the Japanese market fitted with the new emissions control TTC-C motors. Engines were 1.6 and 2.0-litre SOHC units. In North America, the 20R 2.2-litre engine was used. The high-performance 2000 GT Sedan and Hardtop Coupé with 18R-G twin cam engine were only offered in Japan. The two-speed automatic was no longer offered. The face lift revised the hood and grille, and enlarged the tail lights. The station wagon featured optional wood panel body <b>claddings.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} reasons that some {{buildings}} from the 1990s were leaky. A major one was {{the increase in the}} use of cladding systems such as fibre cement sheet and EIPS (Externally Insulated Plaster System) that relied on a paint finish as the primary defence against water ingress. This system is very similar to Exterior insulation finishing system (or EIFS). Such cladding systems typically allowed for little construction or thermal movement so that fine cracks that appeared insignificant, and would have been relatively insignificant in traditional <b>claddings</b> such as weatherboard, allowed continuous ingress of moisture into the framing. [...] These causes, combined with the reduced air movement through the prevalence of sheet cladding or sheet insulating materials for the monolithic look cladding, resulted in very damp conditions which are ideal for rot. A further exacerbating factor that resulted in more significant damage from the leaks, was the change to the New Zealand Standard for Timber Treatment in 1995, allowing the use of untreated Pinus radiata timber for wall framing. As this timber has little natural resistance to rot when wet, damage occurs more quickly.|$|E
