Extensive testing identified the primary mechanism that increased the rotor vibration levels was {{high levels of}} dynamic pressure pulsations due to acoustic resonance. This presentation will identify the fundamentals of acoustic resonance and how these frequencies can {{be affected by the}} factors which define an acoustic system. An inherent characteristic of OFS <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> flow is a pulsed flow defined by pocket or lobe passing frequency occurring when the discharge gas from the rotor lobe pocket passes into the <b>discharge</b> <b>porting.</b> Oil free screw compressors can experience high levels of vibration due to acoustic resonance coupling with high dynamic pressure pulsations generated by these positive displacement machines.

40|$|LectureThe shop {{performance}} {{test of a}} hydrogen recycle gas compressor for refinery plant was conducted with the suction pressure of 50 barA based on ASME PTC- 10 Type- 2 test. During testing, a surge phenomenon was observed at a flow rate 15 % higher than the predicted surge flow. From the FFT results of the shaft vibration and the pressure pulsation at the <b>discharge</b> of the <b>compressor,</b> the peaks of sub-synchronous components were observed at two frequencies of 2 Hz and 30 Hz near surge flow. The sub-synchronous vibration at 30 Hz {{was considered to be}} caused by rotating stall, but the 2 Hz was too low to be attributable to rotating stall. As an assumption of the root cause, the acoustic characteristics of shop test loop were checked. The calculated and measured Helmholtz resonance frequency of the shop test loop was in agreement with the sub-synchronous frequency of 2 Hz. For further investigation, additional tests were carried out with a fully instrumented test loop. Many different test cases were carried out by changing the suction pressure and piping size, with and without installing a perforated plate near the compressor. The originating flow points of the surge were different in each case. The originating flow point of the surge was small when the suction pressure was high and/or the perforated plate was installed. From the investigation results, {{it was found that the}} mode of the acoustic characteristics of test loop was related with the originating flow point of surge. In case the <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> is the node of pressure pulsation, it becomes the anti-node of flow fluctuation. In this case, if the flow approaches surge, the flow fluctuation at the <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> is increased. It transmits to the compressor suction, and it would cause the surge of the compressor. In case the perforated plate was installed near the <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge,</b> the pressure pulsation at the <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> was increased. It decreased the flow fluctuation of the <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge,</b> and the surge became suppressed...|$|R
40|$|A {{primary reason}} R- 404 A {{has become the}} {{preferred}} refrigerant for commercial refrigeration {{over the last two}} decades is its low <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> temperature which provides excellent protection for compressors and significantly improves their operability and durability. However, R- 404 A with a 100 year global warming potential (GWP) of 3943 is also one of the highest GWP refrigerants in use today and has been targeted by various regulatory agencies for potential phase-down or phase-out. Several reduced GWP options have been proposed using blends of HFCs and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) that are around 1300 GWP. However, these blends have increased <b>compressor</b> <b>discharge</b> temperature and in some applications may require external compressor cooling.

Methods: After we visited numerous mushroom farms, we measured the temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> of heaters, fan capacity, and {{the locations of the}} air circulators in the farms. According to the data, most mushroom growers installed the heaters near the entrance and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> of the heaters at the third growing bed on the same height as the heaters in the entrance. The temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of heater was 26 °C, and the fan capacity was 4, 500 m 3 /hr. The air circulator was placed {{in the center of the}} mushroom farm 50 cm above the ground, and its capacity of inlet port was 1, 100 m 3 /hr and <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> 1, 600 m 3 /hr. The mushroom farm was insulated. Results: According to the analysis of the temperature distribution in the vertical plane of the entrance side, no air circulation causes the high temperature zone of 296 ~ 299 K at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of the heater to take up 34 % of area while the operation of air circulators causes it to occupy only 9 %. This means that not using air circulators leads to a concentration of high temperature at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> near the entrance. In addition, with the results of the analysis of the temperature distribution in the vertical planes of the center, no air circulation causes the temperature zone of 295 ~ 298 K at the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of the heater to take up 48 % of area while the operation of air circulators causes it to occupy 80 %. This shows that the high outlet port temperature disseminated to the center. Conclusions: After ninety minute operation of both heater and ai...|$|R

40|$|A new {{disposal}} unit, {{designated as}} Saltstone Disposal Unit 6 (SDU 6), is being designed for support of site accelerated closure goals and salt waste projections {{identified in the}} new Liquid Waste System Plan. The unit is a cylindrical disposal cell of 375 ft in diameter and 43 ft in height, {{and it has a}} minimum 30 million gallons of capacity. SRNL was requested to evaluate the impact of an increased grout placement height on the flow patterns radially spread on the floor and to determine whether grout quality is impacted by the height. The primary goals of the work are to develop the baseline Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and to perform the evaluations for the flow patterns of grout material in SDU 6 as a function of elevation of grout <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> and grout rheology. Two transient grout models have been developed by taking a three-dimensional multiphase CFD approach to estimate the domain size of the grout materials radially spread on the facility floor and to perform the sensitivity analysis with respect to the baseline design and operating conditions such as elevation height of the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> and fresh grout properties. For the CFD modeling calculations, air-grout Volume of Fluid (VOF) method combined with Bingham plastic and time-dependent grout models were used for examining the impact of fluid spread performance for the initial baseline configurations and to evaluate the impact of grout pouring height on grout quality. The grout quality was estimated in terms of the air volume fraction for the grout layer formed on the SDU 6 floor, resulting in the change of grout density. The study results should be considered as preliminary scoping analyses since benchmarking analysis is not included in this task scope. Transient analyses with the Bingham plastic model were performed with the FLUENTTM code on the high performance parallel computing platform in SRNL. The analysis coupled with a transient grout aging model was performed by using ANSYS-CFX code in the parallel computing platform in Mercer University. Recommended operational guidance was developed assuming that local shear rates and flow patterns related to radial spread along the SDU floor {{can be used as a}} measure of grout performance and spatial dispersion affected by the grout height and viscosity. The 5 ft height baseline results show that when the 150 gpm grout flow with a 5 Pa yield stress and a 60 cp viscosity is poured down through a 3 inch <b>discharge</b> <b>port,</b> the grout is spread radially up to about 64 ft distance from the pouring center after 2 hours&#x 27; pouring time. The air volume fraction of the grout layer is about 29 % at 5 minutes&#x 27; transient time, and it is reduced by about 9 % in 2 hours&#x 27; pouring time, resulting in the grout density consisting of about 80 % grout and 20 % air volume fractions. The sensitivity results show that when the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> is located at a higher position, a larger amount of air is trapped inside the layer formed below the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> at the early transient time of less than 30 minutes because of the higher impinging momentum of the grout flow on the floor, resulting in the formation of less smooth layer. The results clearly indicate that the radial spread for the 43 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> is about 10 % faster than that of the 5 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> for the early transient period of 5 minutes. However, for the pouring time longer than half an hour, the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> height does not affect the radial distance spread on the disposal floor. When grout quality is related to grout volume fraction, the grout volume fraction for the 43 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> has lower volume fraction than the 5 ft <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> for the transient period of the first 5 minutes. However, for the pouring time longer than half an hour, the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> height does not affect the grout volume fraction for the layer accumulated on the disposal floor. A modified Bingham plastic model coupled with time-dependent viscosity behavior was developed for conducting the initial scoping calculations to assess the impact of fluid residence time on radial spreading and basic flow patterns. The results for the transient viscosity model show that when grout material becomes more viscous, the thickness of the grout layer accumulated on the floor becomes higher, but the radial distance spread on the horizontal floor becomes smaller. The early transient results for the grout density with about 32 % air volume fractions are in reasonable agreement with those of the idealized Bingham plastic model. It is recommended that the current models developed here be benchmarked against the experimental results for critical applications of the modeling results...|$|R
