5|$|With {{the release}} of the game engine's source code, the {{possibilities}} of changing the game greatly opened up, and the fan community made use of the code to update the game using recent technology. Led by Edward Gardner and Ian Warfield, the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a <b>core</b> <b>engine</b> for others to take advantage of. Using the new fan-updated engine, projects such as Beyond the Red Line, based on the new Battlestar Galactica, and The Babylon Project, based on Babylon 5, have become possible. PXO, the free Internet gaming service handling SquadWar, was initially acquired by THQ in their 2002 acquisition of Outrage Entertainment (renamed as Outrage Games). The service was continued until July 2003, when Outrage Games was dissolved and PXO terminated. The components of its website were, however, later handed over to the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project to help them create a similar service in tracking statistics and rankings.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the <b>core</b> <b>engine</b> so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

500|$|The {{engine for}} God of War III {{was from the}} first two installments. Santa Monica senior {{producer}} Steve Caterson said that the development team ported God of War IIs engine to the PlayStation 3 {{and were able to}} quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from God of War II, the <b>core</b> <b>engine</b> for God of War III was brand new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the game shipped, morphological anti-aliasing (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said [...] "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." [...] MLAA is [...] "now a popular edge-detection process that can cost-effectively remove jagged edges from each frame", which helped Santa Monica free up the processing cycle and [...] "allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways." [...] Diamand also said that [...] "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" [...] during that same time period.|$|E
500|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Cory Barlog at a God of War II launch event, {{and it was}} officially announced at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). After {{the first eight months}} of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II, respectively) became director. Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the [...] "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the [...] "level of detail [...] expected [...] so high and intricate, it [...] multiple departments." [...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment.

40|$|Abstract. SMT solvers {{are widely}} used as <b>core</b> <b>engines</b> in many applications. Therefore, {{robustness}} and correctness are essential criteria. Current testing techniques used by developers of SMT solvers do not satisfy the high demand for correct and robust solvers, as our testing experiments show. To improve this situation, we propose to complement traditional testing techniques with grammar-based blackbox fuzz testing, combined with delta-debugging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and report on critical bugs and incorrect results which we found in current state-of-the-art SMT solvers for bit-vectors and arrays. ...|$|R
