5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to <b>control</b> <b>risk.</b> A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. <b>Control</b> <b>risk</b> is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

50|$|With {{an average}} {{worldwide}} prevalence of 1/800 live births, oral clefts {{are one of}} the most common birth defects. Although over 300 malformation syndromes can include an oral cleft, non-syndromic forms represent about 70% of cases with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and roughly 50% of cases with cleft palate (CP) only. Non-syndromic oral clefts are considered ‘complex’ or ‘multifactorial’ in that both genes and environmental factors contribute to the etiology. Current research suggests that several genes are likely to <b>control</b> <b>risk,</b> as well as environmental factors such as maternal smoking.Re-sequencing studies to identify specific mutations suggest several different genes may <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> to oral clefts, and many distinct variants or mutations in apparently causal genes have been found reflecting a high degree of allelic heterogeneity. Although most of these mutations are extremely rare and often show incomplete penetrance (i.e., an unaVected parent or other relative may also carry the mutation), combined they may account for up to 5% of non-syndromic oral cleft.|$|E
