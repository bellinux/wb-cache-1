40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{indentation}} rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belt and compares the results with those for fabric reinforced conveyor belt. Due to the steel cables imbedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution between the belt and a <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll is not uniform. The fluctuating pressure {{means that a}} two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model - which is suitable {{for the analysis of}} fabric belt - cannot be readily applied to the analysis of steel cord belt. To cope with this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler.</b> The pressures determined by the finite element analysis are compared with experimental results found with the Tekscan pressure measurement system, and the reaction loads are used in the two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model developed by Wheeler [2]. The results from Wheeler's model are summed to determine an overall indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo {{three dimensional analysis}} to predict the indentation rolling resistance of belt conveyors. Conventional methods used to analyse the indentation rolling resistance problem typically assume a bottom cover of uniform thickness bonded to a rigid substrate with no consideration of the carcass properties. This work aims to analyse {{the influence of the}} carcass construction and configuration for steel cord conveyor belts and predict the influence on the indentation rolling resistance. Due to the presence of steel cords embedded in the conveyor belt, the pressure distribution at the interface between the belt and a <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll is not uniform. To solve this problem, a static three dimensional finite element model was developed to determine the pressure distribution and reaction forces transmitted through the belt to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> roll. The reaction loads are then used in a two dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to determine the indentation rolling resistance for the steel cord belt. This paper investigates the influence of the conveyor belt carcass and bottom cover properties on the resulting stress distribution throughout the belt and consequently on the indentation rolling resistance. The influence of the steel cord diameter and pitch, applied load, bottom cover thickness and strain rate is investigated. A finite element method is detailed for the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the belt. A range of carcass configurations is investigated and experimental verification of the calculated stress distribution undertaken using a Tekscan™ pressure measurement system...|$|E

Precise {{determination}} of the time-to-failure for <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> allows the planning of regular conveyor system maintenance and well-timed replacement of worn conveyor garlands.

40|$|The {{following}} report {{outlines the}} research completed, methodology used and details of an Idler Management Program that support smart <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler</b> maintenance practices. Modern conveyor belts are becoming larger, faster {{and capable of}} transporting increasingly larger volumes of product as demand increases. Finding a balance between performance and reliability {{is an area that}} the mining industry has been struggling with for a long time now. High coal prices have meant that production gets preference over maintenance, this is largely due to the time taken to perform most condition monitoring practices. However, recent times have seen large fluctuations in the demand for coal and as a result many mines have had to make every penny count so to speak. Improving conveyor maintenance practices can account for large savings for any mine site. The main objective of this project was to develop idler management software that does improve conveyor maintenance practices and can assist in making significant savings for the mine. To reach this objective a staged approach was taken by first completing large amounts of research, then defining what the software should be capable of, and finally product development where many iterations of the software were tested and refined. The final product works by automating the process of analysing the data collected from condition monitoring, saving considerable time and identifying trends that would otherwise be missed...|$|E

The belt, drives/gearboxes or the conveyor rolling elements. Of which - <b>Conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> are the most numerous component on the conveyor system. It has been shown that conveyor roller failure in underground coal mines is the premier cause of fires. This presents a significant hazard to coal mine workers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{two most}} often used methods for rolling {{bearings}} condition monitoring are thermographic inspection and vibrodiagnostic. However, analysis of the relevant literature has shown that so far there is no established correlation between rolling bearings surface temperatures and measured radial vibration intensities. These variables also strongly depend on rolling bearing’s service life and it’s environmental operating conditions, especially in case of open pit coal mine <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler’s</b> rolling bearings; where high concentration of debris particles (such as surface dust, dirt and excavated coal) is present. Taking into account previously listed facts; the main goal of the presented research results was to establish statistically significant correlation between listed variables: rolling bearings surface temperatures, radial vibration intensities, service life and concentration level of debris particles in bearing grease. In order to achieve this goal, specific experimental methodology was developed and implemented. Obtained results were then processed using standardized statistical software and appropriate correlation was generated and later verified in praxis. At this moment, developed experimental methodology is applied only to open pit coal mine <b>conveyor</b> <b>idler’s</b> rolling bearings, but its principles are universal, so with minor modifications {{it could be used}} for prediction of any of listed variables for different kinds of rolling bearings, operating in different environments...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 124 - 131). Overland {{conveyor belt}} systems form {{a vital part}} of modern transportation systems in the mining and mineral processing industries. It is vital that the system is well maintained in order to minimise system downtime and maximise profit. The conveyor belt is the single most expensive item in the system. It must be monitored to pick up potential problems before they cause belt failure. The majority of conveyor belt monitoring methods identify belt failure events rather than belt failure causes. The purpose of this project was to research and design a belt condition monitoring board which could be physically embedded in the conveyor belt. This would then be used to monitor the condition of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> whose failure can result in major system damage. The venture was split into two areas of research: the design of a vibration data logging board and the design of a power generation system. The thesis focused on the design of a DSP vibration data logging prototype board, while S. A. Williams investigated the design of a power generation system...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing ball bearings service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and ball bearings dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of ball bearings also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of ball bearings thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between ball bearings temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical <b>conveyor</b> <b>idlers</b> bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for ball bearings service life testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation. That is the most important contribution of performed research - the new equation and methodology for ball bearings internal clearance determination which could be used for eventual improvement of existing bearings service life equations.

40|$|High {{incidence}} of injuries {{caused by the}} manual handling of heavy idler rollers {{is a major concern}} for the Australian mining industry. Consequently, major mining industry stakeholders called for the development of light weight idler rollers. As a result this project was designed to develop a light weight idler roller using pultruded continuous glass fibre, vinyl ester composite circular hollow section. Current literature on the subject highlighted the need for non-ferrous light weight idler rollers but offers no real solution. A rigorous test regime, including physical static and dynamic testing in conjunction with finite element analysis, was used to analyse a designed light weight composite prototype idler roller. The main empirical finding of the project was the possibility of producing shaftless lightweight composite idler rollers for use in the mining industry. The conceptual shaftless composite rollers are estimated to be 40 - 60 % lighter than traditional steel rollers. The light weight of the concept idler roller, combined with the possibility of manufacturing idler rollers that are dimensionally suitable for mining, addressed the concerns of the Australian mining industry and answered the call to develop a light weight <b>conveyor</b> belt <b>idler</b> roller. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} of idlers' bearing assemblies {{is the basic}} indicator of their technical condition. The main aim {{of this article is}} to present the impact of decreased tightness of the <b>conveyor</b> belts' <b>idlers</b> which results in the higher {{temperature of}} bearing assemblies, which in turn is the main factor influencing their level of durability. This article includes research methodology of idlers, which was designed to determine the direct impact of lower tightness of bearing assemblies, at a determined load, on the temperature of bearing assemblies. Research results are presented in the form of dependence of ΔT temperature increase, in t time function, and at the determined F radial load. The characteristics set during the tests included the temperature of bearing assemblies and were analysed in terms of the possible or potential risk of bearing assembly seizure. The research carried out showed the significant impact of load on the temperature increase of bearing assemblies. Constant recording of temperature increases and the nature of changes allowed conclusions to be drawn concerning the seizure of bearings or idler's seals. A thermographic (infrared) camera enabled pivotal areas located in the bearing assembly to be determined, which may indicate the seizure, and helped to present thermography images showing the distribution of the temperature in the idler which occurred during testing...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the failure {{analysis}} of a conveyor belt related {{to the place of}} impact where material lands. It studies how the number of <b>conveyor</b> carrying <b>idlers</b> influences the belt compression stress in the place of impact. The landing material is represented by an impactor of 500 kg landing from the height of 4 m. The analyses are grounded in mathematical modelling of the transport belt and experimentally determine the quantities vital for the simulations. The place of impact under examination is the critical site of the whole facility as it is subject to extreme stress. The failure analysis considers two variants of idler number in the place of material impact. The results clearly demonstrate that the construction making use of a higher number of idlers is more suitable due to lower deformations of the belt. The conclusions presented in the article may thus lead to conveyor belt construction optimisations, and thus contribute to their longer life. At the same time, there is a great potential for further research, as the topic of longer conveyor belt life via changing the number of carrying idlers at the place of impact has not been widely investigated.
