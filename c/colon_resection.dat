To determine whether these ACF could be identified in fresh tissue, 10 <b>colon</b> <b>resections</b> were collected after surgery for colorectal cancer.

The number of ACF per cm 2 and {{the average number of}} crypts per foci correlated highly in unfixed and fixed mucosa (r = 0. 93 and 0. 78, respectively). A significantly higher frequency of lesions was found in left-sided compared to right-sided <b>colon</b> <b>resections.</b> To determine whether the topographic features of the ACF gave an indication of the histological appearance, 68 specimens containing ACF or normal mucosa were examined histologically. The presence of slit-like lumen in the crypts of ACF on the mucosal surface correlated with the presence of dysplasia at histology, thus identifying microadenomas.

Setting The study was performed at an 851 -bed community hospital. Seventeen surgeons performed <b>colon</b> <b>resections,</b> with the number of resections varying from 1 to 154. Ten pathologists and 3 pathology assistants evaluated the specimens. Patients A total of 430 patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent surgical resection. Only patients with colon cancer were included in the study; patients with rectal cancers, in situ disease only, T 4 tumors, and stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis were excluded to ensure a uniform group of patients, all undergoing resection with curative intent. Main Outcome Measures Age of the patient; the surgeon, pathologist, and pathology technician; stage of disease; and year of surgery were analyzed. Results: No statistical difference was found in the number of lymph nodes retrieved based on the surgeon (P = 3 D. 21), pathologist (P = 3 D. 11), or pathology technician (P = 3 D. 26).

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{test whether}} the newly {{developed}} comprehensive complication index (CCI) is {{more sensitive than}} traditional endpoints for detecting between-group differences in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). BACKGROUND A major challenge in RCTs is the choice of optimal endpoints to detect treatment effects. Mortality {{is no longer a}} sufficient marker in studies, and morbidity is often poorly defined. The CCI, integrating all complications including their severity in a linear scale ranging from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death), is a new tool, which may be more sensitive than other traditional endpoints to detect treatment effects on postoperative morbidity. METHODS The CCI was tested in 3 published RCTs from European centers evaluating pancreas, esophageal and <b>colon</b> <b>resections.</b> To compare the sensitivity of the CCI with traditional morbidity endpoints, for example, presence of any (yes/no) or only the most severe complications, all postoperative events were assessed, and the CCI calculated. Treatment effects and sample size calculations were compared using the CCI and traditional endpoints. RESULTS Although RCTs failed to show between-group differences using any or most severe complications, the CCI revealed significant differences between treatment groups in 2 RCTs-after pancreas (P= 0. 009) and esophageal surgery (P= 0. 014). The CCI in the RCT on <b>colon</b> <b>resections</b> confirmed the absence of between-group differences (P= 0. 39). The required sample sizes in trials are up to 9 times lower for the CCI than for traditional morbidity endpoints. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates superiority of the CCI to traditional endpoints.

40|$|Colonic inertia is a {{frustrating}} motility disorder to patients, clinicians, and pathologists. The pathogenesis is largely unknown. The aims {{of this study}} were to: (1) characterize the expression of smoothelin, a novel smooth muscle-specific contractile protein expressed only by terminally differentiated smooth muscle cells, in the normal gastrointestinal (GI) tract; and (2) determine whether smoothelin is aberrantly expressed in patients with colonic inertia. A total of 57 resections of the normal GI tract (distal esophagus to left colon) were obtained from patients without GI motor dysfunction. Sixty-one <b>colon</b> <b>resections</b> were obtained from patients with a clinical diagnosis of colonic inertia. Smoothelin immunostaining was conducted on full-thickness tissue sections. In the nondysmotile controls, strong and diffuse cytoplasmic staining for smoothelin was observed in both the inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of the muscularis propria (MP) throughout the entire GI tract. The muscularis mucosae (MM) and muscular vessel walls were either completely negative or only patchily and weakly stained. The 1 exception to this pattern was observed in the distal esophagus, in which the MM was also diffusely and strongly stained. In cases with colonic inertia, a moderate to marked reduction of smoothelin immunoreactivity was observed in 15 of 61 (24. 6 %) <b>colon</b> <b>resections,</b> selectively seen in the outer layer of the MP. The data demonstrate that smoothelin is differentially expressed in the MP and MM of the normal GI tract and suggest that defective smoothelin expression {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of colonic inertia in a subset of patients.

40|$|Abstract (Clinical {{practice}} points) What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject?After nearly 20 years of development, laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer {{has emerged as the}} standard procedure compared to open surgery with similar oncologic outcomes and superior perioperative results. Usually, an abdominal incision is required for anastomosis and specimen extraction for laparoscopic colon surgery. Recently, natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) and intracorporeal anastomosis have been proposed {{to improve the quality of}} laparoscopic <b>colon</b> <b>resections.</b> This approach can eliminate a larger abdominal incision other than that for trocar placement. However, intracorporeal anastomosis is the major challenge in laparoscopic surgery. Technique of delta-shaped anastomosis which was used for the gastric cancer surgery was reported firstly in 2002. and there was no report on the feasibility and safety of totally laparoscopic resection with delta-shaped anastomosis for colon cancer surgery till now. we describe this simple and safe technique of intracorporeally delta-shaped anastomosis in sigmoid colectomy combined with transvaginal extraction of the specimen. What are the new findings?Natural orifice specimen extraction and intracorporeal anastomosis have been proposed to improve the quality of laparoscopic <b>colon</b> <b>resections.</b> This case report demonstrates that the technical innovations of transvaginal specimen extraction and an intracorporeal delta-shaped anastomosis is considered a more feasible and safer procedure, and obesity does not adversely affect the outcomes of this technique with respect to postoperative recovery. How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?This case report describes the feasibility, safety and shortterm outcome of an intracorporeal delta-shaped anastomosis technique for laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy combined with transvaginal extraction of the specimen in an obese patient. Our findings suggest that this technique is more feasible and safer for patients with sigmoid colon cancer than other natural orifice specimen extraction approaches and that obesity does not adversely affect the outcome of this technique with respect to postoperative recovery.
