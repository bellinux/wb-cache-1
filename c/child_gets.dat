25|$|The {{transition}} from childhood to adolescence {{can be seen}} in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time. For example, Yucatec Mayan children's play time decreases from childhood to adolescence and as the <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> older, is replaced for time spent working. In childhood the work is initiated by others whereas in adolescence it is self-initiated. The shift in initiation and the change in time spent working versus playing shows the children's motivation to participate in order to learn.|$|E
25|$|Babies {{born with}} severe CP often have an {{irregular}} posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as spinal curvature, a small jawbone, {{or a small}} head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> older. Some babies born with CP do not show obvious signs right away. Classically, CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or gross motor developmental delay is seen.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmopatic {{findings}} {{are more common}} but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism {{in children and adolescents}} are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the bigger the delay from their potential development level. The <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.|$|E

She was appointed as the national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights on 10 August 2010. UNICEF Representative Karin Hulshof said of the appointment: [...] "She is equally passionate about her {{work on behalf of}} children and adolescents.

He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> sick, and it ends up being an 'Odd Couple' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun." [...] Bakula also explained {{in an interview with the}} website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will [...] "find out a lot of stuff about [...] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!"

2500|$|Attachment theory (Bowlby 1969, 1973, 1980) {{is rooted}} in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically {{programmed}} to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected. Through repeated attempts to seek physical and emotional closeness with a caregiver and the responses the <b>child</b> <b>gets,</b> the child develops an internal working model (IWM) that reflects the response of the caregiver to the child. According to Bowlby, attachment provides a secure base from which the child can explore the environment, a haven of safety to which the child can return when he or she is afraid or fearful. Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth identified that an important factor which determines whether a child will have a secure or insecure attachment is the degree of sensitivity shown by their caregiver: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the series is taken from a children's game, , in which the {{participants}} sit in a circle, {{and the leader of}} the game names each person after a type of fruit; when the name of a child's fruit is called, that <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> up and has to find a new seat. When the protagonist, Tohru Honda first plays this game in kindergarten, she is assigned [...] "onigiri", by her cruel classmates, but she does not mind because she thinks onigiri are delicious. Once the game is finished, and all of the children but Tohru are called, Tohru realizes that onigiri are not a type of fruit at all, and she realizes that she does not belong. Tohru comes to associate this game with the Sohma family, and that she does not fit in among them any more than an onigiri does in a basket of fruit. In volume 1 of the manga, after Yuki and Kyo bring Tohru home from her grandfather's house, she begins to feel like she belongs with the Sohma family. After this, she imagines herself as a child hearing [...] "onigiri" [...] called in the game, symbolizing that she has finally found her place.|$|E
2500|$|Behaviorists explain {{personality}} {{in terms of}} the effects external stimuli have on behavior. [...] The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. [...] This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or [...] "the organism" [...] with its environment. [...] Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. [...] These are the response, and consequences. [...] The response is the child crying, and the attention that <b>child</b> <b>gets</b> is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. [...] Skinner put forward a [...] "three term contingency model" [...] which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the [...] "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" [...] in which the critical question is: [...] "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Byers‚ÄêHeinlein & Werker (2009) studied 48 17 and 18-month-old {{monolingual}} (English), bilingual, and trilingual (22 diverse languages) infants {{to compare}} their patterns on disambiguation. They studied infants {{at this age}} because this is when the heuristic {{has been shown to}} appear in monolingual infants. Additionally, they studied bilinguals from multiple diverse language backgrounds to show that the patterns were not language-specific but rather characteristic of bilingualism in general. they found that monolinguals showed disambiguation, bilinguals somewhat, and trilinguals did not. Byers‚ÄêHeinlein & Werker (2009) hypothesized that this was particularly an effect of translation equivalents (knowing the name for something in more than one language), as [...] "they represent a departure from the one-to-one mapping between word and concept that is typical of monolingual vocabularies" [...] (p 820). Indeed, in a later study conducted by Byers-Heinlein & Werker (2013) in 17‚Äì18 month-old Chinese-English bilingual infants, results showed that disambiguation did not occur in the infants who [...] "understood the translation equivalents {{for more than half of}} the words in their vocabularies" [...] (p.407), while disambiguation occurred in those who knew fewer translation equivalents. They also suggested that the reverse could be possible‚Äîthat infants who employed the heuristic were the ones that did acquire the translation equivalents because of the high level of one-to-one mapping. also say that disambiguation and language exposure are not correlated, but the presence or absence of translation equivalents could be attributed by the amount of exposure in each language the <b>child</b> <b>gets.</b> Particularly, if children receive more exposure in both languages, they are likely to have both words for a given object or concept, but if they have less exposure in one language they will likely lack the appropriate amount of translation equivalents, thereby exhibiting disambiguation.|$|E
