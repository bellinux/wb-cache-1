500|$|Kalabhavan Shajon, who {{previously}} {{worked in the}} industry as a comedian and the sidekick of the lead actors, was chosen for the main antagonistic role. The director stated, [...] "I had two-three actors in mind, but at last decided to pick Shajon.

Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision. For a long time I thought, 'Well, it's {{just not going to}} happen.' Then when I actually started to consider it, it became so <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> desperately wanted to say more about these characters, it would've been an easy no and it was a spectacularly easy yes. There was no wrestling." [...] Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes.
