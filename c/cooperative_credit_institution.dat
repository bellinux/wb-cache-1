40|$|Cooperative {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and {{effective}} systems in terms of development of human civilization. Cooperative institutions are organised and managed on the principle of cooperation, self-help and mutual help. There are different types of cooperative institutions functioning in India. As far as the institutional credit structure is concerned, cooperatives play a significant role in this regard. <b>Cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> are spread all over India and are providing their services at the grass root level. As main portion of the population in India lives in rural areas so it is important to strengthen the <b>cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> in these areas. The major advantage of the institutions is their strong branch network which covers entire area of the country. This paper attempts to study the State Co-operative Banking in India. The paper mainly focuses on the branch networking, capital, advances, deposits, working capital and recovery performance of these banks in India. Basically we have studied the growth and performance of State Co-operative Banks in India. The study is based on secondary data.

40|$|In {{view of a}} {{legislative}} reform going to change ab imis the Italian ‘Credito Cooperativo’ system (BCC), this paper puts under scrutiny the peculiarities of mutual banks – which, after the company law reform {{at the beginning of}} this millennium, were forced to remain ‘prevalently mutual’- reflecting their full integration in the surrounding territory. BCCs were essential in funding SMEs over time, so that changes in their morphology would alter their prerogatives and, consequently, be detrimental to this important productive sector. This presumption is further confirmed by EU indications, especially those related to the Capital Market Union (see Action Plan, chapter 5) which underlines the key role played by <b>cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions.</b> In this context, one should not fully agree with the reform proposal supported by Federcasse and adopted in the decree-law, which aims at putting all Italian mutual banks under a single holding company. In fact, this would result in a over-sized structure impeding to sustain local economies, with obvious consequences within the overall system. A different, more restrained form of consolidation (for instance, through the creation of regional groups) would allow BCCs to pursue the regulator’s goals, namely the strengthening of capital bases jointly with the integration within their own territory...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{financial}} sector reforms, sustainability, viability and operational efficiency of rural financial institutions (RFIs) are the major issues {{that need to be}} taken cognizance of in ensuring effective rural credit delivery system. However, the major problems plaguing the efficiency of rural credit delivery system are the mounting overdue 1 and Non Performing Assets (NPAs) 2 of RFIs. The overdue problem of different entities of rural credit delivery structure is reported to be an all-pervasive phenomenon that cuts across these different agencies (Puhazhendi and Jayaraman, 1999). Among various RFIs, though commercial banks (CBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Cooperatives are the major sources of credit for the agricultural sector at the village level, cooperatives alone account for 45 per cent share in the rural credit flow for agriculture and 31 per cent in rural deposits in terms of network, coverage and outreach (Gulati and Bathla, 2002). Co-operatives, therefore, enjoy major share in rural credit delivery. The reform process in cooperatives have taken much longer time to start because of the need for generating a consensus among the various State Governments which govern and control <b>cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> and the need to balance the interests of many diversified groups which control, operate and guide the cooperatives.

40|$|Este artigo visou a descrever as transformações das cooperativas de crédito, diante da economia de mercado atualmente observada no Brasil. Para isso, fez-se uma revisão bibliográfica acerca do tema, além de se assinalar sobre evidências empíricas de conduta do sistema no País. Constatou-se que as cooperativas decrédito se estruturam neste contexto sem perder suas características doutrinárias e mantendo seus princípios ideológicos. As mudanças observadas nas cooperativas de crédito são provocadas por força de alterações normativas, mas também por iniciativa de modelos de gestão que têm a intenção de melhorar a posição destas organizações nos mercados onde atuam. No Brasil, embora a participação das cooperativas de crédito seja ainda pequena, no cenário agregado do sistema financeiro nacional é visível seu crescimento e melhoria de seus resultados, particularmente no século XXI. Evidências dessa melhoria estão no aumento no número de estabelecimentos, no crescente número de associados e na expansão da participação no total do crédito nacional, variáveis que permitem inferir sobre odesempenho das instituições de crédito cooperativo brasileiras.

Evidence of this improvement is {{the increase in the number}} of establishments andthe increasing share in total domestic credit variables that allow inferences about the performance of <b>cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> in Brazil. </div...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into rural credit delivery system in Maharashtra shows slower growth in institutional finances through commercial banks, <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> RRBs and LDBs, {{particularly during the}} decade of 1991 - 2000, which is mainly due to adverse environment created by the financial sector reforms. Due to unfavourable policy framework, the entire rural credit delivery system encompassing rural branches of commercial banks, <b>cooperative</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> and RRBs is reduced to a moribund state. High transaction costs and poor repayment performance are the twin root causes of the moribund state of rural credit delivery system. With a view to revive the agricultural credit delivery system, there is need to adopt innovative approaches like linking of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) with mainstream financial institutions. Such linkages are reported to have not only reduced transaction costs but also ensured better repayment performance. One of the recent studies conducted in Maharashtra has shown cent per cent recovery of loans through SHGs despite having excessively high rates of interest (24 - 36 per cent per annum) on their loan advances. One of the further disquieting features of RFIs in Maharashtra has been the high proportion of NPAs to total assets, particularly of RRBs and SCARDBs, which are estimated to hover around 36 - 48 per cent during the mid-to late nineties. One {{of the reasons for}} such high incidence of NPAs of RFIs has been the familiar practice of debt forgiveness, which eroded repayment and allowed defaulters to scot free with no deterrent reprimand. Political interference in issues of prudent fiscal management has got {{a lot to do with}} this unfortunate scenario. In order to rejuvenate rural credit delivery system, the twin problems facing the system, viz., high transaction costs and poor repayment performance, need to be tackled with more fiscal jurisprudence reserving exemplary punishment for willful defaults, especially by large farmers. In fact, insofar as the rural credit delivery system is concerned, the focus should be on strategies that are required for tackling issues such as sustainability and viability, operational efficiency, recovery performance, small farmer coverage and balanced sectoral development. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether a credit crunch occurred in Germany during the recent financial crisis and to analyze the underlying factors. In order to disentangle credit supply and demand we specify a theory-based dynamic disequilibrium model of the German credit market. To estimate this model we use a new approach based on Bayesian Inference suggested by Bauwens and Lubrano (2007). Besides the analysis of the whole banking sector we will apply the model to five groups of banks (big private banks, Landesbanken, savings banks, <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> regional <b>institutions</b> of <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives)</b> that were affected differently by the financial crisis. The results suggest that a credit crunch did not occur in Germany during the recent economic crisis as well as during the following recovery starting in 2010. Furthermore, we find that especially those banks that were more affected by the financial crisis through huge impairments restricted their credit supply more than others. Both supply and demand side factors contributed to the stabilization of credit financing. This suggests that the structure of the German banking sector as well as economic policy measures avoided a credit crunch...|$|R
