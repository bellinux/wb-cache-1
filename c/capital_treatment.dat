The paper will detail how Putnam's treatment of social capital has evolved, examine the arguments of his critics and will also critique his socio-economic analysis. Design/methodology/approach – The approach taken is a literature review that investigates Putnam's social capital understanding and considers the reasons why this conceptual treatment “touched a nerve” and proved so influential and adaptable. Findings – Putnam's social <b>capital</b> <b>treatment</b> belongs to a socio-economic communitarian tradition that can be traced to de-Tocqueville, which offers an alternative to both mainstream free market ideology and to leftwing socio-economics. Originality/value – The originality of this paper is to identify Putnam as a radical in a methodological sense, reinvigorating a Burkean, consensual interpretation of socio-economics. The value of this paper is to offer a critique of Putnam's interpretation of social capital. Economic theory, Social capital, Social economics...|$|E

40|$|The {{roles of}} banks in {{mortgage}} asset securitization {{in recent years}} is the product of an evolution in recognition by agencies, courts and Congress of the authority and desirability of permitting asset securitization as a means of selling or borrowing against loan assets. 1 National banks engaged in the first securitizations of residential mortgage loans {{as far back as the}} 1970 s under the same laws that permit national banks to securitize their assets today. Since that time, there has been significant growth in the number and complexity of asset-backed securitizations. 2 Congress encouraged some of this growth in the 1980 s and 1990 s by expanding the authority of national banks and other financial institutions to purchase certain mortgage-related and small business-related securitized assets. But many other factors, beyond legal authority, have driven the tremendous growth of the securitization market by creating incentives for market participants to use securitizations. These factors, as described below, include reallocating risks such as credit and interest rate risk among originators and investors, providing new sources of funding and liquidity and achieving favorable accounting and <b>capital</b> <b>treatment.</b> Market events, along with recent changes i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has {{a policy}} {{framework}} for how clearing member banks should treat their exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. Clearing member banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential <b>capital</b> <b>treatment</b> under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|E

40|$|Annual {{issuance}} of {{asset backed securities}} reached to $ 3. 650 billion globally {{at the end of}} 2005 and the securitisation activities have taken several forms ranging from traditional securitisation transactions to different types of synthetic structures. Continuous studies for the establishment of international standards and harmonisation of national regulations for accounting and regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>treatment</b> of securitisation transactions, as constituent parts of International Accounting Standards and Basel II, resulted in a very complex and widely accepted framework for securitisation activities.

This study examined the impact of bonding and bridging social capital (i. e. close and distant ties) on public disclosure and described the complex relationship between bonding and bridging social capital in the context of serostatus disclosure among AIDS patients enrolled in South Africa's public sector ART programme. Data were collected from a cohort of patients enrolled in the public sector ART programme in the Free State province of South Africa. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a random sample of 268 patients at three points in time (< 6 months of ART, 6 - 12 months of ART, and 18 - 24 of months ART). The relationship between bonding and bridging social capital and the impact of different forms of social capital on public disclosure were determined using a fully cross-lagged regression model. The positive impact of bonding social <b>capital</b> (<b>treatment</b> and emotional buddy) on public disclosure was positive and invariant across time. The results from the cross-lagged regression indicated that bridging social capital (community health worker and support group) only encouraged public disclosure in the second year of treatment. At the start of treatment, bivariate analysis showed a strong negative association between bonding and bridging social capital, which diminished at follow-up and eventually disappeared in the second year of treatment. This study identified bonding social capital as a leverage to maximize potential benefits and minimize potential risks in order to shift the balance towards consistent public disclosure. Furthermore, the importance of bridging social capital initiatives is demonstrated, especially for the most vulnerable patients, those who cannot capitalize their bonding social capital by disclosing their HIV serostatus to family and friends at the start of treatment...|$|E

500|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{industrial}} suburbs was {{the model}} town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). [...] Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks {{to provide for the}} social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A [...] strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward <b>capital's</b> <b>treatment</b> of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.|$|R
40|$|The {{operating}} characteristics of thirteen municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) with design capacities between 50, 000 and 300, 000 m 3 /d (mean 75, 000 m 3 /d) were studied. The treatment processes used by these plants included one biofilter (BIO); two A/O (activated sludge anaerobic and aerobic processes in sequence); four A 2 /O (modified A/O with anaerobic, annoxic (denitrification) and aerobic cells in sequence); three oxidation ditches (OXD); two A/B (absorption-bio-oxidation two-stage [anaerobic cell followed by aerobic cell]); and one sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The study objec-tive {{was to determine whether}} the WWTPs were operating at design conditions, and if not, to try to identify the causes of under-performance. All the WWTPs produced a treated effluent quality which was in compliance with a few exceptions. Nine WWTPs were operating with a mean of 62 % of the design hydraulic flows. Thirteen WWTPs were operating at a mean of 56 % of the design five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and at 84 % of the design total suspended solids (TSS) loadings. Three WWTPs received high-strength wastewater (WW) (BOD> 400 mg/L), four normal-strength WW (BOD = 150 to 260 mg/L) and five received weak-strength WW (BOD < 150 mg/L). WW strength appeared to be a local characteristic. The mean <b>capital</b> <b>treatment</b> plant costs for one cubic metre of WW per day was 232 USD (104 to 444 USD); consequently, between 80 and 100 MUSD capital investment in WWTPs is unused.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the nature}} (capital or revenue) {{of the proceeds}} arising {{from the use of}} short positions in South African hedge fund fundamental paired trades. Hedge funds, which typically avail themselves of an array of alternative investment strategies such as short selling in addition to the traditional asset classes, were recently brought into the South African investment regulatory net. This was achieved by classifying regulated hedge funds as a separate category of collective investment scheme in terms of the CISCA. This categorisation brought regulated hedge funds into the ambit of section 25 BA of the Income Tax Act which carries an important distinction between amounts of a capital nature and amounts of a revenue nature. Given that hedge funds may use short positions for both profit-seeking and risk-mitigation purposes, the resulting proceeds from short sales could be capital or revenue in nature from a tax perspective based on the surrounding facts of the trade. The onus of discharging the proof that the proceeds resulting from a short sale are capital in nature is significant. The South African case law emphasises the importance of applying the various principles to the specific facts of the case. The importance of the dominant intention of the trade is highlighted, given the potentially competing purposes of profit-seeking and risk-mitigation present. Factors that should be analysed in such a scenario include the overall portfolio positioning, the size of the long and short positions relative to each other, the degree of specificity of the risk that the short position purports to hedge against, the manner of re-investment of the short sale proceeds, the level of trading activity in the hedge fund, the level of short positions in the hedge fund, the absolute sizes of the long and short positions {{in the context of the}} overall portfolio, the exposure of the hedge fund to the long position after the close out of the short position, the manner of close out of the short position and the holding period of the short position. While the analysis reveals factors that may be indicative of <b>capital</b> <b>treatment,</b> the classification of short sale proceeds as capital or revenue in nature remains a challenging task to undertake due to the potentially wide variety of facts and circumstances and the potential for undesirable consequences should an incorrect classification be made. Consequently, improved clarity through the provision of de jure guidance as to the nature of short sale proceeds would be welcome...|$|E
40|$|The normal biomass {{level in}} the {{conventional}} activated sludge reactor is generally limited to between 2, 000 and 3, 000 mg/L due to the oxygen transfer limitation {{and the need for}} effective sludge settling in the secondary clarifier. In order to eliminate these two constraints, an exploratory study has been carried out to use hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen source in a non-aerated sludge blanket reactor containing a biomass level of 18, 000 - 52, 000 mg/L. The thick sludge blanket can effectively retain most of the produced bio-solids, leaving an effluent with SS levels between 50 and 350 mg/L, which may be polished by settling, micro-straining, or even slow sand filtration for small treatment plants. It has been found that an influent dosing of 800 mg/L H 2 O 2 does not induce any peroxide toxicity. This dosing provides an oxygen supply of 376 mg/L, which can satisfy a theoretical COD removal of 750 mg/L based on a cell yield coefficient of 0. 50. Of course, the actual COD removal is somewhat lower because a portion of the oxygen supply is consumed by biomass respiration. In treating a synthetic influent containing a TOC of 300 to 500 mg/L (with a COD/TOC ratio of 2. 65) and an HRT of 0. 33 to 1. 0 hour, the reactor can accept an organic loading of up to 36 kgTOC/m 3 -day (over 50 times higher than the conventional activated sludge system) with a 50 % organic removal efficiency. When the loading rate is reduced to 7. 2 kgTOC/m 3 -day, the efficiency increases to 82 %. Actually, the extent of TOC removal is largely dictated by the level of peroxide dosing since in this type of reactor, the biomass level is very high and the organic stabilization rate is not dictated by microbial activities. The capital requirement for such a compact reactor is less than 5 % of that for the conventional activated sludge plant since its reactor volume is only 2 to 3 % of the aeration tank, and {{there is no need for}} blowers or other aeration equipment. The operating cost is higher as 1. 0 kg of oxygen supply from peroxide is about HK$ 12 /kgO 2, while that from diffuser aeration is only HK$ 1. 5 to HK$ 2. 0 /kgO 2. Nevertheless, for a small plant with a treatment capacity of 500 m 3 /day treating an influent COD of 500 mg/L, the daily oxygen required is only 112. 5 kg/day (equivalent to a peroxide cost of HKD$ 1, 350 /day or HK$ 2. 7 /m 3), which can be easily offset by the tremendous capital saving for the plant installation.

40|$|Entering {{and staying}} in treatment, coming off opioid {{substitution}} treatment (OST) and exiting structured treatment are all important indicators of an individual’s recovery progress, {{but they do}} not in themselves constitute recovery. Coming off OST or exiting treatment prematurely can harm individuals, especially if it leads to relapse, which is also harmful to society. Recovery is a broader and more complex journey that incorporates overcoming dependence, reducing risk-taking behaviour and offending, improving health, functioning as a productive member of society and becoming personally fulfilled. These recovery outcomes are often mutually reinforcing. •	The ambition for more people to recover is legitimate, deliverable and overdue. Previous drug strategies focused on reducing crime and drug-related harm to public health, where the benefit to society accrued from people being retained in treatment programmes as much from completing them. However, this allowed a culture of commissioning and practice to develop that gave insufficient priority to an individual’s desire to overcome his or her drug or alcohol dependence. •	This has been particularly true for heroin users receiving OST, where the protective benefits have too often become an end in themselves rather than providing a safe platform from which users might progress towards further recovery. •	Overcoming drug or alcohol dependence is often difficult. Only half of established smokers in England are likely to make a long-term recovery from tobacco dependence 1. In the USA, up to half of the alcohol-dependent population can expect to recover over the long term 2. Heroin and other opiates have a far worse prognosis: long-term USA studies suggest that, over 30 years, half of dependent users will die, one fifth will recover and the remainder will continue to use opiates, albeit some at a lower level. •	According to the research, the international track record and clinical experience, not everyone who comes into treatment will overcome their dependence. We know from the same sources that it is not possible or ethical to predict which individuals will eventually overcome their dependence. This is why we are obliged to create a treatment system that makes every effort to provide the right package of support to maximise every individual’s chances of recovery. •	Fewer young people are now coming into treatment for dependence on the most damaging drugs such as heroin, but there is an ageing cohort of drug dependent and ex-dependent individuals who will experience an increase in morbidity and mortality as they develop multisystem diseases that need complex treatment. Primary and secondary care services will be needed to treat them. •	Well-delivered OST provides a platform of stability and safety that protects people and creates the time and space for them to move forward in their personal recovery journeys. OST has an important and legitimate place within recovery-orientated systems of care. The drug strategy is clear that medication-assisted recovery can and does happen. We need to ensure OST is the best platform it can be, but focus equally on the quality, range and purposeful management of the broader care and support it sits within. •	If we stick closely to the compelling evidence for effective OST, and the existing guidance based upon that evidence, we will deliver many of the improvements needed – but we can and should do more. A determined assessment of the shortfalls in provision, followed by remedial action, is a priority if OST is to fulfil its potential in supporting recovery. •	There is no justification for poor-quality treatment anywhere in the system. It is not acceptable to leave people on OST without actively supporting their recovery and regularly reviewing the benefits of their treatment (as well as checking, responding to, and stimulating their readiness for change). Nor is it acceptable to impose time-limits on their treatment that take no account of individual history, needs and circumstances, or the benefits of continued treatment. Treatment must be supportive and aspirational, realistic and protective. •	Some people have a level of personal and other resources (called ‘recovery capital’) that enables them to stabilise and leave treatment more quickly than others. Many others have long-term problems and complex needs, meaning their recovery may take much longer and they require help to build their recovery <b>capital.</b> <b>Treatment</b> given over this timescale must maintain its recovery orientation. •	Arbitrarily or prematurely curtailing an individual’s OST will not help them sustain their recovery and is not {{in the interests of the}} wider community either. It risks losing any advances because it is externally imposed and so has no meaning – the individual does not own the decision. This would likely lead to an increase in blood-borne virus rates, drug-related deaths and crime. However, clear and ambitious goals, with timescales for action, are key components of effective individualised treatment, especially when the individual collaborates in planning them. We strongly support continued reference and adherence to the existing NICE drug misuse guidance (reviewed and unchanged in 2010 - 11) and to the more practitioner-orientated 2007 Clinical Guidelines. •	The more ambitious approach outlined will sometimes lead to people following a potentially more hazardous path, with the risk of relapse (or at least occasional lapse) as they seek to disengage from the OST that has supported them. Individuals (and their families), clinicians and services need to understand this potential risk. They need to approach the change with careful planning and increased support, and include a ‘safety-net’ in case of relapse. •	OST will improve as a result of changes at a system, service and individual level. These include: • treatment systems and services having a clear and coherent vision and framework for recovery that are visible to people in treatment, owned by all staff and maintained by strong leadership • purposeful treatment interventions that are properly assessed, planned, measured, reviewed and adapted • ‘phased and layered’ interventions that reflect the different needs of people at different times • treatment that creates the therapeutic conditions and optimism in which people, and especially those with few internal and external resources, can meet the challenge of initiating and maintaining change • OST programmes that optimise the medication according to the evidence and guidance • measuring recovery by assessing and tracking improvements in severity, complexity and recovery capital, then using this information to tailor interventions and support that boost an individual’s chances of recovering and improve his or her progress towards that goal •	treatment services that are not expected to deliver recovery on their own but are integrated with, and benefit from, other services such as mutual aid, employment support and housing •	treatment that works alongside peers and families to give people direct access to, or signposts and facilitated support to, opportunities to reduce and stop their drug use, improve their physical and mental health, engage with others in recovery, improve relationships (including with their children), find meaningful work, build key life skills, and secure housing.
