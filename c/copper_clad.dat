25|$|For {{the past}} quarter century, copper has been {{designed}} into a much wider range of buildings, incorporating new styles, varieties of colors, and different shapes and textures. <b>Copper</b> <b>clad</b> walls are a modern design element in both indoor and outdoor environments.|$|E
25|$|Building 17, {{also known}} as the Men's Barracks, stands {{on the south side of}} the parade ground near the throat of the Dalhousie Bastion. Two stories high for most of its length, the {{rectangular}} building has exterior walls of stone and features symmetrical elevations, a hipped, <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> roof, and a projecting course of stone above the ground floor.|$|E

5000|$|Facade <b>cladding</b> (<b>copper</b> cladding; <b>copper</b> wall <b>cladding)</b> with alloys of copper, e.g. brass or bronze, will weather {{differently}} from [...] "pure" [...] <b>copper</b> <b>cladding.</b> Even a lasting gold colour is possible with copper-alloy cladding, for example Colston Hall in Bristol, or the Novotel at Paddington Central, London.|$|R
25|$|When {{used as a}} fully {{supported}} roof covering, copper is half the weight (including substrate) of lead and {{only a quarter of}} tiled roofs. This generally provides savings in supporting structure and materials costs. <b>Copper</b> <b>cladding</b> offers additional opportunities to reduce the weight of copper structures (For more details, see: <b>Copper</b> <b>cladding</b> and Wall cladding).|$|R
25|$|Centered {{above the}} Sanctuary {{on the east}} side of the church is a <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> cupola {{surrounded}} by twelve ornate gothic arched windows. This feature is reminiscent of the cupolas of the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice. While the lantern provides a striking visual presence it was also built with function in mind. In the days before mechanical fans and air conditioning a series of mechanically operated louvers allowed for window panels to be opened to help cool the sanctuary inside.|$|E
25|$|Seaming technique. This is a {{vertical}} or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and façade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness {{may not be}} a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. Double lock standing seams are often not necessary. Links to photographs of horozontal and vertical standing and flat lock seams at the University of Debrecen's Copper Gateway in Hungary and of pre-oxidized <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> seamed facades at the Hotel Crowne Plaza Milano, in Milan, Italy, are available.|$|E

25|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>cladding</b> {{is used in}} {{building}} exteriors and indoor environments. On building exteriors, <b>copper</b> <b>cladding</b> sheets, shingles, and pre-fabricated panels shield buildings from the elements, acting as first line of defenses against wind, dust, and water. The cladding is lightweight, durable, and corrosion resistant, which is particularly important for large buildings. Common interior applications include lobby walls, soffits, column facings, and interior walls of elevator cabs.|$|R

2500|$|The {{lighthouse}} is conical in form. It stands [...] high, {{constructed of}} prefabricated cast iron plates, and painted white, with splayed flanges at the base, {{much like the}} Sandy Cape Light. The tower is topped by a cantilevered iron gallery, with a simple iron balustrade. Inside the tower is a spiral iron staircase with cast iron steps, adjoined to the internal walls. Entrance to the lighthouse was originally via an external flight of stairs and a small landing leading to a door on the second floor. In 1935 and entrance was provided {{on the ground floor}} and the stairs were relocated within the tower. On top of the gallery is the original [...] diameter Chance Bros lantern. In the lantern room is a catwalk, supported by ornate iron brackets. The dome of the lantern is <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> and painted red, and itself topped with a spherical knob and a weather vane. The lighthouse is fenced.|$|E

Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electro-plating copper on steel.|$|E

The March 1993 Grade II listing details describe it: [...] Buff brick; <b>copper</b> <b>cladding.</b> Flat roof. Irregular plan with staggered rooms, facing west. Eight storeys.

Elevation to east has expressed rectangular staircase and lift tower rising above roof line and narrow horizontal strip windows.|$|R
