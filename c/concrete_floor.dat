5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the <b>concrete</b> <b>floor,</b> but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was arrested}} on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive {{statements}} that he had publicly made. In March 1964 {{he was sentenced to}} 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy as well as maths and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe {{and other members of the}} ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.|$|E

40|$|Reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> {{constructed}} between movement restraints often crack seriously due to shrinkage after completion. One common {{mitigation measure}} is {{to construct the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> in stages to allow part of the shrinkage movement to take place before completion. However, shrinkage movement analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> constructed in stages is quite cumbersome, as the structural configuration changes during construction, thus necessitating reanalysis of the partially completed structure at each stage. Herein, a finite element method for shrinkage movement analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> constructed in stages is developed. It analyses the whole structure, including the completed and uncompleted portions, at all stages. The same mesh is used {{all the time and}} therefore re-meshing and location matching are no longer necessary. This is achieved by giving negligibly small stiffness to the uncompleted portions, which in reality do not exist yet. In the analysis, the locked-in strains due to increase in elastic modulus as the concrete hardens and the creep of the hardened concrete are taken into account. Most important of all, this method would enable fully automatic shrinkage movement analysis for the purpose of construction control. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A {{cohort study}} was {{performed}} on 150 HF X Black Pied crossbred dairy cattle in order to compare the effects of rubber <b>flooring</b> and solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> on claw horn quality, horn growth and wear, net growth, lameness and claw health. To this end on a dairy farm with 628 dairy cattle one of two identical buildings was established with rubber flooring (KURA P®, Gummiwerk Kraiburg Elastik GmbH, Tittmoning/ Obb.). After calving the animals were either assigned to the group housed in the building with rubber flooring or the building with solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> No differences existed {{between the two groups}} with respect to hygiene management and food and water supply. Approximately two weeks before calving heifers were transported to the dairy farm from a rearing farm, where the latter animals had been kept solely on straw bedding. In contrast, the dairy cows of the second and higher lactations on the farm already had a history of being kept alternately on free stalls with <b>concrete</b> <b>flooring</b> or straw bedding. The observation period lasted 15 weeks for single animals being kept either on rubber <b>flooring</b> or solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> It started with functional claw trimming. At claw-trimming {{and at the end of}} the observational period documentation of claw lesions using the DLG-Score took place and horn samples were obtained from the sole segment of the right lateral hind claw, which were examined by light microscopy. The number of horn tubules per mm², the diameter of the horn tubules as well as the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules were determined. In addition net horn growth was determined from wear and growth characteristics of the claw horn at the dorsal wall. Lameness scoring (Sprecher et al., 1997) took place in two-week intervals. Claw health was evaluated by recording new cases of claw disorders that had occurred during the observation period and the cure rate. The number of horn tubules per mm² of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 22 to 28, 34 to 40, 39 to 44, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 31 to 33, 33 to 39, 35 to 46, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> At the end of the observation period the number of horn tubules for calved heifers kept on rubber flooring was lower than for the same group of animals kept on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> As the number of horn tubules is genetically fixed, the lower number of horn tubules in the group housed on rubber was thought to be the consequence of a higher water content of the horn located between the tubules leading to larger distances between the single horn tubules. The latter effect was not observed in animals with lactation numbers of two and higher. Horn from the sole segment of animals of the first lactation belonging either to the group kept on rubber or on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> had lower numbers of horn tubules than cattle of lactation two and higher. The diameter of horn tubules of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle ranged from 76 µm to 78 µm, 58 µm to 62 µm, 62 µm to 62 µm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 61 µm to 63 µm, 51 µm to 51 µm, 47 µm to 50 µm, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> With respect to the diameter of horn tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber <b>floors</b> or solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> In addition there were no significant changes in the relation between the areas of the marrow zone to the cortex of the horn tubules between the two groups. The diameter of horn tubules being larger for cattle of the first lactation in either group suggests that the animals have also larger dermal papillae. The relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules ranged from 1. 74 to 1. 90, 1. 91 to 1. 87, 1. 69 to 1. 77, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors compared to 1. 93 to 2. 00, 1. 96 to 2. 14, 1. 91 to 2. 00, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> With respect to the relation between the area of the marrow zone and the cortex of the different tubules no differences were observed between cattle kept on rubber <b>floors</b> or solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> The monthly horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 4. 4 mm, 3. 9 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 4. 7 mm, 4. 1 mm, 3. 7 mm, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> The monthly horn wear of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 1. 8 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 5 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 5 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 6 mm, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> This results in a monthly net horn growth of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle of 2. 5 mm, 3. 5 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 2. 2 mm, 3. 4 mm, 3. 2 mm, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> Animals of the first lactation showed slightly smaller amounts of horn growth and horn wear compared to older animals. However, net horn growth did not differ between animals kept on rubber <b>flooring</b> versus solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> The small amount of horn wear on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> might be related to a lack of exercise of the animals due to the slippery solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> The latter is also reflected in the net growth rates of claw horn of animals on <b>concrete</b> <b>flooring</b> being more than 3 mm/month. Net horn growth of the bulb of first, second and third or higher lactation cattle were 2. 0 mm, 2. 2 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively in the group of animals kept on rubber floors versus 1. 5 mm, 1. 6 mm, 2. 1 mm, respectively on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> There were no differences observed with respect to the flooring types. The prevalence of lameness ranged from 14 % to 31 % (rubber floors) and 28 % to 42 % (solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors).</b> They did not differ in the two groups at any date of observation. In addition, no differences were observed with respect to lactation numbers. The prevalence of laminitis-associated disorders were already high at the start of the observational period (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd or higher lactation: 71 %, 87 %, 87 % (rubber floors); 90 %, 99 %, 99 % (solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors).</b> After 15 weeks laminitis-associated disorders were observed in nearly all claws. Defects of the white line (WLD), sole haemorrhages and double soles were the most prominent lesions observed in this context. There was no difference found with respect to the occurrence of new cases of defects of the white line and sole haemorrhages between the two groups, however the cure rate of the latter diseases was higher for animals of the third and higher lactation that were kept on rubber floors. In addition, the latter effect was also observed for defects of the white line and haemorrhages of animals of the first lactation kept on rubber flooring. Based on the latter findings the conclusion can be drawn that the type flooring does not lead to a reduction in cases of subclinical laminitis which might have been caused by fermentation disorders, but rubber flooring seems to enhance the process of recovery. The occurrence of new cases and the cure rates of double soles, slurry heel, digital dermatitis and interdigital dermatitis were not affected by the type of flooring. Animals of the first lactation that were kept on rubber floors had a smaller number of lesions related to dermatitis digitalis. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the study: Claw horn quality of rubber flooring dairy cattle does not differ from cattle kept on solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> Net growth of dairy cattle kept on rubber floors is not higher as net growth of dairy cattle kept on slippery solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> Prevalence of lameness does not differ between cattle kept on rubber or solid <b>concrete</b> <b>floors.</b> Keeping cattle on rubber floors does not lead to a better claw health if management based problems such moisture of alleys, bad stall comfort or feeding are not previously solved...|$|R
