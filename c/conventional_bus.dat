5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. <b>Conventional</b> <b>bus</b> chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{underwent}} a funding crisis in 2001 after the Central Link light rail project {{was found to}} be over budget and {{would not be able to}} open until 2009, three years later than planned. The light rail project was truncated to Westlake station in Downtown Seattle and to Tukwila, the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date. The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a <b>conventional</b> <b>bus</b> network. In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.|$|E

25|$|As of 2014, TARC has a {{fleet of}} 225 buses. 32 are hybrid buses, which combine a {{traditional}} diesel engine and an electric motor to reduce emissions and eliminate tailpipe exhaust during acceleration, but cost nearly {{twice as much as}} a <b>conventional</b> <b>bus.</b> The hybrids were provided through Federal highway bill earmarks by U.S. Senator Jim Bunning. In 2007, a new TARC bus cost $285,000, while a hybrid bus cost $504,000. Now a New clean diesel costs $405,000 dollars a bus while a hybrid costs $600,000 dollars a bus.|$|E
25|$|The Wheel-Trans {{door-to-door}} {{service has been}} available since the mid-1970s. Since the 1990s, the TTC has focused on providing accessible services on <b>conventional</b> <b>bus</b> routes, the RT and subway. 37 of the 69 stations on Lines 1 Yonge–University, 2 Bloor–Danforth, and 3 Scarborough are wheel-chair accessible, and all stations on Line 4 Sheppard are fully accessible. In December 2011, all bus routes became accessible with the retirement of the commission's last inaccessible buses. On August 31, 2014, the commission launched its new fleet of low-floor Bombardier's Flexity Outlook streetcars, which are replacing the commission's non-accessible vehicles by 2020.|$|E

Mérida has one of Venezuela's best public transit systems; nevertheless, the system has become overwhelmed by increasing demand, and may be beginning to collapse.

[...] The service was closed in 2011 due to the relatively high subsidy per journey, with funding moved to <b>conventional</b> <b>bus</b> routes following a public consultation.

40|$|Abstract- CDMA {{interconnect}} {{is a new}} interconnect {{mechanism for}} future SoC. Compared to a <b>conventional</b> TDMA-based <b>bus,</b> a CDMA-based bus has better channel isolation and channel continuity. We introduce a new bus architecture called CT-Bus, which mixes and takes strengths of both CDMA-based and TDMA-based interconnect schemes. A CT-Bus gives designers the {{ability to cope with}} widely varying communication requirements. We propose a method and a tool to explore the mapping of heterogeneous traffic flows onto the CT-Bus. Simulation results on a multimedia mobile phone system show that traffic flows mapped onto a CT-Bus meet the latency requirements while the same traffic flows mapped onto a <b>conventional</b> TDMA-only <b>bus</b> violate these requirements. 1...|$|R

[...] In September 2007 it was investigated by the Traffic Commissioner for selling illegal fares. Despite this it was extended to serve Leith, Ocean Terminal and Cameron Toll from October 2007. The vehicles used were Ford Transits. However, in February 2009 it was announced that the operation was up for sale as it had been operating at a loss despite carrying over 88,000 passenger in 2008.
