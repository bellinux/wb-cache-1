40|$|We {{analyze the}} problem of {{dilution}} leading to inefficient underinvestment caused by the adverse selection problem. We assume that the market obtains information about the firm over time, but that at each date the manager possesses better information about firm prospects than does the market. We show that issuing callable convertible securities with fixed <b>conversion</b> <b>prices</b> and restrictive call provisions is optimal. Such securities make the payoff to new claimholders independent of the private information of the manager. The restrictive call provision serves as a commitment device, enabling the manager to call only when the stock price rises in the future. This benefits the new {{as well as the}} existing claim—holders so that adverse selection problem is costlessly solved without any dissipation or underinvestment. Furthermore, we show that this efficient outcome can also be implemented by issuing optimally designed floating price convertibles. (JEL G 32...|$|R
5000|$|From 1970 to 1992, {{there were}} two {{operating}} uranium hexafluoride conversion facilities in the United States. These included Allied Signal's Metropolis Works Facility and General Atomics' Sequoyah Fuels Facility in Gore, Oklahoma. Facing low <b>conversion</b> <b>prices</b> and {{the implementation of the}} Megatons to Megawatts Program, both companies recognized the forthcoming struggles surrounding excess market supply of conversion services. In 1992, Allied Signal and General Atomics agreed to close the Gore, Oklahoma facility and take joint and equal ownership of profits from Allied Signal's plant in Metropolis, Illinois. [...] ConverDyn was formed as a general partnership between the two companies as the sole marketing organization of uranium hexafluoride produced at the Metropolis plant. As a result, any and all uranium hexafluoride produced at Metropolis Works is marketed and sold by ConverDyn. In 1999, Honeywell and Allied Signal merged resulting in the partnership structure that exists currently.|$|R
25|$|Vanilla {{convertible}} bonds {{are the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the <b>conversion</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conversion price: The {{nominal price}} per share at which {{conversion}} takes place, this number is fixed at the issuance {{but could be}} adjusted under some circumstance described in the issuance prospectus (e.g. Underlying stock split).

A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer would be able to recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E

2500|$|Mandatory {{convertibles}} are {{a common}} variation of the vanilla subtype, especially on the US market. Mandatory convertible would force the holder to convert into shares at maturity—hence the term [...] "Mandatory". Those securities would very often bear two conversion prices, making their profiles similar to a [...] "risk reversal" [...] option strategy. The first <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> would limit the price where the investor would receive the equivalent of its par value back in shares, the second would delimit where the investor will earn more than par. Note that if the stock price is below the first <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> the investor would suffer a capital loss compared to its original investment (excluding the potential coupon payments). Mandatory convertibles {{can be compared to}} forward selling of equity at a premium.|$|E

There are many subtype of ratchet formula (e.g. Make-whole base, time dependent...), their impact for the bondholder could be small (e.g. ClubMed, 2013) to significant (e.g. Aegis, 2012). Often, this clause would grant as well the ability for the convertible bondholders to [...] "put" [...] i.e. ask for the early repayment of their bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Contingent {{conversion}} (aka CoCo): Restrict {{the ability}} of the convertible bondholders to convert into equities. Typically, restrictions would be based on the underlying stock price and/or time (e.g. convertible every quarter if stock price is above 115% of the <b>conversion</b> <b>price).</b> Reverse convertibles in that respect could be seen as a variation of a Mandatory bearing a contingent conversion feature based. More recently some CoCo's issuances have been based on Tier-1 capital ratio for some large bank issuers.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} this kind of convertible debt is that it often carries conditions like a quarterly or semiannual reset of the <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> to keep the <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> more or less close to the actual stock price. However, a lower <b>conversion</b> <b>price</b> also increases the number of shares that a bond holder gets in exchange for one bond, which increases the dilution of existing shareholders. A lower price reset can also force investors that have set up a long CB/short stock position to sell more stock ("adjust the delta"), creating a vicious circle, hence the nickname death spiral.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the accuracy of distinguishing on a current basis convertible debentures between dilutive and non-dilutive groups. The test was based upon actual dilution from subsequent conversions, not just some level of conversion taking place. The study 2 ̆ 7 s premise {{was to determine whether}} the accuracy of the common stock equivalency requirements could be enhanced within the current levels of objectivity and cost effectiveness or whether the concept should be discontinued as some commentators have suggested. ^ A random sample of 191 convertible debenture issues outstanding on December 31, 1984, was taken with a review for actual dilution over the subsequent three years made. Issues showing potential dilution of three percent or more (the materilaity level included in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15) and resulting in one-half or more conversion during the test period were classified as dilutive (since Opinion No. 15 requires the issue be classified as one, the dilutive impact should be included only when at least one-half of the issue is converted). All other issues selected with a potential for material dilution were classified as non-dilutive. ^ Two ratios were tested on a current basis regarding their ability to predict the actual classifications. The results show that the more theoretically supported <b>conversion</b> value/call <b>price</b> ratio with a cutoff value of one (other cutoff amounts examined showed no additional success) and the yield to maturity/Aa bond rate measure with a cutoff value of 2 / 3 correctly predicted 85. 6 and 80. 8 percent of the classifications respectively. The difference in results was found insignificant. However, both success rates were determined as significantly greater than the 60 percent properly predicted as non-dilutive assuming the equivalency concept is discontinued. The results thus show that equally significant accuracy in primary earnings per share can be achieved by either continuing all earnings per share requirements other than frequency of the equivalency test or by utilizing annually a more theoretically supported <b>conversion</b> value/call <b>price</b> measure. ...|$|R
