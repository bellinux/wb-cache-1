40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{our recent}} researches {{on the development}} of coding devices, the investigation of security and the design of systems in the optical cod-division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. Besides, the techniques of nonlinear signal processing used in the OCDMA systems fire our imagination, thus some researches on all-optical signal processing are carried out and also summarized in this thesis. Two fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based coding devices are proposed. The first <b>coding</b> <b>device</b> is a superstructured FBG (SSFBG) using ±π/ 2 -phase shifts instead of conventional 0 /π-phase shifts. The ±π/ 2 -phase-shifted SSFBG en/decoders can not only conceal optical codes well in the encoded signals but also realize the reutilization of available codes by hybrid use with conventional 0 /π-phase-shifted SSFBG en/decoders. The second FBG based <b>coding</b> <b>device</b> is synthesized by layer-peeling method, which can be used for simultaneous optical code recognition and chromatic dispersion compensation. Then, two eavesdropping schemes, one-bit delay interference detection and differential detection, are demonstrated to reveal the security vulnerability of differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and code-shift keying (CSK) OCDMA systems. To address the security issue as well as increase the transmission capacity, an orthogonal modulation format based on DPSK and CSK is introduced into the OCDMA systems. A 2 bit/symbol 10 Gsymbol/s transmission system using the orthogonal modulation format is achieved. The security of the system can be partially guaranteed. Furthermore, a fully-asynchronous gigabit-symmetric OCDMA passive optical network (PON) is proposed, in which a self-clocked time gate is employed for signal regeneration. A remodulation scheme is used in the PON, which let downstream and upstream share the same optical carrier, allowing optical network units source-free. An error-free 4 -user 10 Gbit/s/user duplex transmission over 50 km distance is reazlied. A versatile waveform generation scheme is then studied. A theoretical model is established and a waveform prediction algorithm is summarized. In the demonstration, various waveforms are generated including short pulse, trapezoidal, triangular and sawtooth waveforms and doublet pulse. ii In addition, an all-optical simultaneous half-addition and half-subtraction scheme is achieved at an operating rate of 10 GHz by using only two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) without any assist light. Lastly, two modulation format conversion schemes are demonstrated. The first conversion is from NRZ-OOK to PSK-Manchester coding format using a SOA based Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The second conversion is from RZ-DQPSK to RZ-OOK by employing a supercontinuum based optical thresholder...|$|E

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of communication systems, network security issues {{have more and}} more impact on daily life. It is essential to construct a high degree of optical layer security to resolve the security problem once and for all. Three different techniques which can provide optical layer security are introduced and compared. Optical chaos can be used for fast random number generation. Quantum cryptography is the most promising technique for key distribution. And the optical coding techniques can be deployed to encrypt the modulated signal in the optical layer. A mathematical equation has been derived from information theory to evaluate the information-theoretic security level of the wiretap channel in optical coding schemes. And the merits and limitation of two coherent optical coding schemes, temporal phase coding and spectral phase coding, have been analysed. The security scheme based on a reconfigurable optical <b>coding</b> <b>device</b> has been introduced, and the corresponding security protocol has been developed. By moving the encryption operation from the electronic layer to the optical layer, the modulated signals become opaque to the unauthorised users. Optical code distribution and authentication is the one of the major challenges for our proposed scheme. In our proposed protocol, both of the operations are covered and defined in detail. As a preliminary draft of the optical code security protocol, it could be a useful guidance for further research...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the grammaticalization of deverbal, denominal and deadjectival prepositions in French out of Latin {{ablative}} absolute (AA) constructions has highlighted two main points of contact that could have allowed the process to take place: the preservation both of the original predicative quality and of the primal circumstantial syntactic function of the item-under-change. As a by-product, this study has provided arguments for the hypothesis that a residual, osmotic relationship could persist between Latin synthetic syntax and modern-French analytic syntax. In particular, this paper focuses on three statements of fact: (1) the grammaticalization of deverbal and denominal prepositions {{appears to be an}} imperfect process that has often left a double syntax as a legacy in modern French (ex. excepté ma soeur vs. ma soeur exceptée); (2) the synthetic origin of deverbal and denominal prepositions is responsible for their unique behavior amongst French prepositional devices; finally, (3) other syntactic constructions (such as participial or nominal sentences) can be found in modern French which clearly take a circumstantial value in the clause without relying on any external, grammatical <b>coding</b> <b>device</b> specifically devoted to the expression of marginal syntactic relations. These facts suggest that the circumstantial value of the ablative case may have followed two preservative paths: either (1) it has found in the French prepositional domain a consistent category where to survive both formally and functionally or (2) it has survived in the French syntax as a silent, deep functional category in spite of the loss of formal inflection. If this second point, in particular, could be confirmed by further research, this would mean that synthesis – that is, the power to convey semantic, morphologic and syntactic information as a whole – still has a place {{at the core of the}} French linguistic system...|$|E
