This research was did in study program of biology and 5 senior high school Pekanbaru on july until august 2015. Subjects of research were basic competencies 3. 7 and 3. 8 on digestion system and respiratory systemsubjects. This research was started by analyzing the curriculum, syllabus, and <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> that arranged by Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran (MGMP). And then making the new design of the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> according to scientific approach they are 3 lecturers and 2 teachers. Validation aspects that was assessed consist of 3 aspects, which are planning, pedagogic, and the contents. After the validation, the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> were fixed according to the inputs and comments from validators and the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> part ii were produced. After that the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> were given limited trial with spreading the studentsquestionnaire responses in 5 senior high school to 17 students on xi grade science class. And next the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> were re-revision according to the inputs and comments from the limited trial so that produced the final result of the <b>work</b> <b>sheets.</b> The average of validation results that has been continued develop on digestion system subject are 3. 26, 5. 50, 3. 40. while to respiratory system subject are 3. 35, 3. 31, and 3. 45. student responses to the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> aspects were 85 with very good category to non-experimental <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> and 80 with good category to experimental <b>work</b> <b>sheets.</b> the research result showed that development of student <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> based on scientific approach for digestion system and respiratory systemsubjects has successfully developed using develop model addie with very valid and very good category...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of physic learning {{as a process}} is to improve studentâ€™s thinking ability. To achieve studentâ€™s thinking skill in learning, a method and learning source are needed to develop studentâ€™s thinking skill. The use of learning source based on science generic skill (or KGS) is very needed in Ohmâ€™s Law and Kirchoffâ€™s First Law materials, because in these materials {{students are able to}} conduct generic skills such as direct observation, indirect observation, awareness about scale, mathematic modeling, and logical inference. These skills are able to apply by conducting a practicum using studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> (or LKS) based on science generic skill (or KGS) that is able to develop studentâ€™s thinking skill in Ohmâ€™s Law and Kirchoffâ€™s First Law materials. This development research used development model adapted from Suyanto with the following stages: 1) need assessment, 2) resource identification, 3) product specification identification, 4) product development, 5) internal test, 6) external test, and 7) production. Based on the test field results conducted with one-shot case study design, the conclusions were that the Ohmâ€™s Law studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> was not effective {{to be used as a}} learning source with the studentâ€™s passing percentage of 74. 2 % and the studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> of Kirchoffâ€™s First Law was effective to be used as a learning source with the student accomplishment percentage of 83. 3 %. Achieved indicators of science generic skill (KGS) in Ohmâ€™s Law studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> were direct observation (98. 4 %), indirect observation (75. 8 %), and awareness about scale (100 %). Indicators of mathematic modeling and logical inference were not achieved in Ohmâ€™s Law studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> with percentages of 68. 5 % and 64. 54 % respectively. Achieved indicators of science generic skill in studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> of Kircoffâ€™s First Law were indirect observation (93. 3 %), awareness about scale (97. 5 %), and logical inference (76. 6 %). Mathematic modeling was not achieved in studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> of Kirchoffâ€™s First Law with 71. 6 % percentage.

40|$|Background of this {{research}} is students learning outcomes is low, so {{this research}} aims to determine: (1) the difference in learning outcomes between students who were taught using Make A Match model assisted with <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> with the students taught by using conventional model, (2) the magnitude of the effect of Make A Match model assisted with <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> in X grade students of SMA Santo Fransiskus Asisi Pontianak. The research method was Quasi Experimental Design with Nonequivalent Control Group Design. Samples were taken by means of purpossive sampling.

Casts generally are used on these patients for one of two reasons: 1) to increase range of motion with the use of serial casting or 2) to augment functional treatment with the use of inhibitive casting. This clinical report describes serial and inhibitive casts and introduces a precasting <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> that promotes the selection of appropriate casting patients and necessary planning. The <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> guides the therapist through an assessment of patient data relevant to casting, including passive range of motion, postural tone and abnormal reflexes, and voluntary movement. The precasting <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> helps therapists gain expertise in casting by familiarizing them with the factors to consider before casting, encouraging them to set goals for casting, and helping them to determine whether the goals were met.
