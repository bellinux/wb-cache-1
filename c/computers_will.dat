5|$|Dive {{computers}} {{also provide}} a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. If the diver exceeds a no-decompression limit, decompression additional to the ascent rate will be necessary.

5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} Kurzweil's {{track record}} with predictions, {{his ability to}} extrapolate technology trends, and his clear explanations. However, there was disagreement on whether <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> one day be conscious. Philosophers John Searle and Colin McGinn insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a conscious machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known Chinese room argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that computers can only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of {{the vision of the}} book.|$|E
25|$|When Warwick {{presented}} the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of Robots {{in the year}} 2000, the lectures were well received by some. However, in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is {{a danger to the}} public perception of science. Due to Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> never have. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures.|$|E

(The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that.

Dollar figures are in 1999 dollars.

As computational power continues to grow, machine intelligence will represent an ever-larger percentage of total intelligence on the planet. Ultimately {{it will lead to}} the Singularity, a merger between biology and technology, which Kurzweil predicts will occur in 2045.

Similarly in 2009 he says there is interest and speculation about the Turing test, by 2019 there are [...] "prevalent reports" [...] of computers passing the test, but not rigorously, while by 2029 machines [...] "routinely" [...] pass the test, although there is still controversy about how machine and human intelligence compare.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient distributed multiple selection algorithm designed to select multiple keys simultaneously from different data sets which are distributed to many computers in a peer-to-peer system. The communication time is usually {{much longer than}} the computation time and is thus a major criterion for measuring {{the performance of a}} distributed algorithm. The objective of this algorithm is {{to reduce the number of}} communication messages. The algorithm makes use of statistical knowledge and results in a smaller communication overhead compared with existing algorithms. In this algorithm, each <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> select keys as pivots (candidates for the answers) according to statistical knowledge and transmit them to other computers in the system. Each <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> compare each pivot with key values in its local file and respond by transmitting ranks to the originating computer. The originating <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> calculate the global ranks and verify whether the pivots are the answers. Each <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> broadcast once sequentially in each round. This broadcasting process will be repeated until all answers are found. Complexity analyses are presented to provide theoretical upper bounds of this algorithm. The correctness of the theoretical predication is verified by experiments with 40 computers connected using Web technologies...|$|R

2500|$|In SGML, XML, and HTML, the {{ampersand}} is used {{to introduce}} an SGML entity. The HTML and XML encoding for the ampersand character is the entity [...] "&amp;". This can create a problem known as delimiter collision when converting text {{into one of these}} markup languages. For instance, when putting URLs or other material containing ampersands into XML format files such as RSS files the & must be replaced with &amp; or they are considered not well formed, and <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> be unable to read the files correctly. SGML derived the use from IBM Generalized Markup Language, which was one of many IBM-mainframe languages to use the ampersand to signal a text substitution, eventually going back to System/360 macro assembly language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{upper end}} {{is related to}} the {{stringent}} requirements of choosing keys used in encryption. [...] In 1999, an Electronic Frontier Foundation project broke 56-bit DES encryption in less than a day using specially designed hardware. In 2002, distributed.net cracked a 64-bit key in 4 years, 9 months, and 23 days. As of October 12, 2011, distributed.net estimates that cracking a 72-bit key using current hardware will take about 45,579 days or 124.8 years. Due to currently understood limitations from fundamental physics, there is no expectation that any digital computer (or combination) will be capable of breaking 256-bit encryption via a brute-force attack. Whether or not quantum <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> {{be able to do so}} in practice is still unknown, though theoretical analysis suggests such possibilities.|$|E
