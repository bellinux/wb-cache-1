The test data were also {{used to create a}} theoretical 5 -mode cycle baseline. The emissions data in the framework of the theoretical 5 -mode cycle were emphasized. There is {{no significant difference in the}} test results produced by data exhibited on the 7 -mode cycle or 5 -mode cycle. The 5 -mode cycle was slightly more conservative for the carbon monoxide pollutant than the 7 -mode cycle. The data were evaluated to determine which mode(s) had the greatest influence on improving general aviation piston engine emissions. Improvements that were achieved as a result of making lean-out adjustments to the fuel metering device were: (1) taxi mode only, (2) taxi and approach modes combined, and (3) leaning-out of the <b>climb</b> <b>mode</b> to best power...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations into}} {{the development of a}} versatile scansorial mobile robot and real-time realisation of a control system for different configurations of the robot namely <b>climbing</b> <b>mode,</b> walking mode and steering mode. The mobile robot comprises of a hybrid leg and wheel mechanism with innovative design that enables it to interchange its configuration to perform the specific tasks of pole <b>climbing</b> in <b>climbing</b> <b>mode,</b> walking and step <b>climbing</b> in walking <b>mode,</b> and skid steering and inclined slope <b>climbing</b> in steering <b>mode.</b> The motivation of this research is due to the surrounding environment which is not always structured for exploration or navigation missions, and thus poses significant difficulty for the robot to manoeuvre and accomplish the intended task. Hence, the development of versatile scansorial robot with a flexible and interchangeable configuration can provide a broad range of applications and locomotion system and to achieve the mission objective successfully. The robot design consists of four arms/legs with wheel attached at each end-effector and has two link manipulation capability. In <b>climbing</b> <b>mode,</b> the arms are configured as grippers to grip the pole and wheels accelerate to ascend or descend. The climbing angle is monitored to retain the level of the robot while climbing. However, in walking mode, the arms are configured as legs and the wheels are disabled. By implementing a periodic walking gait, the robot is capable of performing stable walking and step <b>climbing.</b> In steering <b>mode,</b> the arms are configured as suspension and the wheels are used for manoeuvring. In this mode, the skid steering system is used to enable the robot perform the turn. The versatile scansorial robot’s configurations and locomotion capabilities are assessed experimentally in real time implementation using the physical prototype. The experiments provided demonstrate the versatility of the robot and successfully fulfill the aims and objectives of the research...|$|R

Lianas are common in the tropical moist deciduous and rain forests, which are competing with other forest trees. Little information is known on the habitat specialization in tropical lianas diversity and the root causes for variation among forests in liana species composition. A total of 170 liana species (≥ 1. 5 cm girth at breast height) representing 109 genera and 43 families were reported in 5 × 5 m quadrate samples along with their <b>climbing</b> <b>modes</b> in the tropical forests of northern Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 210 grids were sampled in study area and reported that Convolvulaceae was the dominant family with 23 species followed by Papilionaceae, 22 species and Asclepiadaceae, 19 species and Ipomoea was the largest genera. Woody lianas were dominated by 128 species and these are classified into six <b>climbing</b> <b>modes</b> consisting in stem climbers (53. 5 %) that were the most predominant followed by stragglersunarmed (14. 7 %), stragglers armed and tendril climbers (13. 5 % each), root climbers (2. 9 %) and hook climbers (1. 8 %). The most dominant liana species in the northern Eastern Ghats were Acacia sinuata and Bauhinia vahlii.

Understanding functional traits of species that colonize at different points in succession can provide insight into community assembly. Although studies on functional traits during forest succession have focused on trees, lianas (woody vines) also contribute strongly to forest biomass, species richness, and dynamics. We examined life history traits of lianas in a forest chronosequence in Costa Rica to determine which traits vary consistently over succession. We conducted 0. 1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites. To examine the establishment of young individuals, we only included small lianas (0. 5 - 1. 5 cm diameter at 1. 3 m height). For each species, we identified seed size, dispersal <b>mode,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>mode,</b> and whether or not the seedling is self-supporting. We found a strong axis of variation determined by seed size and seedling growth habit, with early successional communities dominated by small-seeded species with abiotic dispersal and climbing seedlings, while large-seeded, animal-dispersed species with free-standing seedlings increased in abundance with stand age. Contrary to previous research and theory, we found a decrease in the abundance of stem twiners and no decrease in the abundance of tendril-climbers during succession. Seed size appears to be a better indicator of liana successional stage than <b>climbing</b> <b>mode.</b> Liana life history traits change predictably over succession, particularly traits related to seedling establishment. Identifying whether these trait differences persist into the growth strategies of mature lianas is an important research goal, with potential ramifications for understanding the impact of lianas during tropical forest succession. © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation...|$|R

A total of 111 climbers, constituting 63 lianas and 48 vine species, under 35 families, were recorded. The forest and wasteland vegetation were quite similar in regard with climber diversity. Family Convolvulaceae included a maximum of 19 climbers. Majority of twining climbers showed right-handed twining.   The wasteland vegetation was most suitable and quite similar to forest habitat for vines as well as for lianas. The right handed circumnutation was the dominant pattern among the twiners of the region. Local climbing flora provides considerable natural resource to the region.

Introduction This paper deals with fast mode transitions of a thrust vectored aircraft. Commercial and military aircraft operate in different modes during flight, corresponding to flight regime, controlled variables and used actuators. In a landing mode, for example, the controlled variables would be the position of the aircraft with respect to the runway.

The free wake of the blades is simulated by a lattice of shed and trailing vortices. The method is applied to a two-blade and the four-blade BO 105 hingeless rotor in hover. The four-blade rotor has also been studied in the forward flight descent and <b>climb</b> <b>modes.</b> Prediction of pressure distribution on blade surface during hover agrees very well with wind tunnel test data and Euler solver results. Results for descent flight where severe blade vortex interaction (BVI) takes place are in fair agreement with the experiment. The time stepping scheme employed permits a detailed study of the wake development. This is done for the descent case to indicate areas of possible severe BVI. No restrictions are placed on the prescribed blade motion, blade profile, planform, twist etc. so that a single code can treat multiblade rotors {{in a variety of}} flight conditions...|$|R

40|$|Special-purpose robot hands (end effectors) {{now under}} {{development}} {{are intended to}} enable robots to traverse cliffs much as human climbers do. Potential applications for robots having this capability include scientific exploration (both on Earth and other rocky bodies in space), military reconnaissance, and outdoor search and rescue operations. Until now, enabling robots to traverse cliffs has been considered too difficult a task because of the perceived need of prohibitively sophisticated planning algorithms as well as end effectors as dexterous as human hands. The present end effectors are being designed to enable robots to attach themselves to typical rock-face features with less planning and simpler end effectors. This advance {{is based on the}} emulation of the equipment used by human climbers rather than the emulation of the human hand. Climbing-aid equipment, specifically cams, aid hooks, and cam hooks, are used by sport climbers when a quick ascent of a cliff is desired (see Figure 1). Currently two different end-effector designs have been created. The first, denoted the simple hook emulator, consists of three "fingers" arranged around a central "palm. " Each finger emulates the function of a particular type of climbing hook (aid hook, wide cam hook, and a narrow cam hook). These fingers are connected to the palm via a mechanical linkage actuated with a leadscrew/nut. This mechanism allows the fingers to be extended or retracted. The second design, denoted the advanced hook emulator (see Figure 2), shares these features, but it incorporates an aid hook and a cam hook into each finger. The spring-loading of the aid hook allows the passive selection of the type of hook used. The end effectors can be used in several different modes. In the aid-hook mode, the aid hook on one of the fingers locks onto a horizontal ledge while the other two fingers act to stabilize the end effector against the cliff face. In the cam-hook mode, the broad, flat tip of the cam hook is inserted into a non-horizontal crack in the cliff face. A subsequent transfer of weight onto the end effector causes the tip to rotate within the crack, creating a passive, self-locking action of the hook relative to the crack. In the advanced hook emulator, the aid hook is pushed into its retracted position by contact with the cliff face as the cam hook tip is inserted into the crack. When a cliff face contains relatively large pockets or cracks, another type of passive self-locking can be used. Emulating the function of the piece of climbing equipment called a "cam" (note: not the same as a "cam hook"; see Figure 1), the fingers can be fully retracted and the entire end effector inserted into the feature. The fingers are then extended as far as the feature allows. Any weight then transferred to the end effector will tend to extend the fingers further due to frictional force, passively increasing the grip on the feature. In addition to the <b>climbing</b> <b>modes,</b> these end effectors can be used to walk on (either on the palm or the fingertips) and to grasp objects by fully extending the fingers...|$|R

40|$|Lianas are an {{important}} growth form in tropical forests around the world. However, they are relatively unknown in south-east Asia. We identified, measured and determined the <b>climbing</b> and dispersal <b>modes</b> for lianas in five 0. 1 -ha plots in three common forest types at the tropical-temperate transitional zone in Xishuangbanna, SW China, namely, montane forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest and seasonally wet forest. Liana diversity in the three forests combined was high; we found a total of 147 liana species, representing 48 families and 75 genera. The mean density of lianas was 3407 ha- 1 and varied significantly between the three forests, with 445, 276 and 301 individuals 0. 1 ha- 1 in the seasonally wet, montane and evergreen forests respectively. Similarity coefficients between the forests were low and mean species richness varied among different forests, indicating that species turnover among the forests was high. In all three forests, most lianas were stem twiners and scramblers, with relatively few hook, tendril and root climbers. Liana species were mostly wind dispersed in the evergreen forest but were animal and gravity dispersed {{in the other two}} forests. Compared with other Asian tropical forests, the diversity and abundance of lianas are relatively high in Xishuangbanna, which {{may be due to the}} warm climate as well as high seasonal rainfall and high rates of disturbance and forest fragmentatio...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} {{has been used}} extensively {{in the study of}} bone loading and implant performance, such as in the femur. The boundary conditions applied vary widely, generally producing excessive femoral deformation, and although {{it has been shown that}} the muscle forces influence femoral deflections and loading, little consideration has been given to the displacement constraints. It is hypothesised that careful application of physiologically-based constraints can produce physiological deformation, and therefore straining, of the femur. Joint contact forces and a complete set of muscle forces were calculated based on the geometry of the Standardized Femur using previously validated musculoskeletal models. Five boundary condition cases were applied to a finite element model of the Standardized Femur: A) diaphyseally-constrained with hip contact and abductor forces; B) case A plus vasti forces; C) case A with complete set of muscle forces; D) distally-constrained with all muscle forces; E) physiological constraints with all muscle forces. It was seen that only the physiological boundary conditions, case E, produced physiological deflections (< 2. 0 mm) of the femoral head in both the coronal and sagittal planes, which resulted in minimal reaction forces at the constrained nodes. Strains in the mid-diaphysis varied by up to 600 micro-strain under walking loads and 1000 micro-strain under stair <b>climbing</b> loads. The <b>mode</b> of loading, as indicated by the strain profiles on the cortex also varied substantially under these boundary conditions, which has important consequences for studies that examine localised bone loading such as fracture or bone remodelling simulations...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are {{under-represented}} in many global datasets that underpin {{knowledge in}} functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested {{a set of}} hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major biogeographical {{regions of the world}} using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, <b>climbing</b> mechanism, dispersal <b>mode,</b> and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major biogeographical regions of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between biogeographical regions. SLA and seed mass were the only two traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad biogeographical regions. Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between biogeographical regions, and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others. 15 page(s...|$|R
