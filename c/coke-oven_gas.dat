Meanwhile, in the United States, the Shell Chemical Company (founded 1929) began the world's first production of ammonia from natural gas in California in 1931. It also started production of chemical solvents from refinery gases in California during the early 1930s while in 1942 it pioneered the production of butadiene, a key raw material for synthetic rubbers. In 1941, production of Teepol liquid detergent began at Stanlow in the UK, the first manufacture of a petroleum-based organic chemical in Europe, Teepol is now manufactured by Teepol Products UK based in Orpington Kent, from there it is sold worldwide. In the decades that have followed, Shell Chemicals companies have been significant players {{in the growth of}} the global petrochemicals sector and have developed some of its key manufacturing processes.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} economy of the {{hydropyrolysis}} process by reducing the hydrogen cost, it has been suggested to use <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> instead of pure hydrogen. The results presented here describe some characteristics of the chars obtained by pyrolysis carried out at 765 °C under 3 MPa of various gas mixtures simulating <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> composition. The char obtained after pyrolysis under <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> pressure is not fundamentally different from those obtained under inert or hydrogen pressure, at least in porosity, optical texture and oxyreactivity in fixed and fluidized beds. The results show clearly the possibility of using <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> for coal pyrolysis and lead to the conclusion that synergy between metallurgical cokemaking and 'creaming-off' coal by hydropyrolysis will be profitable to both processes.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{combustion}} and pollutant gases {{generation in}} a recovery combustion systems burning residual steel gases has been investigated. These artificial fuels {{are characterized by}} reduced lower heating values and high content of nitrogen (N 2) and sulphuratted hydrogen (H 2 S). For a steady combustion of these fuels in the furnace there is also used an amount of natural gas. During the combustion of the two artificial fuels results {{a large amount of}} nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphure dioxide (SO 2). To help understand the combustion of this particular type of fuels, in this paper, it has been analyzed numerically the interaction of the turbulent flow processes, the heat transfer and the combustion with the mechanism of NO formation. The simulation results are compared with experimental results.

40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI), {{together}} with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion Incorporated (formerly Peabody Engineering Corporation), the University of Utah, and Far West Electrochemical have developed and demonstrated an innovative combustion system suitable {{for natural gas}} and <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> firing within the steel industry. The combustion system is a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient burner that can reduce NOx by more than 75 %. The U. S. steel industry needs to address NOx control at its steelmaking facilities. A significant part of NOx emissions comes from gas-fired boilers. In steel plants, byproduct gases – blast furnace gas (BFG) and <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> (COG) – are widely used {{together with}} natural gas to fire furnaces and boilers. In steel plants, natural gas can be fired together with BFG and COG, but, typically, the addition of natural gas raises NOx emissions, which can already be high because of residual fuel-bound nitrogen in COG. The Project Team has applied its expertise in low-NOx burners to lower NOx levels for these applications by combining advanced burner geometry and combustion staging with control strategies tailored to mixtures of natural gas and byproduct fuel gases. These methods reduce all varieties of NOx – thermal NOx produced by high flame temperatures, prompt NOx produced by complex chain reactions involving radical hydrocarbon species and NOx from fuel-bound nitrogen compounds such as ammonia found in COG. The Project Team has expanded GTI’s highly successful low-NOx forced internal recirculation (FIR) burner, previously developed for natural gas-fired boilers, into facilities that utilize BFG and COG. For natural gas firing, these burners {{have been shown to}} reduce NOx emissions from typical uncontrolled levels of 80 - 100 vppm to single-digit levels (9 vppm). This is done without the energy efficiency penalties incurred by alternative NOx control methods, such as external flue gas recirculation (FGR), water injection, and selective non-catalytic reduction. The FIR burner was previously demonstrated on firetube and watertube boilers, and these units are still operating at several industrial and commercial boiler sites in sizes ranging from 2. 5 to 60 million Btu/h. This report covers the development of an innovative combustion system suitable for natural gas or <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> firing within the steel industry. The prototype FIR burner was evaluated on a 20 million Btu/h watertube boiler. Acceptable burner performance was obtained when firing natural gas and simulated <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas</b> doped with ammonia. The laboratory data reveals a direct relationship between NOx formation and the ammonia concentration in the fuel. In addition, NOx formation increases as the primary stoichiometric ratio (PSR) increases. Representative ammonia concentrations, as documented in the steel industry, ranged from 200 to 500 vppm. When the laboratory burner/boiler was operated with 500 vppm ammonia in the fuel, NOx emissions ranged from 50 to 75 vppm. This, conservatively, is 75 % less than state-of-the-art burner performance. When the burner is operated with 200 vppm ammonia in the fuel, the corresponding NOx emissions would range from 30 to 45 vppm, 84 % less than present burner technology. During field evaluation on a 174 million Btu/h industrial prototype burner both natural gas and actual COG from on-site generation were tested. Despite the elevated hydrogen cyanide and ammonia content in the COG throughout the test program, the FIR burner showed an improvement over baseline emissions. At full load; 167 million Btu/h, NOx emissions were relatively low at 169 vppm. This represents a 30 % reduction compared to baseline emissions not accounting for the higher hydrogen cyanide content in the COG. CO emissions remained below 20 vppm and were stable across the firing range. This represents a 68 % reduction compared to baseline CO emissions. When firing natural gas, emissions were stable as firing rate increased over the range. At low fire; 45 million Btu/h, NOx emissions where 33 vppm and increased at full load; 144 million Btu/h, to 49 vppm. CO emissions fluctuated with the oxygen content and remained below 135 vppm during all tests. The boiler’s maximum output was not achieved due to a limitation dictated by the host site natural gas supply. The FIR burner benefits the public by simultaneously addressing the problems of air pollution and energy conservation through a low-NOx combustion technology that does not increase energy consumption. Continuing activities include the negotiation of a license with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion, Incorporated (Hamworthy Peabody) to commercialize the FIR burner for steel industry applications. Hamworthy Peabody {{is one of the largest}} U. S. manufacturers of combustion equipment for boilers in the Steel Industry, and has stated their intention to commercialize the FIR burner...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{research}} and development of original small-size internal combustion engine Lombardini LGW 702. This engine was optimised for application in micro-cogeneration unit (MCU), equipped with variable-speed generator and electronic converter. The electronically controlled combustion engine in MCU works in a regime depending on the load of the generator. It has the lowest possible number of revolutions and minimum possible fuel consumption. The generator combines directly with the crankshaft of the engine. To reach stable parameters of the network, the power electronics controls and processes the variable frequency of the generator. A combustion engine powered by natural gas can utilise also a blend of natural gas and hydrogen and other alternative fuels produced from renewable sources of energy, e. g. synthesis gases. A comparison of engine parameters was made, namely parameters of engines powered by the above-mentioned alternative fuels, such as syngas, <b>coke-oven</b> <b>gas,</b> landfill gas, sewer gas, Hythane and natural gas. A new three-phase variable-speed generator and converter for micro-cogeneration unit were developed. The rated electric power of MCU is 4 kW. The power overload is 80 %, compared to rated power. In the case of natural gas, the best electric efficiency is 25 %, the thermal efficiency is 65 % and the total efficiency of MCU is more than 90 %...|$|E
