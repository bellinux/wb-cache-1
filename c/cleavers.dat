5|$|Karnataka's pre-history {{goes back}} to a paleolithic hand-axe culture {{evidenced}} by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and <b>cleavers</b> in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also {{been found in the}} state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{innovation}} {{associated with}} Acheulean hand-axes {{is that the}} stone was worked symmetrically and on both sides.

50|$|<b>Cleaver</b> {{began his}} {{undergraduate}} studies at Antioch College in 1962, graduating with a bachelor's {{degree in economics}} in 1967.

From 1964-965, <b>Cleaver</b> studied abroad at the University of Montpellier where he engaged with the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France. In 1967, <b>Cleaver</b> enrolled at Stanford University to begin a Ph.D. in economics. While at Stanford, <b>Cleaver</b> was active in the Anti-war Movement. As a student activist opposed to the Vietnam War, <b>Cleaver</b> protested the Stanford Research Institute's alleged connection to the United States Department of Defense, which became the impetus for his dissertation research into the connections between the Green Revolution and social engineering. <b>Cleaver's</b> frustrations with mainstream economic theory during this period in his studies lead him to embrace Marxism.|$|R
25|$|Lythronax {{is known}} from some large teeth. It has been stated that these resembled banana-shaped meat <b>cleavers,</b> {{although}} somewhat smaller. Its teeth are serrated, but also quite beefy. It {{is suggested that}} they weren’t just for slicing off meat, but also for inflicting damage and crushing bone. The shape of the teeth would have made Lythronax an efficient hunter; {{it would have been}} able to carve out huge chunks of flesh and bone and swallow whole.|$|E
25|$|Leave It to Beaver {{is set in}} the fictitious {{community}} of Mayfield and its environs. The principal setting is the Cleaver home. The <b>Cleavers</b> live in two houses over the series' run. The move was necessary when the façade of the original house, located at Republic Studios. became unavailable for filming following the production's move to Universal. The new house stood on the Universal backlot. The address of the first house is 485 Mapleton (sometimes Maple) Drive, and the second at 211 Pine Street.|$|E

25|$|The refuge {{region has}} been {{inhabited}} by humans for 11,000 years, and 58,000 stone {{artifacts from the}} Folsom period have been recovered from the refuge since 1989. Many of the stone tools are made from {{what is known as}} Knife River Flint, a sturdy but relatively easily worked stone from which Paleo Indians fabricated spear points, meat <b>cleavers</b> and other implements. Western North Dakota has the only large concentrations of this glass-like caramel-colored stone, and similar stone tools made from these deposits have been found as far away as the states of New York and New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{constitute}} an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They {{are particularly important}} in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites.) Hand axes, chopping tools and trihedral picks are considered core utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer to flake tools as micro industry, {{as opposed to the}} more general size referred to as macro industry, which includes hand axes and <b>cleavers.</b> However, some scrapers are as big as hand axes.|$|E

25|$|Tool types {{found in}} Acheulean assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to {{the shapes of}} the final tool), <b>cleavers,</b> {{retouched}} flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated with the tools but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include chalcedony, quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the toolmakers worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the Acheulean was a set of skills passed between individual groups.|$|E
500|$|A late {{change in}} the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, {{becoming}} the eighth female cox {{in the history of}} the race.

2500|$|Chimpanzees in the Nimba Mountains of Guinea, Africa, {{use both}} stone and wooden <b>cleavers,</b> {{as well as}} stone anvils, to chop up and reduce Treculia fruits into smaller {{bite-sized}} portions. These fruits, which can be {{the size of a}} [...] volleyball and weigh up to 8.5kg, are hard and fibrous. But, despite lacking a hard outer shell, they are too large for a chimpanzee to get its jaws around and bite into. Instead, the chimpanzees use a range of tools to chop them into smaller pieces. This is the first account of chimpanzees using a pounding tool technology to break down large food items into bite-sized chunks rather than just extracting it from other unobtainable sources such as baobab nuts. It is also the first time wild chimpanzees have been found to use two distinct types of percussive technology, i.e. movable <b>cleavers</b> against a non-movable anvil, to achieve the same goal.
