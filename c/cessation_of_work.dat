2500|$|Part III of the CLPTA {{deals with}} illegal strikes and lock-outs in {{essential}} services. Section 5 of the Act defines a strike as [...] "the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by {{a body of}} persons employed in any essential service acting in combination, or a concerted refusal or a refusal under a common understanding {{of a number of}} persons who are or who have been so employed to continue to work or to accept employment", and a lock-out as [...] "the closing of a place of employment or the suspension of work, or the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employed by him in consequence of a trade dispute, done with a view to compelling those persons, or to aid another employer in compelling persons employed by him, to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment". Essential services are any services, businesses, trades, undertakings, manufactures or callings included in Part I of the First Schedule to the Act, namely: ...|$|E
60|$|The blight of {{hard times}} was {{on all the}} neighborhood. The {{families}} not involved in one strike were touched by some other strike or by the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in some dependent trade. Many single young men who were lodgers had drifted away, thus increasing the house rent of the families which had sheltered them.|$|E
60|$|The fleet in the harbour was now an {{imposing}} one. Not {{only were the}} English and French squadrons there, but some Italian ships of war had arrived, and a United States cruiser; and on the 7th of July, Sir Beauchamp Seymour sent in a decisive message, that he should commence a bombardment of the fort unless the strengthening of the fortifications was, at once, abandoned. No heed was taken of the intimation and, three days later, he sent an ultimatum demanding the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and the immediate surrender of the forts nearest to {{the entrance to the}} harbour; stating that, if these terms were not complied with in twenty-four hours, the bombardment would commence.|$|E
50|$|Mrs Ford {{worked from}} September to July on {{successive}} fixed term contracts for 8 academic {{years as a}} part-time lecturer at the Warwickshire College of Further Education until September 1979. Then she was told her contracts would not be renewed. Given the summer breaks, the question was whether her summer holiday breaks counted as merely temporary <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> She sought to claim her dismissal was unfair, but was told that her year long fixed term contract {{was not enough to}} meet the necessary qualifying period.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s there were {{plans to expand}} the village, which were {{strongly}} opposed by the residents at the time, who formed the protest group 'Cossington In Distress'. The residents were successful in bringing about the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> and the village remains a peaceful community to this day.|$|R
60|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the month}} the Plague spread rapidly, and all work ceased in the parishes most affected. But, just as it had raged for weeks in the Western parishes outside the City, so it seemed {{restricted}} by certain invisible lines, after it had made its entry within the walls, and while it raged in some parts others were entirely unaffected, and here shops were open, and the streets still retained something of their usual appearance. There had been great want among the poorer classes, owing to the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> especially along the riverside. The Lord Mayor, some of the Aldermen, and most other rich citizens had hastened to leave the City. While many of the clergy were deserting their flocks, and many doctors their patients, others remained firmly at their posts, and worked incessantly, and did all that was possible in order to check the spread of the Plague and to relieve the distress of the poor.|$|E
60|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} of the Syndicalist methods is the strike. Ordinary strikes, for specific objects, are regarded as rehearsals, as a means of perfecting organization and promoting enthusiasm, but even when they are victorious so far as concerns the specific point in dispute, they are not regarded by Syndicalists as affording any ground for industrial peace. Syndicalists aim at using the strike, not to secure such improvements of detail as employers may grant, but to destroy the whole system of employer and employed and win the complete emancipation of the worker. For this purpose what is wanted is the General Strike, the complete <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by a sufficient proportion of the wage-earners to secure the paralysis of capitalism. Sorel, who represents Syndicalism too much {{in the minds of the}} reading public, suggests that the General Strike is to be regarded as a myth, like the Second Coming in Christian doctrine. But this view by no means suits the active Syndicalists. If they were brought to believe that the General Strike is a mere myth, their energy would flag, and their whole outlook would become disillusioned. It is the actual, vivid belief in its possibility which inspires them. They are much criticised for this belief by the political Socialists who consider that the battle is to be won by obtaining a Parliamentary majority. But Syndicalists have too little faith in the honesty of politicians to place any reliance on such a method or to believe in the value of any revolution which leaves the power of the State intact.|$|E

5000|$|Moreover, this {{demographic}} decline {{was clearly}} {{felt in the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> planning <b>work</b> {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In the first half of the 20th century, Aigrefeuille d'Aunis entered a period of lethargy and the commune stagnated. The sumptuous period <b>of</b> major urban <b>work</b> undertaken during the second half of the 19th century which was a [...] "golden age" [...] for the town was over.|$|R
5000|$|On the 27th November 2009 a {{group of}} around 300 artists, writers, and {{painters}} gathered in the Plaza Mayor of Murcia. The outcome was the [...] "Manifesto for San Esteban".

5000|$|The main route {{would have}} gone through Woonsocket, Rhode Island to {{downtown}} Providence, with a branch around the west side to the docks south of downtown.

50|$|If {{a number}} of workers engage in a concerted <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{for the purpose of}} obtaining some {{concession}} from their employer, they are deemed to be on strike. Under the common law, striking workers need not be paid. The common law also allowed employers summarily to dismiss striking employees, but this has since been changed by the Labour Relations Act 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The lead {{ship was}} laid down on 18 November 1938, but the rapid arrival of World War II {{led to a}} slow down of {{construction}} and the ultimate <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that came in June 1940 as the country capitulated to German invasion.

50|$|Construction was re-initiated by Hitachi, Ltd., but the 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis led to <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in December 1997. When work was resumed in July 1998, MTrans Holdings took over, locally manufacturing its own rolling stock and completing {{the project to}} save cost; the line was completed {{at a cost of}} MYR 1.18 billion. As the line was opened in 2003, it was agreed that the parent company and owner of the KL Monorail Line, KL Infrastructure Group, would hold a 40-year concession to operate the monorail. The line and number of stations remains unchanged since 2003.|$|E
50|$|About {{three months}} after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> {{arrangements}} were made with others under which the well was completed and brought into production. In June 1950, a receiver was appointed to sell the oil won, and, subject to stated deductions, to deposit the proceeds in a special trust account to the credit of the action. The plaintiff's action did not come to trial until more than six years had elapsed from the registration of the lien, and no renewal statement had been filed as required by what was then s. 29(7) of The Mechanics' Lien Act of Alberta.|$|E

60|$|Then one lad {{had some}} bantering word, or another pictured what the Tories {{might be doing}} and thinking, while a third {{proposed}} that the enemy would wait before attacking, until reinforcements could come from England, and so the time went on with many a quip and jest; but no <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> until {{about an hour and}} a half after daybreak, when the British battery of six guns on Copp's hill opened upon us as if beginning the battle.|$|R
50|$|Fonotipia Records. De Lucia also {{recorded}} 30 Neapolitan songs for the Fonotipia label (later subsumed by Odeon Records).

The De Lucia titles had the catalogue numbers 92695 to 92724. The 92000 sequence was cut between 1907 and 1914 on the characteristic ten-and three-quarter-inch Fonotipia record format, and De Lucia's were made in 1911 after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> his <b>work</b> for the Gramophone Company. Some of these duplicate the HMV and Phonotype recordings.|$|R
