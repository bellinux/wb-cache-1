50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and {{steering}} gearbox as the M113, but utilized a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark powershift transmission. The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A hydraulic grapple attachment was later offered to fit over the cable fairleads). Or as a <b>Clam-Bunk</b> forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|E
5000|$|A skidder is {{any type}} of heavy vehicle used in a logging {{operation}} for pulling cut trees out of a forest in a process called [...] "skidding", in which the logs are transported from the cutting site to a landing. Here they are loaded onto trucks (or in times past, railroad cars or flumes), {{and sent to the}} mill. One exception is that {{in the early days of}} logging, when distances to the timberline from the mill were shorter, the landing stage was omitted altogether, and the [...] "skidder" [...] would have been used as the main road vehicle, in place of the trucks, railroad, or flume. Modern forms of skidders can pull trees with a cable/winch, just like the old steam donkeys, or a grapple or a <b>clam-bunk.</b>|$|E
