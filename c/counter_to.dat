5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} high status, running a large business enterprise.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{our experience}} using the Cray Gemini performance <b>counters</b> <b>to</b> {{gain insight into}} the network resources being used by applications. The Gemini chip consists of two network interfaces and a common router core, each providing an extensive set of performance counters. Based on our experience, we have found some of these <b>counters</b> <b>to</b> be more enlightening than others. More importantly, we have performed a set of controlled experiments to better understand what the counters are actually measuring. These experiments led to several surprises, described in this paper. This supplements the documentation provided by Cray and is essential information for anybody wishing {{to make use of}} the Gemini performance counters. We demonstrate the use of the Gemini tile performance <b>counters</b> <b>to</b> quantify the reduction in network congestion due to an improved process mapping scheme for the MiniGhost miniapp. I...|$|R
5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression.

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder.

5|$|In 1844, {{the family}} hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was {{initially}} thought {{too young to}} study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise. By the age of six, he had become fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached to the young woman; her affection for him was reportedly a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> his mother's coldness and emotional distance from him, though others assert that the mother doted on her son. Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky's work from this period, which includes his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes.|$|E

His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
