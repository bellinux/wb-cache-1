25|$|The M.23 was a small, {{conventional}} low-wing cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage, the mainwheels {{mounted on}} a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle,</b> plus a tailskid. The fin and rudder assembly were broader and shorter {{than that of the}} M.19, though the shape varied with sub-type. A wide variety of engines were fitted, with power ranging from the 28kW (38hp) ABC Scorpion two-cylinder motor to the 112kW (150hp) of the seven-cylinder Siemens Sh 14a radial.|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{locomotive}} {{was initially}} a success, although the design problems were resolved. In {{the case of}} Caledonian the vertical cylinders were placed between the frames {{in front of the}} smokebox and drove vertically mounted connecting rods attached to the leading wheels, which were also in front of the smokebox. It had a tendency to derail and had to be rebuilt with inside cylinders and a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle.</b> Vertical cylinders were the norm at this time (other builders used them too), the theory being that a horizontal or inclined arrangement would lead to premature wear due to the weight of the piston.

50|$|Later in 1914 the 511 was {{modified}} {{with a new}} pair of wings with no sweepback and a V-form (<b>cranked</b> <b>axle),</b> skidless main undercarriage, becoming the Avro 514.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the 4-6-0, Highland Railway had thus obviated the 0-6-0 type employed by practically every other British railway, except its most intense competitor, the Great North of Scotland Railway. A 0-6-0, however, would have meant a <b>crank</b> <b>axle,</b> and <b>crank</b> <b>axles</b> did not have a place in Jones' designs.|$|R
25|$|A <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> is a {{crankshaft}} which also serves {{the purpose of}} an axle. It is used on steam locomotives with inside cylinders.|$|R
25|$|On 2 April 1909, a {{passenger}} train became divided and was derailed at , Lanarkshire when the <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> of the locomotive hauling it failed. A few passengers suffered minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{cylinders}} {{were located}} externally, unlike those on English locomotives, which avoided {{the need for}} a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> that would have been expensive and difficult to manufacture. The steam engine was equipped with inside Stephenson valve gear.|$|E
50|$|The steam {{cylinders}} {{were located}} externally, unlike those on English locomotives, which avoided {{the need for}} a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> that would have been expensive and difficult to manufacture. The steam engine was equipped with inside Borsig double valve gear driven via two eccentric cams.|$|E
50|$|The F.200's fixed {{landing gear}} was conventional, with a track of 3.0 m. Each mainwheel {{was on a}} <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> {{from the corners of}} the fuselage, with a rubber shock {{absorber}} at the apex of a vertical V-strut from the wing spars. There was a small tailskid.|$|E

5000|$|On 16 July 1884, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train was derailed between [...] and , Yorkshire {{due to the}} fracture of the <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> on the locomotive hauling it. Nineteen people were killed.|$|R
500|$|On 24 April 1953, the <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> on {{the central}} driving wheel of No. 35020 [...] "Bibby Line" [...] {{fractured}} whilst approaching Crewkerne station at speed. [...] No-one was injured, but the incident resulted in the withdrawal of all Merchant Navy class locomotives from service whilst the cause was ascertained. [...] An examination of other class members showed that the fracture, caused by metal fatigue, was a common fault. [...] To cover the motive power shortage caused by the mass withdrawal of thirty locomotives, classes from other British Railways regions were drafted in to deputise. The incident resulted in a redesign and replacement of the <b>crank</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The outside {{cylinders}} {{drove the}} third pair of driving wheels while the inside cylinder drove the second pair through a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle,</b> with the cylinder mounted in an inclined position. The three cranks were arranged {{at an angle}} of 120 degrees to each other, allowing for the inclination of the inner cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The steam {{cylinder}} {{was based}} on English construction principles and located inside under {{the level of the}} axles which meant it required an expensive and heavy <b>cranked</b> <b>axle.</b> The engine drove the second coupled axle. The steam engine was probably fitted with a simple Stephenson valve gear without a steam expansion stage, which would not have permitted any control of steam admission.|$|E
5000|$|The Lorraine-Hanriot was {{powered by}} an uncowled five-cylinder [...] Lorraine 5Pc radial engine. It had fixed landing gear, with each mainwheel on a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> {{assisted}} by a trailing drag strut, both hinged {{on the central}} fuselage underside. Tall, inward-leaning oleo struts were mounted from the same upper fuselage point as the forward wing struts. The small tailskid also had an oleo shock absorber.|$|E
50|$|On 2 April 1909, {{locomotive}} No. 903 Cardean was hauling {{a passenger}} train that became divided and was derailed at , Lanarkshire {{due to the}} failure of the <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> of the locomotive. A few passengers suffered minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|It was an {{amphibian}} with retractable {{wheels on}} <b>cranked</b> <b>axles</b> with rearward drag struts hinged from the fuselage sides and with near-vertical shock absorber legs. Other struts facilitated {{the raising of}} the wheels above the waterline but no details are known.|$|R
5000|$|The Inspector's report {{allowed that}} the {{accident}} [...] "could {{not have been}} foreseen or prevented". It did however question, among other matters, the use of inside <b>cranked</b> <b>axles,</b> {{and the use of}} iron rather than steel for these important components.|$|R
50|$|The S.XII had conventional, fixed {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 4.10 m. Each wheel was mounted {{on its own}} <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> from the lower fuselage longeron and had a rearwards drag strut from that longeron. A short, vertical Messier oleo strut {{was attached to the}} forward wing strut which was reinforced at that joint by two short struts to the fuselage side. The mainwheels had Bendix brakes and the tailwheel castored.|$|E

50|$|Whilst {{this type}} of running gear did not catch on with the state railway or more {{generally}} within Europe, several advantages to the American sectional frame were identified, including better accessibility to an internally arranged running gear. As a result, {{this type of}} frame was also made use of on the batch of ten S 2/5 locomotives built by Maffei in 1904 {{as well as all}} later Bavarian four-cylinder compound locomotives. However, they differed from their American counterparts in that they were given inside cylinders and a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Railway {{use of such}} {{bearings}} continues today. The Peppercorn Class A1 Tornado replica uses {{roller bearings}} rather than the original plain bearings and these use cannon tube bearings for both the driving and bogie axles, although not for the central cylinder's <b>crank</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
25|$|On Novelty, the {{cylinders}} were mounted vertically towards {{the rear of}} the engine (to the right {{of the men in the}} illustration). Directly below were bell cranks which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the bell cranks to the <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> (the axle on the left in the illustration).|$|R
50|$|The use of {{a return}} {{connecting}} rod to a shaft beneath the boiler with overhung cranks also avoided {{the need for an}} internal crank. For Stephenson's designs, this <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> would also have carried the locomotive's weight, not being merely a crankshaft, and so this avoided a particularly difficult piece of forging work.|$|R
5000|$|The outcome, in 1870 was a {{locomotive}} with 8 ft driving wheels, {{designed specifically for}} high speed expresses between York and London. The norm {{in those days was}} inside cylinders. Not only were there frequent failures of the <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> shafts, with such large driving wheels, they would have set the boiler too high. He therefore used outside cylinders with a four-wheeled bogie for lateral stability at the front end. According to Hamilton Ellis's description entitled 'Pat Stirling's masterpiece,' the design was a version of a 2-2-2 designed by Stirling for the Glasgow and South Western Railway, 'considerably enlarged, and provided with a leading bogie.' ...|$|E
50|$|The LeO H-23-2 was an amphibious {{aircraft}} {{with conventional}} tailwheel landing gear. Each wheel, fitted with low pressure tyres and brakes, {{was on a}} <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> with a drag strut, both hinged from the hull side, and another leg which was vertical when the gear was down; the fuselage hinge also mounted an inverse V-strut, its vertex {{on the top of}} the vertical leg. All three joined the bottom end of an oblique Messier retracting shock absorber which projected inwards above the wing. Retracted, the wheel was exposed under the wing, at about 30° to it. The castoring tailwheel was attached just aft of the rear step and had a rubber shock absorber.|$|E
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the Couzinet 100 had fixed, tailwheel landing gear. When the Couzinet 100, powered by [...] Salmson 9 ADb radials made its first flight it had mainwheels in trouser fairings and relied on low pressure tyres to absorb landing shocks. One flight was enough to see its return to the factory, where a more conventional three strut arrangement was installed. The Couzinet 101 had similar gear, each wheel with a near-vertical oleo strut to the forward spar in the inner wing and a <b>cranked</b> <b>axle</b> and drag strut from the lower fuselage. The wheels, in spats, were below the outer engines with a track of 2.83 m. The mainwheels had independent brakes and the tailwheel castored on its oleo strut.|$|E
50|$|The steam {{cylinders}} {{were located}} on the outside, unlike those on English locomotives, which avoided {{the need for a}} <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> that would have been expensive and difficult to manufacture. The engine drove the second coupled axle. The steam engine was equipped with inside Borsig double valve gear driven via two eccentric cams.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 51 had fixed landing gear, with mainwheels on <b>cranked</b> <b>axles</b> {{and drag}} struts {{from the lower}} fuselage; near {{vertical}} shock absorbing legs were attached to the forward wing struts, reinforced at their tops by struts inwards to the upper fuselage. The wheels were enclosed in semi-circular fairings. There was a short tailskid.|$|R
50|$|Millholland's inventions and {{contributions}} include the cast-iron <b>crank</b> <b>axle,</b> wooden spring, plate girder bridge, poppet throttle, anthracite firebox, water grate, drop frame, and steel tires. He {{was also an}} early user and advocate of the superheater, the feedwater heater, and the injector. Several of his innovations were adopted as standard practice by the railroad industry.|$|R

John Galloway junior commented late in life that: [...] "... the trade did not seem likely to be remunerative, and we certainly did not foresee the immense possibilities of the railroad. It was generally considered that about 20 engines would be all that would be required, and competition was keenly felt at the beginning." ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, <b>cranked</b> <b>axles</b> {{mounted on a}} central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid from the lower fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|Although he had {{experimented with}} compounding, Hughes {{chose to use}} four simple {{cylinders}} here. These gave better balance and also permitted just two of outside valve gear, with the inside valves being operated by rockers. This freed up more space between the frames, allowing for a stronger <b>crank</b> <b>axle,</b> connecting rods and big ends.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} 0-6-0 locomotives had outside cylinders, {{as these}} were simpler {{to construct and}} maintain. However, once designers began to overcome {{the problem of the}} breakage of the <b>crank</b> <b>axles,</b> inside cylinder versions were found to be more stable. Thereafter this pattern was widely adopted, particularly in the United Kingdom, although outside cylinder versions were also widely used.|$|R
2500|$|Marketed {{and known}} {{by a variety}} of names (Z-cranks, P.M.P cranks, etc.) non-straight crank arms have been {{introduced}} several times. However, [...] "as long as the distance from <b>crank</b> <b>axle</b> to pedal is fixed, there is no pedaling advantage in using bent crank arms". Possible disadvantages from comparable straight crank arms include more weight and more flex.|$|R
