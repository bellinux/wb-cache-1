It examines scholarly discussions regarding peacekeeping success including conditions and criteria for successful peacekeeping and applies the factors regarding mandates to Korean peace operations in East Timor and Lebanon. The two country case studies view the results of Korean peace operations from a long-term perspective, applying relevant evaluation factors closely related to the nature of peacekeeping force activities, and avoiding evaluations based on reports from local media and Korean pro-governmental news networks. For successful peace operations, troop-contributing governments should clearly and narrowly order the scope of force activities regardless of the specific field of activity. Despite claims that use of force is needed in more violent contemporary situations, rigorous adherence to the rule of engagement by military <b>contingents</b> <b>will</b> likely create positive outcomes if the force employs friendship-building efforts along with security operations. However, for more fruitful efforts in peacekeeping operations, the military troops and their government should be more deliberate regarding capacity-building activities to most benefit sustainable development and local ownership.

40|$|Gisbertus Voetius was {{the first}} rector and 'primarius theologiae professor' of Utrecht University in its {{beginning}} years. Although he is {{regarded as one of}} the most important and influential Reformed theologians of the 17 th century, his extensive oeuvre, which predominantly resulted from active disputations practiced at young Utrecht University, remains largely unexplored. This first monograph on Voetius' dogmatic disputations analyses his concept of theology and his doctrine of God. The volume is composed of three parts. The first part describes Voetius' life and work within the context of the early modern period in Europe, thereby giving special attention to the conflict with Cartesianism and to Voetius as an important central figure of the major Dutch religious movement of his age (the 'Nadere Reformatie'). The concept of theology of Voetius is worked out in the second part. For him natural theology is in an objective sense based on divine revelation and does not form the 'artium' of supernatural theology, nor is it 'praeambula fidei' in an epistemic sense. Instead Voetius follows the medieval tradition of 'fides quaerens intellectum'. Moreover, according to its genus theology is a practical science (cf. Duns Scotus). His concept of theology is certainly neither intellectualistic nor rationalistic. Analysis of the doctrine of God of Voetius forms the core of this study in the third part. It is argued that Voetius embraces the doctrine of divine simplicity while at the same time recognizing that the divine attributes are distinct and can be grouped into two classes: regulative attributes (unity; perfection; infinity; immutability) and operative attributes (knowledge; will; right and righteousness; power). Moreover, like Duns Scotus, Voetius discerns both a contingent and a necessary dimension within the divine attributes. In this way, the role of the free and contingent divine will is pivotal: God's necessary knowledge of possible states of affairs precedes his <b>contingent</b> <b>will,</b> whereas his free and contingent knowledge of contingent states of affairs follows his will. In a similar vein, the divine will forms the axis of the distinctions between God's necessary and contingent right and his absolute and ordinate power. Thus God's necessary being can have a contingent relationship to his contingent creation while the extremes of necessitarianism and voluntarism (in the strong sense) are avoided. Moreover, Voetius rejects the Jesuit concept of 'middle knowledge' as being superfluous, dangerous and, surprisingly, as imposing necessity on God and thus on man. He argues instead that God's <b>contingent</b> <b>will</b> and decree do not necessitate human will but rather allow for its inalienable formal freedom. These findings not only confirm but also advance results of recent research on Reformed Orthodoxy (Richard A. Muller, Willem van Asselt, Antonie Vos). At the same time they falsify, with regard to one of the most outstanding figures of Reformed Scholasticism, Alexander Schweizer's thesis that the doctrine of God of these theologians has to be interpreted in terms of necessitarian determinism...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 44) While {{there has}} been considerable attention recently {{to the subject of}} meeting educational and functional adjustment needs of the hearing impaired in a hearing world, very little has been said about the communication skills of the hearing impaired and their family members. I have set up a hypothetical ten-week program designed to facilitate communication and to develop a clearer emotional, social, and psychological understanding between the deaf adolescent and those in his immediate environment. This lack of meaningful communication within a family group {{is not limited to the}} deaf alone, but is a weakness within many family units. When a deaf person is involved, however, there is an additional communication barrier. Through discussion, relaxation, and role playing exercises and a variety of self-discovery activities, it is hoped to open the emotional and psychological communication channels between the deaf adolescent and the significant persons encountered in his daily world. This program will be designed to include hearing adolescents and their parents. For the first half of the program parents of both hearing and deaf adolescents will meet as one self-contained group, and their youth participants will make up the other group. It is hoped to build a feeling of camaraderie and awareness of similar problems and behavior of the formative teen years. During the second half of the program the teen <b>contingent</b> <b>will</b> begin to meet and to communicate with the parent countergroup. It should be noted that this is a hypothetical project developed out of my own experience with deaf adolescents and their parents and my deep concern over the lack of and the need for implementation of this type of skill in communication consciousness...|$|E

The method of contingent valuation can provide information about the user's perception of value in monetary terms, and therefore comparable between services of a very different nature. This study attempts to extract the economic value that the subject, user of primary care nursing services in a public health system, attributes to this service by the method of contingent valuation, based on the perspectives of Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Accept [Compensation] (WTA). Methods/Design This is an economic study with a transversal design. The <b>contingent</b> valuation method <b>will</b> be used to estimate the user's willingness to pay (WTP) for the care received from the primary care nurse and the willingness to accept [compensation] (WTA), were this service eliminated. A survey that meets the requisites of the <b>contingent</b> valuation method <b>will</b> be constructed and pilot-tested. Subsequently, 600 interviews will be performed with subjects chosen by systematic randomized sampling from among those who visit nursing at twenty health centers with different socioeconomic characteristics in the Community of Madrid. The characteristics of the subject and of the care received that can explain the variations in WTP, WTA and in the WTP/WTA ratio expressed will be studied. A theoretical validation of <b>contingent</b> valuation <b>will</b> be performed constructing two explanatory multivariate mixed models in which the dependent variable will be WTP, and the WTP/WTA relationship, respectively. Discussion The {{identification of}} the attribution of economic value to a health service {{that does not have}} a direct price at the time of use, such as a visit to primary care nursing, and the definition of a profile of "loss aversion" in reference to the service evaluated, can be relevant elements in planning, enabling incorporating patient preferences to health policy decision-making. </p...|$|R
