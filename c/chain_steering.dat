5000|$|Roberts, {{from this}} {{experience}} of the War Office competition, had the vision to design a vehicle for the British Army which {{would be able to}} traverse unstable ground. Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where [...] two pitched chains of links and pins with cross bars and blocks of metal and wood to make contact with the ground are passed around the front and rear sprocket wheels, one {{on each side of the}} vehicle and form a track. The weight of the vehicle body (and engine) is taken by side brackets provided with curved pathways or bearing surfaces resting on rollers which, in turn, are supported on the chains, or on rollers of large diameter revolving on fixed pins. With this arrangement, when the vehicle is running the body is, so to say, rolled forward on the <b>chains.</b> <b>Steering</b> may be accomplished by varying the speed of the driving sprocket wheels on either side of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|She {{was then}} {{the first of the}} fleet to be {{modified}} to burn bunker oil and coal tar; between 8 March and 3 August 1939 Baragoola was altered to an oil burner using tar under natural draught, like the Curl Curl, Dee Why and South Steyne. Propellers of improved design were also fitted at this time. Other modifications included in 1948 the removal of her <b>chain</b> operated <b>steering</b> gear that were replaced with Brown Brothers (later known as Vickers) hydraulic equipment. In 1958, it was withdrawn for a rebuild by which included the replacement of its steam engines with English Electric 7SKM diesel-electric engines. It returned to service in 1961.|$|R
40|$|Surface plasmons are {{collective}} and coherent oscillations of conduction band electrons in metal nanostructure which enable coupling of photons to electrons at a metal dielectric interface. Plasmonic nanostructures have gained much attention {{due to their}} ability to confine, tune and manipulate light for specific applications simply by varying their geometries and local dielectric environment. This thesis will focus on designing and studying fundamental plasmonic properties of Au nanostructures for applications in photothermal cancer therapy, chemical sensing, optical waveguiding, and room temperature gas phase photocatalysis. First, this thesis focuses on spherically concentric nanoparticles, a rudimentary “nanomatryushka”, composed of a silica-coated gold nanosphere surrounded by a gold shell layer. These nanoparticles were synthesized using wet chemistry technique and were found to possess exceptional geometrically tunable optical resonances in a compact, sub- 100 nm size. Changing the internal geometry of the nanoparticle not only shifts its resonance frequencies, but can also strongly modifies the relative magnitudes of the absorption and scattering cross sections, independent of nanoparticle size. In addition the inherent asymmetry of each individual Au/SiO 2 /Au nanomatryushka generate multiple Fano resonances due to the overlapping bright superradiant and dark subradiant plasmon modes. Fano resonances have immense potential for single particle localized surface plasmon sensing applications. Next, this thesis investigates a new class of waveguiding consisting of chains of fused heptamer nanodiscs. This novel waveguiding structure transports electromagnetic energy via magnetic plasmon resonance mode. In this new geometry, heptamer structure serves as a benzene-like subdiffraction limit building blocks which support antiphase magnetic plasmons with “antiferromagnetic” behavior in multiple repeated structures. By repeating the heptamer units, this waveguide enables low-loss magnetic plasmon propagation along linear <b>chains,</b> <b>steering</b> over large-angle bends and splitting. It has numerous potential uses in energy transport, data storage, near-field microscopy, and other nanophotonic applications. Finally, this thesis explores the use of Au-photocatalysts as multifunctional catalysts for enhanced reactivity and efficiency. Au-photocatalysts were used for room temperature dissociation of H 2 on Au nanoparticle surface using visible light. Surface plasmons excited in the Au nanoparticle decay into hot electrons which can be transferred into an antibonding resonance of an H 2 molecule adsorbed on the Au nanoparticle surface, triggering dissociation. This process is probed by detecting the formation of HD molecules from the dissociations of H 2 and D 2. The rate of dissociation was also profoundly dependent on of intensity and wavelength of excitation light. This work demonstrates an important application of plasmonics in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis opening up a new pathway for all optical control of chemical reactions on metallic catalysts...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 : Middleboxes and AddressingInternational audienceThe {{migration}} of network functions (NFs) to datacenters, as promoted by Network Function Virtualization (NFV), raises {{the need for}} service <b>chaining</b> (i. e., <b>steering</b> traffic through a sequence of NFs). Service chaining is typically performed by installing forwarding entries in switches within datacenters (DCs). However, {{as the number of}} service chains in DCs grows, switches will be required to maintain a large amount of forwarding state. This will raise a dataplane scalability issue, due to the relatively small flow table size of switches. To mitigate this problem, we present a software-defined network (SDN) based source routing architecture for scalable service chaining, at which the NF-path is encoded into the packet header obviating the need for any forwarding state and lookup in the switches. We assess the feasibility and efficiency of our architecture using a prototype implementation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} the {{machinery}} of exterior differential forms, more particularly the Goursat normal form for a Pfaffian system, for solving nonholonomic motion planning problems, i. e. planning problems with non-integrable velocity constraints. We apply this technique to solving the problem of steering a mobile robot with n trailers. We present an algorithm for finding a family of transformations which will display the given system of rolling constraints on {{the wheels of the}} robot with n trailers in the Goursat canonical form. Two of these transformations are studied in detail. The Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems is dual to the so-called chained form for vector fields that we have studied in our earlier work. Consequently, we are able to give the state feedback law and change of coordinates to convert the N-trailer system into chained form. Three methods for <b>steering</b> <b>chained</b> form systems using sinusoids, piecewise constants and polynomials as inputs ar [...] ...|$|R

About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed <b>steering</b> <b>chains,</b> rendering her unable to steer.

This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked up}} and down. The bridge was his own after all. He had paid for it; and with the stem of the pipe in his hand he would stop short at times as if to listen with a {{profound}} and concentrated attention to the deadened beat of the engines (his own engines) and the slight grinding of the <b>steering</b> <b>chains</b> upon the continuous low wash of water alongside. But for these sounds, the ship might have been lying as still as if moored to a bank, and as silent as if abandoned by every living soul; only the coast, the low coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms in a bunch at the back, grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line, without a single feature to arrest attention. The native passengers of the Sofala lay about on mats under the awnings; the smoke of her funnel seemed {{the only sign of}} her life and connected with her gliding motion in a mysterious manner.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{control for}} {{automotive}} {{is one of}} the most promising research topic in the forthcoming decade. Actually, the long-term target is the substitution of most hydraulic car systems with their electronic counterparts. A bright example is set by the steering function, which has passed from pure mechanical to power assisted and recently to pure electrically power assisted function. The next step, the full electronic steering (Steer-By-Wire, SBW), is in progress. Definitively, it is going to substitute the mechanical connection with the steering wheel by wire-transmitted digital signals to one or more remote electric motors. Obviously, any innovative control strategy needs thorough hardware verification. At the early stages, or whether a real car prototype was not available, it is common practice to use hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators, for fast control prototyping. In this frame, as proposed here, a high dynamic electric drive can virtually reproduce the real nonlinear load, represented by the <b>steering</b> <b>chain</b> and other external torque contributes. The paper presents the model details, the system architecture as well as the experimental validation of the complete HIL simulator...|$|R
50|$|Tennessee became {{flagship}} of Admiral Buchanan, {{and served}} gallantly in {{action in the}} Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On that morning Tennessee and wooden gunboats , , and , steamed into combat against Admiral David G. Farragut's powerful fleet of four ironclad monitors and 14 wooden steamers. Unable to ram the Union ships because of their superior speed, Tennessee delivered a vigorous fire on the Federals at close range. The Confederate gunboats were sunk or dispersed. Farragut's fleet steamed up into the bay and anchored. Buchanan might have held Tennessee under the fort's protection but steamed after the Federal fleet and engaged despite overwhelming odds. The ram became the target for the entire Union fleet. Tennessee was rammed by several ships, and her vulnerable <b>steering</b> <b>chains</b> (which, oddly, lay in exposed trenches on the after deck) were carried away by the heavy gunfire. Unable to maneuver, Tennessee was battered repeatedly by heavy solid shot from her adversaries. With two of her men killed, Admiral Buchanan and eight others wounded, and increasingly severe damage being inflicted on her, Tennessee was forced to surrender.|$|R

500|$|About 07:40, Tecumseh {{attempted}} to close with the Tennessee by {{passing through the}} minefield, but struck a [...] "torpedo" [...] and capsized within 90 seconds. Manhattan continued to engage the fort until all but the last pair of wooden ships had cleared the obstacles. She closed {{to a range of}} about [...] from the Confederate ironclad and began firing with her one operable gun; a flake of iron had fallen into the vent hole of one of her guns and was jammed in place. One of her shots hit the Tennessee and broke the armor and its wooden backing so that daylight was visible through the side of the casemate. The shot failed to penetrate, and netting laid {{on the inside of the}} backing caught all of the splinters so that no one was injured. During the battle Manhattan fired a total of 11 shots, six at Tennessee and five at Fort Morgan. Nicholson claimed four hits, including the shot that broke the Tennessees <b>steering</b> <b>chains</b> and another that jammed her stern gun port shutter in the closed position. The monitor was hit nine times during the battle, but sustained no significant damage or casualties.|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the current}} {{international}} standards were {{applied in the}} 1930s, it was common for steering orders on ships to be given as [...] "Tiller Orders", which dictated to {{which side of the}} vessel the tiller was to be moved. Since the tiller is forward of the rudder's pivot point, and the rudder aft of it, the tiller's movement is reversed at the rudder, giving the impression that orders were given [...] "the wrong way round". For example, to turn a ship to port (its left side), the helmsman would be given the order [...] "starboard helm" [...] or [...] "x degrees starboard". The ship's tiller was then moved to starboard, turning the rudder to the vessel's port side, producing a turn to port. The opposite convention applied in France (where tribord—starboard—meant turn to starboard), but Austria and Italy kept to the English system. There was no standardisation in vessels from Scandinavian countries, where the practice varied from ship to ship. Most French vessels with steering wheels had their <b>steering</b> <b>chains</b> reversed and when under the command of a British pilot this could result in confusion.|$|R
500|$|The two Milwaukee-class ships bombarded Fort Morgan {{for about}} an hour and a half while the wooden ships passed through the mouth of Mobile Bay. Chickasaw fired 75 rounds at the fort {{beginning}} at 07:10; the return fire badly damaged her funnel so that the crew was forced to use tallow and coal tar to generate enough steam to keep the ship in the fight. She engaged the Tennessee two hours later until the ironclad surrendered at 10:40. The Confederate ironclad was shooting at the wooden ships at this time at point-blank range in a chaotic melee with both sides making multiple attempts to ram each other. Chickasaw remained off the Tennessees stern through their engagement and fired on her at ranges between [...] None of her 52 shells penetrated their target's armor, but they did jam shut several of the armored shutters that protected the aft gun ports, including the stern gun port at 09:40. Perkins claimed that his ship shot away the Tennessees flagstaff, smokestack and the exposed <b>steering</b> <b>chains</b> that controlled her rudder. Chickasaw was struck 11 times during the action, with one shot penetrating her deck that set some of the crew's hammocks on fire. Two of Chickasaws sailors, Chief Boatswain's Mate Andrew Jones and Master-at-Arms James Seanor, were later awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} gear of earlier ships's wheels sometimes {{consisted of a}} double wheel where each wheel {{was connected to the}} other with a wooden spindle that ran through a barrel or drum. The spindle was held up by two pedestals that rested on a wooden platform, often no more than a grate. A tiller rope or tiller chain (sometimes called a steering rope or <b>steering</b> <b>chain)</b> ran around the barrel in five or six loops and then down through two tiller rope/ chain slots {{at the top of the}} platform before connecting to two sheaves just below deck (one on either side of the ship's wheel) and thence out to a pair of pulleys before coming back together at the tiller and connecting to the ship's rudder. Movement of the wheels (which were connected and moved in unison) caused the tiller rope to wind in one of two directions and angled the tiller left or right. In a typical and intuitive arrangement, a forward-facing helmsman turning the wheel counterclockwise would cause the tiller to angle to starboard and therefore the rudder to swing to port causing the vessel to also turn to port (see animation). On many vessels the helmsman stood facing the rear of the ship with the ship's wheel before him and the rest of the ship behind him— this still meant that the direction of travel of the wheel at its apex corresponded to the direction of turn of the ship. Having two wheels connected by an axle allowed two people to take the helm in severe weather when one person alone might not have had enough strength to control the ship's movements.|$|R
