50|$|Many {{insurance}} companies prefer their claims adjusters {{to have a}} 4-year college degree preferably in business related fields. In the past, high school graduates have become claims adjusters by promotion from within the claims department. Since there are no college majors for claims adjusters, many states require a state certification in order to practice as an adjuster. States also require that {{a certain number of}} continuing education credits for claims adjusters are earned each year in order to maintain their license. This continuing education is achieved by attending seminars and online training from different <b>claim</b> <b>adjuster</b> educational resources. There are also professional designations that have become prevalent among claims adjusters; for example, The American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters awards the Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) designation to experienced underwriters.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognized}} design philosophies in advanced race design: hyper-growth (HG), hyper-production (HP), and tri-immune-HE. HG emphasises empire size, with high population growth rate and {{high rates of}} planet habitability. The <b>Claim</b> <b>Adjuster,</b> Hyper Expansion, and War Monger Primary Racial Traits tend toward HG, although other PRTs may also go the HG route. HP focuses on maximum potential per planet, with very good factory settings, usually sacrificing population-produced resources and small amounts of population growth rate and habitability (relative to HG). The Super Stealth PRT has the strongest tendency toward HP, although other PRTs may go the HP route. The Hyper Expansion PRT with immunity to all three environmental factors and very low population growth rate is the original heavy-hitter of advanced play, earning a perpetual mention in race design discussions. However, modern HG and HP races have surpassed it in performance, and triple immunity is no longer considered the best approach.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} for establishing reserves for {{the portion of}} loss adjustment expense as-sociated {{with the cost of}} claim adjusters. The actuar-ial literature contains very little material on how to estimate unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) reserves. The literature briefly mentions “transaction-based ” methods that require claim department time studies. However, many feel that the improvement in estimating ULAE reserves does not justify the high cost of performing such a study. Fortunately, most claim departments of major insurance carriers and third party administrators now utilize sophisticated automated work measurement tools that may capture the type of data {{that can be used to}} perform an automated time study. The first section describes a process that can be used to perform the work-study, including a discus-sion of the technical and practical issues in conduct-ing such a study. The second section shows how the results of the study can be utilized to determine <b>claim</b> <b>adjuster</b> expense reserves. Other potential applications of the claim standards will be discussed, including pric-ing unbundled claim service, allocating claim depart-ment expense to line of business for statutory and man-agement reporting purposes, and monitoring claim de-partment expenses. Changes in the NAIC definition of loss adjustment expense are also discussed in the pa-per...|$|E
40|$|This paper quantitatively {{analyzes}} {{indicators of}} Agent (policy seller), Adjuster (indemnity <b>claim</b> <b>adjuster),</b> Producer (policy purchaser/holder) indemnity behavior suggestive of collusion in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) national crop insurance program. According to guidance {{from the federal}} law and using six indicator variables of indemnity behavior, those entities equal to or exceeding 150 % of the county mean (computed using a simple jackknife procedure) on all entityrelevant indicators were flagged as "anomalous. " Log linear {{analysis was used to}} test (1) hierarchical node-node arrangements and (2) a non-recursive model of node information sharing. Chi-square distributed deviance statistic identified the optimal log linear model. The results of the applied data mining technique used here suggest that the non-recursive triplet and Agent-producer doublet collusion probabilistically accounts for the greatest proportion of waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program. Triplet and Agent-producer doublets need detailed investigation for possible collusion. Hence, this data mining technique provided a high level of confidence when 24 million records were quantitatively analyzed for possible fraud, waste, or other abuse of the crop insurance program administered by the USDA RMA, and suspect entities reported to USDA. This data mining technique can be applied where vast amounts of data are available to detect patterns of collusion or conspiracy as may be of interest to the criminal justice or intelligence agencies...|$|E

5000|$|A public {{adjuster}} is {{a professional}} <b>claims</b> handler <b>claims</b> <b>adjuster</b> who advocates for the policyholder in appraising and negotiating a claimant's insurance claim. [...] Aside from attorneys and the broker of record, public adjusters licensed by state departments of insurance are the only type of <b>claims</b> <b>adjuster</b> that can legally represent the rights of an insured during an insurance claim process. A public adjuster will be most beneficial when {{it is clear that}} the insurer will pay the claim and the only issue is the proper identification and valuation of the loss. Most public adjusters charge a percentage of the settlement. Primarily they appraise the damage, prepare an estimate and other claim documentation, read the policy of insurance to determine coverages, and negotiate with the insurance company's claims handler.|$|R
