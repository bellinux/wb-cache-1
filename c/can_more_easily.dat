25|$|Smashers {{use this}} ability to attack snails, crabs, molluscs, and rock oysters, their blunt clubs {{enabling}} them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like fish, which their barbed claws <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> slice and snag.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl {{provides}} some of the effects typical of other opioids through its agonism of the opioid receptors. Its strong potency in relation to that of morphine is largely due to its high lipophilicity, per the Meyer-Overton correlation. Because of this, it <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> penetrate the Central Nervous System.|$|E
25|$|The polymer of methyl acrylate, PMA or poly(methyl acrylate), {{is similar}} to poly(methyl methacrylate), except {{for the lack of}} methyl groups on the {{backbone}} carbon chain. PMA is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than PMMA because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> slide past each other.|$|E

25|$|Organic {{pollutants}} {{can also}} be found in groundwater as insecticides and herbicides. As many other synthetic organic compounds, most pesticides have very complex molecular structures. This complexity determines the water solubility, adsorption capacity, and mobility of pesticides in the groundwater system. Thus, some types of pesticides are more mobile than others so they <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> reach a drinking-water source.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion {{has been}} linked to higher {{sensitivity}} of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater.|$|E

25|$|The Open Build Service {{provides}} {{software developers}} with {{a tool to}} compile, release and publish their software for many distributions, including Mandriva, Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian.

It is published under the GNU GPLv2+.|$|E
25|$|Loons {{find their}} prey by sight. They eat mainly fish, {{supplemented}} with amphibians, crustaceans and similar mid-sized aquatic fauna. Specifically, {{they have been}} noted to feed on crayfish, frogs, snails, salamanders and leeches. They prefer clear lakes because they <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> see their prey through the water. The loon uses its pointy bill to stab or grasp prey. They eat vertebrate prey headfirst to facilitate swallowing, and swallow all their prey whole.|$|E
25|$|A left-handed batsman {{has more}} {{difficulty}} facing off break bowling, because the ball {{moves away from}} his body. This means that any miscalculation <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A ball bowled by a left-arm orthodox spin bowler with an off break action spins in the opposite direction. Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a left-arm orthodox spinner.|$|E

25|$|The tritium nucleus, {{containing}} one proton and two neutrons, has {{the same}} charge as the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsive force when brought close to another atomic nucleus. However, the neutrons in the tritium nucleus increase the attractive strong nuclear force when brought close enough to another atomic nucleus. As a result, tritium <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> fuse with other light atoms, compared with the ability of ordinary hydrogen to do so.|$|E
25|$|The Student Counseling and Guidance Service {{provides}} mainly {{psychological support}} and counseling to {{students on a}} variety of issues including social and academic life, family problems, adjustment difficulties, emotional problems etc. It also organizes seminars and on a regular basis that deal with stress handling, exam preparation, study time organization and many more. With the help of the Student Counseling and Guidance Service students <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> adapt to student life and surpass any problems or difficulties.

25|$|The {{first version}} of OpenGL, version 1.0, was {{released}} in January 1992 by Mark Segal and Kurt Akeley. Since then, OpenGL has occasionally been extended by releasing {{a new version of}} the specification. Such releases define a baseline set of features which all conforming graphics cards must support, and against which new extensions <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> be written. Each new version of OpenGL tends to incorporate several extensions which have widespread support among graphics-card vendors, although the details of those extensions may be changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} feedpoint of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Persons with ONJ {{may have}} either {{necrotic}} bone or bone marrow {{that has been}} slowly strangulated or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a fibrous marrow since fibres <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> live in nutrient starved areas, a greasy, dead fatty marrow (wet rot), a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone infarct, a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} to expand admissibility of bad character evidence were also opposed {{on the grounds}} of unfairness (the defendant's past bad character <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> be adduced than a witness's) and of dangerous irrelevance. The measures reforming hearsay, which were more closely modelled on the Law Commission's report than the other reforms, attracted less adverse attention, though the Bar Council disputed some of its aspects. The maximum period a suspected terrorist could be detained without charge was increased from 7 to 14 days. This was later increased to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.|$|E

25|$|Much of Calgary's {{street network}} is on a grid where roads are {{numbered}} with avenues running east–west and streets running north–south. Until 1904 {{the streets were}} named; after that date, all streets were given numbers radiating outwards from the city centre. Roads in predominantly residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result. However, it is a developer and city convention in Calgary that non-numbered streets within a new community have the same name prefix as the community itself so that streets <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> be located within the city.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, even numbers such as 8, 10 and 12 can be added. However, these {{double the}} main triad, {{and as such}} are fairly rare. 10 {{tends to be the}} most common; it can be used both in {{suspended}} chords and (with an accidental) in major or minor chords to produce a major–minor clash (e.g., C710 indicating the Hendrix chord of C–E–G–B–E). However, because of enharmonics, such chords <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily,</b> and perhaps more intuitively, be represented by 2 (or 9) for a minor over a major or 4 for a major over a minor. In any other case, an 8, 10 or 12 simply indicates the respective note from the triad doubled up one octave.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they <b>can</b> <b>more</b> <b>easily</b> take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.|$|E
