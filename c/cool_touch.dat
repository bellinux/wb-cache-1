60|$|About me {{the purple}} {{mountains}} gleamed with the fresh, <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> of the night. Between twin spurs, resting against {{the bosom of}} the sky, snow had gathered, until in the distant outline a pure, white lamb appeared, slain for the holy festival.|$|E
60|$|We {{struck out}} of the pines at half past five. Floating mist hid {{the lower end of}} the plateau. The morning had a <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> but there was no frost. Crossing Middle Canyon about half way down we jogged on. Cedar trees began to show bright green against the soft gray sage. We were nearing the dark line of the cedar forest when Jim, who led, held up his hand in a warning check. We closed in around him.|$|E
60|$|Jean's {{first sight}} of his future home thrilled him through. It was a big, low, {{rambling}} log structure standing well out from a wooded knoll {{at the edge of}} the valley. Corrals and barns and sheds lay off at the back. To the fore stretched broad pastures where numberless cattle and horses grazed. At sunset the scene was one of rich color. Prosperity and abundance and peace seemed attendant upon that ranch; lusty voices of burros braying and cows bawling seemed welcoming Jean. A hound bayed. The first <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> of wind fanned Jean's cheek and brought a fragrance of wood smoke and frying ham.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alvaro Neder awarded the album 4 {{and a half}} stars stating [...] "The {{highlights}} are the wonderful melodies, the musical sonority of his lyrics (it even doesn't matter if you understand them, as his focus is on its musicality), the smart violão of Djavan, and the rich rhythmic interplay between voice and violão. All of the compositions are great, exploring from samba to baião, and, more importantly, it's mostly an acoustic band album, with <b>cool</b> <b>touches</b> of a Rhodes.".|$|R
50|$|Though {{variations}} exist amongst some Calabrian families, the zippula {{dough is}} prepared with fresh parsley, deep-fried in a skillet, and dipped in marinara sauce {{when they are}} <b>cooled</b> to <b>touch.</b>|$|R
60|$|A dark streak {{broke the}} {{glittering}} surface, a <b>cool</b> draught <b>touched</b> Marston's face, and the slack sails swelled. Columbine began to move, and presently gathering speed, listed {{over to the}} fresh sea-breeze.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{this street}} led my eye to great snowcapped mountains, and I stopped short in my tracks, for I {{realized}} they were the Arizona peaks. Up the swelling slopes swept a black fringe that I knew to be timber. The mountains appeared to be close, but I knew that even the foot-bills were miles away. Penetier, I remembered from one of Dick's letters, was on the extreme northern slope, {{and it must be}} anywhere from forty to sixty miles off. The sharp, white peaks glistened in the morning sun; the air had a <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> of snow and a tang of pine. I drew in a full breath, with a sense on being among the pines.|$|E
60|$|It was on Thursday {{evening that}} Cork's {{seclusion}} became intolerable to him. Never a hart panted for water fountain {{as he did}} for the <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> of a drifting stein, for the firm security of a foot-rail {{in the hollow of}} his shoe and the quiet, hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars. But he must avoid the district where he was known. The cops were looking for him everywhere, for news was scarce, and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs. If they got him before Corrigan came back, the big white finger could not be uplifted; it would be too late then. But Corrigan would be home the next day, so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him.|$|E
60|$|A {{few nights}} later Philip awoke {{suddenly}} {{to find himself}} in a cold sweat, {{face to face with}} all the horrors of an excited imagination. Once more he felt his hand greedy for the soft flesh of the man he hated, tearing its way through the stiff collar, felt the demoniacal strength shooting down his arm, the fever at his finger tips. He saw the terrified face of his victim, a strong man but impotent in his grasp; heard the splash of the turgid waters; saw himself, his lust for vengeance unsatisfied, peering downwards through the dim and murky gloom. It was not only a physical nightmare which seized him. His brain, too, was his accuser. He saw with a hideous clarity that even the excuse of motive was denied him. It was a sense of personal loss which had driven him out on to that canal path, a murderer at heart. It was something of which he had been robbed, an acute and burning desire for vengeance, personal, entirely egotistical. It was not the wrong to the woman which he resented, had there been any wrong. It was the agony of his own personal misery. He rose from his bed and stamped up and down his little chamber in a fear which was almost hysterical. He threw wide open the windows, heedless of a driving snowstorm. The subdued murmur of the city, with its paling lights, brought him no relief. He longed frantically for some one who knew the truth, for Elizabeth before any one, with her soft, <b>cool</b> <b>touch,</b> her gentle, protective sympathy. He was a fool to think he could live alone like this, with such a burden to bear! Perhaps it would not be for long. The risks were many. At any moment he might hear the lift stop, steps across the corridor, the ring at his bell, the plainly-clad, businesslike man outside, with his formal questions, his grim civility. He fumbled about in his little dressing-case until he came to a small box containing several white pills. He gripped them in his hand and looked around, listening. No, it was fancy! There was still no sound in the building. When at last he went back to bed, however, the little box was tightly clenched in his hands.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars and stated [...] "The {{proceedings}} here are straight-ahead with some <b>cool</b> soul-jazz <b>touches...</b> This {{is a fine}} effort from an underappreciated trio".|$|R

500|$|The {{explosion}} as Doofenshmirtz's firecracker rocket launches {{leaves the}} lair filthy and partly destroyed; the creepy look thrills Vanessa's arriving goth friends, who find {{it to be}} <b>cool.</b> <b>Touched</b> by this, Vanessa happily thanks both her father for getting one birthday party right for her and Perry for helping her father out. As the rocket ascends, Doofenshmirtz is himself cursing Perry, as usual, but pauses to notice Love Handel singing below. The band finish their song just as Doofenshmirtz's rocket explodes with a heart-shaped flare. The episode ends with Love Handel singing [...] "Music Makes Us Better" [...] and with everyone (including Doofenshmirtz, who has survived the explosion unscathed) dancing.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{watched the}} {{maneuvers}} of the battleship from the shore, {{at the foot}} of the hotel. His glasses were strong, and he could make out regular disciplined movements of men on board. What a life, he thought. To be always waiting for war, ready for action in any part of the world, regardless of human personal ties. The monster breasting waves seemed as horrible as it was majestic. The man who was once a priest had never wished to be a soldier. This morning he sensed the command to draw anchor, felt the significance of carnage for the sea, saw the ship move. Against a skyline, clear with oncoming day, it took unchallenged sway. The man followed with his glasses. He stood fascinated by almost imperceptible motion. Against morning sky a black streamer rested, then gradually trailed to invisible distance, as broadside perspective dropped away. The man-of-war was gone. But Philip still stood on the shore. Early day had taken possession of his will. He seemed rooted to the wet sand beneath his feet. Was Isabel awake? Had she yet missed him? He looked back at the hotel, rising above lawn and palm trees. He could see no signs of life, and it occurred to him that a brisk walk might atone for his restless night. The fresh air stimulated him as he went forward. Without thought of destination he left the ocean for the esplanade, the esplanade for the long business street of the town. As he went on he began to see people and to realize for the first time that it was Sunday. Many were going to early Mass, and he was not among them. At a corner he saw a modern Catholic church. The old mission now had its rival in the new brick building. Several maids from the hotel got off a car to hurry onward. A woman in front went faster as she neared the church, but turned half round and looked at Philip. He felt her insinuating survey as he strode rapidly away; then he recognized Reginald Doan's former nurse. It was undoubtedly Maggie; and she knew him for all that he had once been. He could not be mistaken. That Maggie had deceived Isabel and followed Mrs. Grace to St. Barnabas was plain. With that lady's departure for the East, the girl must have ceased to be her maid. Maggie's surprise seemed evident; and at best the encounter was disagreeable. Philip hurried on with the sense of being watched. He walked past gardens, not seeing flowers freshened by night's <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> and morning's breath. Suddenly he was cast down, depressed by something impalpable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cool</b> <b>Touch</b> is a 1990 album, {{recorded}} by the English singer-songwriter, Leo Sayer. It was only released in the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany. It was his first album release since 1983's Have You Ever Been in Love.|$|E
40|$|It was at {{half past}} {{ten in the}} morning that they took {{me down to the}} {{operating}} room, weary with pain and numb with morphine. Upon my closed eyes I felt, for an instant, the soft, <b>cool</b> <b>touch</b> of the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s hand, succeeded immediately after by the warmth and woolliness of gauze and by the pressure of the rubber hood over my nose and chin. I wriggled a moment, coughed, and the pressure vanished. When it came again it brought with it the pungent sweetness of ether. I breathed deep, gasped and breathed deeper, gasped again and pumped for breath, my mouth open and my ears ringing...|$|E

5000|$|In The Verges review, Vlad Savov wrote [...] "the Nova is {{a good-looking}} device with a build quality that matches or exceeds {{the best in}} its {{targeted}} price range, which the company describes with the cringe-inducing language of aiming for young dynamic aspirers." [...] It concluded the Nova will be cheap enough for those who can’t afford a flagship to get it. The website Slashgear also reviewed [...] "Huawei, though, didn’t get that memo, and proceeded to aggressively challenge the status-quo {{with a number of}} devices that could compete on thinness, metal construction, and design." [...] The website Recombu said [...] "...there’s plenty of <b>cool</b> <b>touches</b> to help the Nova stand out in a crowded market." ...|$|R
60|$|Then he started, and {{a little}} thrill ran through him as he {{wondered}} {{whether it was a}} trick his eyes had played him or he saw her in the flesh. She stood close beside him, with a grey cedar trunk behind her, in a long trailing dress, but the white hat was in her hand now, and the little shapely head bared to the <b>cooling</b> <b>touch</b> of the dew. Still, she had materialized so silently out of the shadows that he almost felt afraid to move lest she should melt into them again, and he lay very still, watching her until she glanced at him. Then he sprang, awkwardly, to his feet, with a little smile.|$|R
40|$|Portable DLPTM (Digital Light ProcessingTM) {{projectors}} {{continue to}} lead the projector industry in terms of lumens/in 3 and lumens/pound. Recently announced products break the 1. 4 kg (3 lb.) barrier with brightness exceeding 1000 lumens. While the weight and volume of these products has decreased dramatically {{over the past several}} years, the power dissipation has remained unchanged or, at best, decreased only slightly. Trends in projector size and power are explored and compared to other types of portable equipment such as the laptop computer. Critical thermal design considerations are discussed including DMDTM (Digital Micromirror DeviceTM) <b>cooling,</b> lamp <b>cooling,</b> <b>touch</b> temperature requirements, fan selection, fan temperature, vent design, and acoustic challenges. Testing and analysis methods used in the design process for the system and subsystem levels are also discussed...|$|R

60|$|Lister resumed paddling. The {{girl had}} charm {{and he was}} young; if he were not cautious, {{there might be some}} risk for him. He was not a clever philanderer, and Ruth and Duveen had been kind. By and by a puff of <b>cool</b> wind <b>touched</b> his hot skin and he looked round. A black cloud had rolled up and there were lines on the water.|$|R
60|$|The {{darkness}} lightened, {{turned to}} slow-drifting haze, and lifted. Through {{a thin film}} of blue smoke she saw the rough-hewn timbers of the court roof. A <b>cool,</b> damp <b>touch</b> moved across her brow. She smelled powder, {{and it was that}} which galvanized her suspended thought. She moved, to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on Lassiter's knee, and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream. The same swift glance, shifting low, brought into range of her sight a smoking gun and splashes of blood.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{he wanted}} something. He was {{happy in the}} wet hillside, that was {{overgrown}} and obscure with bushes and flowers. He wanted to touch them all, to saturate himself with the touch of them all. He took off his clothes, and sat down naked among the primroses, moving his feet softly among the primroses, his legs, his knees, his arms {{right up to the}} arm-pits, lying down and letting them touch his belly, his breasts. It was such a fine, <b>cool,</b> subtle <b>touch</b> all over him, he seemed to saturate himself with their contact.|$|R
25|$|Electric incinerating toilets turn {{excrement}} into a {{small amount}} of ash. They are <b>cool</b> to the <b>touch,</b> have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.|$|R
50|$|Stocking up: Edema (fluid) {{retained}} in the lower legs due to reduced lymphatic drainage, often because the horse is sedentary for long periods (such as when stalled) but occasionally due to pathology.

5000|$|Complex Simplicity {{has been}} embraced by many fans, bloggers, and music critics. The album {{is said to}} be [...] "awe-inspiring and <b>cool</b> and <b>touching</b> and kind of avant-garde in a weird {{homegrown}} way." [...] Vibe called the album [...] "a great entry into the R&B game." [...] Further, Allmusic's review stated boldly that Complex Simplicity [...] "is the best R&B album of 2004—if not the best pop-oriented R&B album since CrazySexyCool." [...] The album compelled many critics to compare her to superstars and legends of R&B, including Mary J. Blige, Deniece Williams, Teena Marie, and Cherrelle.|$|R
5000|$|Some guanacos {{live in the}} Atacama Desert, {{where in}} some areas it has not rained for over 50 years. A mountainous {{coastline}} running parallel to the desert enables them to survive in what are called [...] "fog oases" [...] or lomas. Where the <b>cool</b> water <b>touches</b> the hotter land, the air above the desert is cooled, creating a fog and thus, water vapor. Winds carry the fog across the desert, where cacti catch the water droplets and lichens that cling to the cacti soak it in like a sponge. When the guanacos eat the cacti flowers and the lichens, the water is transferred to them.|$|R
60|$|Michael, his forefeet on the gunwale, barked {{to him in}} a puzzled, {{questioning}} sort of way, and Jerry whimpered back incommunicable understanding. The lady-god {{pressed his}} two flanks together reassuringly, and he turned to her, his <b>cool</b> nose <b>touched</b> questioningly to her cheek. She gathered his body close against her breast in one encircling arm, her free hand resting on the rail, half-closed, a pink- and-white heart of flower, fragrant and seducing. Jerry's nose quested the way of it. The aperture invited. With snuggling, budging, and nudging-movements he spread the fingers slightly wider as his nose penetrated into the sheer delight and loveliness of her hand.|$|R
60|$|The team plunged on, and Festing, jolting to and fro, durst not {{lift his}} eyes from the trail. The storm would {{probably}} not last long and might do some good if it were followed by moderate rain. But he was not sure that moderate rain would fall. By and by a few large drops beat upon his hat, there was a roar in the distance, and a <b>cool</b> draught <b>touched</b> his face. It died away, but the next puff was icy cold, and the roar got louder. He looked up, for he knew what was coming, but there was not a bluff in sight that would shield him from the wind.|$|R
500|$|Much of the album's {{content was}} written by Armstrong, except [...] "Emenius Sleepus" [...] written by bassist Mike Dirnt, and the hidden track, [...] "All by Myself", which was {{composed}} and written by drummer Tré <b>Cool.</b> The album <b>touched</b> upon various experiences of the band members and included subjects like anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom, mass murder, divorce, and ex-girlfriends.|$|R

60|$|He hardly {{recognized}} her face or her voice, {{but what she}} said proclaimed her to be Allie. She enveloped him. Her arms, strong, convulsive, clasped him. Up came her face, white, gleaming, joyous, strange to Neale, but he knew somehow that it was held up to be kissed. Dazedly he kissed her--felt <b>cool</b> sweet lips <b>touch</b> his lips again and then again.|$|R
50|$|Blades {{are usually}} made of {{rust-resistant}} stainless steel.Ceramic cutters are available; {{they are not}} subject to corrosion, and stay sharper longer because of a higher resistance to wear than metal blades. They remain <b>cool</b> to the <b>touch</b> even with fairly prolonged use, as ceramic is a poor heat conductor. However, ceramic blades are brittle and easily broken, and more expensive to replace than metal blades.|$|R
60|$|A {{light breeze}} touched the long swell that splashed about the coaling mole, for the range that {{runs down the}} middle of Teneriffe cut off the Trade-wind. The sun was near the {{mountain}} tops and <b>cool</b> shadow <b>touched</b> Santa Cruz. The houses on the hillside had faded to grey, but the lower town shone dazzlingly white, and the sea was like wrinkled silver. At the end of another mole, across the flatly-curving bay, a beach of black sand and a green house with balconies marked the citizens' bathing place. The correillo rode at anchor near the mole's seaward end, and an African mail boat rolled upon the sparkling swell between her and the coaling station.|$|R
5000|$|Steve Loewy of AllMusic states, [...] "While Baker's chops {{are clearly}} subpar {{there is a}} quaint romanticism to it all that somehow snares the listener. ... Baker is a more than a bit muddled in his singing, {{sounding}} as though his mouth is filled with steel wool. Yet, the feelings he displays are so pure and touching that every note is imbued with deep emotion. Most of the songs are performed slowly, sometimes heart-wrenchingly so. While Baker seems tired, there is a <b>cool,</b> raw <b>touch</b> throughout, making this a decent example of the trumpeter's later playing. His range seems even more limited than usual, too. Danko is a thorough joy, and plays splendidly in support".|$|R
