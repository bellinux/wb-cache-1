5|$|While the Apostolic Faith Mission {{was founded}} in 1908 and Pentecostalism brought to South Africa by American missionaries, several factors helped create a {{favorable}} climate for the Pentecostal movement to spread in the country. First, revivals in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (DRC) in 1860, 1874 and 1884 were characterized by deep conviction of sin followed by conversion, fervent prayer and some ecstatic phenomenon. Thus in 1908, some older DRC members were familiar and open to Pentecostalism. Second, the Dutch Reformed minister Andrew Murray was a prominent holiness teacher and helped <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> for revival. A third factor was the Zionist churches, led by John Alexander Dowie from Zion City, Illinois, United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} Securitate and Militia forces at Petroșani was doubled and {{military}} units were placed near all mines in the Jiu Valley. Securitate agents were hired as miners, {{not only to}} inform on other workers, but also to exert psychological pressures on them and even beat them before witnesses so as to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> of intimidation. A relatively large number of common criminals released from prison were brought into the mines as well. The Valley was declared a restricted area from August 4 until January 1, 1978. Strict surveillance was intended to block the flow of any information {{to the rest of}} the country or contact with the outside world, yet 22 miners acting on behalf of 800 others managed to send a letter (dated September 18) to the French newspaper Libération, which published it on October 12. Foreign media drew a link between Paul Goma's movement that spring and the miners' unrest several months later, though no connection actually existed.|$|E

She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E
