25|$|Camber: Camber {{refers to}} the bend of the board from tip to tail. Traditionally boards have a raised camber, meaning that {{if one were to}} lay it flat the board <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground between the spots where one's feet would be (contact points).

25|$|The {{pitch is}} said to be covered when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The use or non-use of covers {{significantly}} affects the way the ball <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the Laws of Cricket provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers' run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} codes of football, {{the way to}} score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the goal post. (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to have gone out of bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trampoline}} effect, {{which is}} common terminology for baseball players, is the phenomenon when the baseball [...] "jumps" [...] {{off the bat}} at contact. The bat-ball collision can be demonstrated from the physics of elastic collisions. The stiffer {{the barrel of the}} bat, the slower the baseball <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat because it loses energy in the collision. The softer the barrel of the bat, the faster the baseball <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bat because it retains its energy applied by the pitcher. The trampoline effect has been experimentally tested, and results show that composite bats outperform all-aluminum bats. The reason why composite bats outperform other aluminum bats is that the trampoline effect can essentially be [...] "tuned." [...] Composite materials have properties that are different in all directions, or anisotropy, which allows the bat manufacturer to design the bat stiff longitudinally (along the handle) and softer circumferentially (around the barrel). This softer barrel allows the ball to come off with less energy loss while maintaining the stiffness of the bat in the handle.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} play [...] "doubles", {{proponents of the}} [...] "heel up" [...] {{technique}} use either one of two techniques: the [...] "slide technique" [...] or the heel-toe technique. In the slide technique, the pedal is struck around the middle area with the ball of the foot. As the drum produces a sound, the toe is slid up the pedal. After the first stroke, the pedal will naturally bounce back, hit the toe as it slides upwards, and rebound for a second strike. In the heel-toe technique the foot is suspended above the foot-board of the pedal. The entire foot is brought down and the ball of the foot strikes the pedal. The foot snaps up, the heel <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> footboard, and the toes come down for a second stroke. Once mastered either technique allows the player to play very fast double strokes on the bass drum. Noted players include Rod Morgenstein, Tim Waterson (who formerly held the world record for the fastest playing on a bass drum), Tomas Haake, Chris Adler, Derek Roddy, Danny Carey, Hellhammer. The technique is commonly used in death metal and other extreme forms of music.|$|E
2500|$|Spinning rods {{are made}} from {{graphite}} or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle, and tend to be between 5 and 8.5 feet (1.5–2.6 m) in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5-8 guides arranged along {{the underside of the}} rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning reel's spool. Unlike bait casting and spin casting reels, the spinning reel hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the [...] "leg" [...] of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, trout, pike and walleye. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.|$|E
