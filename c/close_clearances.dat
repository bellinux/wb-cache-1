50|$|Drawbacks: The {{nature of}} the pump {{requires}} very <b>close</b> <b>clearances</b> between the rotating pump and the outer edge, making it rotate at a slow, steady speed. If rotary pumps are operated at high speeds, the fluids cause erosion, which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through, which reduces efficiency.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} replace steam on the {{numerous}} light rail branches {{operated by the}} Nacionales de Mexico (NdeM), EMD export models G12 and G16 were obtained. A total of 24 G16 units were built by EMD for the NdeM, all equipped with dynamic brakes and introduced between 08/1958 and 07/1960, their running numbers being 7300 to 7323. The first 13 units (Nr. 7300 to 7312) had <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> cabs, the last 11 units (Nr. 7313 to 7323) were delivered in 1960 and received a standard cab. Nr.7323 was pictured in 1963 with a standard cab, but appeared in 1974 with a <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> cab, indicating that this unit was either rebuilt or more probably renumbered.|$|R

This creates many areas of close and critical clearances. Critical Clearances are defined as hardware-to-hardware or hardware-to-envelope clearances which fall below a pre-established location dependent threshold and pose a risk of hardware to hardware contact during events such as launch, entry, landing, and operations. <b>Close</b> <b>Clearances,</b> on the other hand, are defined as any clearance value that is chosen to be tracked but is larger than the critical clearance threshold for its region. <b>Close</b> <b>clearances</b> may be tracked for various reasons including uncertainty in design, large expected dynamic motion, etc...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of close-clearance mixers: anchors and helical ribbons. Anchor mixers induce solid-body {{rotation}} and do not promote vertical mixing, but helical ribbons do. <b>Close</b> <b>clearance</b> mixers {{are used in the}} laminar regime, because the viscosity of the fluid overwhelms the inertial forces of the flow and prevents the fluid leaving the impeller from entraining the fluid next to it. Helical ribbon mixers are typically rotated to push material at the wall downwards, which helps circulate the fluid and refresh the surface at the wall.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to design and build a work cell that utilized a robotic vision system to assemble a micro motor. The work cell design consisted of an Adept SCARA robot with a vision system, end-of-arm tooling, and a combination work surface/ lighting system. On-screen vision tools were applied to images of the parts, both binary and gray scale, to assist in accurate part recognition. Using these images, retained by the vision system as reference, the robotic vision software was programmed to enable the robot {{to pick up the}} various parts in random positions within the cell and assemble them into the micro motor. The techniques used allow for accurate identification of the parts with no concern for orientation during part presentation for pickup or placement. The micro motor assembly involves three parts, two of which mate intimately with one another and have <b>close</b> <b>clearances.</b> The whole assembly is complicated by the small size of the individual parts. The assembly of the motor was quite difficult to accomplish and had numerous problems associated with it that needed to be overcome...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 89 Long term pump {{efficiency}} and durability {{are directly related}} to the ability of materials of construction to resist various forms of wear. The need for resistance to both adhesive and abrasive wear is often greatest in wear rings and similar components, where <b>close</b> <b>clearances</b> must be maintained between rotating and stationary components. Insufficient resistance to adhesive wear will induce failure by galling or seizure in the event these components make contact. Inadequate resistance to abrasive wear will lead to rapid loss of clearances and drop in pump performance. Traditionally, pump manufacturers have specified hardened martensitic stainless steels for critical wear parts, maintaining a 50 - 100 Brinell hardness difference between rotating and stationary components as experience has shown this is adequate to prevent galling. Coatings have been used to a limited extent, primarily in specialized applications, such as the plungers in reciprocating pumps. Selection of coatings have been hampered by a lack of reliable technical data on comparative performance. The result has been that a variety of coatings have been utilized by various pump manufacturers through the years, with mixed success and few documented case histories on coating performance...|$|E
40|$|Gearbox {{efficiency}} is reduced at high rotational speeds due to windage drag and viscous effects on rotating, meshed gear components. A goal of NASA aeronautics rotorcraft research {{is aimed at}} propulsion technologies that improve efficiency while minimizing vehicle weight. Specifically, reducing power losses to rotorcraft gearboxes would allow gains {{in areas such as}} vehicle payload, range, mission type, and fuel consumption. To that end, a gear windage rig has been commissioned at NASA Glenn Research Center to measure windage drag on gears and to test methodologies to mitigate windage power losses. One method used in rotorcraft gearbox design attempts to reduce gear windage power loss by utilizing <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> walls to enclose the gears in both the axial and radial directions. The <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> shrouds result in reduced drag on the gear teeth and reduced power loss. For meshed spur gears, the shrouding takes the form of metal side plates and circumferential metal sectors. Variably positioned axial and radial shrouds are incorporated in the NASA rig to study the effect of shroud clearance on gearbox power loss. A number of researchers have given experimental and analytical results for single spur gears, with and without shrouding. Shrouded meshed spur gear test results are sparse in the literature. Windage tests were run at NASA Glenn using meshed spur gears at four shroud configurations: unshrouded, shrouded (max. axial, max. radial), and two intermediate shrouding conditions. Results are compared to available meshed spur gear power loss data analyses as well as single spur gear data analyses...|$|R
5000|$|Axial {{bars are}} placed {{on the inside of}} steam-heated drums to create {{turbulence}} in the rimming condensate layer. If the spacing of the bars is chosen correctly, resonant waves are created in the condensate film, between each pair of bars. This significantly increases the level of turbulence, even at high drum speeds. This increase in turbulence reduces the resistance to heat transfer from the steam, through the condensate film, to the drum shell. The increase in heat transfer can be as large as 50%, even when compared to the performance of drums with modern, <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> rotating syphons. The maximum increase, however, requires the bars to operate with the optimum condensate layer thickness.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} blade/shroud {{system designed}} to maintain <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> between blade tips and turbine shrouds {{and at the same}} time, be resistant to environmental effects including high temperature oxidation, hot corrosion, and thermal cycling is described. Increased efficiency and increased blade life are attained by using the advanced blade tip seal system. Features of the system include improved clearance control when blade tips preferentially wear the shrouds and a superior single crystal superalloy tip. The tip design, joint location, characterization of the single crystal tip alloy, the abrasive tip treatment, and the component and engine test are among the factors addressed. Results of wear testing, quality control plans, and the total manufacturing cycle required to fully process the blades are also discussed...|$|R

The free piston engine design incorporates features such as gas bearings, <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> seals, and gas springs. This design is hermetically sealed to provide long life, reliability, and maintenance free operation. An implementation assessment study performed indicates that the free piston solar Stirling engine-linear alternator can be manufactured at a reasonable price cost (direct labor plus material) of $ 2, 500 per engine in production quantities of 25, 000 units per year. Opportunity for significant reduction of cost was also identified...|$|R

40|$|Critical {{response}} estimation {{attempts to}} determine the synchronous forced response (displacement) of a rotor at critical points which cannot be measured directly. This type of critical response prediction capability, if accurate and reliable, has broad potential use in the rotating machinery industry. Many machines have <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> points on their shafts, such as seals, which can easily be damaged by excess vibration. Accurate estimates of the actual level of vibration at these points could usefully assist machine operators in troubleshooting and in protecting the equipment from expensive damage. This type of response information can be used both to generate less conservative alarm limits and, if magnetic bearings are available, to directly guide the bearing controllers in restricting the rotor motion at these critical points. It is assumed that the disturbance forces acting upon the rotor are predominantly synchronous (e. g., mass unbalance.) The design of the estimator also accounts {{for the fact that}} most industrial rotating machinery operates at a single, constant speed over long periods of time, eliminating the benefits of variable speed response measurements...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} three research topics; i) the catcher bearings life prediction method, ii) the Morton effect, and iii) the two dimensional modified Reynolds equation. Firstly, catcher bearings (CB) are {{an essential component}} for rotating machine with active magnetic bearings (AMBs) suspensions. The CB's role {{is to protect the}} magnetic bearing and other <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> component {{in the event of an}} AMB failure. The contact load, the Hertzian stress, and the sub/surface shear stress between rotor, races, and balls are calculated, using a nonlinear ball bearing model with thermal growth, during the rotor drop event. Fatigue life of the CB in terms of the number of drop occurrences prior to failure is calculated by applying the Rainflow Counting Algorithm to the sub/surface shear stress-time history. Numerical simulations including high fidelity bearing models and a Timoshenko beam finite element rotor model show that CB life is dramatically reduced when high-speed backward whirl occurs. Secondly, the theoretical models and simulation results about the synchronous thermal instability phenomenon known as Morton Effect is presented in this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|The high {{pressure}} turbine configuration for the Energy Efficient Engine {{is built around}} a two-stage design system. Moderate aerodynamic loading for both stages is used to achieve {{the high level of}} turbine efficiency. Flowpath components are designed for 18, 000 hours of life, while the static and rotating structures are designed for 36, 000 hours of engine operation. Both stages of turbine blades and vanes are air-cooled incorporating advanced state of the art in cooling technology. Direct solidification (DS) alloys are used for blades and one stage of vanes, and an oxide dispersion system (ODS) alloy is used for the Stage 1 nozzle airfoils. Ceramic shrouds are used as the material composition for the Stage 1 shroud. An active clearance control (ACC) system is used to control the blade tip to shroud clearances for both stages. Fan air is used to impinge on the shroud casing support rings, thereby controlling the growth rate of the shroud. This procedure allows <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> control while minimizing blade tip to shroud rubs...|$|R

40|$|Multistage rotor-stator (RS) mixers {{are widely}} {{utilized}} to generate high shear rate in dispersion {{processes such as}} foam generation and emulsification, featuring narrow gaps between rotors and stators in the axial direction and <b>close</b> <b>clearance</b> between rotors and vessel wall in the radial direction. In this study, CFD simulation of the multistage RS mixers is carried out for Newtonian and shear-thinning power-law fluids to investigate the strain rate distribution and power characteristics, {{both of which are}} critical for bubble or droplet size distribution and process optimization. The simulation indicates that the shear-thinning power-law fluids lead to large fluid dead zones in the laminar regime compared to the Newtonian fluids, whereas such dead zone disappears in turbulent regime. But the area of higher strain rate of the power-law fluid near the tip of rotors is greater than that of Newtonian fluid. The average strain rate in turbulent flow is much higher than that in laminar flow, and the tails of strain rate distribution become longer as the flow index n decreases. The radial clearance ratio is found to have a non-negligible effect on the proportionality constant Kp between the power number and Reynolds number. For non-Newtonian fluids, CFD simulation indicates that the shear rate proportionality Ks nearly keeps constant in the laminar regime and is insensitive to the flow index n, showing that the Metzner-Otto concept is still suitable for the multistage RS systems. However Ks is strongly dependent on the radial clearance ratio and the axial gap, and hence new correlations are proposed for Kp and Ks to consider this effect. Then a new correlation for the power number is established and can serve as a unified correlation for Newtonian and shear-thinning power-law fluids in the laminar regime in multistage RS systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{features}} of engine design and installation are clearly demonstrating important advantages in engine performance retention. Bearing arrangement no doubt {{has an important}} role in performance retention. Four bearings seem to be insufficient while six are probably more than are required. A well designed five-bearing system would seem to be an optimum configuration. Bearings with over-hung components such as fans, should be designed to minimize such over-hang to limit associated wobble, which in turn leads to shroud rub, or to allow <b>closer</b> running <b>clearances.</b> Almost any effort to improve stiffness and generally reduce flexing of the engine structure will pay off significantly in performance retention, even at a weight penalty. For this reason cowl load sharing to provide additional rigidity at a low cost in additional weight and complexity is favored...|$|R
