25|$|Cullen {{was born}} in West Orange, New Jersey, and was the {{youngest}} of eight children. His father, a bus driver, was 58 {{years old at the time}} of Charles' birth and died when Cullen was seven months old. Cullen described his childhood as miserable. He first attempted suicide at age nine by drinking chemicals from a <b>chemistry</b> <b>set.</b> This would be the first of many suicide attempts throughout his life. Later, working as a nurse, Cullen claimed to have fantasized about stealing drugs from the hospital where he worked and using them to end his life.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a <b>chemistry</b> <b>set,</b> which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 2004 Paul was the {{recipient}} of the 2nd annual Boston College Arts Council Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. The award was presented as part of the sixth annual Boston College Arts Festival. His appearances at the festival also included an [...] "Inside the BC Studio" [...] interview with music writer Scott Alarik, a master class on songwriting, and a concert. In 2004 Paul was also awarded his 13th Boston Music Award in the category of Outstanding Singer/Songwriter. [...] At the time Paul was writing what he called [...] "country tunes" [...] when he teamed up with an Irish musician, producer, and studio expert named Flynn. [...] This resulted in American Jukebox Fables, released April 5, 2005, a recording produced by Flynn that surprised some fans by melding folk, pop and electronica. [...] Paul said that his collaboration with Flynn formed a partnership where he brought banjos and accordions and Flynn brought a laptop and keyboard. [...] Although Paul knew that the end result would fall outside the comfort zone of some fans who expected another acoustic folk album, experimenting with Flynn's musical <b>chemistry</b> <b>set</b> injected excitement and fun into the recording project.|$|E

[...] A line of <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> reminiscent of the traditional Gilbert and Porter sets was marketed [...] by Thames & Kosmos. [...] Many modern <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> are designed according the guidelines of microscale chemistry; using precise but smaller quantities of chemicals is more economical and safer than traditional setups.The related genre of forensics science toys has also become popular.|$|R

2500|$|Born in Alice, Texas, United States, Curl {{was the son}} of a Methodist minister. Due to his father's missionary work, {{his family}} moved several times within {{southern}} and southwestern Texas, and the elder Curl was involved in starting the San Antonio Medical Center's Methodist Hospital. [...] Curl attributes his interest in chemistry to a <b>chemistry</b> <b>set</b> he received as a nine-year-old, recalling that he ruined the finish on his mother's porcelain stove when nitric acid boiled over onto it. [...] He is a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio, Texas. [...] His high school offered only one year of chemistry instruction, but in his senior year his chemistry teacher gave him special projects to work on.|$|E
2500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England on 1 January 1941. His mother was a teacher. His father {{maintained}} a mechanical workshop and taught Evans to use tools and machines including a lathe. Evans was close to his grandfather who was a choir master at a Baptist Church for over 40 years, and whose main interests were music, poetry, and the Baptist Church. His mother's brother was a professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge. As a boy Evans was quiet, shy and inquisitive. He liked science, and his parents encouraged his education. He remembers loving old science books and receiving an electric experimental set which he wanted for Christmas. He attributes to a <b>chemistry</b> <b>set,</b> from which he learned basic chemistry, {{for the development of}} one of his [...] "greatest amateur passions". He went to middle school at St Dunstan's College, an independent school for boys in South East London, where he started chemistry and physics classes, and studied biology. He worked hard studying for the University of Cambridge entrance exams. At school {{he was one of the}} best pupils, although not at the top of the class.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1900s, modern <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> {{specifically}} targeted younger people and were intended to popularize chemistry. In the United States, the best known such sets were produced by the Porter Chemical Company and the A. C. Gilbert Company. Although Porter and Gilbert were the largest American producers of <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets,</b> other manufacturers such as the Skilcraft corporation were also active.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets,</b> {{with a few}} exceptions, tend {{to include}} a much more {{restricted}} range of chemicals and very simplified instructions. Many chemistry kits are single use, containing only the types and amounts of chemicals for a specific application. [...] Several authors have noted that from the 1980s on, concerns about illegal drug production, terrorism and legal liability have led to <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> becoming increasingly bland and unexciting.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century, amateur {{chemistry}} was an unexceptional hobby, with high-quality <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> readily available, {{and laboratory}} suppliers freely selling to hobbyists. For example, Linus Pauling had no difficulty in procuring potassium cyanide {{at the age of}} eleven. [...] However, due to increasing concerns about terrorism, drugs, and safety, suppliers became increasingly reluctant to sell to amateurs, and <b>chemistry</b> <b>sets</b> were steadily toned down.
