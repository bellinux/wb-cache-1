40|$|Abstract — <b>Corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh {{laminates}} (CWML) are a {{class of}} engineered open cell structures that have potential for applications in many areas including aerospace and biomedical engineering. Two different methods of fabricating <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates from stainless steel, one using a high temperature Lithobraze alloy and the other using a low temperature Eutectic solder for joining the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> meshes are described herein. Their implementation is demonstrated by manufacturing CWML samples of 304 and 316 stainless steel (SST). It is seen that due to the facility of employing wire meshes of different densities and wire diameters, {{it is possible to}} create CWML laminates {{with a wide range of}} effective densities. The fabricated laminates are tested under uniaxial compression. The variation of the compressive yield strength with relative density of the CWML is compared to the theory developed by Gibson and Ashby for open cell structures [22]. It is shown that the compressive strength of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates can be described using the same equations by using an appropriate value for the linear coefficient in the Gibson-Ashby model...|$|R

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) are ecosystem {{engineers in}} that they substantially alter the environment through their unique foraging and feeding habits. At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

The frequency of drinking was less than 0. 5 % in the 1 st experimental group and mostly higher than 1 % in the other three groups during the whole rearing period.

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) are ecosystem {{engineers in}} that they substantially alter the environment through their unique foraging and feeding habits. At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically for large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548 and 50, respectively). <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the level of impact, with a higher relative frequency of wire-net-protected trees found in lower impact categories compared with unprotected trees. Since tree mortality has been attributed to high levels of elephant impact, the use of <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> could serve to maintain individual trees or populations particularly vulnerable to elephant impact in areas with locally high densities of elephants. Conservation implications: Since <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a relatively low cost and ecologically unobtrusive strategy, it could be used to reduce elephant impact in problem areas. This method focuses on protecting trees rather than some other strategies such as environmental manipulation, translocation, contraceptives, and culling that instead focus on reducing elephant numbers.

40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>Wire</b> Mesh Laminates (CWML) {{are open}} cell type {{cellular}} structures manufactured by bonding {{several layers of}} metallic <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> meshes {{on top of each}} other. Due to their open cell structure and the mechanical properties of the parent material, CWML can offer high stiffness and strength per unit weight. Therefore, they have many potential applications where lightweight and high rigidity and strength are required, such as in sandwich constructions in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and orthopaedic implants in biomedical engineering. The main loading in such applications is transverse compression, occasionally accompanied by in-plane shear. This thesis presents an attempt to understand and characterise the behaviour of <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire</b> mesh laminates under transverse compression loading. First, a theoretical model is developed for the CWML using a truss structure to approximate the <b>corrugated</b> <b>wire.</b> Although simplistic, this model is useful in establishing expressions for the relative density, effective transverse stiffness and transverse compressive strength of the CWML. The influences of wire diameter, opening width, and the corrugation angle on these parameters are established. A new method is developed for the fabrication of CWML at a relatively low temperature of 225 degrees Celsius making it significantly simpler and cost effective compared to existing methods. For the first time, a finite element model is developed to numerically simulate the deformation behaviour of CWML under transverse compression and shear loading. The numerical model investigates the effects of nonlinearities such as material nonlinearity, large deformation behaviour, curvature {{at the tip of the}} corrugations and friction. Experimental testing is conducted on several samples of single layer, two layer, and four layer wire mesh laminates under transverse compression and separately under shear loading. The test results show considerable scatter probably due to variations in the quality of the bonding in the manufacturing process. The load deflection behaviours of the single and multi layer laminates observed in the tests are compared to those analytically determined by the numerical simulations. Unfortunately, the agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental results is rather poor; this is attributed to the bends in the wires as they cross over each other in the mesh, which were not modelled in the simulation. The finite element (FE) model, therefore, requires further improvement; nevertheless, it does provide significant insight into aspects that influence the deformation behaviour of CWML...|$|R

Within floor types, three stocking densities (8, 12 and 16 rabbits/m 2) were applied. Thirty-six rabbits were placed into conventional cages (2 rabbits/cage) as control. The experiment took place between the ages of 5 and 11 weeks. At 11 weeks of age animals were slaughtered and carcasses dissected. Rabbits on the <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floor had significantly higher liveweight at slaughter than rabbits on the combined floor (2575 vs. 2498 g). The dressing percentage (ratio of warm carcass to the live weight) was higher in animals reared on the combined floor (60. 5 % vs. 61. 1 %). The type of floor had a significant effect also on the ratio of the hind part to the chilled carcass (30. 6 % vs. 31. 3 %; P< 0. 01). The ratio of m.
