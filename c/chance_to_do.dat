5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high prices for the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{college has}} a {{tradition}} of community meals dating back to the Waukegan campus, when the community would meet for potluck meals and discuss matters of general interest. The Orange Horse, Shimer's biennial talent show since the 1960s, invites students, faculty and alumni to read poetry, sing, play music or tell jokes, individually or in groups. The Shimer theater program produces plays complementing its curriculum, offering anyone who wants to participate the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Recent productions have included Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
50|$|Busy-Bee (De'aundre Bonds): An {{undersized}} player, he is {{very supportive}} of the team and his teammates. He yearns <b>to</b> play but <b>does</b> not get very many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He is shot while somebody tries to steal his coat. When he returns, he is given the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play and becomes successful.|$|R
60|$|Miss Martha was forty, her bank-book {{showed a}} credit of two {{thousand}} dollars, and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart. Many people have married whose <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so were much inferior to Miss Martha's.|$|R

5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolt of}} Mortimer and the Percys very quickly gives him his <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just that. The {{high and the}} low come {{together}} when the Prince makes up {{with his father and}} is given a high command. He vows to fight and kill the rebel Hotspur, and orders Falstaff (who is, after all, a knight) to take charge of a group of foot soldiers and proceed to the battle site at Shrewsbury.|$|E
25|$|Pesach Sheni (פסח שני) ("Second Passover") {{is a day}} {{prescribed}} in the Torah {{to allow}} {{those who did not}} bring the Paschal Lamb offering (Korban Pesach) a second <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Eligibility was limited to those who were distant from Jerusalem on Passover, or those who were ritually impure and ineligible to participate in a sacrificial offering. Today, some have the custom to eat matzo on Pesach Sheni, and some make a small change to the liturgy.|$|E

60|$|The dude and his crony, {{as well as}} Larkspur, {{were still}} down upon the Rovers, but for the present they kept quiet, the reason being that they were behind in their lessons and {{had to work hard}} to make up.

5000|$|It {{was as a}} Laker Girl that Paula Abdul was [...] "discovered" [...] by {{the group}} The Jacksons, {{in which she was}} hired by them to choreograph the music video for the song [...] "Torture". This led <b>to</b> her <b>doing</b> the choreography for their Victory Tour, as well as other <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the choreography for other music videos. Abdul's success has given an extra {{prestige}} to being a Laker Girl.|$|R
25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact that we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
25|$|Figo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in {{the middle}} of 2005 on a free {{transfer}} after his contract with Madrid had expired. This meant that Figo would finally be able to play for a club in Italy, something he had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before his move to Barcelona, but was scuppered due to a dispute between the two clubs interested, Juventus and Parma. During the middle of 2008, Figo's compatriot José Mourinho joined Inter on a managerial level. This has been said to please Figo, as he would have several Portuguese teammates during the remainder of his stay at Inter.|$|E
25|$|Universal Studios Singapore {{was opened}} for sneak peek week {{in view of}} the Chinese New Year Celebrations, from 5pm to 9pm every night between 14 and 21 February 2010. Though {{visitors}} had to pay SGD$10 to enter the park even-though rides were not operating, tickets for the week were sold out in 2 days. On 5 March 2010, it was announced that the park will open its doors at 8:28am (UTC+8) on 18 March 2010, for a soft-opening phase. From 13 March 2010, the team members of Resorts World Sentosa and their families had a chance to visit the park before the public has a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The park had its soft opening period from 18 March 2010 to 26 October 2010.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the bonus}} round, called the [...] "Final Five", the winning {{contestant}} is shown five facts and five numbers. The contestant must match each fact to its corresponding number in 45 seconds with two <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so (the clock stops when the contestant locks in their answers the first time). Each correctly placed fact is worth an additional $500 {{and if the}} contestant places all five facts correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|R

2500|$|Einziger noted, [...] "It {{just seems}} like a very {{appropriate}} name for the album because we've been {{in the spirit of}} taking risk, stepping up and making a leap. For us, it's a very common theme for us <b>to</b> take <b>chances,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things differently. There's something exciting and equally scary about that idea. Now we've nothing left to lose, really. We've kind of accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish as a band; at this point we're just living our dreams." ...|$|R
25|$|Soon after, through sheer luck, {{the group}} find {{themselves}} perfectly positioned to attempt another {{attack on the}} Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group {{find their way to}} the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.|$|E
25|$|His army's {{numbers were}} also low, only about 1,500 men at first, with two third on cavalry, {{and only a}} little more than 600 had firearms. Bayonets were in short supply, so they had to improvise by adding lances to their arsenal. Those {{officers}} that could not bring their own saber would have to do without. The scarcity of arms and supplies forced them to impose a strict control and organization. Belgrano spent the first months of his command in establishing a hospital, military tribunal, supply corps, reconnaissance company and in negotiating the manufacturing of ammunition and clothing. The relative hostility of the local population over the demands of the porteños did not make his job easy. He utilized the few friendships with the locals, La Madrid among them, to help with troop recruiting. Crucial in this task was Güemes, who with his troubled personal relations with Belgrano would force the latter to release him in June before even having had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> combat.|$|E
25|$|Eugene left Vienna {{in early}} June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000–90,000 men. By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan's son-in-law, the Grand Vizier Damat Ali Pasha, were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene's {{position}} {{west of the}} fortress of Petrovaradin on the north bank of the Danube. The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to attack immediately {{on the morning of}} 5 August with approximately 70,000 men. The Turkish janissaries had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha's forces fell into confusion. Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, seem to have lost double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the mêlée and subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E

25|$|Tibor, Jason and Gabrielle battled {{it out for}} an Aussie Christmas episode {{which set}} a new {{standard}} {{so far in the}} show. Gold Coast chef/teacher Jason struggled with his signature dish round with his Cafe Del Mare (seafood platter For 2) which he served cold after cooking it too early. Gabs impressed the two male judges with an old favourite, aussie burgers minus the beetroot, and Tibor went over the top with a Jurassic feast of ostrich, barbecued pears with spiced honey, walnuts and blue cheese. The secret ingredient this week was turkey, and while Jason professed his loathe for the bird, he was the only contestant able to cook it properly. Mark, Julia and Ben refused to eat Tibor's and Gabrielle's turkey (as it was medium rare) and declared Jason the winner, although Mark thought he was not the best on the day, preferring Gabrielle as a choice. Clearly Jason's food was presented well and his technique was polished thus the judges wanted to see more and gave him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as he was put through to the semi finals.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1985, Ballard was {{aboard the}} French {{research}} ship Le Suroît, which {{was using the}} side scan sonar SAR {{to search for the}} Titanics wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS Scorpion and the USS Thresher, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the Titanic. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the Argo, and his search for the Titanic. The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested in finding out what happened to their missing submarines and ultimately concluded that Argo was their best <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The Navy agreed it would finance his Titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines, and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time, and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the Titanic.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our {{threefold}} concept of "bringing robotics closer to students". Our efforts begin with motivating high-school students to study engineering sciences by increasing {{their interest in}} technical issues. This is achieved by a national robotics contest. Besides our work with high-school students, we also focus on projects for undergraduate university students. Several robotics projects and competitions are included into the curriculum of electrical and mechanical engineering and computer science. These projects offer <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> special assignments and student research projects.
