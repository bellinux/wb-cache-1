5|$|Understanding the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during an}} organism's {{evolution}} can reveal the genes needed to construct {{parts of the}} body, genes which {{may be involved in}} human genetic disorders. For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during the}} last quarter of a century - or during the present generation of living men - have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world's history.|$|E
60|$|The <b>change</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> there, {{during the}} past fortnight, was striking. Then none but black faces could be seen. Now it was the encampment of a British force, with its white tents and all their belongings.|$|R
50|$|The Kinvigs {{were very}} {{conscious}} of the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in their lifetime and the threats these changes posed {{to the future of}} the Manx language. They were keen to encourage students of Manx Gaelic and many visited them to study pronunciation.|$|R
25|$|In mid-1965, Thiệu {{became the}} figurehead chief {{of state of}} a {{military}} junta, with Kỳ as the prime minister. After a series of short-lived juntas, their pairing {{put an end to}} a series of leadership <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> since the assassination of Diệm.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} indicator is the sectoral <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{since the}} stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the Secondary sector of Manufacturing have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a tertiary Sector stronghold also see greater rate of Economic Development.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{history of}} Europe {{encompasses}} {{the history of}} the patterns of genetic diversity among the human populations of the European continent. The history reflects the patterns of demographic and ethnic <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in Europe throughout time. The primary data comes from sequences of mitochondrial, Y-chromosome and autosomal DNA (including single-nucleotide polymorphisms), from modern populations and, where available, from ancient DNA.|$|E
25|$|There are {{observable}} <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{over the}} last ten to fifteen years that show Tuvaluans {{that there have been}} changes to sea levels. Those observable changes include sea water bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools on each high tide and flooding of low-lying areas including the airport on a regular basis during spring tides and king tides.|$|E
50|$|State Route 78 {{was formed}} in 1977, coinciding with the {{construction}} of I-15 through the area, serving the area it does now. The only <b>change</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> to the route was a change to the legal definition in 1987, making it more detailed.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 Myrdal {{went back}} to the Chinese village he {{reported}} on in 1962 and recorded his observations in Return to a Chinese Village (1984), in which he expressed his disappointment at the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred,</b> and his continued support of Mao's programs, including the Cultural Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, the College {{discussed}} {{the need to}} build a new [...] "sacred space" [...] for the college community. Considering the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> at Saint Rose and in the world since 1920, the College decided to build an interfaith space. This space was christened the Hubbard Interfaith Sanctuary.|$|R
25|$|It {{was found}} that in most orders, there are species with rates of {{chromosome}} evolution that {{can be considered as}} 'default' rates. It needs to be noted that the number of rearrangements that have become fixed in evolutionary history seems relatively low, due to 180 million years of the mammalian radiation. Thus a record of the history of karyotype <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> during evolution have been attained through comparative chromosome maps.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 97 was {{originally}} commissioned on February 3, 1952. At this time, the highway extended from Sapulpa (at its present-day southern terminus, where it intersected {{what was then}} US-66) to the southern SH-51 junction, which also carried US-64 (as the Keystone Expressway {{had not yet been}} built). The highway was extended north into Osage County on October 15, 1956. The only <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> since then are relatively minor changes in alignment through Sand Springs and Sapulpa.|$|E
25|$|Terry {{finds it}} {{particularly}} hard {{to adjust to}} the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> during his time in the Army. As implied in the lyrics to the programme's theme song, the 1970s series plays on both lads' feelings of nostalgia for the lost days of their reckless youth. Both of them are depressed by the demolition of so many of the landmarks of their youth, though Bob, who works for a building firm, sometimes sees it as progress. Bob has also bought his own house on a newly-built estate, further distancing him from his and Terry's pasts.|$|E
50|$|Policies forbidding {{the use of}} German and {{requiring}} French were promptly introduced. In order not to antagonize the Alsatians, the region was not subjected to some legal <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> {{in the rest of}} France between 1871 and 1919, such as the 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State.|$|R
50|$|His {{name is a}} {{reference}} to the character of the same name in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Smith left the U.S. in 1969 to study art in Italy and, struck by the profound social <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> during his absence from the U.S., adopted the name after returning to America in 1976.|$|R
50|$|The {{conservative}} Congress of Vienna {{reversed the}} political <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> during the wars. Napoleon suddenly returned, {{seized control of}} France, raised an army, and marched on his enemies in the Hundred Days. It ended with his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and his exile to a remote island.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have {{reported}} a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in E. coli, in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.|$|E
500|$|Yumemi is a goodhearted but {{extremely}} talkative gynoid attendant of {{an abandoned}} planetarium; she is designed {{to look like a}} young girl. Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware of the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in the past 30 years, as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore. Therefore, she treats the protagonist like a regular guest by calling him , speaks of the world as it was before the war, and fails to understand any information he tells her, other than things related to her job at the planetarium. The name [...] "Hoshino Yumemi" [...] itself is a pun—"hoshi" [...] means star or planetary body; [...] "no" [...] is a possessive particle; [...] "yume" [...] is a dream or a reverie; [...] "mi" [...] means see. Yumemi is the only character shown to the audience of the game.|$|E

50|$|He {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred.</b> Thun handed over the business powers to his general vicar, Count Auersperg, and the clergy, the episcopal functions to his auxiliary bishop, Karl Kajetan von Gaisruck. In 1804 he let himself be dispensed with his residence. As General Vicar Auersperg Passau also left 1806, confused administrative conditions prevailed.|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} characterized {{cohort of}} 115 Great Lakes fisheaters and 95 non-fisheating controls was re-examined in 1989 to evaluate <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in serum PCB and DDT levels since the 1982 study. Substantial and significant decreases in mean serum DDT levels <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in both fisheaters (25. 8 ppb vs 15. 6 ppb) and controls (9. 6 ppb vs 6. 8 ppb) ppb=ng/...|$|R
50|$|In 1997, NIMH realigned its {{extramural}} {{organizational structure}} {{to capitalize on}} new technologies and approaches to both basic and clinical science, as well as <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in health care delivery systems, while retaining the Institute's focus on mental illness. The new extramural organization resulted in three research divisions: Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Research; Services and Intervention Research; and Mental Disorders, Behavioral Research and AIDS.|$|R
2500|$|Locating a {{specimen}} {{filed in the}} herbarium requires knowing the nomenclature and classification used by the herbarium. [...] It also requires familiarity with possible name <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.|$|E
2500|$|By {{comparing}} extant sequences, one {{can determine}} the amount of sequence divergence. This raw measurement of divergence provides information about the number of <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> along the path separating the sequences. The simple count of differences (the Hamming distance) between sequences will often underestimate the number of substitution because of multiple hits (see homoplasy). Trying to estimate the exact number of <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> is difficult, and usually not necessary. Instead, branch lengths (and path lengths) in phylogenetic analyses are usually expressed in the expected number of changes per site. The path length is the product of the duration of the path in time and the mean rate of substitutions. [...] While their product can be estimated, the rate and time are not identifiable from sequence divergence.|$|E
2500|$|The year 2005 is {{significant}} {{primarily because of}} the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in the philosophy of physics over the past 100 years. [...] These changes began in 1905 with the publication of four papers by Einstein that: explained Brownian motion, introduced the special theory of relativity, described how the photoelectric effect could be explained by the quantization of light -which helped launch quantum mechanics-, and developed E = mc2. [...] These papers are commonly called his Annus Mirabilis Papers because they later defined 1905 as a miracle year for physics.|$|E
50|$|Vito Russo {{wanted his}} {{book to be}} {{transformed}} into a documentary film and helped out on the project until he died in 1990. Some critics of the documentary noted that it was less political than the book and ended on a more positive note. However, Russo had wanted the documentary to be entertaining and to reflect the positive <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> up to 1990.|$|R
5000|$|The 2003 campaign, Violence Against Women Violates Human Rights: Maintaining the Momentum Ten Years After Vienna (1993-2003), {{was focused}} on {{reviewing}} <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in the 10 years since the Vienna Declaration that {{was a result of}} the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (1993) and the UN General Assembly's adoption of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (2003).|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{results from a}} qualitative study of parents benefits in participation in course given to parents whose children are placed in foster care. The participants describe <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> in their life situations, and aspects of the course evaluated as useful. Essential findings indicate <b>that</b> the participants <b>have</b> increased self-confidence and regard their children in a new way. Foucault’s concepts of Power are applied in the analysis...|$|R
2500|$|Agostini v. Felton, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, the Court overruled its decision in Aguilar v. Felton (1985), now finding {{that it was not}} a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment for a state-sponsored education initiative to allow public school teachers to instruct at religious schools, so long as the material was secular and neutral in nature and no [...] "excessive entanglement" [...] between government and religion was apparent. This case is noteworthy in a broader sense as a sign of evolving judicial standards surrounding the First Amendment, and the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, this [...] "New South" [...] {{was more}} of a slogan of civic {{boosters}} than a reality in many areas. Racist conflicts during the Civil Rights Movement gave the American South a backward image in popular culture. However, in the 1960s the black population began being enfranchised and represented in many political offices. In the post-World War II era, American textiles makers and other light industry moved en masse to the South, so as to capitalize on low wages, social conservatism, and anti-union sentiments. [...] With the industrialization of the South came economic change, migration, immigration and population growth. Light industry moved offshore but has been replaced to a degree by auto manufacturing, tourism and energy production. [...] In light of the many <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> since the Civil War, many now use the term in a celebratory sense.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{there is}} {{extensive}} statistical evidence from so-called [...] "fingerprint" [...] studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as {{each person has}} a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{since the start of}} the Industrial Revolution are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War I, {{there were}} many Australian place names with German names {{throughout}} Australia, {{but because of the}} ongoing war against Germany and subsequent anti-German sentiment, many place names with German origins changed their names. This was done through either petition or Acts of Parliament. The South Australian Nomenclature Act of 1935 attempted to reverse and revert the name <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> during WWI and post war years.|$|R
5000|$|The story's unnamed narrator {{arrives at}} Arkham to visit Miskatonic University, noting <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>occurred</b> there since the 1920s and 1930s.
