2500|$|The {{introduction}} of congestion pricing {{was one of}} a number of anti-congestion policies implemented in Singapore since the 1970s, in recognition of the country's land constraints, need of economic competitiveness, and to avoid the traffic gridlock that chokes many cities in the world. One key aspect of demand management in Singapore is the restraint of vehicle ownership, either through the imposition of high ownership costs or restriction on the actual growth of the <b>car</b> <b>population.</b> [...] These measures have included high annual road tax, custom duties and vehicle registration fees. Besides fiscal deterrents, supply of motor vehicles was regulated since 1990, when a Vehicle Quota System was introduced. These high initial buy-in charges are considered as the price motorists pay for the luxury of owning a car and to cover part of the fixed costs associated with scaling basic road infrastructure. Then, use-related charges, such as fuel taxes (50% of final sale price), ALS or high parking rates are utilised by public authorities to further constraint travel. In parallel to the whole spectrum of road pricing measures, the government has invested heavily in public transport and implemented a park-and-ride scheme, with thirteen fringe car parks, hence providing car users a real alternative to switch travel modes. In summary, Singapore's urban and transport strategy allowed the users to have pro-transit [...] "carrots" [...] matching auto-restraint [...] "sticks", and as a result, despite having one of the highest per capita incomes in Asia, 32% of Singaporean households owned cars in 2010.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe photo-excited triplet {{states of}} carotenoids, sensitised by triplet–triplet energy {{transfer}} from the chlorophyll triplet states, {{have been investigated}} in the isolated Photosystem II (PSII) core complex and PSII–LHCII (Light Harvesting Complex II) supercomplex by Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance techniques, using both fluorescence (FDMR) and absorption (ADMR) detection. The absence of Photosystem I allows us to reach the full assignment of the carotenoid triplet states populated in PSII under steady state illumination at low temperature. Five carotenoid triplet (3 <b>Car)</b> <b>populations</b> were identified in PSII–LHCII, and four in the PSII core complex. Thus, four 3 <b>Car</b> <b>populations</b> are attributed to β-carotene molecules bound to the core complex. All of them show associated fluorescence emission maxima which are relatively red-shifted {{with respect to the}} bulk emission of both the PSII–LHCII and the isolated core complexes. In particular the two populations characterised by Zero Field Splitting parameters |D|= 0. 0370 – 0. 0373 cm− 1 /|E|= 0. 00373 – 0. 00375 cm− 1 and |D|= 0. 0381 – 0. 0385 cm− 1 /|E|= 0. 00393 – 0. 00389 cm− 1, are coupled by singlet energy transfer with chlorophylls which have a red-shifted emission peaking at 705 nm. This observation supports previous suggestions that pointed towards the presence of long-wavelength chlorophyll spectral forms in the PSII core complex. The fifth 3 Car component is observed only in the PSII–LHCII supercomplex and is then assigned to the peripheral light harvesting system...|$|R

Goitre rates and cassava processing practices were compared in three Central African Republic (<b>CAR)</b> <b>populations.</b> Short-cuts in cassava processing were associated with elevated urinary thiocyanate and increased goitre rates, suggesting a goitrogenic effect in one population. While improved cassava processing may be beneficial, the priority is to correct the iodine deficiency. The use of the urinary iodine/tiocyanate ratio as indicator of goitrogenic effects was explored using data from Tanzania and CAR. As the ratio can be calculated in four mathematically different ways and has physiological shortcomings, its use is discouraged. Biannual iodised oil capsule (IOC) distribution in a Tanzanian population of 7 million during nine years was studied. Mean distribution coverage was 64 %, mean delay of subsequent distribution 1. 25 years, and only 43 % of targeted person-time was covered.

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays, {{the usage}} of cars is {{increasing}} day by day. Cars (or automobiles) make up approximately 87 % of the total motor vehicle annual production in the world. The number of cars on the world's roads surpassed one billion last year, {{according to a study}} that has spurred debate on what the rapidlygrowing <b>car</b> <b>population</b> will mean for the world's economy and environment. Not surprisingly, China led the way in vehicle growth, with the number of cars on Chinese roads increasing by 27. 5 per cent, amounting to half the entire global growth.

40|$|For {{whom the}} road tolls? The future for road {{congestion}} charging in the UK In the next 30 years, the UK’s <b>car</b> <b>population</b> {{is likely to}} increase by around 50 %. With our roads already heavily congested, we need to find ways to cope with this large increase. One solution is charging for the use of congested roads. Many trial schemes are already in place within Europe and London is set to introduce congestion charges in February 2003. In this article Peter Hills and Phil Blythe look at the options and technology available for implementing road use pricing. For those who regard today’s traffic levels as already too high, the prospect of a further 50 % increase is unthinkable. And yet, if real disposable incomes go on rising over the next 25 – 30 years as they have since the mid- 1970 s, then the <b>car</b> <b>population</b> is almost bound to go on rising, until some ‘saturation ’ level of ownership is reached by about 2030. By then, today’s 23 million cars registered in the UK could have grown to 33 – 36 million. If traffic is not to grow commensurately, the nettle of the hitherto radical policy of road-use pricing (including congestion charging in urban areas and the tolling of congested motorways) will have to be grasped. The legislation for this is in place, through the Transport Act 2000, and much experimentation is afoot, but the political will at the national level is still lacking. This brief review of the future for congestion charging and of emerging technologies, for vehicle/roadside communication and automated toll-collection systems, concludes that the lack of appropriate technology will not be the constraint in implementing road-user charging in the near future in the UK...|$|E
30|$|This {{study is}} the first to explore the {{potential}} safety implications of company cars in Israel. It relies on available national figures, a market survey, and a questionnaire-based survey of company car drivers and privately owned car drivers which lacks randomness.

Since company cars are common in the Western world (except for the United States) and enjoy an increasing share of the general <b>car</b> <b>population</b> in many countries, their safety implications should be of concern; however, this issue has not received much attention in the literature and the implications were found to be worrisome. The conclusion of this paper, therefore, should be noted in other countries beyond Israel.

40|$|AIMS—To {{investigate}} {{the outcome of}} cataract surgery on the patients' self estimation of visual function while driving. Furthermore, the benefit of surgery to the <b>car</b> driving <b>population</b> was determined.  METHODS—A total of 208  consecutive patients (211  cases) with driving licences, who underwent cataract surgery with intraocular lenses, were studied prospectively using self administered questionnaires. Their self estimated degree of visual functional problems while driving were analysed before and after surgery.  RESULTS—Visual problems while driving declined from 82 % preoperatively to 5 % after surgery. Remaining visual problems with the operated eye were present in only seven patients. Problems in estimating distance while driving decreased from 37 % before surgery to 6 % after surgery. Twenty three per cent of the patients drove with a visual acuity below the requirements for driving in Sweden before surgery and only 4 % after surgery. There was no correlation between the degree of visual problems while driving and visual acuity before surgery.  CONCLUSION—The <b>car</b> driving <b>population</b> greatly benefited from cataract surgery in terms of subjectively improved visual function and distance estimation while driving. Functional visual problems while driving {{should be considered as}} an indication for cataract surgery. These findings also indicated that the second eye should be operated on, if necessary, to achieve optimal ability to estimate distance and give best possible road safety. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} real {{velocity}} curves {{from the city}} of Stuttgart are used to investigate the emission behaviour for both benzene and particulates of passenger cars. The driving cycles, which are carried out by the ISV, represent the style of driving for several types of city streets. The types of city streets are chosen in order to describe all occuring common traffic conditions. Vehicles from the passenger <b>car</b> <b>population,</b> both with Otto-engine and Diesel-engine will be selected by the FKFS. By means of these cars the emissions of CO, HC and NO_x, benzene and particulates will be measured on the exhaust gas roller test bench of the Institute. Emissions factors for several groups of engine displacements and different classes of technologies to reduce noxious components in the exhaust gas are developed from the measuring results. By means of these factors it is possible to evaluate the emissions of passenger cars both related to <b>car</b> <b>population</b> and the types of city streets and even ascending routes the vehicles are driving on. The influence of the cold-start phase on the emissions is also taken into account and will be declared as a selfstanding factor. The interpretation of the results shows the great progress of technical research in emission reduction since the begin of the eighties. (orig.)

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} problems plaguing urban cities all over the world today. With traffic congestion, goods and services experience delays in accessing markets and employees are late for work. This results in reduced production. At the same time, idling vehicles waste fuel and cause air pollution. This situation is the same in South Africa, where millions of rand are lost each year on congestion costs (CERF 1999). Studies carried out in Cape Town, South Africa, project that if no immediate action is taken to reduce traffic congestion, by the year 2020, the <b>car</b> <b>population</b> will increase by 64 %, thereby reducing highway traffic speeds to 29 kilometres per hour (South Africa. National Department of Transport 1999). Worldwide, policies to reduce congestion levels include, among other things, the promotion of public transport (Climate Change 2001; Cullinane and Cullinane 2003). As public transport has a better cost and space effectiveness for transportation of volumes of people, having more people use public transport will lead to a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.

They further observed that EV users are typically men in multi-car households located in the largest city suburbs. In addition to these studies, there are a plethora of websites that both monitor and encourage the use of EVs in Norway and abroad; hence they often produce short articles about EVs in Norway; see, for instance, Gronnbil.no; elbil.no and; Eurocitie.eu.|$|E
