5000|$|The Period of Industry {{was another}} major {{experience}} of the New College program {{with the intent of}} giving the prospective teacher the insight of what a working member of the community went through during the course of his life. By better understanding the work ethic of the people they encountered it was reasoned that the teacher could be a more effective leader in the community. The problems of wages, unemployment, capital, and labor in an industrial society take on new meanings through active participation in some industrial pursuit. For instance, in consideration of the potentiality of industrial production for individual and social welfare (i.e. making buttons for garments), actual experience in a shop or factory gives a better understanding to the theories of supply and demand. The purpose of the Period of Industry was not to produce another industrial worker instead of a student, but rather through direct contact develop in that student an appreciation and understanding of the fabric of industrial organization, of the attitudes and psychology of the worker, and of the problems in the social and economic order. [...] The first operational year of New College did not have a Period of Industry because of the already record unemployment brought by the Great Depression. It was reasoned that it might be impossible to insist that students have an experience in industry under the circumstances. Other experiences included visits to cooperative stores, factories and farms. Contact with organized labor, organized <b>capital,</b> <b>relief</b> organizations, and welfare agencies were also encouraged as well as research into the problems of insurance, credits and taxation.|$|E

40|$|Within a marking-to-model framework, this {{research}} computes the bank's capital charge for credit and operational risks of loan commitments at Basel- 2 fixed audit date. This {{is done in}} three steps. The first one prices commitment credit risk as a Gram-Charlier put value and determines the commitment forward-funding proportion. In the second one, put value and funding proportion are combined to compute Basel- 2 'fair' capital charge for credit and operational risks.

What sets our sample apart is its comprehensive coverage of the particularly rich and well developed credit market for SMEs in Germany.

Our results suggest that systematic risk tends to increase with firm size, conditional on the respective rating category. We also compare the size of this effect with the <b>capital</b> <b>relief</b> that has been granted in Basel II for SMEs relative to large firms. For SME loans in the corporate portfolio of the Internal Ratings-Based Approach and also for SME loans treated under the revised standardized approach of Basel II, our asset correlation estimates suggest a significantly larger relative difference from large firms than reflected in the regulatory capital requirements...|$|E

40|$|The rating-sensitive {{capital charges}} on credit risks {{under the new}} Basel Accord are likely to {{increase}} the volatility of minimum capital requirements, which may force banks to hold larger capital cushions in excess of minimum requirements. We analyse this claim {{on the basis of}} numerical simulations on hypothetical bank portfolios, in which the bank’s choice of capital cushion is assumed to satisfy a value-at-risk-type constraint. The results suggest that the size of the cushion depends on the bank’s credit portfolio risk and its chosen approach for calculating the minimum capital requirement. Although the more ratings-sensitive internal ratings based approach imposes lower minimum capital requirements on sufficiently high-quality credit portfolios than does the standardised approach, this <b>capital</b> <b>relief</b> is countered by the need for larger relative cushions under the former approach. The results imply that the cushions induced by greater rating sensitivity may influence both banks’ choices between proposed approaches for calculating capital requirements as well as the aggregate level of post-reform bank capital. Hence these cushions should be given due consideration in the final calibration of the Basel risk weights. new Basel Capital Accord; credit risk; internal ratings; value-at-risk...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the understanding of the relatively poor performance of banks and the depressed credit supply since the 2007 - 2009 crisis. In chapter 1, I study the role of securitisation in bank lending. I compare banks with and without access to securitisation and exploit the crash in the market for securitised products in 2007 as a shock to the ability to securitise. My results show that securitisation is associated with enhanced credit supply and lower dependence on capital in lending, giving rise to a <b>capital</b> <b>relief</b> channel. Furthermore, I find evidence that banks use unlocked capital from the securitisation of consumer and residential credit to propel commercial lending, suggesting spill-over effects. I document that since the market crash in late 2007 and even more so after the crisis when tighter regulations kicked in, the credit supply enhancing effects of securitisation have evaporated. In chapter 2, I study the impact of post-crisis stress testing on banking. CCAR is an extremely far-reaching and costly annual stress testing exercise whose outcome directly impacts banks' capital distributions. Bank executives name CCAR as one of the main culprits for poor performance and lower credit supply. I exploit cross-sectional variation in compliance to isolate the impact of CCAR. My results confirm that participating in CCAR is associated with significantly lower profitability and that banks shed high risk-weighted assets including large lending exposures to comply with elevated CCAR-capital requirements. In chapter 3, I study the stock market response to enhanced prudential standards (EPST). I find that immediate price adjustments reflect that investors perceived EPST as relatively good news. In the longer-term, I document that stocks of banks affected by EPST strongly outperform otherwise comparable bank stocks. This outperformance suggests a prolonged learning period of investors to evaluate the impact of EPST on banks' financial performances. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|As of today, {{securitization}} is {{an established}} {{product on the}} capital market. The first transaction {{was made in the}} US in the 1970 s. Since then the product has been developed and today there are several different structures of the product. Internationally securitization has been used for two reasons. Originally securitization was used to gain <b>capital</b> <b>relief,</b> but since capital requirements such as Basel II were implemented, the usage of securitization changed to more of a funding source. The purpose with this paper is to highlight the benefits and risks concerning securitization and to investigate the demand for securitization on the Swedish market. If the demand was found to be low, we would further examine why it’s low. We have investigated which assets are best suited for securitization and above all how the Swedish market will develop in the future. Securitization has been studied all across the world mainly due to the financial crisis, but studies from Sweden is lacking. Our literary sources are complemented with empirical knowledge through interviews of people with expertise in securitization. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part will deal with the theoretical aspects regarding securitization. The second part will process the empirical angels of securitization. In the third part we present an analysis and our own reflections on the subject. The Swedish securitization market has historically seen rather few transactions, despite the strength of the Swedish economy. Our research found that the assets used for securitization is mainly residential mortgage portfolios and consumer credits. These assets have certain characteristics and most importantly they are generating a good cash flow and can be structured in vast numbers to diversify a bank’s portfolio. How the market will develop in the future depends on how the bank sector will respond to Basel III requirements, the structure of future transactions and the competence of originators and buyers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze the {{implementation}} process of Basel II so to understand whether {{and to what extent}} national discrepancies might cause problems of competitive neutrality and thus invalidate the significant level of harmonization in capital adequacy regulation which was successfully achieved by Basel I. To achieve this result, this work looks at three different issues. The first paper looks at the negotiation process of an international soft law agreement and tries to understand whether it is able to explain its implementation results in terms of the actual degree of compliance across different countries. A game theory coordination model is suggested as a theoretical answer to this question, while the two Basel Accord cases are used to test the model empirically. The appreciation of the circumstances that led to the two Accords is proved as indicative of the reasons behind the widespread adoption of the Basel I Accord as opposed to the piecemeal implementation of Basel II. The {{aim of the}} second paper is then focus on the actual implementation of Basel II and to analyze how its second Pillar is likely to impact the banking industry in Europe. It finds evidence of a piecemeal implementation of Pillar II rules across Member States (MSs) which, in turn, is able to cause an alteration of the level playing field among banks depending on the country they are incorporated in,. It concludes that there is a clear case for further harmonization not only by reducing the extent of national discretions at the regulatory level, but more importantly in building up further arrangements for supervisory convergence and coordination. With the third paper the attention is finally drawn to possible problems of competitive neutrality arising from the fact that under Basel II "standardized" banks' level of capital is indirectly determined by rating agencies. Being their predictions often inconsistent one with the other, banks can in principle enact regulatory arbitrage strategies. And despite minimum standards are required by means of a common recognition process, the consistency of national authorities' assessment is still not guaranteed and banks might thus be provided with undue regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>relief.</b> A more institutional answer is needed if Europe wants in real fact to ensure competitive neutrality across MSs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five chapters. In {{the first chapter}} I provide {{the introduction to the}} three essays examined in this thesis. In the second chapter I examine the impact of securitization on U. S. bank holding companies’ (hereafter BHCs) credit risk, credit risk taking, profitability, and capital level between 2001 and 2013. I also study the effect of the credit enhancements and liquidity provision on BHCs’ performance between 2001 and 2013. Since securitization is an endogenous decision, I use the treatment-effects model to control for the selection bias and observe a positive relationship between securitization and credit risk. I also find that securitization decreases BHCs’ profitability, but that securitization increases BHCs’ capital levels. Although it is possible that relatively risk-averse BHCs may consciously increase their capital buffer by retaining earnings, for example, I do not exclude the possibility that BHCs engaged in regulatory capital arbitrage to increase their capital level. Nevertheless, I find that use of securitization for capital regulatory purposes is mitigated by the risk-retention mechanism, i. e. credit enhancements and liquidity provision—banks had to keep the required capital for their extended guarantees. However, as was uncovered during the financial crisis, these credit and liquidity risk-reducing tools were not sufficient to prevent the recent turmoil in the securitization markets. The third chapter analyzes information opacity and systemic risk for the U. S. BHCs {{in the context of the}} asset-backed commercial paper (hereafter ABCP) between 2001 :Q 2 and 2012 :Q 4. Banks which set up costly ABCP conduits might have benefited from the regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>relief</b> and from providing financing alternatives to their clients. However, they faced costs in terms of the increase in information opacity through the provision of ABCP guarantees to BHCs’ own and third-party sponsored ABCP conduits. Furthermore, I observe that higher information asymmetry about BHCs’ value is associated with higher volatility of returns and also with higher systemic risk. In the fourth chapter I examine the proposal to limit bank size, which is known as tackling the banks’ incentive to become “too big to fail”, and also how this regulation to curb bank size may affect banks’ operating costs. I examine the relationship between the size of BHCs and BHCs’ operating costs from 2001 :Q 2 to 2014 :Q 1 to evaluate the costs that the newly suggested regulations on bank size might bring. I find that rules to limit the size of banks could significantly reduce economies of scale. In particular, if large and cost-efficient banks become split into smaller parts, data processing, legal fees, audit and consulting expenses, in addition to expenses on premises and automated teller machines (hereafter ATMs) are likely to increase. I also pay particular interest to legal fees and litigation settlement; I find evidence that larger banks, but not necessarily systemically more risky banks, face litigation charges more frequently. I do not find evidence that larger banks face a lower probability of being fined. This suggests that another phenomenon known as “too big to jail” may not be true, if the assumption is that the misconduct detection is perfect. I do, however, observe that penalties had little effect on BHCs’ profitability, and that some of the largest banks continuously face litigation charges. In turn, this could possibly imply that benefits from wrongdoing outweighed the costs. The fifth chapter summarizes major findings and concludes...|$|E
