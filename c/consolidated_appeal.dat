40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>consolidated</b> <b>appeals</b> was {{laid down in}} the General Assembly (GA) {{resolution}} 46 / 182, which stated that, for emergencies requiring a coordinated response, the Secretary- General would ensure the issuance of <b>consolidated</b> <b>appeals</b> covering all concerned organizations {{of the system and}} prepared in consultation with the affected State. To this end OCHA has undertaken a number of activities and initiatives designed to support the Inter Agency commitment to a strengthened <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Appeals</b> Process (CAP). In 1998 OCHA held a series of consultations with a broad spectrum of humanitarian partners, who expressed the need for closer inter-agency attention to a number of specific issues surrounding the effective implementation of a <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Appeals</b> Process. The IASC Sub-Working Group on the CAP, established in April 1998, is responsible for addressing these issues and to give consideration to the measures that can be taken to correct the shortcomings and weaknesses of the process. Particular attention has been given so far to improving the strategic planning within the CAP, standardizing the procedures for the preparation of appeal documents, promoting monitoring mechanisms for the CAP and training staff at HQs and in the field...|$|R

50|$|Laskin {{presided over}} a number of {{landmark}} constitutional cases, most notably the 1981 Patriation Reference, which considered Pierre Trudeau's attempt to have the federal government unilaterally patriate the Constitution of Canada without the consent of the provinces. The case was a <b>consolidated</b> <b>appeal</b> of three provincial references, from Quebec, Manitoba and Newfoundland. By a 7-2 division, a majority of the Court held that Parliament had the legal authority to act unilaterally. However, by a division of 6-3, the Court also held that unilateral federal action would violate a constitutional convention that had emerged since Confederation, requiring substantial provincial agreement on constitutional amendments. Laskin was one of the judges in the majority on the issue of Parliament's legal authority to act unilaterally, but was one of the three dissenting judges who would have held that there was no constitutional convention restricting Parliament's power to act unilaterally.|$|E
