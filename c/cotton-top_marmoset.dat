40|$|A new {{virus was}} {{isolated}} from an uninoculated kidney-cell culture obtained from an apparently normal owl monkey. The virus satisfies the biological, physical, and chemical characteristics {{for inclusion in}} the family of herpesviruses. In vitro, the agent is released in active form from infected cells; this indicates that it is a cell-free virus. The virus did not cross react antigenically with other known herpesviruses nor with Herpesvirus aotus types 1 and 3, which are also latent herpesviruses from the owl monkey. Preliminary serologic data indicate that the most likely reservoir of this virus in nature is the owl monkey. The designation of Herpesvirus aotus type 2 has been suggested for this agent. In the last few years several species of New World monkeys {{have been found to be}} natural hosts for herpesviruses. The squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) is a natural host for Herpes-virus T and Herpesvirus saimiri [1, 2]. The <b>cotton-top</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Saguinus oedipus) is the carrie...|$|E
40|$|In certain New World monkeys Epstein-Barr (EB) 1 viral {{infection}} {{is accompanied by}} the development of lymphoproliferative disease. Four of eight <b>cotton-top</b> <b>marmosets</b> (tamarins) inoculated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (the Hawley strain) derived from a patient with post-transfusion heterophile-positive mononucleosis, developed malignant lymphoma (1). The EB 3 Burkitt lymphoma virus strain induced malignant lymphoprolifo erative disease in an owl monkey, and a cell line recovered from this tumor contained viral DNA (2, 3). Another mononucleosis strain ofEBV, Kaplan, was subsequently found to induce lymphosarcoma in <b>cotton-top</b> <b>marmosets</b> (4). The likelihood that EBV was etiologically responsible for the lesions was increased by the demonstration of the EB nuclear antigen in the majority of cells of an imprint prepared from a tumor biopsy (5). Additional evidence for the etiologic role of EBV was the demonstration of the EBV genome directly in tumor cell DNA by the technique of molecular hybridization (6). Finally, in vivo neutralization tests done on small scale demonstrated that leukoviremia and mesenteric adenopathy could be prevented by preincubation of the inoculum with EBV antibody-positive human serum and not by incubation with antibody-free huma...|$|R

5000|$|Rainforest Life is a {{walk-through}} indoor exhibit {{that houses}} several {{different species of}} rainforest animals. Among the species in the main forest walk-through are two-toed sloths, golden-headed lion tamarins, a female tamandua named Tammy, red titi monkeys, armadillos, Geoffrey's <b>marmosets,</b> <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, Goeldi's <b>marmosets</b> and sunbitterns. The building also has a darkened area called [...] "Nightlife", which houses nocturnal animals such as Seba's short-tailed bats, slender lorises, pottos, Australian water rats, Malagasy giant rats and blind cave fish.|$|R
40|$|Injection of {{concentrated}} EBV {{derived from}} {{cells of the}} Kaplan line of infectious mononucleosis (IM) origin resulted in malignant lymphoproliferation in {{one out of three}} <b>cotton-top</b> <b>marmosets</b> 6 weeks after inoculation. Two additional animals receiving the same isolate after incubation with an antibody-containing human serum did not develop tumors. Inoculation of concentrated virus derived from the P 3 HR- 1 line of Burkitt origin did not lead to lymphoproliferations in five marmosets. Three of these received non-neutralized, and two received neutralized P 3 HR- 1 virus. The tumor obtained with the Kaplan isolate revealed characteristics of a lymphosarcome. It contained EBV-specific DNA. In addition, EBV-synthesizing lymphoblastoid lines were established from a tumorous lymph-node, {{as well as from the}} spleen of the diseased marmoset. Virus recovered from these lines transformed lymphocytes derived from spleens of healthy marmosets. The tumor-bearing animal developed low levels of anti-VCA antibodies during the course of tumor growth. These data demonstrate the oncogenic potential of EBV directly derived from cells of IM origin...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to account for {{differences}} in the biologic behavior of Epstein-Barr virus in different primate species, we studied lymphocyte surface markers on primary and transformed cells. Among primary leukocytes, the distribution of cells with characteristics of bone-marrow-derived cells (B cells) was similar in humans, wooly monkeys, and <b>cotton-top</b> <b>marmosets.</b> However, after transformation by Epstein-Barr virus, cells from each species were characterically different. Transformed human umbilical cord cells expressed the complement receptor; monkey cells exhibited both this receptor and the receptor for IgG Fc (EA 7 S); and marmoset cells did not have either surface marker. We measured the transformation efficiency of human and marmoset leukocyte subpopulations enriched or depeleted in cells with the complement receptor. In both species the highest efficiencies of transformation were found in populations with the greatest numbers of cells with the receptor. The data therefore suggest that, in all species, a cell with the complement receptor is susceptible to transformation but that this receptor is not expressed on transformed marmoset cells. Thus, in Epstein-Barr virus-induced transformation {{it is necessary to}} distinguish between transformation of growth properties (immortalization) and transformation of cell surface properties...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} use of nonhuman primates as models for infectious diseases and reproductive biology, imprecise phenotypic and functional definitions exist for natural killer (NK) cells. This deficit is particularly significant in the burgeoning use of small, less expensive New World primate species. Using polychromatic flow cytometry, we identified peripheral blood NK cells as CD 3 -negative and expressing a cluster of cell surface molecules characteristic of NK cells (i. e., NKG 2 A, NKp 46, NKp 30) in three New World primate species - common <b>marmosets,</b> <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, and squirrel monkeys. We then assessed subset distribution using the classical NK markers, CD 56 and CD 16. In all species, similar to Old World primates, only a minor subset of NK cells was CD 56 +, and the dominant subset was CD 56 -CD 16 +. Interestingly, CD 56 + NK cells were primarily cytokine-secreting cells, whereas CD 56 -CD 16 + NK cells expressed significantly greater levels of intracellular perforin, suggesting these cells might have greater potential for cytotoxicity. New World primate species, like Old World primates, also had a minor CD 56 -CD 16 - NK cell subset that has no obvious counterpart in humans. Herein we present phenotypic profiles of New World primate NK cell subpopulations that are generally analogous {{to those found in}} humans. This conservation among species should support the further use of these species for biomedical research...|$|R
