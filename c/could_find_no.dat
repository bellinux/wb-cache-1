5|$|The sheriff, Teller, {{was named}} after Teller from the {{illusion}} and comedy duo Penn and Teller. The pair had wanted to appear on an episode of the show, but when Chris Carter <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> way to work them into the show this reference was added instead. The Astadourian Lightning Observatory {{was named after}} Mary Astadourian, Chris Carter's executive assistant. Darin Oswald was named after writer Darin Morgan.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} first session of the Tenth Congress, Rowan {{proposed}} that a congressional committee be formed to investigate accusations against General James Wilkinson that, in 1788, he took money from the government of Spain in exchange for efforts to separate Kentucky from Virginia and unite it with Spain rather than the United States. Aaron Burr {{had been accused of}} working with Wilkinson in the so-called Spanish Conspiracy, and when Burr had approached Rowan in 1806 to solicit his services in defending Burr against the charges, Rowan had declined because he believed Burr to be guilty. Rowan's proposal to form an investigative committee against Wilkinson failed, but he succeeded in gaining approval for a committee to investigate federal judge Harry Innes' purported role in the Conspiracy. Rowan was appointed to the committee and delivered its report April 19, 1808; the report stated that the committee <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> evidence of wrongdoing by Innes.|$|E
50|$|The kiln {{fell into}} disuse after the colliery's {{fireclay}} workings were abandoned in 1903, {{and it was}} eventually demolished in the late 1940s. An archaeological excavation {{carried out in the}} early 21st century <b>could</b> <b>find</b> virtually <b>no</b> trace of it.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{was taken}} by wagon and train to Jackson, Mississippi, then to Montgomery, Alabama, before finally being {{confined}} to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederacy's capital. In August, he was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where Confederate officials investigated whether Dow had armed slaves {{to fight against the}} rebels, which the Confederate Congress had made a capital offense. Dow had done so, but his prosecutors <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> evidence of such an action after the law was passed, so the charges were dropped and Dow was returned to Libby Prison in October. He remained there until February 1864, when he was exchanged for captive Confederate General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee. His health was damaged by his prison experience, and after spending several months convalescing in Portland, he resigned from the Army in November 1864.|$|E
5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Segrè's group set up its {{equipment}} in a disused Forest Service {{cabin in the}} Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos in August 1943. His group's task was to measure and catalog the radioactivity of various fission products. An important line of research was determining the degree of isotope enrichment achieved with various samples of enriched uranium. Initially, the tests using mass spectrometry, used by Columbia University, and neutron assay, used by Berkeley, gave different results. Segrè studied Berkeley's results and <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> error, while Kenneth Bainbridge likewise found no fault with New York's. However, analysis of another sample showed close agreement. Higher rates of spontaneous fission were observed at Los Alamos, which Segrè's group concluded were due to cosmic rays, which were more prevalent at Los Alamos due to its high altitude.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{examined}} the role of this polymorphism in risk of neuropsychiatric disorders , including schizophrenia [...] and depression.It is generally thought that some variants of the polymorphism lead to memory impairment and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders,and a 2007 meta-analysis of case-control studies found a relationship between the SNP and substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia.Another 2007 meta-analysis <b>could,</b> however, <b>find</b> <b>no</b> association between the SNP and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.Meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease also indicate that the SNP has little or no association with these diseases.Also inconsistencies in association studies with depression have been noted.|$|R
5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} hartebeest is Alcelaphus buselaphus. First described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, it is classified in the genus Alcelaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. In 1979, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba supported Sigmoceros as a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest, a kind of hartebeest, as she assumed it was related to Connochaetes (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein's hartebeest with Connochaetes. However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum, who classified it as an independent species of Alcelaphus. Zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon and Theodor Haltenorth considered it to be a subspecies of A. buselaphus. Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An MtDNA analysis <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest. It also showed the tribe Alcelaphini to be monophyletic, and discovered close affinity between the Alcelaphus and the sassabies (genus Damaliscus)—both genetically and morphologically.|$|E
5|$|With {{the enemy}} subdued, Strachan ordered a {{thorough}} {{search of the}} captured vessels, but <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>no</b> contraband and returned control to the French commander. The French officer however refused, insisting {{that he and his}} ship were treated as prisoners of war. Cornwallis ordered the merchant ships released to continue their journey and for the frigate to be towed back to Mahé, where it was anchored in the roads with its sails and topmasts struck. Provision was subsequently made at Mahé by Strachan for the wounded French sailors. Soon afterwards Saint-Félix arrived at Mahé in his frigate Cybèle and reacted furiously at the discovery that one of his neutral ships had been attacked and captured by the British. When Cornwallis insisted that his ships had been acting within their orders, Saint-Félix promised reprisals if any of his vessels were attacked again and withdrew with both Cybèle and Résolue later in the day, followed by Minerva and Phoenix. One account reported that Saint-Félix actually ordered his crew to fire on Cornwallis but that they refused. The British shadowed the French for several days, openly stopping and searching French merchant ships but without provoking a response from Saint-Félix. Résolue and Phoenix were subsequently detached by their commanders, Cornwallis and Saint-Félix remaining in contact for several more days before finally separating.|$|E
