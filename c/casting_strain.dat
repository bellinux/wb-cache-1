40|$|Abstract The {{results of}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on the cyclic behavior of composite truss beam to reinforced concrete column connection of moment resisting frames are reported. The beams are constituted by a steel truss and end zone added rebar {{embedded within a}} concrete block cast in place, so that, after curing, the steel truss and the added rebar work together with the concrete matrix as reinforcement of the composite beam. Particularly, three specimens of two-span continuous beams were tested under monotonic and cyclic actions as three point bending test. With the goal to investigate about {{the behavior of the}} end zone of the beam integrated into a moment resisting frame before concrete <b>casting</b> <b>strain</b> gauges were placed on the steel reinforcements close to the joint, where plastic behavior was expected, in order to identify the role of steel truss elements in providing stiffness and strength in the plastic hinge region. Experimental results are reproduced by a fiber model. The results prove that in the joint region the bottom steel plate and the top truss chord are not effective in tension, while they are partially effective in compression. The large amount of unbounded reinforcing elements causes a concentration of plastic deformations in a small region at the beam edge; however, the beam exhibits large rotational ductility. In lacking of specific confining reinforcement at the beam end, when large rotations are experienced, the damage of unconfined concrete reduces section strength and ductility for cyclic action, causing a sudden loss of bonding between reinforcing rebars and damaged concrete...|$|E

The object of this research effort was, upon request for evidence from a building contractor, to compare the influence of various amounts and types of fibers on crack widths, using a steel ring mold. Comparisons were made between syn-thetic fibers (polyolefin) of 48 mm length, hooked-end steel fibers of diameters 0. 6 mm and 1. 05 mm, both of 50 mm length. 10 -liter samples were extracted from concrete ready-mix truck batches at delivery sites, whereupon fibers were mixed into the samples, layer by layer, by applying a drill-mounted mortar mixing device. For each amount of fiber content, 4 rings were cast, and of the plain concrete control samples, 5 rings were cast. After removing the outer steel <b>casting,</b> <b>strain</b> gages were installed on the exposed outer concrete surface. Strain values were continuously logged, and crack developments and crack widths were measured daily. Sufficient data with statistically high significance were ob-tained to indicate that: A synthetic fiber content of 3 kg/m 3 did not decrease crack-widths {{as compared to the}} non-fiber concrete samples. Synthetic fiber contents of 5 kg/m 3 and higher, did reduce crack widths on par with hooked-end steel fibers in the amounts of 25 kg/m 3 and above.

GC tumor susceptibility is supported by multiple Granulosa cell tumor (Gct) loci, but the Gct 1 locus on Chr 4 derived from SWR strain background is fundamental for GC tumor development and uniquely responsive to the androgenic precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). To resolve the location of Gct 1 independently from other susceptibility loci, Gct 1 was isolated in a congenic strain that replaces the distal segment of Chr 4 in SWR mice with a 47 9 106 -bp genomic segment from the Castaneus/Ei (<b>CAST)</b> <b>strain.</b> SWR females homozygous for the CAST donor segment were confirmed to be resistant to DHEA- and testosterone-induced GC tumorigenesis, indicating successful exchange of CAST alleles (Gct 1 CA) for SWR alleles (Gct 1 SW) at this tumor susceptibility locus.

A mapping study between TgFVB and CAST/EiJ (<b>CAST)</b> <b>strains</b> showed this trait {{to be influenced}} by a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 3 A 1 –A 3 (HIVAN 1), with CAST alleles associated with increased risk of disease. We introgressed a 50 [*]Mb interval, encompassing this HIVAN 1 locus, from CAST into the TgFVB genome (TgFVB-HIVAN 1 CAST congenic mice). Compared to the TgFVB strain, these congenic mice developed an earlier onset of proteinuria, a rapid progression to kidney failure, and increased mortality. A prospective study of these congenic mice also showed that they had a significantly greater histologic and biochemical evidence of glomerulopathy with one-third of mice developing global glomerulosclerosis by 6 weeks of age. An F 2 cross between TgFVB and the congenic mice identified a significant linkage (LOD= 3. 7) to a 10 [*]cM interval within the HIVAN 1 region between D 3 Mit 167 and D 3 Mit 67 resulting in a 60 % reduction of the original interval.

Mammalian meiotic recombination, which preferentially occurs at specialized sites, 1 - 2 Kb long, known as hotspots, assures the orderly segregation of meiotic chromosomes and creates genetic variation among offspring. However, despite their importance in determining the recombination landscape of the organism, we have little understanding of the elements determining the location and relative activity of hotspots. That {{the location of a}} hotspot is not determined simply by its internal DNA sequence is supported by both yeast (1) an d mammalian studies (2, 3). Two recent reports (4, 5) have described the existence of trans-acting loci that control the activation of specific hotspots elsewhere. The loci, Dsbc 1 and Rcr 1, are located in overlapping 5. 4 Mb and 6. 3 Mb regions on mouse chromosome 17. We have now extended the mapping of both Rcr 1 and Dsbc 1 using 1580 progeny of a cross between the C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and CAST/EiJ (<b>CAST)</b> mouse <b>strains</b> differing in activity of the Rcr 1 / Dsbc 1 controlled hotspots Hlx 1, Esrrg- 1 and Psmb 9 (fig. S 1). We located both loci to a common 181 Kb region containing four protein coding genes (Fig. 1) : Psmb 1, Tbp, Pdcd 2, and Prdm 9. We found no differences in expression levels of the transcripts of any of these proteins in testes when assayed by RT-PCR (table S 1). Psmb 1, proteasome beta type 1 subunit, is a ubiquitously expressed protein that functions as a structural component of an organelle responsible for generalized protein degradation.

Pdcd 2, programmed cell death protein 2, is widely expressed, repressed during B cell lymphomagenesis. Based on DNA sequencing of the entire coding regions of these three proteins, we found only five coding SNPs, all synonymous, resulting in no amino acid differences between the B 6 and <b>CAST</b> <b>strains</b> (table S 2).

A major susceptibility locus, HIVAN 1, was previously mapped to chromosome 3 A 1 -A 3 in {{a cross between}} TgFVB and CAST/EiJ (<b>CAST)</b> <b>strains,</b> and introgression of a 51. 9 Mb segment encompassing HIVAN 1 from CAST into TgFVB resulted in accelerated development of nephropathy. We generated three sub-congenic <b>strains</b> carrying <b>CAST</b> alleles in the proximal or distal regions of the HIVAN 1 locus (Sub-II, 3. 02 - 38. 93 Mb; Sub-III, 38. 45 - 55. 1 Mb and Sub-IV, 47. 7 - 55. 1 Mb, build 38). At 5 - 10 weeks of age, histologic injury and proteinuria did not differ between HIV- 1 transgenic Sub-II and TgFVB mice. In contrast, HIV- 1 transgenic Sub-III and Sub-IV mice displayed up to 4. 4 fold more histopathologic injury and 6 -fold more albuminuria compared to TgFVB mice, similar in severity to the full-length congenic mice. The Sub-IV segment defines a maximal 7. 4 Mb interval for HIVAN 1, and encodes 31 protein coding genes: 15 genes have missense variants differentiating CAST from FVB, and 14 genes show differential renal expression. Of these, Frem 1, Foxo 1, and Setd 7 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nephropathy. HIVAN 1 congenic kidneys are histologically normal without the HIV- 1 transgene, yet their global transcriptome is enriched for molecular signatures of apoptosis, adenoviral infection, as well as genes repressed by histone H 3 lysine 27 trimethylation, a histone modification associated with HIV- 1 life cycle.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii {{undergoes}} differentiation from {{rapidly growing}} tachyzoites to slowly growing bradyzoites during its life cycle in the intermediate host, and conversion can be induced in vitro by stress. Representative {{strains of the}} three clonal lineages showed equal capacity to differentiate into bradyzoites in vitro, as evidenced by induction of bradyzoite antigen 1, staining with Dolichos biflorus lectin (DBL), pepsin resistance, and oral infectivity in mice. We also examined several recently described exotic strains of T. gondii, which are genetically diverse and have a different ancestry from the clonal lineages. The exotic strain COUG was essentially like the clonal lineages and showed a high capacity to induce bradyzoites in vitro and in vivo, consistent with its ability to be efficiently transmitted by the oral route. In contrast, exotic strains MAS and FOU, which are defective in oral transmission, showed a decreased potential to develop into bradyzoites in vitro. This defect was evident from reduced staining with DBL and the cyst antigen CST 1, failure to down-regulate tachyzoite antigens, such as tachyzoite surface antigens 1 and 2 A, and decreased resistance to pepsin treatment. Despite normal in vitro differentiation, the exotic <b>strains</b> <b>CAST</b> and GPHT also showed decreased oral transmission, due to formation of smaller cysts and a lower tissue burden during chronic infection, traits also shared by MAS and FOU.

40|$|Juvenile-type granulosa cell tumors (GCT) {{originate}} in the somatic tissues that surround the germ cells of the ovarian follicle in children and young women. Unlike Adult-type GCT that share a common, acquired mutation in the FOXL 2 gene, the genetic determinants for juvenile-type GCT susceptibility are not so well defined. A spontaneous, early-onset GCT phenotype in SWR inbred female mice has revealed multiple Gct loci: Gct 1 on Chromosome (Chr) 4 initiates the tumorigenic program; Gct 4 on Chr X modifies trait penetrance and Gct 6 on Chr X is a suppressor of GCT initiation. The Gct 6 locus has been mapped to a 1. 02 million base pair region with over 20 annotated genes. Two complementary approaches were taken to help prioritize Gct 6 gene candidates. First, a congenic strain approach was taken to determine the tumor suppressor phenotype of the Gct 6 C 57 allele in SWR. C 57 -X females. Second, a whole-locus capture and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol was applied to identify all nucleotide variations between SWR (tumor-susceptible SW) and Castaneus (CAST; tumor-resistant CA) alleles vs. the C 57 BL/ 6 J (C 57) genome. The congenic strain data supported the hypothesis that a common Gct 6 tumor suppressor allele in C 57 and CAST genomes was distinct from the permissive Gct 6 SW allele, which reduced the prioritized list of NGS variants (SNPs, INDELs) to 746. Priority was given to non-synonymous variants identified in the coding region of 5 candidate genes: BC 065397, Esx 1, Slc 25 a 53, Tmsb 15 b 1 and Tmsb 15 l.

40|$|Purpose. Analysis {{of changes}} of high-chromium cast irons' {{structure}} and properties {{under the influence}} of physical and heat factors during mechanical machining. Methodology. The methodology of evaluation of the cutting tool's force and heat influence on the machined material has been developed and applied. Cast specimens underwent preliminary turning to obtain the diameter of 25 mm. The microsection was made on the end surface of the specimen with the length of 50 mm. Standard plates with sizes 10 × 10 mm made of VK 8 according to the State Standard 19051 - 80 were used in the turning process. Findings. Force influence on the specimens made of highchromium <b>cast</b> iron caused <b>strain</b> hardening during machining. Temperature influence on the structure and properties of high-chromium cast iron during machining caused increase of the plasticity characteristics of the metallic base in the cutting area, fragmentation of the carbide phase and elimination of the strain hardening. During turning with cutting depth 0. 8 mm only force influence of the cutting tool on the specimen took place. Carbide inclusions in the surface layer didn't undergo sufficient changes; {{at the same time the}} metallic base was strain-hardened to 1 100 HV 50. As it was drawn away from the turning surface, the microhardness of the metallic base was decreasing and equaled to 500 … 520 HV 50 at the distance of 1. 2 mm from the turning surface. Strain hardening was not observed at the depth of more than 3 mm. Cutting depth increase up to 1. 5 mm caused simultaneous influence of force and heat factors. The temperature influence revealed in increasing of metallic base plasticity in the specimen's surface layers. Strain hardening of heated surface layers didn't occur. While drawing away from the cutting surface, the influence of the temperature factor decreased, when the influence of force factor remained the same. Due to the base plasticity decrease the strain hardening occurred. The metallic base strain was hardened to 490 … 520 HV 50.

40|$|The {{testing of}} {{physical}} analogues {{has been shown}} to be important in the development of theoretical models describing the relationships between fluid flow in fracture systems, and the state of stress and deformation within the host rock of the fracture. The flow and transport characteristics related to fracturing are often enhanced by the effects of the state of stress in the rock walls, which may open up secondary pathways and cause chemical alterations in the wall rocks. [...] The objective of this study was to describe the influence of two, parallel, large scale fracture roughness asperities on: 1) the fracture stiffness, displacement and hydraulic transmissivity, 2) the local stress field in the adjacent wall rock, 3) the mode and patterns of secondary fracturing, and 4) the effects on host rock permeability all as a function of changes in both normal and shear stress. The overall study approach included a series of experiments on an instrumented high strength concrete model of a fracture plane in a stiff biaxial loading frame, and comparison of the experimental data with numerical model simulations. [...] The concrete model (200 x 200 x 300 millimetres) was <b>cast</b> with 92 <b>strain</b> gauges mounted on concrete coupons embedded along the centre of the model, and 17 manometer ports intersecting the fracture plane to measure the fluid pressures across the length of the model. The fracture plane was formed by pressing an aluminium plate matching the form of the asperities into the wet concrete. This plate was separated from the wet concrete by a piece of geotextile. When the concrete was set, the second half of the model was cast on the geotextile (which was left in place). This geotextile provided the form of a uniform small scale roughness on the fracture surface after the blocks were separated. Four 6. 4 millimetre diameter wells were drilled into the top of the model. These wells were used to estimate the matrix permeability changes of the concrete of the model as it was subjected to changing load conditions. [...] Results of the study confirmed that the large scale asperities had a significant influence on the local strain field, as seen in the data recovered from the 78 strain gauges that survived the casting and pre-test processes. Three normal and four shear loading cycles showed repeatable internal strain patterns that reflected the effects of the applied boundary conditions. Fracturing in the model was assumed to be caused by tensile stress concentrations at the base of the asperities, and at the ends of the sample. [...] Displacement data indicate permanent normal closure of the fracture was greatest for the first normal loading cycle, and decreased over the following two cycles. During the final four cycles, the permanent fracture closure became essentially identical at about 20 per cent of the original closure. This suggests that fracture seating occurred during the first normal loading cycle, which is consistent with other experimental work. [...] Fracture transmissivity was seen to decrease logarithmically with the cube root of the normal stress applied to the sample, and decreased further as the sample was sheared, causing closure of the aperture at the large scale asperities. [...] The four wells drilled into the top of the model were pressurised with 345 kPa (50 psi) water, and shut in. The pressure decline of each well was monitored sequentially throughout the shear cycles and these data were used to estimate the relative permeability of the concrete. All four wells showed similar decline curves over the periods that each well was monitored. There was no indication that the permeability of the concrete was enhanced by the shear stress applied except by the propagation of secondary fracturing through the wells as the concrete failed. [...] The post-test finite element analysis confirmed the assumption that induced tensile fracturing was the primary mode of failure in this experiment. Under normal load, finite element analysis showed that the large scale asperities caused local changes in the orientation of the stress field. Under combined normal and shear load, there were significant tensile stress concentrations associated with the restraining and releasing bends of the fracture, which provided the focus points for the onset of failure of the blocks...|$|R
