25|$|On April 15 {{humanitarian}} aid organizations were granted {{access to the}} camp {{for the first time}} since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>staff</b> entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day Adalah and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp. On April 19, a day after Israeli troops withdrew from the camp, journalists reported counting about 23 bodies that were lined up on the outdoor grounds of the clinic, before being quickly buried by Palestinians.|$|E

500|$|According to tradition, bishops may use {{the arms}} of their diocese marshalled with their own {{personal}} arms, with a mitre {{in place of the}} helmet and a crosier displayed behind the shield, but these are removed when the bishop retires. These arms may {{take the form of a}} shield divided per pale or quartered with the arms of the diocese in the first and third quarters and the bishop's personal arms in the second and fourth quarters. The <b>cross</b> <b>staff</b> or [...] "primate cross" [...] is used only by the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Bishop of Lund, crossed with the crosier behind the shield. Antje Jackelén, Bishop of Lund, uses the traditional oval shield of a woman's arms, and her arms were designed by the diocese's heraldist, Jan Raneke. Raneke also designed the arms of Jackelén's predecessor, Christina Odenberg, who was the first woman to be a bishop in the Church of Sweden.|$|E
500|$|The nation's {{president}} {{flew into}} the destructed area, lifting survivors' spirits.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945, Bernadotte was in Germany when he met Heinrich Himmler, who was briefly {{appointed}} commander of an entire German army following the assassination attempt on Hitler the year before. [...] Bernadotte had originally been assigned to retrieve Norwegian and Danish POWs in Germany. [...] He returned on 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler's death. [...] Following an interview, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet wrote that Bernadotte succeeded in rescuing 15,000 people from German concentration camps, including about 8000 Danes and Norwegians and 7000 women of French, Polish, Czech, British, American, Argentinian, and Chinese nationalities. [...] The missions took around two months, and exposed the Swedish Red <b>Cross</b> <b>staff</b> to significant danger, both due to political difficulties and by taking them through areas under Allied bombing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1594, {{they may}} have been visited by English {{commander}} Richard Hawkins, who, combining his own name with that of Queen Elizabeth I, the [...] "Virgin Queen", gave a group of islands the name of [...] "Hawkins' Maidenland". However, the latitude given was off by at least 3 degrees and the description of the shore (including the sighting of bonfires) casts doubts on his discovery. [...] Errors in the latitude measured can be attributed to a simple mistake reading a <b>cross</b> <b>staff</b> divided into minutes meaning the latitude measured could be 50° 48'. [...] The description of bonfires can also be attributed to peat fires caused by lightning, which is not uncommon in the outer islands of the Falklands in February. In 1925, Conor O'Brian analysed the voyage of Hawkins and concluded that the only land he could have sighted was Steeple Jason Island. [...] The British historian Mary Cawkell also points out that criticism of the account of Hawkins discovery should be tempered by the fact it was written 9 years after the event; Hawkins was captured by the Spanish and spent 8 years in prison.|$|E
