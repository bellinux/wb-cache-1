50|$|Once {{the control}} program's {{dispatcher}} selects a TCB to be dispatched, the context is determined {{and the general}} purpose registers are obtained from the appropriate <b>control</b> <b>block,</b> then the PSW is loaded from the appropriate <b>control</b> <b>block</b> thereby dispatching the unit of work.|$|R

[...] evaluates the <b>controlled</b> <b>block</b> or expression for each element of list and returns {{a list of the}} resulting values. These constructs enable a simple functional programming style.|$|R
50|$|Rather, a TCB {{provides}} an anchor for a linked list of other, related request <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> (RBs), the composite of which (i.e., the TCB plus the top-linked RB) performs {{the function of}} a Process control block.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstream}} view engine used in MonoRail is NVelocity, {{based on}} the Apache Velocity library. NVelocity is supplied with simple <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> such as if statements and foreach loops. The NVelocity view templates are text files with the extension '.vm'.|$|E
50|$|RPL <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> are not {{strictly}} postfix. Although {{there are some}} notable exceptions, the control block structures appear as they would in a standard infix language. The calculator manages this by allowing the implementation of these blocks to skip ahead in the program stream as necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} system holds {{most of this}} information about active processes in data structures called process <b>control</b> <b>blocks.</b> Any subset of the resources, typically at least the processor state, {{may be associated with}} each of the process' threads in {{operating system}}s that support threads or child (daughter) processes.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{version of}} GW-BASIC {{was the one}} {{included}} with Compaq DOS 1.13 (released with the Compaq Portable in 1983) and was analogous to IBM BASICA 1.10. It used the CP/M-derived file <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> for disk access and did not support subdirectories. Later versions added this feature and improved graphics and other capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The Program {{status word}} may {{be stored in}} one <b>control</b> <b>block</b> (possibly a PRB, a Program Request Block), while the general purpose {{registers}} may be stored in the immediately preceding <b>control</b> <b>block</b> (an SVRB, Supervisor Call Request Block, an IRB, Interruption Request Block, or the TCB itself), depending upon the particular context.|$|R

50|$|These {{spaces are}} similar in that both are areas of virtual storage that a program can create, and can be up to 2 gigabytes. Unlike an address space, a dataspace or hiperspace {{contains}} only user data; it does not contain system <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> or common areas. Program code cannot run in a dataspace or a hiperspace.|$|E
50|$|A DCB {{is one of}} {{the many}} <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> used in these {{operating}} systems. A control block is a data area with a predefined structure, very similar to a C , but typically only related to system's functions. A DCB may be compared to a FILE structure in C, but it is much more complex, offering many more options for various access methods.|$|E

50|$|In IBM {{mainframe}} {{operating systems}} from the OS/360 and successors line, a Unit <b>Control</b> <b>Block</b> (UCB) is a memory structure, or a <b>control</b> <b>block,</b> that describes any single input/output peripheral device (unit), or an exposure (alias), {{to the operating}} system. Certain data within the UCB also instructs the Input/Output Supervisor (IOS) to use certain closed subroutines in addition to normal IOS processing for additional physical device control.|$|R

50|$|Caché ObjectScript {{is a part}} of the Caché {{database}} system sold by InterSystems. The {{language is}} a functional superset of the ANSI-standard MUMPS programming language. Since Caché is at its core a MUMPS implementation, it can run ANSI MUMPS routines with no change. To appeal as a commercial product, Caché implements support for object-oriented programming, a macro preprocessing language, embedded SQL for ANSI-standard SQL access to M's built-in database, procedure and <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> using C-like brace syntax, procedure-scoped variables, and relaxed whitespace syntax limitations.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1966, CSC staff {{began the}} {{conversion}} of CP-40 and CMS to run on the S/360-67. CP-67 was a significant reimplementation of CP-40; Varian reports that the design was [...] "generalized substantially, to allow a variable number of virtual machines, with larger virtual memories", that new data structures replaced [...] "the <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> describing the virtual machines which had been a hard-coded part of the nucleus", that CP-67 added [...] "the concept of free storage, so that <b>control</b> <b>blocks</b> could be allocated dynamically", and that [...] "the inter-module linkage was also reworked, and the code was made re-entrant." [...] Since CSC's -67 would not arrive for some time, CSC further modified the microcode on its own customized S/360-40 to simulate the S/360-67 [...] - [...] particularly its different approach to virtual memory. CSC repeatedly and successfully used simulation to work around the absence of hardware: when waiting for its modified S/360-40, for its S/360-67, and later for the first S/370 prototypes. This {{can be seen as}} a logical outgrowth of [...] "virtual machine" [...] thinking. During this period, early testing of CP-67 was also done at sites where S/360-67 hardware was available [...] - [...] notably IBM's Yorktown Heights lab and MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A {{new line}} {{equalizer}} is {{proposed for the}} appli-cation of backplane serial link. The equalizer is made of digitally controlled feed-forward equalizer (DCFFE), bottom detector, limiting amplifier and <b>control</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>block</b> is capable of detecting signal shapes and decides the high frequency boosting level of DCFFE. Successful equalization is demonstrated for signals trans-mitted over 2 m long PCB trace (about 10 dB loss). The circuit is designed with CMOS 0. 18 ㎛ fabrication process and verified with SPICE simulation...|$|R
