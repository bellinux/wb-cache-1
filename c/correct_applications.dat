5000|$|In the {{religious}} field, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1839-1897) gave Islam a modernist reinterpretation and fused {{adherence to the}} faith with an anti-colonial doctrine that preached Pan-Islamic solidarity {{in the face of}} European pressures. He also favored the replacement of authoritarian monarchies with representative rule, and denounced what he perceived as the dogmatism, stagnation and corruption of the Islam of his age. He claimed that tradition (taqlid, تقليد) had stifled Islamic debate and repressed the correct practices of the faith. Al-Afghani's case for a redefinition of old interpretations of Islam, and his bold attacks on traditional religion, would become vastly influential with the fall of the Caliphate in 1924. This created a void in {{the religious}} doctrine and social structure of Islamic communities which had been only temporarily reinstated by Abdul Hamid II in an effort to bolster universal Muslim support, suddenly vanished. It forced Muslims to look for new interpretations of the faith, and to re-examine widely held dogma; exactly what al-Afghani had urged them to do decades earlier.Al-Afghani influenced many, but greatest among his followers is undoubtedly his student Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905), whose teachings would play a similarly important role in the reform of the practice of Islam. Like al-Afghani, Abduh accused traditionalist Islamic authorities of moral and intellectual corruption, and of imposing a doctrinaire form of Islam on the ummah, that had hindered <b>correct</b> <b>applications</b> of the faith. He therefore advocated that Muslims should return to the [...] "true" [...] Islam practiced by the ancient Caliphs, which he held had been both rational and divinely inspired. Applying the original message of the Prophet Muhammad with no interference of tradition or the faulty interpretations of his followers, would automatically create the just society ordained by God in the Qur'an, and so empower the Muslim world to stand against colonization and injustices.|$|E

40|$|Soil blowing {{is often}} a serious problem from December to May [in the Southern Great Plains], when the soil is, in many cases, bare and winds are high. This period is often {{referred}} to as the 'blow season. ' The whole art of preventing and controlling soil blowing consists in keeping nonblowing materials on the surface. These may be crops, crop residues, or clods. When crops are absent, the essential feature in preventing soil blowing is the use of implements that lift clods and other nonblowing materials to the surface rather than implements that pulverize or destroy them [...] Since tillage is dependent on implements, it seems of first importance to consider the implements that may be used to discuss their merits and shortcomings in relation to soil blowing [...] From the general principles stated and the specific examples of implement use given, most farmers can probably decide on the <b>correct</b> <b>applications</b> for their farms.

Research on n-damo bacteria progresses quickly with experimental evidences through enrichment cultures.

Important characteristics of n-damo enrichments were obtained and their key significance in microbial nitrogen and carbon cycles was investigated. The molecular methods currently used in detecting n-damo bacteria were comprehensively reviewed and discussed for their strengths and limitations in applications {{with a wide range of}} samples. The pmoA gene-based PCR primers for n-damo bacterial detection were evaluated and, in particular, several incorrectly stated PCR primer nucleotide sequences in the published papers were also pointed out to allow <b>correct</b> <b>applications</b> of the PCR primers in current and future investigations.

Relatively new to the United States, these HVAC systems have potential to reduce energy consumption and utility costs in the <b>correct</b> <b>applications.</b> Although useful in many applications, the best building types for VRF are those requiring {{a large number of}} zones and with low ventilation air requirements. The report explains design and system selection considerations and accordingly presents two flowcharts to help designers implement this system. To show how the system compares to traditional technologies in terms of efficiency and cost, the report presents results from several studies comparing VRF to other systems. In addition, an energy modeling study is conducted to clarify the effect of climate on the system; this study established air-to-air VRF as having highest energy consumption in dry, southern climates, based on energy use and operating costs. With this report, HVAC designers can learn when air-to-air VRF is an acceptable method for providing heating and cooling in a building...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of aspirin, an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug, undoubtedly represents {{a milestone in}} the history of medical therapy. Since ancient times the derivatives of willow (Salix alba) were used to treat a variety of fevers and pain syndromes, although the first report dates back to 1763 when the English Reverend Edward Stone described the effect of an extract of the bark willow in treating malaria. In the XIX century many apothecaries and chemists, including the Italian Raffaele Piria and Cesare Bertagnini, developed the biological processes of extraction and chemical synthesis of salicylates, and then analyzed their therapeutic properties and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. In 1899 the Bayer Company, where Felix Hoffmann, Heinrich Dreser and Arthur Eichengrün worked, recorded acetyl-salicylic acid under the name “Aspirin”. In the XX century, besides the definition of the <b>correct</b> <b>applications</b> of aspirin in the anti-rheumatic therapy being defined, Lawrence L.

Finitism denies that inherent properties or meanings attach to concepts and determine their future <b>correct</b> <b>applications</b> ’ (Barnes 1982, 30). ‘[N]othing in the rule itself fixes its application in a given case ’ (Barnes 1995, 202). 3 An important theme in the work of Barry Barnes has been ‘finitism’. The theme emerged from Barnes’s work in the sociology of science, and in particular from his engagement with the philosophy of science of Mary Hesse (1974), and first became clear when Barnes made explicit the finitist aspects of the work of T. S. Kuhn (Barnes 1982). Subsequently, Barnes built finitism into the core of his approach to social theory and to the analysis of social order, for example elaborating Wittgenstein’s famous account of rule-following. In this chapter, I will argue that Barnes’s finitism throws light on a domain quite different from that in which it was developed: accounting, and specifically financial reporting. Many of th...|$|E
