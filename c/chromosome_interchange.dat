40|$|Rice stocks {{carrying}} {{one or more}} recessive marker genes were fertilized with pollen of a stock carrying normal alleles at {{the corresponding}} loci, that had been preirradiated with gamma rays. Plants derived from such hybridization were investigated for their marker genes, morphological features and seed fertility. Fifty-two pseudo-dominant plants for 9 marker genes were detected from 13, 063 plants of 10 cross combinations, {{and a number of}} other plants that did not show pseudo-dominant for any marker genes but had variations in morphological features and/or seed fertility, were also obtained. The chromosome number of those plants were counted in the root tip cells, and plants with 2 n= 12, 2 n= 23, 2 n= 23 + 1 Fr (fragment chromosome), 2 n= 23 + 2 Fr, 2 n= 23 + 3 Fr, 2 n= 25, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchange</b> heterozygous, were observed.

40|$|Motivation: The {{position}} of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus {{is believed to}} be associated with a number of biological processes. Here, we present a web-based application that helps analyze the relative {{position of}} chromosomes during interphase in human cells, based on observed radiogenic chromosome aberrations. The inputs of the program are a table of yields of pairwise <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> and a proposed chromosome geometric cluster. Each can either be uploaded or selected from provided datasets. The main outputs are P-values for the proposed chromosome clusters. SCHIP is designed to be used by a number of scientific communities interested in nuclear architecture, including cancer and cell biologists, radiation biologists and mathematical/computational biologists...|$|R
40|$|Interchanges (otherwise {{known as}} {{segmental}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> or reciprocal translocations), involving exchanges of segments of nonhomologous chromosomes, {{have been studied}} extensively in plants. Probably the earliest observations were those of Gates (1903) on a ring of chromosomes at meiosis in Oenothera rubrinervis. Belling's reports of sterility in hybrids amongst certain velvet beans (Stizolobium) were later attributed to an <b>interchange</b> of <b>chromosome</b> segments (Belling, 1925). More clearly defined early cases were provided by McClintock's (1930) cytological demonstrations of interchanges in maize. Burnham's (1956) review indicates a sizable accumulation of data in plants. The researches in maize by Brink, McClintock and Burnham, and others, {{are by far the}} most extensive, and these data have contributed much to our present understanding of many cytological processes, particularly synapsis, chiasma formation and orientation phenomena...|$|R

The chlorophyll-defi-cient allele was tested against eight nuclear chlorophyll-deficient mutants {{and was found}} nonallelic; It was assigned gene symbol /so- The tan-saddle allele was identified previously as l< 2 - Mutant y 2 o-f< 2 was n ° t located on trlsomics A, B, or C, and l< 2 was not linked to the breakpoint of a homozygous <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchange</b> from PI 101. 404 B. No linkage was detected between y 2 o-^ 2 or k 2 and seven mutants that were not chlorophyll deficient. About 25 000 F 2 and F 3 plants were classified, but y ^ could not be separated genetically from k 2. The lack of crossover genotypes Indicated either that the genes are tightly linked or that there Is a plelotroplc effect.

40|$|A {{chimeric}} {{plant was}} observed in the F 2 generation of {{a cross between a}} male-sterile line and a plant introduction homozygous for a <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchange</b> in soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ]. F 3 progeny of this plant included one chimera, 36 yellow plants and 16 green plants. The yellow plants, which progressively turn green, were viable and fertile in field, greenhouse and growth-chamber environments. Reciprocal cross-pollinations were made between these yellow plants and four known nuclear yellow mutant plants, between these yellow plants and sibling green plants and between these yellow plants and unrelated green plants. Segregation data from F 1 and F 2 generations indicated cytoplasmic inheritance of the newly discovered yellow phenotype. Pollinations in which reciprocal F 1 hybrid plants were used as male or female parents were made with unrelated green plants. Observations in F 1 and F 2 generations substantiated the hypothesis of cytoplasmic inheritance. No interactions have been observed between this mutant and the various nuclear backgrounds. This is the first report of a cytoplasmically inherited mutant affecting plant color in soybeans. Exchange grafts were made between cytoplasmic yellow plants and sibling green plants and between cytoplasmic yellow plants and unrelated green plants. The phenotype was controlled by the scion, indicating that graft-transmissible agents were not involved. When grown in darkness, cytoplasmic yellow plants and normal green plants accumulated the same amount of protochlorophyllide. Cytoplasmic yellow plants grown in dim light accumulated slightly less chlorophyll than did their green siblings. Electron photomicrographs showed that the prolamellar body (a structure associated with synthesis of protochlorophyllide) and chloroplast ultrastructure were normal in the cytoplasmic yellow mutant. These observations led to the hypothesis that the synchrony involved in deposition of nuclear and cytoplasmic gene products during organelle development is impaired in this cytoplasmic mutant...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of microsporogenesis in endogamous plants of popcorn (S 5 to S 7) showed several and distinctinterchanges which involve the nucleolus organizer (chromosome 6). The detection of cells with interchanges was facilitatedby {{the presence of}} two nucleoli of different sizes in contrast to normal ones with a single big nucleolus. Interchange points donot {{always seem to be}} at the same place. Whereas in several situations the interchange point clearly involved more than twochromosome pairs, a simple terminal translocation seemed to occur in others. During diplotene, a cross-shaped configurationconnected with the nucleoli was observed in some meiocytes. Some heteromorphic bivalents were found during diakinesis,after which meiosis progressed normally to the end and gave rise to apparently normal tetrads with one normal nucleolus ineach microspore. Tests of pollen viability in fixed pollen grains showed 100 % stainability in normal and in affected plants. This is the first report on <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> in popcorn...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{chromosome}} proximity {{plays an}} important role in the understanding of genetic diseases and cancer. During the early cell cycle DNA is arranged in chromosome territories. Irradiation of the cell???s nucleus introduces chromosome breaks that lead to chromosome exchanges. The proximity effect hypothesis states that the number of radiation induced exchanges is larger between chromosomes that are located closer to each other. The validity of the proximity effect hypothesis is testedon three previously published data sets derived from experiments in which <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> in human lymphocytes are recorded. To model random pairwise chromosome interactions we used a log-linear model. We tested the proposed model using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and were not able to reject the null hypothesis of no proximity effect. We considered a modified log-linear model where proximity-effect of individual pairs was included as an additional parameter. We were not able to reject the modified model for chromosome pairs 1, 22 and 13, 14...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To measure {{chromosome}} aberrations in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 mouse fibroblasts using FISH {{painting at}} the first mitosis following exposure to 30 keV/microm hydrogen or neon ions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells in plateau-phase were irradiated with 0. 86 MeV protons at the TTT- 3 Tandem accelerator in Naples (Italy), or with 400 MeV/n Ne ions at the HIMAC accelerator in Chiba (Japan). Colcemid-blocked cells were harvested {{at the first}} mitosis following exposure, and chromosome spreads were hybridized in situ with a fluorescein-labelled composite mouse DNA probe specific for chromosomes 2 and 8. RESULTS: Protons were more efficient than neon ions at the same LET in the induction of <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> and breaks. Yields of complex exchanges were similar for both particles at the same dose, but protons produced mostly insertions, while with Ne exposure non-reciprocal exchanges were the most frequent complex-type exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Charged particles with the same LET produce different yields of chromosome aberrations, and some observed differences can be explained based on the available track-structure models...|$|R
40|$|Both {{fluorescence}} {{in situ hybridization}} of metaphase spreads with whole-chromosome probes and premature chromosome condensation in interphase nuclei {{have been}} used in the past to estimate the radiation dose to lymphocytes. We combined these techniques to evaluate the feasibility of using painted interphase chromosomes for biodosimetry. Human peripheral lymphocytes were exposed to gamma rays and fused to mitotic Chinese hamster cells either immediately after irradiation or after 8 h incubation at 37 degrees C. Interphase or metaphase human chromosomes were hybridized with a composite probe specific for human chromosomes 3 and 4. The dose-response curve for fragment induction immediately after irradiation was linear; these results reflected breakage frequency in the total genome in terms of DNA content per chromosome. At 8 h after irradiation, the dose-response curve for <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges,</b> the prevalent aberration in interphase chromosomes, was linear-quadratic and similar to that observed for metaphase chromosomes. These results suggest that painting prematurely condensed chromosomes can be useful for biological dosimetry when blood samples are available shortly after the exposure, or when interphase cells are to be scored instead of mitotic cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the reasons for pollen sterility in lily hybrids, four diploid sterile Oriental x Trumpet (OT) lily cultivars ('Nymph', 'Gluhwein', 'Yelloween', and 'Shocking') were used to investigate the meiotic chromosome behaviors in pollen mother cells (PMCs), using genomic in situ hybridization and conventional cytological methods. At metaphase I, chromosome associations were quite variable, not only among different genotypes but also in different PMCs of the same genotype. In addition to bivalents, a certain amount of univalent, trivalents, and quadrivalents were observed in all of the investigated genotypes. In addition, ring octavalents and ring hexavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. Even dodecavalents were observed in 'Nymph'. These abnormal chromosome associations at metaphase I implied the occurrence of <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> (translocation) in these intersectional hybrids. At anaphase-telophase, a large number of laggard chromosomes and different kinds of chromosome bridge configurations were observed. At the tetrad stage, micronuclei and polyads were also found in many PMCs. All of these abnormal chromosome behaviors in PMCs were responsible for the pollen sterility in lily hybrids...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} reported the kinetics of chromosome rejoining and exchange formation in human lymphocytes exposed to gamma rays using {{the techniques of}} {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and premature chromosome condensation (PCC). In this paper, we have extended previous measurements to cells exposed to charged particles. Our goal was to determine differences in chromatin break rejoining and misrejoining after exposure to low- and high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. Cells were irradiated with hydrogen, neon, carbon or iron ions in the LET range 0. 3 - 140 keV/microm and were incubated at 37 degrees C for various times after exposure. Little difference was observed in the yield of early prematurely condensed chromosome breaks for the different ions. The kinetics of break rejoining was exponential for all ions and had similar time constants, but the residual level of unrejoined breaks after prolonged incubation was higher for high-LET radiation. The kinetics of exchange formation was also similar for the different ions, but the yield of <b>chromosome</b> <b>interchanges</b> measured soon after exposure was higher for high-LET particles, suggesting that a higher fraction of DNA breaks are misrejoined quickly. On the other hand, the rate of formation of complete exchanges was slightly lower for densely ionizing radiation. The ratios between the yields of different types of aberrations observed at 10 h postirradiation in prematurely condensed chromosome preparations were dependent on LET. We found significant differences between the yields of aberrations measured in interphase (after repair) and metaphase for densely ionizing radiation. This difference might be caused by prolonged mitotic delay and/or interphase death. Overall, the results point out significant differences between low- and high-LET radiation for the formation of chromosome aberrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{recombination}} {{and repair}} defective mutant, mei- 41, exhibits three rather striking {{effects on the}} genetic properties and chromosomal stability of rDNA in Drosophila. First, mei- 41 inhibits rDNA magnification. However, mei- 9, another recombination and repair defective mutation has no similar effect. This indicates that magnification requires some, but not all, of the gene products necessary for meiotic exchange. Second, under magnifying conditions, mei- 41 induces interchanges between the X rDNA and either arm of the Ybb- <b>chromosome.</b> These <b>interchanges</b> occur at high frequency and are independent of rDNA orientation. Third, in mei- 41 bb+/Ybb+ males, bobbed mutants in the X, but not the Y, also arise at high frequency. Evidence suggests that these events involve the rDNA type I insertion. The recombination and repair defective properties of mei- 41 together with our results regarding its unusual and specific effects involving rDNA are explained in a simple model that has general implications for chromosome structure...|$|R

In crosses of Translocation x Translocation, exceptional progeny are recovered nonselectively in which the chromosome sequence has apparently reverted to Normal. Genetic, cytological, and molecular evidence indicates that reversion is the result of meiotic crossing over between homologous displaced rDNA repeats. Marker linkages are wild type in these exceptional progeny. They differ from wild type, however, in retaining an interstitial block of rRNA genes which can be demonstrated cytologically by the presence of a second, small interstitial nucleolus and genetically by linkage of an rDNA restriction site polymorphism to the mating-type locus in linkage group I. The interstitial rDNA is more highly methylated than the terminal rDNA. The mechanism by which methylation enzymes distinguish between interstitial rDNA and terminal rDNA is unknown.

40|$|The {{study of}} natural {{variation}} is a principle component of biology. One process that affects levels of natural variation is meiotic recombination—the {{process by which}} homologous <b>chromosomes</b> break and <b>interchange</b> genetic information with one another during the formation of gametes. Surprisingly, this factor that shapes levels of natural variation across the genome itself presents {{with a great deal}} of variation. That variation manifests itself at many levels: within genomes, between individual organisms, across populations, and among species. The factors and mechanisms responsible for the non-random patterning of recombination events across the genome remain particularly elusive in most cases. Herein, I utilize a combination of bioinformatic and molecular genetic approaches to better explain recombination patterning. I explore several factors that are now known to contribute to the distribution of recombination events across genomes. In particular, I demonstrate that transcriptional activity during meiosis is associated with, and partially predictive of crossing over events in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, I present a model which is capable of accounting for approximately 40 % of the variation in crossover rates in Drosophila based on the localization of several previously identified DNA motifs. Lastly, I present preliminary data describing how recombination patterns are altered under naturally stressful conditions, a key insight that is necessary for uniting our findings at one level of variation with the many others. These findings support a multifactorial model for crossover distribution that includes both genetic and epigenetic factors and will further progress the field in developing a comprehensive understanding of recombination localization...|$|R
