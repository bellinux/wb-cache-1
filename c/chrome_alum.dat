30|$|The {{usage of}} the {{synthetic}} dyes in textile dyeing industries is increasing due to cheaper and wider ranges of brighter shades in comparison to natural dyes. Coloured products have gained lot of importance in present day societies. Textile dyes are considered as the most polluting industrial process. Increase in the demand of the dyed textile products with proportional increase in its manufacturing by utilizing synthetic dyes {{has contributed to the}} severe pollution of water, soil and as a whole to our environment (Dos et al. 2007). The effluent containing heavy load of harmful chemicals of the textile industries {{is one of the major}} polluters of our environment (Gyanendra et al. 2015) Excessive use of the synthetic dyes in textiles has led serious health hazards and disturbances in eco-balance of nature. Estimated consumption of the textiles globally is around 30 million tonnes for which the expected increase is at the rate of about 3  % per annum (Rajendran and Thamarai 2014). About 700, 000 tonnes of different dyes are required for the colouration of such a bulk quantity of the textiles (Rungruangkitkrai and Mongkholrattanasit 2012). The global production of the synthetic dyes is over 7 [*]×[*] 105 annually (Ogugbue and Sawidis 2011). The adverse of the synthetic dyes can be prevented by utilizing eco-friendly dyes and methods (Wanyama et al. 2014). Natural dyes exhibit long endurance, beauty and charm and can be of varied sources like mineral, insect animal and plant of which roots, flowers, barks, leaves, fruits and stems can be used. The international rising demand of the natural dyes is about 10, 000 tonnes which is mere 1  % of the world synthetic dye consumption (Sachan and Kapoor 2007). It is of relevance to optimize the colouring process with the objective of reducing the environmental impact of the textile dye industry. The associated toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergic reactions of the synthetic dyes has raised an interest in the revival of the natural dyes which are clinically safer, disease free, non-polluting and biodegradable (Kulkari et al. 2011; Aminoddin 2010, 2010). Non-substantivity of the natural fibre towards natural dye requires a mordant which are usually derived from metallic salts like <b>alum,</b> <b>chrome,</b> copper sulphate, stannous chloride and ferrous sulphate which does not make the process of the dyeing fully eco-friendly (Lodrick et al. 2015). The increased awareness on hazardous, toxic and allergic reactions associated with synthetic dyes has raised a growing demand for the natural dyes and dyed products (Singh and Srivastava 2015). The rising demand of the dyed products and consciousness about the human health and pollution has marked a need for the revival and {{usage of the}} natural dyes and dyed products all over the world. Kashmir valley abounds a rich and varied biodiversity of plants which needs to get explored and utilized commercially as a varied sources of the dyes and mordants. India is one of the 17 megadiverse countries having a rich biodiversity and wide range of natural products (Singh and Srivastava 2015). A sustainable linkage must be developed between cultivation, collection and use of the natural dye sources in our country which has a rich biodiversity and plenty of raw materials (Kumaresan et al. 2011). Kashmir valley enriches with natural dye sources, which has to be explored. The dyeing potential of the similar species using different mordant is only reported by Geelani et al. (2015 a, b). The work was conducted to explore the dyeing potential of Quercus robur, Salix alba and Populus deltoides for their usage in textile industries in order to reduce the pollution of the synthetic dyes. The aim of the work was to extract the natural sources of the textile dyes and mordants by adopting eco-friendly practices. The specific objectives were to compare the efficiency of the dye with the suitable mordant on the fabrics in producing different shades and hues, analysing the colour values and assessment of the colour fastness properties of the dyed fabrics.|$|R

Sections are then floated onto the prepared slides and inicubated at 37 TC overnight. The adhesive is clear, does not affect immunoperoxidase reactions, and is suf-ficiently insoluble in xylene for the sections to be brought to water and finally counterstained in the usual way. The non-wettable surface of the Cow Gum smear is an advantage in that it limits spreading of the reagents by increasing the angle of contact so that smaller volumes may be used and the risk of the section drying out is reduced...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical studies {{indicate}} that a substantial decrease in mitochondrial ribonucleic acid (RNA) of rat liver cells occurs following parenteral administration of large doses of cortisone acetate (1). Reports have appeared indicating that carcinogens can also affect mitochondrial RNA content {{as well as their}} number (2, 3), while virus invasion of a cell alters mitochondrial morphology (4). Mitochondria appear to be the locus of action of both the Krebs tricarboxylic acid enzyme system and the cytochrome system.

40|$|Basophilic and eosinophilic tissue {{components}} {{are difficult to}} demonstrate by stains commonly used in light microscopy after osmium tetroxide fixation. Baker (2) states that "if only chromatin were left in a state in which it could be differentially stained without difficulty, this fixative would be universally recognized as superior to all others" for light microscopy. The difficulty encountered in staining tissues fixed in osmium tetroxide for light microscopic study limits the direct comparison by light and electron microscopy of the same tissue. In the past several years, the various methods which have been applied to sections of osmiumfixed tissue include the following: routine hematoxylin and eosin (6), Feulgen reaction (8), gallocyanin <b>chrome</b> <b>alum</b> (12, 16), thionine (17), ammoniacal silver (6), Verhoeff's elastica stain (6), aldehyde fuchsin for pancreatic islets (7), the Hale colloidal iron stain (12); and methylene blue {{has been used as}} a stain for epoxy resin-embedded tissue (l 5).

40|$|In rodents, chronic estrogenization {{has been}} shown to induce {{degeneration}} of dendrites and myelin figures in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus adjacent to peroxidase-positive astrocyte processes. Because in this brain region estradiol is metabolized to 2 -hydroxyestradiol (catecholestrogen), we hypothesized that the latter may be oxidized by the astrocytic peroxidase activity to cytotoxic ortho-semiquinones as occurs in peripheral tissues. Cysteamine induces nonenzymatic peroxidase activity in cultured astroglia identical to that observed in viva. Using electron spin resonance, we demonstrate robust peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 2 -hydroxyestradiol and dopamine by cysteaminepretreated astrocyte cultures relative to untreated controls.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the view of Muller that the demand {{for the creation of}} a space in the cranium results in the necrosis of the infundibulum, the samples of brain tissues of 12 patients with intracranial tumor were stained by the <b>chrome</b> <b>alum</b> hematoxylin phloxine (CH-P) method. It was revealed that (1) there were disturbances of the neurosecretory system, and that (2) the corpora amylacea were positive for CH, having a high incidence of appearance. Further investigation was carried out on these two points, and the following observations were made : 1. There was an abnormally high degree of accumulation of the neurosecretory substance in the neurosecretory pathway which subsequently underwent expansion and disintegration. The neurosecretory cells, especially the nerve cells of the nucl. supraopticus, which control these nerve fibers, showed the evidence of degeneration. The degeneration consisted principally of tigrolysis. Red pyknosis had no relation to this degenerative process, nor was there any clinical symptom imputable to this process. This led to an assumption that the neurosecretory function would be compensated for to a considerable extent. 2.
