40|$|Agricultural {{machinery}} is {{an important}} source of emission of air pollutant in rural locations. Emissions of a specific tractor engine mainly depend on engine speed. Various driving methods and use of implements with different work capacities can affect the engine load. This study deals with the effects of <b>types</b> of <b>tractors</b> and operation conditions on engine emission. In this study two <b>types</b> of agricultural <b>tractors</b> (MF 285 and U 650) and some tillage implements such as centrifugal type spreader, boom type sprayer and rotary tiller were employed. Some of the exhausted gases from both tractors in each condition were measured such as, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) and nitrogen oxide (NO). Engine oil temperature was measured at every step for both <b>types</b> of <b>tractors.</b> Difference between steady-state condition and operation conditions was evaluated. The results showed all exhaust gases that measured and engine oil temperature at every operation conditions are higher than steady-state condition. A general conclusion of the work was that, using various implements and employing different <b>types</b> of <b>tractors</b> effect on engine emissions. The results of variance analysis showed all exhausted gases had a significant relationship with types of implements used at 1 %. Also, all exhausted gases except CO had a significant relationship with <b>types</b> of <b>tractors.</b> A further conclusion was that NO emission increased as engine oil temperature increased. The final conclusion was about the difference between MF 285 and U 650; using U 650 at operation conditions is better than MF 285 in terms of pollution...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity of}} the primary sequences of 16 S rRNA genes among Neisseria meningitidis strains (Men) and evaluated the use of this approach as a molecular subtyping tool. We aligned and compared a 1, 417 -bp fragment of the 16 S rRNA gene from 264 Men strains of serogroups A, B, C, and Y (MenA, MenB, MenC, and MenY, respectively) isolated throughout the world over a 30 -year period. Thirty-one positions of difference were found among 49 16 S types: differences between types ranged from 1 to 14 positions (0. 07 to 0. 95 %). 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> and serogroups were highly associated; only 3 out 49 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> were shared by two or more serogroups. We have identified 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> that are exclusively associated with strains of certain hypervirulent clones: 16 <b>S</b> <b>type</b> 5 with MenA subgroup III, 16 <b>S</b> <b>type</b> 4 with the MenB electrophoretic type 5 (ET- 5) complex, and 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> 12 and 13 with MenC of the ET- 37 complex. For MenC strains, 16 S sequencing provided the highest sensitivity and specificity and the best overall association with the outbreak-related versus sporadic isolates when compared with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and multilocus sequence typing. We demonstrated for the first time an unexpected diversity among 16 S rRNA genes of Men strains, identified 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> associated with well-defined hypervirulent clones, and showed the potential of this approach to rapidly identify virulent strains associated with outbreaks and/or an increased incidence of sporadic disease...|$|R

As far as I have experimented, the felling and the bucking operations by this row thinning method, there seems practically no improvement in its working efficiency, so I introduced two machines expecting to keep natural state of thinning and to promote the working efficiency.
