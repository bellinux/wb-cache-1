5|$|The Young <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> (Jonge Centrumdemocraten), {{became the}} youth {{organization}} of the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats,</b> having originally been founded as the youth wing of the Centre Party in the early 1980s. It was later succeeded by the CD Youth (CD-Jongeren), which was based almost exclusively in the Haarlem area. The <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> did not attract many youngsters, nor did it establish a particularly active youth organization. Most of the far-right youth tended to join CP'86.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} years, the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions. The first {{occurred when the}} <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem. A group of anti-fascist activists believed that the two parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1986 election, the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{worked on}} {{improving}} both its image and its grassroots support. The strategy paid off with Janmaat winning {{a seat in}} the House of Representatives in the 1989 general election. By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.|$|E
50|$|Brisbin {{was born}} in 1837 at Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, a son of Margaret and Ezra Brisbin. He studied at the Boalsburg Academy, and upon graduating Brisbin began teaching. He later {{purchased}} and edited the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrat</b> newspaper in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and also studied law and was later admitted to the bar of Pennsylvania. Brisbin was prominently known as an anti-slavery orator.|$|R

50|$|Bigler {{was born}} in early 1805 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania to parents of German ancestry. Beginning work in the {{printing}} trade at an early age, Bigler, {{as well as his}} younger brother, William, never received a formal education, yet Bigler took it upon himself to educate his younger brother. In 1831, both brothers moved to Bellefonte in Centre County to buy the local Andrew Jackson-affiliated <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrat</b> newspaper, where older John assumed editorial duties. Bigler worked as editor until 1835, when he sold the publication to study law.|$|R
5|$|In the 1995 provincial elections, in {{the face}} of {{competition}} from four new ethnocentric competitors, none of which won a seat, the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> did not increase its three-seat presence in the provincial parliament. In the 1998 local elections the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> lost all but one of its seats, having contested the election in just around half of the municipalities it contested in 1994. In the 1998 general election two months later, the party lost all its seats in Parliament. This was {{as a result of the}} Centre Democrats's failure to benefit from increased attention on immigration issues, its years of internal infighting, and new legislation directed mainly against the far-right, which had raised the number of signatures per district required in order to contest elections.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 2002, only a {{few months}} before Janmaat died, the party was {{formally}} dissolved. As a result, it did not participate in the 2002 general election, where the recently emerged Pim Fortuyn List attracted votes based on an appeal {{similar to that of the}} <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} scientific bureau, {{or think}} tank, of the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> was the Stichting Wetenschappelijke Onderbouwing Centrumdemocratische Ideologie (Foundation for the Scientific Elaboration of the Centre Democratic Ideology, SWOCI). In 1992 its name {{was changed to}} the Thomas Hobbes Stichting (Thomas Hobbes Foundation), after Janmaat's favorite political philosopher.|$|E

5000|$|Gillon {{defended the}} use of torture {{as a means of}} [...] "self-defense against terrorism." [...] He told Danish media that Israel might have to re-introduce [...] "moderate {{physical}} pressure" [...] when interrogating suspected Palestinian terrorists. [...] "We banned this form of interrogation in Israel in 1999 because of the peace process. Unfortunately, it looks like we may have to start using it again," [...] Gillon said. One member of parliament, <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrat</b> leader Peter Duetoft, called opposition to Gillon's appointment [...] "hypocritical" [...] because Yasser Arafat, [...] "the biggest terrorist", had recently visited Denmark without there having been similar objections.|$|R
5|$|Over {{time the}} <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{published}} {{a variety of}} party papers of varying quality. The Centrumtaal and the Middenkoers were the original newspapers first published in 1986. Although the former was intended for general party news, and the latter aimed at a more intellectual readership, they did not differ much in content. By 19871988, Centrumtaal {{was more or less}} succeeded by CD-info, and Middenkoers by CD-actueel. CD-actueel was distributed for the last time in 1993, with CD-info succeeded by the CD-Nieuwsbrief in 1997, although in later years it had been published less and less frequently.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> did {{not gain}} enough votes for {{parliamentary}} {{representation in the}} 1986 general election, but Janmaat won back his seat after the following election in 1989. In 1994 he was joined by two additional representatives won by the party. The CD was subject to a cordon sanitaire by the other parties in Parliament, although some parties rather sought to confront it following its 1994 success. The CD failed to win any seats in the 1998 election, and it fell into disarray until it was finally dissolved in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good {{contacts with}} nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The Vlaams Blok did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations {{particularly with the}} French National Front, {{as well as the}} German People's Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Centre</b> of Social <b>Democrats</b> (<b>Centre</b> des d√©mocrates sociaux, CDS; also {{translated}} as Democratic and Social Centre) was a Christian-democratic and centrist political party in France. It existed from 1976 to 1995 and was based {{directly and indirectly}} on {{the tradition of the}} Popular Republican Movement (MRP). The CDS was one of the co-founding parties of the European People's Party, and later merged into the Democratic Force.|$|R

50|$|In May 1976, CDP {{merged with}} the CD to form the <b>Centre</b> of Social <b>Democrats</b> (CDS), which in 1978 joined the Union for French Democracy (UDF).|$|R
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
25|$|Centrist parties {{such as the}} Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{immediately}} conceded The Union's victory, {{while other}} parties, like Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 {{regional}} elections (3 April/4 April 2005), centre-left candidates the {{for regional}} presidencies won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of {{local governments and}} presidencies were at stake. Berlusconi's coalition held {{only two of the}} regions (Lombardy and Veneto) up for re-election. Three parties, Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats,</b> National Alliance and New Italian Socialist Party, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. Berlusconi after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April, he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point demanded by the Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> (and to a lesser extent by National Alliance) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction be reduced.|$|E

25|$|The centre-left {{majority}} coalition, on 7 May 2006, officially endorsed Napolitano as its {{candidate in}} the presidential election that began on 8 May. The Vatican endorsed him as President through its official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, just after The Union named him as its candidate, as did Marco Follini, former secretary of the Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats,</b> a member party of the House of Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> lacked about 2,000 - 3,000 of the {{required}} 20,000 signatures in order {{to run in the}} 2007 election when Anders Fogh Rasmussen called it on 24 October, meaning that they won't be able to run. The Liberalists had reached 5,000 signatures. The Danish Ministry of Welfare has registered more than 70 parties that had not handed in {{the required}} number of signatures.|$|E
25|$|After Marini {{was given}} the mandate, two {{politicians}} (Bruno Tabacci and Mario Baccini) splintered from the Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> (UDC) to form the White Rose, while two leading members of the Forza Italia faction Liberal Popular Union (Ferdinando Adornato and Angelo Sanza) switched allegiance to the UDC. On 4 February, the Liberal Populars (an UDC faction which favours merging with Forza Italia) seceded from UDC to join Berlusconi's People of Freedom later this year.|$|E

25|$|Salvatore Cuffaro, 48, {{was first}} elected at the Sicilian Presidency in the July 2001 with 59.1% of {{regional}} votes; that election was held immediately after the national election which saw the centre-right win all the 61 Sicilian ridings. Cuffaro is a prominent member of Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats,</b> a Christian democratic party. Often associated to the mafia by his critics because of an open investigation by the magistrature of Palermo which brought to a trial commitment, Cuffaro will nevertheless head the regional UDC list of candidates for the April general election.|$|E
25|$|A {{white paper}} for a proportional-only electoral system was {{presented}} to the Chamber of Deputies on 13 September 2005, only seven months before the 2006 general election. This reform, strongly backed by the centrist Union of Christian and <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> (UDC), proposed a 4% threshold before a party gained any seats, and a majority bonus of (at least) 340 seats for the winning coalition, the total votes for each coalition being the sum of the votes of those coalition parties which had won at least 4% of the national votes. The new proposal was approved by parliament.|$|E
25|$|To {{comply with}} Danish {{election}} law, {{and to be}} able to stand for elections the Liberal Alliance had to gather 19,185 signatures of supporters on special forms, the number being equivalent to one parliamentary seat in the Folketing. Each completed form had to be certified with the civil registry offices of municipalities before being collectively handed in to the Ministry of the Interior. In the event of an election being called before the Liberal Alliance had finished its nomination process, the minor party <b>Centre</b> <b>Democrats</b> offered to let the Liberal Alliance put forward candidates on their lists. The Liberal Alliance did not take any stand on this offer, however.|$|E
50|$|On 23 May 1976, the Democratic Centre rejoined {{with the}} CDP {{to form the}} <b>Centre</b> of Social <b>Democrats</b> (CDS). The CDS joined on 1 February 1978 the newly founded Union for French Democracy (UDF) of Giscard d'Estaing.|$|R
