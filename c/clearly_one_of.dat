He showed considerable promise {{in his first season}} with the first team in 1930, with 59 wickets for 23 each, with 7 for 20 against Leicestershire on a rain-affected wicket his outstanding performance. It was several years before he improved upon this, but by 1935 he was <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the hardest-working of several emerging pace bowlers with 119 wickets for less than 22 each and an annual output of around a thousand overs per season. The following three years saw Perks maintain his form. he took fifteen for 106 against Essex at Worcester in 1937, the best match figures of his career.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "Northern Isles" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos. Stroma, which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney, is part of Caithness, and so falls under Highland council area for local government purposes, not Orkney. It is, however, <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "northern isles" [...] of Scotland. Fair Isle and Foula are outliers of Shetland, but would normally be considered as part of Shetland and thus the Northern Isles. Similarly, Sule Skerry and Sule Stack, although distant from the main group, are part of Orkney and technically amongst the Northern Isles. However, the other small islands that lie off the north coast of Scotland are in Highland and thus not usually considered {{to be part of}} the Northern Isles.|$|E

Vaizey put Neill's Summerhill in a disappearing lineage of post-World War I experimental schools that focused on freedom from directed games, classics curriculum, and prudery. He wrote in 1962 that [...] "Summerhill is <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> England's greatest schools" [...] and that the decline of this experimental school tradition was a tragedy. Still, Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) wrote that Summerhill had not been [...] "duplicated" [...] in the four decades since its creation. The Booklist noted Neill's [...] "scant credit" [...] awarded to prior progressive and experimental schools, and added that {{the addition of a}} British inspection report added objective credibility to the book. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) described Neill's style as [...] "bewitchingly direct, even epigrammatic" [...] though also [...] "patchy", leaving many discussions incomplete.|$|E

500|$|Although Exton was [...] "clearly a {{partisan}} figure" [...] {{in the politics}} of London, his most recent biographer has noted that he [...] "nevertheless belonged to a ruling oligarchy whose shared interests often made it a force for stability" [...] in those politics. In any case, he managed to negotiate a difficult political period with little harm coming to him or the city under his mayorality, even though this involved allying with both the crown and its opponents against the other on varying occasions. Paul Strohm has suggested that, although Exton is often viewed as being politically sympathetic towards Brembre's views, Strohm says the difference between them is that Exton was [...] "an honest and aboveboard player who did not scruple to expose his predecessor's hyperpartisan chicanery" [...] whose policies were much the same but lacking the [...] "criminal excesses" [...] of Brembre. Sumption, meanwhile, has summed up the Mayor as an [...] "astute trimmer whose main objective was to stay out of trouble," [...] whereas an earlier biographer believed that Exton remained loyal to the King, but was unable to go against the general feeling of his compatriots. Either way, Exton's policy was <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> non-alignment.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best shows on television right now. I just think {{they may want to}} lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to Britain {{to receive}} his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O'Leary {{was given a}} grand {{reception}} attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also {{the subject of much}} patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that [...] "No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them." [...] and Thomas Scanlan who said: [...] "I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him." [...] His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: [...] "I am surprised he didn't do more. I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet." ...|$|E

[...] The two poems offer two extreme views of facing death, each one which balances the other when they are read together− <b>clearly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Tennyson's original intentions when he first drafted them in 1833.

Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop Billboard Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. Heart in Motion is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA. Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, Home For Christmas in 1992, which included the song [...] "Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)", written by Chris Eaton and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including Donna Summer, Jessica Simpson (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), Vince Gill, Sara Groves, Point of Grace, Gladys Knight, and Broadway star Barbara Cook.|$|E
