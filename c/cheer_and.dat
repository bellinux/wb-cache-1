5|$|Heavy metal {{is a form}} {{of music}} {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development of blues, blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins lie in the British hard rock bands who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound. Most of the pioneers in the field, like Black Sabbath, were English, though many were inspired by American performers like Blue <b>Cheer</b> <b>and</b> Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
25|$|The Battalion's {{arrival in}} Bakloh in 1963 was big, much awaited event, {{to which the}} town had long been looking forward to.

25|$|A Purim spiel was {{historically}} a comic dramatization that {{attempted to}} convey the saga of the Purim story. By the 18th century, {{in some parts of}} Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther {{was little more than a}} pretext. Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories. Today, Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews and Judaism that will bring <b>cheer</b> <b>and</b> comic relief to an audience celebrating the day.|$|E

25|$|Every December 31, {{a special}} New Year's Eve {{countdown}} show occurs normally beginning at 9:30 PM. The show {{begins with the}} original show production and is then immediately followed by a special countdown show. Highlights of New Years celebrated in individual countries begins the show; the Asian pavilions (Japan and China) go first, followed by those in Europe (Italy, Norway, France, Germany), after that, the countries {{of those in the}} GMT time zone (Morocco and the United Kingdom). During the presentation, fireworks shoot from the back of each pavilion accompanied with custom celebration music from each country. The countdown begins at 10 seconds prior to midnight with the North American nations: United States, Canada, Mexico. The count down starts with a dong (which originates from the American pavilion) and leads to the massive celebratory firework display at 12:00 midnight including a 360 degree launch of fireworks around the World Showcase lagoon. The song Auld Lang Syne plays as spectators <b>cheer</b> <b>and</b> watch the massive firework display. This tag uses double the amount of fireworks that are launched in IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. A male announcer concludes the show wishing guests a happy New Year and reminds guests of extended park hours for the New Year's Eve celebration.|$|E
25|$|The most {{successful}} adaptation was David Garrick's Catharine and Petruchio, which was first performed at Drury Lane in March 1754, starring Hannah Pritchard and Henry Woodward, although Pritchard {{was replaced by}} Kitty Clive in 1756. This adaptation dominated the stage for almost a century, with Shakespeare's play not returning to the English stage until 1844, although Garrick's version was still being performed as late as 1879, when Herbert Beerbohm Tree staged it. In Catharine and Petruchio, the subplot is entirely omitted; Bianca is married to Hortensio when the play opens. Consequently, {{it is not a}} full-length play, and was often performed with Garrick's shorter version of The Winter's Tale or as an afterpiece. Indeed, the play only began to dwindle in popularity when afterpieces became less fashionable in the mid-eighteenth century. Prior to that, however, it was a huge success {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic; it was first staged in North America in 1768 at the John Street Theatre, starring Margaret <b>Cheer</b> <b>and</b> Lewis Hallam. It was performed at John Philip Kemble's benefit in 1788, with a text he had prepared himself, which deviated slightly from Garrick's, starring Sarah Siddons and Kemble himself. Kemble continued to play the role for many years, including a run opposite his wife, Priscilla Kemble, in 1810. Previously, Kemble's brother, Charles Kemble had also staged the play, acting alongside his own wife, Marie Thérèse Kemble, in 1802.|$|E

500|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the phrase}} to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: [...] "Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in {{the last few years}} could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock." [...] In January 1970 Lucian K.

San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran's classic [...] "Summertime Blues", from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including [...] "Born to Be Wild", which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider (1969). Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Annie Barrett {{opined that}} Stritch and Alda [...] "really made this episode great." [...] Meredith Blake, a {{contributor}} for the Los Angeles Times, opined that television Christmas episodes [...] "are a sitcom staple, but... they're also a risky proposition {{for a show}} like 30 Rock. Just how do you maintain the right balance between holiday <b>cheer</b> <b>and</b> year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got it just right. That is, they leaned toward the former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism – but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness." [...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart". Sassone noted that the problem with [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was Tracy's subplot [...] "as it wasn't very funny" [...] {{and the one that}} dragged the episode down.|$|E

But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns {{to be a little}} less the man he was." [...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false <b>cheer</b> <b>and</b> false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E
