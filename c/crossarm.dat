25|$|Kendall's first design, {{submitted}} to the United States Commission of Fine Arts in May 1923, {{formed the basis for}} planning the Virginia approaches. Preliminary designs for the bridge showed it terminating on Columbia Island. For the center of Columbia Island, Kendall envisioned a gigantic roadway <b>crossarm</b> circumscribed by a grassy ellipse. The roads north and south from this <b>crossarm</b> would terminate in traffic circles at the northern and southern tips of the island. The traffic circles would accommodate connections to Lee Highway and the proposed Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway.|$|E

25|$|Because Los Angeles {{is older}} than most other cities in California, the LADWP is {{currently}} faced with several unique issues. Most of the power lines in Los Angeles were built above-ground before it became customary to run power lines below-ground; as a result, the horizon line of the typical Los Angeles boulevard looks much more cluttered than boulevards in most Southern California cities. Starting in 2007, LADWP has a long-term project to upgrade the overhead power lines and convert them to underground. This difficult conversion has been slowed by budget constraints, the impact on traffic, the pursuit of other modernization projects, and the lingering effects of a workforce reduction over the last decade. Budget issues are particularly acute in the department's transmission system, where underground transmission costs about 10 to 14 times the cost of overhead transmission, per unit length, and the technical and environmental challenges which confront such installations. Additionally, undergrounding of the three 500 kV transmission lines (five lines, if the Pacific AC Intertie's two 500 kV lines terminating in Los Angeles are included) is presently technically infeasible. Upgrading the overhead lines {{is expected to take}} 10 to 15 years. The upgrading of LADWP's overhead power lines consists of eliminating the V-shape brackets on the power poles that are holding up the <b>crossarm</b> and replacing them with cross-brackets that are put on the <b>crossarm.</b> Some of the wooden power poles are being replaced with metal poles.|$|E
2500|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{carved from}} white stone. This is usually Portland stone, {{but it is}} {{sometimes}} granite or any type of white limestone commonly found in France or Belgium.

40|$|The {{effect of}} metal end plates on {{reducing}} checking of pentachlorophenol-treated Douglas-fir <b>crossarms</b> was evaluated over 13 wetâ€“dry cycles. Check development was variable {{over the first}} three to four cycles, and then steadily increased for both plated and nonplated ends of arms; however, both the number of checks and the maximum width of the checks were significantly lower on plated ends. The results suggest that end plating reduces the potential for deep check development in <b>crossarms</b> {{that could lead to}} early failure...|$|R
40|$|Prestressed stayed columns have an {{enhanced}} resistance to buckling through the {{effective use of}} <b>crossarms</b> and pretensioned stays when compared to conventional columns. An analytical derivation of the minimum, linear optimum and maximum initial pretension forces for configurations of prestressed stayed columns with multiple <b>crossarms</b> and additional stays is presented for the first time. The findings are validated through comparisons with finite element models developed in the commercial package ABAQUS. The influence of the initial pretension on the load-carrying capacity of the configurations considered is also analysed, providing insight into the actual optimum initial pretension force for the configurations accounting for the significance of geometric nonlinearities...|$|R
2500|$|The {{presence}} of railroad tracks also caused design problems. The tracks of the Rosslyn Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad ran somewhat inland along the Virginia shoreline of the Potomac River. In June 1927, the CFA proposed lowering these tracks by [...] {{to avoid an}} at-grade crossing with the proposed Memorial Drive. Since this trench also affected the Virginia road connections to the bridge, studies {{as to how to}} best design the approaches were ordered in spring 1927. Deciding which roads to extend through the area and where to build them proved increasingly vexatious. In July 1927, the NCPC said it would study the entire area between Arlington Memorial Bridge and Francis Scott Key Bridge to determine how best to coordinate the Virginia approaches with existing roadways. The NCPC said, however, that it expected Columbia Island's north <b>crossarm</b> to connect with Lee Highway. Lee Highway (not to be confused with Lee Boulevard.) was then under construction in a west-northwesterly direction from Falls Church, Virginia. At the time, its exact western terminus had not yet been decided, although many expected it to link with Francis Scott Key Bridge. The Virginia State Highway Commission, which was providing some of the money for Lee Highway, agreed with the NCPC. But Arlington County, which was building the highway, remained silent on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Kendall's first design, {{submitted}} to the CFA in May 1923, was generally well received. His plan envisioned a low, Neoclassical arch bridge. Two statues stood atop each pier {{on both sides of}} the bridge. The D.C. approaches consisted of a traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial linked to the Potomac River by a plaza and monumental steps (the [...] "watergate"). Two memorial columns were placed in this plaza. On the Columbia Island landing, Kendall envisioned a gigantic <b>crossarm</b> circumscribed by a grassy ellipse, with traffic circles at the terminus of the north and south arms. The traffic circles would accommodate Lee Highway and the Mt. Vernon Memorial Parkway. Within the ellipse were placed two [...] tall memorial columns. Two circular Greek Revival temples were planned for the western shoreline. The commission was especially pleased that Kendall had the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway linked to the traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial rather than passing beneath the bridge via an arch. (Kendall had, in fact, intended to pass it through one of the bridge's arches but forgot to make the change.) However, CFA members asked that he consider widening the bridge to [...] from the proposed [...] The CFA also discussed at length its long-standing proposal for a major traffic circle on Columbia Island, within which would be placed a memorial to Robert E. Lee. There was also concern whether enough space had been allotted to permit the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway, Lee Highway, and Memorial Drive (which was planned to cross the Boundary Channel via the Boundary Channel Bridge into Virginia and link with the main gate to Arlington National Cemetery). When the CFA gave its preliminary approval to the bridge design (but withheld a resolution on the approaches), models of the bridge went on public display in February 1924.|$|E

Natural contraction and expansion of the wires tied to these [...] "threadless insulators" [...] resulted in insulators unseating from their pins, requiring manual reseating.|$|E
5000|$|Traffic signal {{preemption}} systems {{integrated with}} train transportation networks typically extend their control of traffic from the typical <b>crossarms</b> and warning lights {{to one or}} more nearby traffic intersections, to prevent excessive road traffic from approaching the crossing, while also obtaining the right-of-way for road traffic that may be in the way to quickly clear the crossing. This also allows buses and hazmat vehicles in the USA to proceed through the intersection without stopping at the railroad tracks.|$|R
50|$|Pole-mounted {{transformers}} {{often include}} accessories such as surge arresters or protective fuse links.

The power line section running over the river has a span width of 2303 m. It is carried by two 346.5 m tall suspension towers, each weighing 4,192 tonnes, and both are among the tallest electricity pylons in the world (for comparison, the towers even surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower, which is 324 m, including antenna). They are identical lattice towers of square cross section with an area of 68 m Ã— 68 m at the base and 8 m Ã— 8 m at the top. The pylons carry four conductors on the lower <b>crossarm,</b> 312 m above ground, with a length of 77 m and two conductors on the upper <b>crossarm.</b> The insulator strings are 10 m long. These pylons are both equipped with an elevator which runs in a cylindrical tube in its center. A spiral staircase circles the elevator shaft outside.|$|E
50|$|The poles {{at the end}} of a {{straight}} section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called dead-end poles in the United States. Elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles. These must carry the lateral tension of the long straight sections of wire. They are usually made with heavier construction. The power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal strain insulators, either placed on crossarms (which are either doubled, tripled, or replaced with a steel <b>crossarm,</b> to provide more resistance to the tension forces) or attached directly to the pole itself.|$|E
