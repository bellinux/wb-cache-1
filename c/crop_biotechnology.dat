40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the framing of debates on <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology</b> {{in terms of}} 'impact assessment' or 'success or failure'. To evaluate the social desirability of technological choice, the paper socio-anthropologically examines the cultural, productive, environmental, and cognitive contexts within which the cotton-growing farmers in Gujarat adopt, develop and diffuse genetically engineered <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology.</b> The paper shows that <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology</b> represents a technological culture with a specific value framework which is endorsed commonly by both multinational companies and certain cotton-growing farmers in Gujarat. The cultivation and multiplication of Bt seeds owe their popularity {{to the fact that}} genetically modified seed technology did not make any paradigmatic change in the agricultural practices and agrarian relations shaped by the Green Revolution, which has privileged and consolidated the social power of resource-rich farmers.

We find that US cotton producers tend to choose bundles of conventional technologies, agrobiotechnologies and relevant agronomic practices out of many possible ones. Hence, their behavior is characterized by multiple simultaneous and interdependent adoption decisions. Furthermore, US cotton producers partially adopt one or more of the biotechnologies, probably, as a way of optimizing their use through “learning by doing ” thereby incorporating complex dynamic considerations in their decision proc-ess...|$|R

The hypothesis was formulated that a genetically modified food is a solution of current food crisis. The hypothesis was confirmed, but with serious reservations. Results showed that GMO are perceived rather negatively and sceptically despite its indisputable advantages and a potential perceived in the Czech Republic and EU.

40|$|Cotton is {{the largest}} source of export {{receipts}} in several West African nations where yields are declining and pesticide use is rising. Although there may be payoffs to introducing genetically modified Bt (Bacillus thurigiensis) cotton, limited information is available to predict its potential economic impact and there is uncertainty about its performance. Recognizing these constraints, we use an economic surplus model augmented with stochastic simulation to estimate ex ante the impact and distribution of benefits from Bt cotton. We consider the effects of adoption on both yields and abating crop damage, and offer scenarios depicting the policy options faced by West African stakeholders. The findings indicate that although the total net benefits of adopting Bt cotton may be relatively small for the countries studied, these countries would be worse off without the technology. Our approach, which incorporates variability and uncertainty, {{may be useful in}} decisions about investments in <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology.</b> <b>Crop</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> Bt cotton, Economic surplus model, West Africa, Agricultural development, Risk, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|We {{predict the}} {{potential}} demand of smallholder farmers for genetically transformed varieties {{of a food}} crop, the cooking banana of the East African highlands. Farmer demand for planting material is derived in an agricultural household model that accounts for variety traits and missing markets. The demand for candidate host varieties is predicted using a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression system. The fitted model is used to illustrate the sensitivity of farmer demand for improved planting material to ("a") investments in research and development, represented by the effectiveness of gene insertion and expression, and ("b") other public investments in education, extension, and market infrastructure that support diffusion. By comparing the characteristics of agricultural households we demonstrate that the choice of host variety can have social consequences, favoring one rural population compared with another. Clients for transgenic banana planting material {{are likely to be}} poorer, subsistence-oriented farmers in areas greatly affected by biotic constraints. A model of this type might be useful in assessing the investments needed to support the systematic dissemination of improved planting material.

40|$|The use of <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology</b> is {{steadily}} increasing in the agrosystems of industrialized countries. Recent advances in genome editing are anticipated to further accentuate this trend. Given {{its potential for}} low input agriculture, {{there is a need}} to bring the benefits of <b>crop</b> <b>biotechnology</b> to developing and emerging countries. The challenge goes beyond the mere generation of transgenic crops because development and deployment of genetically engineered crops require local capacities and support from the authorities. In the recent years, we have used biotechnological approaches to improve cassava, the most important root crop in the tropics. Cassava production and processing suffer from several constraints, including viral diseases, drought and post-harvest deterioration. A better understanding of crop responses to biotic and abiotic stresses combined with genetic engineering approaches can be particularly instrumental to generate plants with improved traits. We have used Omics approaches to characterize cassava response to stresses and to subsequently implement biotechnological approaches for trait improvement. Smallholders and industries in cassava growing regions need traits such as resistance against cassava mosaic and brown streak diseases, prolonged shelf-life, drought tolerance, modified starch and improved nutritional content. Importantly those technologies should be implemented in local germplasm to secure impact for the local value chains.

40|$|APPROXIMATELY EIGHT SPECIES OF SOUTHern African legumes are {{currently}} used as sustainable food <b>crops.</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> {{has the potential}} to improve the productivity of growing these plants by small-scale farmers who cannot afford sufficient phosphate fertilizer to optimize their nitrogen fixation and hence conversion to edible protein. The metabolic adaptations that enable legumes to fix atmospheric nitrogen {{are currently}} being investigated by our group for the purpose of genetic modification to enhance crop yields. Until now, attempts at modifying host plants or symbiotic bacteria have not significantly enhanced N 2 fixation. We propose, instead, to bioengineer the key enzymes that control the mechanisms involved in protein formation. This may lead to enhanced seed protein content, which would be of advantage to poor communities that rely on this source of food. We postulate that misregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) could be exploited by biotechnology to improve N 2 fixation and protein content. We have found that, as distinct from their roots, legume nodules are under permanent phosphate stress, even during optimal phosphate supply to the host plant, implying that the development of phosphate stress may engage different forms of PEPc to ensure continued nodule functioning.
