The nitrifying bacteria are more <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrobacteria are inversely correlated with anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The correlation is quite weak between all the nitrite bacteria {{which indicates that}} the nitrite bacteria have a controlling and regulating function in water quality {{and there is no}} interdependence as each plays a role of its own. The paper also discusses how the superficial soil (pond mud down to 3. 5 cm deep) and different layers of the mud affect the biomass of bacteria. The study shows that the top superficial layer (down to 1. 5 cm deep) is the major area for decomposing and converting organic matter...|$|R

Based on an extensive literature search, which was carried out using the PubMed database and the keywords of osteogenesis, VEGF, endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification, this manuscript reviews the role of VEGF in ossification, with emphasis on its effect in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> processes. VEGF acts as an essential mediator during these processes. It not only functions in bone angiogenesis but also in various aspects of bone development. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Existing research has demonstrated that for a team, OBP is more <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> to runs scored than is AVG, and secondly, for players, OBP is more <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> over time than is AVG. We offer an algebraic explanation for the latter phenomenon. Specifically, we will prove that batting average depends more heavily upon a particularly unpredictable variable, hits per balls in play (HPBP), than does OBP. This result will explain why for both batters and pitchers, on-base percentage is a better indicator of future performance than batting average. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} cardiac output measurements by transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis using a brachial arterial catheter. STUDY DESIGN: Criterion standard study. SETTING: University hospital, single institution. POPULATION: Twenty-three adult patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cardiac output was measured with a thermistor-tipped brachial arterial catheter using pulse contour analysis (COpc) and transpulmonary thermodilution (COba), which serves to calibrate COpc in the system tested. Both methods were compared separately with standard pulmonary artery thermodilution (COpa). COba was <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with COpa (r = 0. 93, p < 0. 001). Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of 0. 91 L/min with limits of agreement of +/- 0. 98 L/min. COpc was also <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> (r = 0. 80, p < 0. 001) with COpa and {{was found to have}} a bias of 1. 08 L/min with limits of agreement of +/- 1. 50 L/min. During the surgical procedure, changes in COpa from baseline were <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with changes in COba (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 01) and COpc (r = 0. 81, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The brachial arterial access allows a reliable assessment of cardiac output by transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} which of two instruments, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS), was more <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> {{with the main}} parameters reflecting activity and severity of psoriatic arthritis. Methods. Both instruments were administered to 72 consecutive patients with psoriatic arthritis. Results. Global HAQ and AIMS scores,were <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with each other (r(s) = 0. 747; P< 0. 00001). AIMS physical function scales namely physical activity, dexterity, social activity and {{activities of daily living}} - were moderately or <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with the main clinical disease activity parameters, most notably morning stiffness of axial joints (r(s) = 0. 271 - 0. 551). Scales measuring psychological status yielded weaker correlations with disease activity parameters (r(s) = 0. 241 - 0. 277) and were also correlated with the visual analog scale score for skin lesion severity. Morning stiffness of peripheral joints was correlated only with two AIMS scales, namely pain (r(s) = 0. 532) and activities of daily living (r(s) = 0. 303). Severity of radiological damage of peripheral and axial joints was most <b>closely</b> <b>correlated</b> with the scales of physical function, most notably physical activity. The global and scale HAQ scores showed moderate to close correlations with the main clinical disease activity parameters, most notably morning stiffness of axial joints. The global HAQ score was also correlated with radiological carpal involvement and with the radiological severity of peripheral joint involvement, whereas only the arising and hygiene scales were (moderately) correlated with the radiological severity of spinal involvement. Conclusion. Although both the HAQ and the AIMS were useful in assessing health status in psoriatic arthritis patients, only the AIMS captured some {{of the effects of the}} skin lesions. Our data also suggest that the AIMS may be more effective than the HAQ for evaluating the effect of radiological lesions produced by psoriatic arthritis...|$|R
