30|$|The Plasma Wave Experiment (PWE) was {{developed}} {{as one of}} the key instruments for this project, in order to observe electric fields, plasma waves, and radio waves in geospace (Kasahara et al. 2016). An electric field provides information about plasma transports and accelerations and {{plays an important role in}} controlling the global dynamics of the inner magnetosphere. Plasma waves provide the characteristics and strength of nonlinear energy and momentum exchanges and enable us to study the processes of high-energy particle accelerations. Plasma waves such as whistler mode chorus, electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave, and magnetosonic wave interact with plasma over a wide energy range and consequently contribute to loss and acceleration processes of high-energy particles in geospace. Radio waves can be used as remote-sensing tools of auroral and magnetospheric activities such as auroral kilometric and <b>continuum</b> <b>radiations.</b> PWE provides electron density information from the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) frequency. Spacecraft potential from PWE also includes information about both electron temperature and density.

40|$|Electromagnetic bound {{states in}} the <b>radiation</b> <b>continuum</b> are studied for {{periodic}} double arrays of subwavelength dielectric cylinders in TM polarization. They are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of Maxwell's equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals, but, {{in contrast to the}} latter, their spectrum lies in the <b>radiation</b> <b>continuum.</b> The phenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the <b>radiation</b> <b>continuum</b> in quantum mechanics, discovered by von Neumann and Wigner. In the formal scattering theory, these states appear as resonances with the vanishing width. For the system studied, the bound states are shown to exist at specific distances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two diffraction channels are open. Analytic solutions are obtained for all bound states (below the <b>radiation</b> <b>continuum</b> and in it) in the limit of thin cylinders (the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength). The existence of bound states is also established in the spectral region where three and more diffraction channels are open, provided the cylinders' dielectric constant and radius are fine-tuned. The near field and scattering resonances of the structure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in the neighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed. In particular, it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes significantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance approaches its critical values. The effect may be used to control optical non-linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical values. Comment: Copyright (2010) American Institute of Physics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a computer program}} for calculating the signal current of a large surface prompt-response self-powered neutron detector (SPND). The program is an improved version of a program developed by Al-Dabagh / 2 /, which was designed for calculating the current only from the emitter of a SPND. In addition to the emitter current the improved program calculates the insulator current and the collector current, and combines these three currents into a current for the complete detector. This detector current accounts for an electric potential inside the insulator and the balancing currents generated hereby. The basic theory and the organisation of theimproved program is described in the paper, with a listing of the source program presented in the appendix. Calculations performed for 80 SPNDs show a significant contribution of the insulator to the detector current. The insulator current may exceed the current from a very thin emitter. This causes a depletion of electrons in the insulator and results in a positive potential. Nevertheless, the emitter thickness proves to be the more important design parameter. The components of the detector current due to. Compton and photoelectric effects as well as discrete and <b>continuum</b> <b>radiations</b> were determined in an investigation.
