500|$|Following the Italian Armistice in September 1943, {{at least}} four of the boats were {{taken over by the}} Kriegsmarine (German Navy). MS 41 was scuttled by its crew on 9 September at Monfalcone. Sources are {{inconsistent}} regarding the boat's ultimate fate; according to Italian sources it was raised and repaired by German forces before being sunk by a mine between Porto Corsini and Porto Garibaldi in October 1944. German sources, on the other hand, claim it was never commissioned by the Kriegsmarine. MS45 was also scuttled by its crew just a few days later, on 18 September at Cattolica. The remaining four boats, MS42–44 and MS46, were commissioned with the Kriegsmarine as S601–604 respectively. They formed part of the 24th S-Boat Flotilla. Soon after their acquisition by the Germans, S601 and S603 were travelling from Piraeus in occupied Greece to the Bay of Kotor when S 603 suffered from a main engine failure. While operating on her cruising engine, she and S601 were attacked by four [...] Supermarine Spitfire fighter-bombers of the Royal Air Force. One of the attackers was shot down by S601, but both boats were damaged, and several crew on both boats were killed or wounded. They put into Corfu for repairs. On 22 February 1944, the two boats attempted to continue their voyage, but two <b>carburetter</b> fires on S603 forced a return to port. This was followed by a fire during a test run, and several crew were badly burnt. Another attempt to leave began on 14 March, but the cruising engine on S 603 exploded, injuring two crewmen. Due to rough seas in the central Adriatic, the two boats were diverted to Salamis, with S601 towing her disabled sister boat. In the meantime, S 602 and S 604 had also been sent to Salamis.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, with four longerons and 3-ply covered. The Le Rhone rotary was partially enclosed within an open-bottomed engine cowling and was mounted on steel tube bearings. Aluminium sheet, rounded {{on the upper}} surface, covered the fuselage rearwards to the cabin. [...] There were two firewalls between engine and cabin and the <b>carburetter,</b> gravity-fed fuel from a tank in the central wing, {{was placed in the}} ventilated space between them.|$|E
50|$|Manufacture continued, now by The S. U. <b>Carburetter</b> Company Limited {{which was}} {{incorporated}} 15 September 1936 {{part of the}} Morris Organization, later known as the Nuffield Organization. The S. U. <b>Carburetter</b> Company Limited of 1936 was voluntarily liquidated in December 1994.|$|E
50|$|The Mark I version had {{a single}} carburettor, and the Mark II had twin <b>carburetters</b> for extra power.|$|R
50|$|The Weslake {{head and}} twin RAG <b>carburetters</b> were fitted {{to the last}} year's {{production}} of SS 1 and SS 2 cars.|$|R
50|$|The car {{featured}} BMC's 1489 cc B type engine but, in the MG Magnette III (and its Riley sibling), {{performance was}} enhanced by fitting twin S.U. H.D.4 <b>carburetters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The S.U. <b>Carburetter</b> Company Limited also {{manufactured}} dual-choke updraught carburettors for aero-engines {{such as the}} Rolls-Royce Merlin and Rolls-Royce Griffon.|$|E

50|$|A single <b>carburetter</b> {{version of}} the 1304 engine also became {{available}} in 1965, which still offered 44 kW (60 PS) of power and commensurate performance.|$|E
5000|$|The Lago-SS {{shared the}} {{advanced}} cylinder-head {{technology of the}} Lago-Spécial, but it used a shortened 2650 mm wheel-base chassis. There was no [...] "standard body" [...] offered with this car which was produced by Talbot only in bare chassis form. Exotic coach-built bodies were provided by coach builders, most notably Figoni & Falaschi. Although fuel feed was [...] "normally" [...] provided using triple Zénith 32 <b>carburetters,</b> cars were also produced featuring larger diameter Zénith 35 <b>carburetters,</b> and thus equipped the car came with listed maximum power of [...]|$|R
50|$|The AMAL {{company was}} formed in the late 1920s when three {{manufacturers}} amalgamated - Amac, Brown and Barlow, and Binks - to manufacture carburettors and associated products under the name Amalgamated <b>Carburetters</b> Ltd.|$|R
25|$|The British Air Ministrys Inspector of Accidents {{reported}} that the accident had been caused by icing in the <b>carburetters</b> of all four engines. This caused a full loss {{of power in the}} inboard engines and partial loss in the outer; the commander of the Cavalier had reported icing problems prior to ditching. The inspector recommended that extra heating of <b>carburetters</b> and of the incoming air be provided and that a temperature indicator be installed. He also advised that passengers should be instructed in the fastening of lifebelts and the location of emergency exits and recommended the provision of extra life-saving equipment like rafts and pyrotechnic signals and that passengers should fasten safety belts at take-off and alighting.|$|R
5000|$|A four-cylinder {{water-cooled}} 1698 cc {{unit had}} also {{first appeared in}} the Rekord B, but only in high compression form. Launching the Rekord C in 1966 Opel introduced a 1698 cc unit with the same lower compression ratio of 8.2:1 as the 1492 cc engine: in this form the engine was known as the [...] "1700". As with the [...] "1500", Opel returned to the old home produced [...] "Carter Licence" [...] <b>carburetter</b> for the first year of production, giving rise to a claimed power output of just 60 hp (44 KW). As with the [...] "1500", so with the [...] "1700", Opel gave up on the self built <b>carburetter</b> after a year, and with a bought-in Solex <b>carburetter,</b> though still with the 8.2:1 compression ratio, claimed power with the [...] "1700" [...] unit was increased to 66 hp (48 kW) in 1967. The [...] "1700" [...] engine powered more Rekord Cs {{than any of the other}} engines available for the car. Also offered was a [...] "1700 S" [...] using the same engine block butwith a Solex 35 PDSI <b>carburetter</b> and a compression ratio raised to 8,8:1. Powered by this unit, the Rekord came with a claimed maximum power output of 75 hp (65 kW). This, in effect, was the same unit that had been launched in 1965 in the Rekord B 1700S.|$|E
5000|$|The four-cylinder {{water-cooled}} 1492 cc unit, {{known as}} the [...] "1500", and which first featured the previous year in the Opel Rekord B was now carried over with few significant changes, although an in-house [...] "Carter Licence" [...] <b>carburetter</b> briefly returned (having, in the Rekord B, {{been replaced by a}} bought-in <b>carburetter</b> from Zenith or Solex). The [...] "1500" [...] was the entry-level engine in 1966 and came with a claimed maximum power output of 58 hp which in 1969 was raised to 60 hp (44 kW) when the old GM [...] "Carter Licence" [...] <b>carburetter</b> was replaced by a bought-in Solex <b>carburetter.</b> Acceleration figures for the 1498 cc cars were a little slower than on the predecessor model which presumably resulted from the increased weight of the Rekord C. Fuel consumption looks heavy by modern standards, but this was nonetheless the most fuel efficient model in the Rekord line-up, and published data indicate that it was also more fuel efficient than the contemporary Ford 17M and Volkswagen 411. Early in 1970 the 1492 cc unit was withdrawn. Presumably it had cost much the same to produce as the more powerful and more torquey but in most respects identical 1698 cc engine which now-became the entry-level power plant. More significantly, at the end of 1970 Opel would introduce the Opel Ascona, which, being slightly smaller and more modern than the Rekord, would compete more effectively in the 1500 cc class than the relatively underpowered base-level Rekord.|$|E
50|$|Early K8 engines used {{a single}} SU KIF <b>carburetter</b> with a manual choke and a breaker-less {{distributor}} {{mounted on the}} end of the camshaft. MEMS Single point injection became standard with the launch of the Rover 100 in 1994.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 the TR4A's venerable {{four-cylinder engine}} was {{replaced}} by Triumph's 2.5-litre straight-6. In the UK and most other markets it was equipped with Lucas fuel injection and called the TR5. In the United States price pressure and tighter emissions standards resulted in an otherwise identical but much less powerful car being fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg <b>carburetters,</b> called the TR250.|$|R
50|$|Power {{came from}} a more {{powerful}} version of the previous model's 2.1 L (2103 cc/128 in³) Rover IOE straight-6 engine now with chromium-plated cylinder bores, an aluminium cylinder head with built-in induction manifold {{and a pair of}} horizontal instead of downdraught <b>carburetters.</b> A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear lever which was replaced by a floor-mounted mechanism in September 1953.|$|R
5000|$|His {{first race}} was in 1949, at a BARC meeting driving a Fiat 1100 special, which he built himself: [...] "very neat was Pierpont's (sic) F.I.A.T. 1,100 with {{aerodynamic}} but not all-enveloping bodywork, two Amal <b>carburetters,</b> a neat silencer in its straight exhaust pipe and an oil-cooler {{ahead of the}} main radiator." [...] He finished seventh in a 3-lap handicap.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 {{the name}} and rights were {{acquired}} by Burlen Fuel Systems Limited of Salisbury which incorporated an entirely new company with the name The S.U. <b>Carburetter</b> Company Limited which continues to manufacture carburettors, pumps and components mainly for the classic car market.|$|E
5000|$|About 1900 Birch {{built his}} first motorcycle, which he also named the George Eliot. The bike had three innovations: {{the engine was}} {{positioned}} where the pedals are on a bicycle, the engine was built into the frame, {{and it had a}} low-tension magneto superseding the battery type ignition. Two of his bikes were shown at the 1902 Stanley Show. The brochure from the show described them as one (is) fitted with Simms' Magneto in conjunction with Birch's advance sparking apparatus. This machine is constructed with Birch's patent combined crank chamber and bottom bracket built in the frame; surface <b>carburetter</b> (carburetor), belt drive, Birch's disc hubs, and compound brake. The other has a surface <b>carburetter,</b> wipe contact, accumulator, trembler coil, and self-compenszing contact ...|$|E
50|$|The Milnes-Daimler {{motor bus}} of 1904 (based on the Cannstatt Daimler lorry), {{operated}} in London by Thomas Tilling, ran on either petrol or paraffin, but for starting the engine, or frequent stop-start work, petrol continuously was the preferable option. The airflow from the <b>carburetter</b> was heated by diverted exhaust gas.|$|E
5000|$|The Taunus P5 was {{the launch}} model for Ford’s new V6 engine {{which was also}} a {{development}} from the company’s V4 unit. The 1998 cc V6 version offered a claimed maximum power of [...] or, with a higher compression ratio, [...] achieved in both cases.at 5,000 rpm. [...] Performance from the six-cylinder engine was boosted by the fitting, as standard equipment, of twin <b>carburetters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Riley and Wolseley {{were linked}} in small cars as well. Launched in 1957, the Riley One-Point-Five and Wolseley 1500 {{were based on}} the unused but {{intended}} replacement for the Morris Minor. They shared their exteriors, but the Riley was marketed as the more performance-oriented option, having an uprated engine, twin S.U. <b>carburetters</b> and a close-ratio gearbox. With its good handling, compact, sports-saloon styling and well-appointed interior, the One-Point-Five quite successfully recaptured the character of the 1930s light saloons.|$|R
50|$|In July 1935 {{the engine}} was bored out {{slightly}} further than before. Engine capacity now increased to 1054cc and claimed power output to 32 PS. This was not a “completely new engine”, however: the stroke length of 68.5 mm remained unchanged as did the 2-stroke 4-cylinder configuration. The Solex FH 26 S carburettor had been replaced in 1934, during the previous car’s production run, with twin Solex 26 BFH <b>carburetters,</b> and this new fuel feed arrangement was retained with the larger engine that arrived in 1935.|$|R
5000|$|The Sport model shared its 2,494 cc 6-cylinder engine {{with the}} sedan/saloon, but {{in place of}} the {{standard}} car’s single <b>carburetter</b> this one came with three. The compression ratio was raised and the lower three gear ratios were mildly lowered. [...] of maximum power was claimed {{in place of the}} standard engine’s [...]|$|E
50|$|After the war, <b>Carburetter</b> {{production}} ceased and Low Mill {{returned to}} textiles. For {{a short time}} the mills were working hard, as textiles were in short supply. However, the machinery was out of date, {{and there was a}} major closure of textile mills throughout the country. In Addingham, the last mill to close was at Low Mill in 1976.|$|E
50|$|The Zenith <b>Carburetter</b> Company Limited was a British company making {{carburettors}} in Stanmore Middlesex {{founded in}} 1910. In 1965 they joined with their major pre-war rival Solex Carburettors {{and over time}} the Zenith brand name fell into disuse. The rights to the Zenith designs were owned by Solex UK (a daughter company of Solex in France).|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{starting}} {{operations at}} his new factory in Molsheim, Bugatti refined his light shaft-driven car into the Type 13 racer. This included boring the engine out to 65 mm {{for a total of}} 1.4 L (1368 cc/83 in3). A major advance was the 4-valve head Bugatti designed [...] - [...] one of the first of its type ever conceived. Power output with dual Zenith <b>Carburetters</b> reached 30 hp (22 kW) at 4500 rpm, more than adequate for the 660 lb (300 kg) car. Leaf springs were now fitted all around, and the car rode on a roughly 2 m (79 in) wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|Project Llama {{began in}} 1985. The chassis {{was based on}} that of the One Ten, and that vehicle's basic layout was adopted. The chassis was made of thicker steel than normal Land Rover chassis. Land Rover claimed that 85% of the chassis and {{drivetrain}} components of the Llama were taken from existing Land Rover models. A 3.5-litre (215 c.u.) Rover V8 with Zenith/Stromberg <b>carburetters</b> was used, tuned to deliver 110 horsepower (less than the power developed by the same engine in other Land Rover products). The 5-speed LT85 manual transmission from the V8-powered One Ten was used, with the LT230 two-speed, permanent 4 wheel drive transfer box.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} [...] "resolutely modern" [...] for the time. The {{displacement}} was : 100 mm bore and 140 mm stroke. Two SU <b>carburetters</b> and dual ignition with Bosch magnetos were fitted. The engine produced [...] for the touring model and [...] for the racing model. The engine speed {{was limited to}} 4,000 rpm. A single overhead camshaft actuated four valves per cylinder, inclined at 30 degrees. This was a technically advanced design at a time where most cars used only two valves per cylinder. The camshaft was driven by bevel gears on a vertical shaft {{at the front of}} the engine, as on the 3 Litre engine.|$|R
5000|$|Moto Guzzi of Italy built a 148 kg [...] {{water-cooled}} DOHC V8 4-stroke motorcycle for Grand Prix racing between 1955 and 1957, {{referred to}} as the Moto Guzzi Grand Prix 500 cc V8. It was known as the Otto Cilindri, and had a very high power output but was not developed to its full potential. Each cylinder had its own <b>carburetter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, with four longerons and 3-ply covered. The Le Rhone rotary was partially enclosed within an open-bottomed engine cowling and was mounted on steel tube bearings. Aluminium sheet, rounded {{on the upper}} surface, covered the fuselage rearwards to the cabin. There were two firewalls between engine and cabin and the <b>carburetter,</b> gravity-fed fuel from a tank in the central wing, {{was placed in the}} ventilated space between them.|$|E
5000|$|The car used a 2,522 cc in-line six-cylinder, pushrod ohv engine fed by {{a single}} SU <b>carburetter.</b> Throughout its life, [...] was claimed, though {{a change in the}} gearing in 1950 was marked by an {{increase}} in maximum speed from 76 mph to 82 mph for the saloon, while the acceleration time from 0 - 50 mph improved from 17.9 to 16.9 seconds. By the standards of the time the car was brisker than it looked.|$|E
5000|$|The 2993 cc {{engine was}} new and {{produced}} [...] fitted with a single Solex carburettor and a compression ratio of 7.0:1. Unusually, the engine incorporated timing gears {{at the rear of}} the cylinder block and a 7-bearing crank to increase smoothness. [...] This was the first appearance of the engine that would power Alvis cars until the manufacturer withdrew from passenger car production in 1967, although modifications, when branded petrol returned to the market and higher octane fuels became available including increased compression ratios, would enable the power output to be progressively raised after 1953 until, fed by three SU <b>carburetters,</b> it reached [...] in 1965.|$|R
50|$|Bentley {{refused to}} allow the engine to be {{modified}} to incorporate the compressor. The huge Roots-type supercharger ("blower") was hence added {{in front of the}} radiator, driven straight from the crankshaft. This gave the Blower Bentley a unique and easily recognisable profile, and exacerbated its understeer. A guard protected the two <b>carburetters</b> located at the compressor intake. Similar protection was used (both in the 4½ Litre and the Blower) for the fuel tank at the rear, because a flying stone punctured the 3 Litre of Frank Clement and John Duff during the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, possibly depriving them of victory. The crankshaft, pistons and lubrication system were special to the Blower engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Split S {{without a}} {{beginning}} half-roll was a standard manoeuvre in early World War II by German pilots seeking to evade British fighters. The Merlin engine used in British fighters was carburetted, and the float valves would malfunction under negative g-force leading to reduced power or a stalled engine (The German fighters were {{not subject to}} this problem since they used fuel injection). This could be prevented by quarter-rolling the aircraft before starting the dive, but doing so took up enough time to give the German pilots an excellent chance of escaping. The beginnings of a solution was provided by [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a fuel-flow restriction device, and was finally solved by changing from the original S.U. <b>carburetters</b> to Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettors, and later to S.U. injection carburettors.|$|R
