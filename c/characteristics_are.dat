5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass {{to that of}} {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> not as well-constrained, the planet's <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> not well-constrained either. The {{inability}} to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral <b>characteristics)</b> <b>are</b> {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
50|$|Linguistic {{universals}} are {{patterns that}} can be seen cross linguistically. Universals can either be absolute, meaning that every documented language exhibits this characteristic, or statistical, meaning that this <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> seen in most languages or is probable in most languages. Universals, both absolute and statistical can be unrestricted, meaning that they apply to most or all languages without any additional conditions. Conversely, both absolute and statistical universals can be restricted or implicational, meaning that a <b>characteristic</b> will <b>be</b> true on the condition of something else (if Y <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> true, then X <b>characteristic</b> <b>is</b> true).|$|R

5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the orbit}} of the red dwarf MOA-2009-BLG-387L. Its discovery was announced on February 21, 2011, making it the eleventh planet discovered using gravitational microlensing. The planet {{is thought to be}} over twice the mass of Jupiter and to have an orbit 80 percent larger than that of Earth's, lasting approximately 1,970 days. However, its exact <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> difficult to constrain because the characteristics of the host star are not well known.|$|E
5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E

Besides this, demographic <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
