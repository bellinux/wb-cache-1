5|$|In 1879, James Ritty, a saloon owner, {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> paving way for its production through the National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company, based in Dayton. The company prospered through the 21st century, producing automated teller machines, barcode scanners, {{and other related}} products, employing thousands. It was eventually relocated to Georgia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> patents and formed the National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> has {{recently}} been updated in the Czech Republic. Their introduction assumes {{the elimination of the}} shadow economy through an increase in reported sales for business entites, who are forced to use it. Regression analysis has not demonstrated a direct effect of the <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> on the level of reported revenues. <b>Cash</b> <b>registers</b> represent an additional burden on businesses and make conditions for doing a business more difficult. In the year of introduction of <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> the number of business entities has decreased, while the number of civil servants has increased. The direct effect of <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> on the development of tax revenue of the state budget could not be demonstrated due to lack of relevant data...|$|R

Some <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> require a numeric password or physical key to be used when attempting to open the till.|$|R
5|$|During 1960, {{the list}} of {{manufacturers}} planning to build COBOL compilers grew. By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (Bendix, Control Data Corporation, General Electric (GE), National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers. GE and IBM planned to integrate COBOL into their own languages, GECOM and COMTRAN, respectively. In contrast, International Computers and Tabulators planned to replace their language, CODEL, with COBOL.|$|E

They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the <b>cash</b> <b>register.</b> The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|Richard M. Scrushy {{was born}} in August 1952 in Selma, Alabama. The son of a middle class family, Scrushy's father, Gerald Scrushy, worked as a <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> {{repairman}} and his mother, Grace Scrushy, worked as a nurse and respiratory therapist. At an early age, Scrushy taught himself {{to play the piano}} and guitar and was earning money doing odd jobs {{by the time he was}} 12 years old.

5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a mint mark, {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} patent, Ritty became {{overwhelmed}} with {{the responsibilities of}} running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company and improved the <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the journal for internal bookkeeping purposes, and the receipt for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer. It also prevents a customer from defrauding the business by falsely claiming receipt of a lesser amount of change or a transaction that never happened in the first place. The first evidence of an actual <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> was used in Coalton, Ohio, at the old mining company.|$|E

25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} a {{compartment}} underneath a <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer typically contains a removable till. The till {{is usually a}} plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately {{in order to make}} counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits.

25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> operating system. The <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E
