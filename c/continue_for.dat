5|$|Late in his reign, Christian IV {{also became}} an early proponent of Baroque {{which was to}} <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> a {{considerable}} time with many impressive buildings both in the capital and the provinces.

A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style.|$|E

5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were {{overwhelmed by the}} tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; {{the last of the}} barricades (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional shots at police or military patrols—would <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> days afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The last abbot, John Bourchier, {{was granted}} the {{substantial}} pension of £200 a year, when the abbey was dissolved: {{the largest in}} the Diocese of Lincoln. Payments did not <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> very long, however, as in 1552, in the reign of Henry VIII's son King Edward VI, the national finance's were so poor that all pensions over £10 were suspended, with Bourchier recorded as having not received payments for over six months.|$|E

Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the 1952 Winter Olympics, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany, an arrangement that would <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> the following two Olympiads.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could <b>continue,</b> <b>for</b> it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> more or less time.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} clarify the pain caused by the bar implant and its {{duration}} after the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum. A semi-structured interview was conducted with eleven mothers and their {{junior high and high}} school children (twenty-two interviewees in total). As a result, the following seven pains and their duration were clarified. (1) Severe pain immediately after surgery and during hospitalization (Ten days after surgery), (2) Pain when changing posture that <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> about three months, (3) Pain caused by restrictions on daily physical activities that <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> about three months, (4) Pain associated with whole-body vibration that <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> about three months, (5) Pain due to upper limb movement that <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> about six months, (6) Pain due to contact and impact that <b>continues</b> <b>for</b> about one year, (7) Pain or discomfort due to the bar implant that remains for one year or more, In most of the pain categories, mothers described the duration of pain as being much longer than their children. However, most mothers stated they were satisfied with the results, and that the occurrence of pain does not negate the necessity of this surgery...|$|R
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of an}} aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. The trial was transformed from a murder trial into one against the Camorra as a whole. The hearings began in the spring of 1911 and would <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> twelve months. Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the final blow to the Camorra. The trial was attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B. McClellan, in whose administration Petrosino was killed.|$|E
5|$|The war {{of words}} would <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> another 130 years with endless {{commentary}} from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
