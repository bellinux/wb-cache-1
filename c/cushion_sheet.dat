30|$|We {{conducted}} three-point bending tests {{by changing}} the condition at the loading point and then examined {{the influence of the}} loading point on the test data. Yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipfera L.) was used for the tests. First, using loading noses with various radii, static bending tests were conducted by varying the depth/span ratios. Deflections were measured from the displacement of the cross head and at the point against the loading nose: Young's and shear moduli were obtained from the modified Timoshenko's bending equation proposed in a previous paper. Then a similar testing procedure was undertaken by inserting <b>cushion</b> <b>sheets</b> of Teflon between the specimen and the nose. After the measuring these moduli, bending strengths were measured using the loading noses and <b>cushion</b> <b>sheets.</b> The following results were obtained: (1) When the deflection was measured from the displacement of the cross head, the radius of the loading nose had an influence on the additional deflection when the depth/span ratio was high, causing the dependence of the shear modulus on the radius. In contrast, the radius had little influence on the measurement of Young's modulus. By placing <b>cushion</b> <b>sheets</b> between the nose and the specimen, the effect of the radius was moderated. When the deflection was measured at the point against the loading nose, the radius of the nose had little influence on the additional deflection; hence the loading nose had little influence when obtaining Young's and shear moduli. This tendency was commonly observed regardless of whether the <b>cushion</b> <b>sheets</b> were in place. (2) When the specimen had a high depth/span ratio, the bending strength increased with the increase in the radius of the loading nose. However, the influence of the radius was small when the specimen had a low depth/span ratio. There was no significant effect of the <b>cushion</b> <b>sheets</b> used here on the measurement of bending strength.|$|R

40|$|Fast {{visualization}} of industrial parts for rapid prototyping is nowadays eased {{by the fact}} that CAD construction data is readily available in most cases. Upholstery constitutes an important exception as its shape is not given a priori but the result of complex physical interactions between hard bodies, soft <b>cushioning</b> and elastic <b>sheets.</b> In this paper we propose an interactive visualization and editing method for upholstery that infers physically plausible surfaces from a sewing pattern. Our method supports fast design decisions by allowing easy and intuitive modifications of the inferred surface at any time. We also propose a reconstruction method for point clouds that is specifically targeted at upholstery. We argue that the sewing pattern encodes important information about shape and material deformations of the final surface and consequently use it as a prior in our reconstruction algorithm. The practicability of our method is demonstrated on two real world data sets. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} an innovative sheet folding theory and technology in the design of new <b>cushioning</b> systems. Flat <b>sheets</b> of material are folded into three dimensional patterns. The effectiveness of the folded pattern in absorbing impact energy without subjecting items being cushioned to high acceleration is dependent on the sheet material, the fold configuration (number of folds per unit length), dimensions of the fold, number of stacked layers, number of sheets folded together and other factors. Full design of experiments is conducted to obtain a relationship between the acceleration observed by the contents of the cushioning systems and the parameters of the cushion design. The relationship has been validated experimentally using different system parameters. The application of the work in providing cushioning systems for highly sensitive items such as electronic components or providing An innovative folding theory has been developed in which a sheet of material can be folded into a three dimensional pattern. Extensive patterns can be generated using this new technique. In this paper, we focus our research {{on one of the most}} commonly generated patterns, namely, th...|$|R

Company also opened a store in Highcross Leicester, UK in September 2015. A 22,000-square-feet of Khaadi store was opened in September 2015 at Karachi’s Dolmen Mall Clifton. Khaadi have built more than 40 stores in Pakistan as well as stores in United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Mexico, America, Australia, Malaysia and United Kingdom. Despite being awarded for menswear, Khaadi never introduced men's clothing at wide global level, but as of 2014, brand is currently in its final stages for reprising it menswear clothing in its stores.

The compartments are situated between tarsal, metatarsal, metacarpal bones, proximal phalanges or other structures of the locomotor apparatus covering the bones palmarly/plantarly and the thick sole skin. Within the cushions, collagen, reticulin and elastic fibres are found. In the main parts, vascular supply is good and numerous nerves course within the entire cushion. Vater–Pacinian corpuscles are embedded within the collagenous tissue of the cushions and within the dermis. Meissner corpuscles are found in the dermal papillae of the foot skin. The micromorphology of elephant feet cushions resembles that of digital cushions in cattle or of the foot pads in humans but not that of digital cushions in horses.
