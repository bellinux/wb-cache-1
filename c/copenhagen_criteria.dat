25|$|To {{become a}} member, a country {{must meet the}} <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criteria,</b> defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable {{democracy}} that respects {{human rights and the}} rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria {{is the responsibility of the}} European Council. No member state has yet left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985. The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause under Article 50, providing for a member to leave the EU.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, the European Parliament {{passed a}} {{resolution}} stating that according to the parliament's assessment, the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criteria</b> have been fulfilled sufficiently {{for the country to}} start its negotiations for EU accession, and called for the Council of the European Union to confirm the date for start of accession negotiations straight away, as bilateral disputes must not be an obstacle for the start of talks—although they must be solved before the accession process. However, {{it remains to be seen}} whether or not the Council decides to agree with the parliament's opinion, at its next meeting in June 2014.|$|E
40|$|This paper’s general {{argument}} is that the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> constitute the leverage that is making Turkish modernisation and democratisation more plural, multi-cultural and consolidated. In the first section, a historical overview of modern Turkey is undertaken {{from the perspective of}} political modernisation and democratic consolidation in order to assess Turkey’s ability to meet the requirements of the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria.</b> The second section evaluates the impact of EU conditionality and the remaining problems and prospects in four major areas – the role of the military, human rights, protection of minorities and the judicial system. The paper concludes with the assessment that the dynamic process of change underway requires the continuation of efforts by Turkey to fully implement the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> and a credible policy of conditionality by the EU that respects the principle of fairness in relations between the two sides...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{makes an}} attempt �to map� the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criterion</b> of {{democracy}} {{and the rule of}} law, one of the main instruments governing the biggest enlargement in the Union history. The meaning of it, however, is still as vague today as it was more than ten years ago, at the time of introduction of the criterion. How should democracy and rule of law be interpreted in the context of enlargement? What exactly is required of the candidate countries in order to meet this criterion? Based on the analysis of the documents released by the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Council {{in the course of the}} application of the criteria and taking the experience of the previous enlargements into account, the paper outlines the core structure of the criterion and assesses the degree of change brought to the enlargement regulation by the conditionality policy applied by the Union. The paper concludes that the assessment {{of democracy and}} the rule of law criterion was not really full, consistent and impartial and that the threshold to meet this criterion was very low. As a result, the Commission failed to establish a link between the actual stage of reform in the candidate countries and the acknowledgement that the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> are met.

On 6 September 2004, the Macedonian government adopted a National Strategy for European integration, {{supported by the}} country's parliament through its Commission for European Issues. The government subsequently began the procedure of answering the questionnaire of the European Commission regarding its performance in preparation for membership {{in accordance with the}} <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criteria,</b> a process that was finished by 31 January 2005.

In order to accede, a state must fulfill {{the economic and political}} requirements known as the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criteria,</b> which require a candidate to have a democratic, free market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{has been}} {{attaching}} {{great importance to}} the values of democracy and human rights in its external policy, including to its relationship with candidate countries seeking membership in the Union.

This paper examines one of those oversight mechanisms – ombudsman institutions – in the candidate states conducting accession negotiations with the EU. It specifically scrutinises a fundamental characteristic for the effective functioning of these institutions – the jurisdiction and powers granted by their statutes. Relying on the findings to be noted, the paper also seeks an {{answer to the question of}} which ombudsman institution(s) score(s) better in terms of effectiveness and thus play(s) a more significant role in the improvement and consolidation of democracy and protection of human rights in its or their countries, and as a result, contribute(s) more to the fulfilment of <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> during the EU accession processes...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} Turkish {{enlargement}} from three basic aspects. Firstly, Turkish enlargement is deeply {{compared to the}} last enlargement of the ten new member states {{which took place in}} May 2004. Main differences which are likely to have large consequences for both Turkey and the European Union are described {{in this part of the}} paper. Political aspects of the Turkish enlargement are the second viewpoint of the thesis. These are mainly <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> and the most important political fields, which might eventually complicate Turkish membership in the European Union. Last aspect of the Turkish enlargement question is economic development and <b>Copenhagen</b> economic <b>criteria.</b> First part of this particular chapter briefly describes economic development of the Turkish economy during the last decade and main economic problems are mentioned as well. Customs union of Turkey and the European Union is deeply analysed in the subsequent part, mainly because of its importance to the current state of relationship between Turkey and EU.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the conditionality of European Union membership had a decisive contribution at the standard setting on and institutional development of minority protection at national level in candidate countries. At {{the beginning of the}} 1990 s, scholars identified several dangerous contextual problems that could have halted Romania's progress in becoming a consolidated democracy, one of them being the ethnic unrests. However, Romania succeeded in becoming member in main international and European organisations dealing, among others, with the protection of minorities. The paper critically assesses the viability of the state apparatus created in Romania in order to safeguard and improve the rights of minorities inhabiting its territory {{in the context of the}} European Union integration. The question of whether the institutional framework for minority protection in Romania succeeded in achieving its stated goal: satisfy the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criterion</b> of “stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and, protection of minorities” is to be discussed within the paper. Furthermore, the paper assesses the extent to which the accession process has generated a substantial change in the institutional framework in Romania. The paper concludes that in order to produce qualitative results, attention must be paid not only on the formal compliance with legal standards but also on the apparatus created to promote and apply those standards...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} examine what {{domestic}} factors in Turkish politics refracted the democratisation requirements {{laid out by}} the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> and what impacts the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> have made on Turkish democracy in the 1999 post-the Helsinki era. It also explains how transformation of Turkish democracy was made possible after 1999 Helsinki decision. In doing this, based on Europeanization studies, the study employs a conceptual framework comprising three-steps, which are Europeanization, goodness of fit, and mediating factors. The thesis argues {{that the impact of}} Europeanization on Turkey’s democracy is institution dependent. Domestic institutions are significant in two respects. First, the institutions determine the degree of pressure for adaptation, which results from Europeanization. Second, domestic institutions have a large impact upon the strategies by which domestic actors respond to adaptational pressure facilitating or inhibiting institutional adaptation. One of the main findings of the thesis is that domestic institutions comprising parties, party system, the military, the president, civil society, the Turkish public and norms, values and traditions embedded in the Turkish polity have refracted the EU democratic reforms sometimes accelerating, sometimes retarding their translation into domestic politics and giving them a national coloring. Another conclusion is that as following 1999 Helsinki decision, “costs-benefits” equation has changed in favour of the latter from the angle of the Turkish state, it was possible for them to take courageous steps, and for the EU to play an effective anchor role in this transformation...|$|R
40|$|Ankara : The Department of International Relations, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 141 - 156. This thesis {{analyzes the}} question of how European transnational capital affects the EU’s enlargement to Turkey. It adopts Neo-Gramscianist critical theory, and it looks at the links between the applicant states’ compliance with the <b>Copenhagen</b> economic <b>criteria,</b> the foreign direct investment inflows by European firms, the reports published by the European Roundtable of Industrialists (ERT), and the decisions taken by the Commission and the member states. To analyze such links, the thesis benefits from comparative case study and historical interpretation methods. As such, it compares Eastern enlargement to the EU’s enlargement to Turkey and analyzes the ERT’s position on enlargement politics within the historical context. In this way, this thesis, first, reconfirms the privileged role of the European transnational capital on enlargement politics. Then, it shows that the ERT was less interested in Turkey’s EU accession when compared to Central and Eastern European countries. It explains the reason why the ERT was less interested in Turkey’s EU accession with reference to the country’s failures to comply with the necessities of <b>Copenhagen</b> economic <b>criteria</b> and the Customs Union Agreement, and it underlines that the ERT actively supported Turkey’s accession only when the country started to make progress in line with the ERT’s policy recommendations. In this way, the thesis suggests {{that one of the reasons}} why Turkey has not been admitted to the EU relates to the apathy of the ERT towards Turkey’s accession. Reyhan, KaanM. S...|$|R
40|$|Studies of EU {{enlargement}} generally take {{as their}} subject the motivations for a country’s accession; rarely do they analyse in great detail any of the steps in the process itself. My contribution to the literature is an analysis of DG Enlargement in {{its role as a}} boundary spanner during the pre-accession period. One of the key boundary-spanning tasks exercised by the DG is to provide information about the organisation, its operations, and its management to the external environment. To answer the questions to what extent DG Enlargement can be characterised as a boundary spanner, and how the relevance of this characterisation might have changed over time, I examine DG Enlargement’s performance during the 2004 enlargement round and the critical self-assessment it undertook thereafter to determine whether lessons learnt have resulted in changed behaviour. In order to maximise evidence of boundary-spanning behaviour, I have chosen DG Enlargement’s management of the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criterion</b> of minority rights protection as my case study: with the condition absent from the acquis, DG ELARG must persuade membership aspirants to adopt this norm by other means. I will argue that DG Enlargement did act as a boundary spanner during the 2004 enlargement round, but that its assimilation of lessons learned has not dramatically affected its current behaviour. Despite disseminating the findings of its internal evaluations widely throughout the EU, political unwillingness to come to an agreement on common standards of minority rights protection prevents DG ELARG from improving its performance other than at the margins...|$|R
2500|$|According to the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>criteria,</b> {{membership}} of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, free market liberal democracy that respects {{the rule of law}} and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of acquis communautaire) and switching to the euro. In order to join the European Union, it is required for all member states to agree; if a single member state disagrees, the applying country is declined acceptance to the European Union. [...] In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).|$|E

40|$|Although {{minority}} protection {{was one of}} the <b>Copenhagen</b> political <b>criteria</b> {{and thus}} was {{at the core of the}} conditionality principle presupposing a fair assessment of the candidate countries’ progress towards accession on the merits, the Commission simultaneously promoted two contradicting approaches to the issue throughout the whole duration of the pre–accession process.

The key question posed in this paper is whether the environmental governance approach in Kosovo, in line with EU accession process, represents an appropriate framework for dealing with the country‟s environmental problems. The current Kosovo legal framework, institutional set-up, and current practice will be evaluated against conformity with the EU acquis. The implementation of EU environmental acquis in Kosovo is to be seen as an important opportunity to create environmental governance and stable processes of assessing environmental impact and increasing environmental policy integration...|$|R
