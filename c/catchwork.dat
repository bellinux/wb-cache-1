40|$|AbstractThe studied {{agricultural}} landscape is situated {{to the south}} and southeast from the volcanic mass of Polana. Terrain of the sub-mountain area is smoothly denudated because it had been eroded {{for a long time before}} the volcanic period. Valleys of the Bystry potok and Riecka streams correspond with tectonic faults. The region was colonized during the 17 th century by pastorals and later by peasants. Traditional forms of agriculture have persisted in the landscape till today. Soils are slightly fertile. The area lies on the boundary between slightly warm and cold, very humid climatic zone. Annual rainfall is within the range 700 - 900 mm. But based on a long-term microclimatic measuring, it is shown that the lack of precipitation is in the period of the vegetation growth. Bedrock consists mainly of granodiorite rocks which have low water permeability and weak springs (yield ranging between 0. 1 – 0. 4 l. s- 1). Water absorbs rapidly and flows over the surface of granodiorite rocks to the lower horizons. A similar process appears in the sandy-loam weathering mantle, which has locally a depth about 2 m. Therefore, local inhabitants had to build a system of catchworks which can distribute water from alluvial plains to uplands’ slopes. We identified about 3700 m of catchworks in the Riecka water catchment area. A prevailing part of catchworks distributes water from streams and less flows from springs. During the fieldwork we identified wetlands and waterlogged areas which represent potential sites for spreading of valuable biotopes. Further, we evaluated the degree of the <b>catchwork</b> utilization and succession processes on slopes. Catchworks are only partly functional, and the investigated area suffers from a lack of water mostly during summer seasons. We propose revitalization of the <b>catchwork</b> system in the landscape. Integrated management of the catchment also should take into account effects of current climate change on the studied region...|$|E

In the urban area of Porto, the second most important city of the Portuguese mainland, there is a population of about 216, 000 inhabitants. This study highlights the importance of urban speleological mapping applied to groundwater and geo-engineering studies. All the water that flows from the so-called Paranhos or Arca D’Água springs is captured by <b>catchwork</b> galleries and their utilization date back around 1120 AD. Paranhos spring galleries catchworks (c. 3, 3 km extension and a - 21 m below ground level) {{was one of the main}} water supplies to Porto City for more than six centuries and, nowadays, these waters are still appropriate for irrigation uses. Topographic, geological, geophysical and hydrogeological data were collected and interpreted, allowing the definition of a hydrogeotechnical zoning. All these features were mapped and overlaid using GIS mapping techniques. This multidisciplinary approach offers a good potential for reliable urban speleological and geo-engineering studies of Arca D’Água site...|$|E

[...] Proceedings of the International Congress on Science and Technology for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage, held 2 - 5 october, Santiago de Compostela, España. Paranhos {{constitutes}} one of {{the main}} water galleries excavated in the granite substratum of Porto City (Portugal) to gather the groundwater for public use during the past six centuries. The interest of this water gallery is double: a) Cultural Heritage and scientific value, b) Underground geoturism. A multidisciplinary research to study the microclimatology, geochemistry, mineralogy and geomicrobiology of the Paranhos <b>catchwork</b> galleries is currently in progress. The characterization of the main environmental parameters (air-rock temperature, relative humidity, CO 2, 222 Rn, etc.) in the internal atmosphere would allow the establishment of: a) Fluid-rock interactions and development of a physical-chemical model of air-water-rock, as a base to define their relations with unusual mineral formations and microbial communities b) Microclimatic parameters and determination of effective radioactive dose for visitors based on 222 Rn studies, as potential use as underground geotourism site under safe conditions. This research was supported by the Spanish Project CGL 2011 - 25690. Peer reviewe...|$|E
