5|$|Whilst the {{government}} is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal, some on civil liberties grounds. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>school</b> attendance is usually justified by reference to the argument that minors are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a grey area, being regarded as effectively adult {{in a number of}} contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Scotland), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.|$|E
5|$|The {{compulsory}} education period in Malta has been {{between five and}} 16 years of age since {{the introduction of the}} Education Act 1988. This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, school attendance became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory) and 14 years of age in 1946, when <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> attendance was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise. Compulsory schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence.|$|E
5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} issue that will arise {{in assessing the}} impact of the minimum age of employment regulation is whether the laws co-move with <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> regulation or natural school transition points.C 138 stipulates that <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws should define the lower bound on minimum age of employment regulation if such laws require schooling beyond age 14. The last column of Table[*] 1 contains the age at which schooling is no longer compulsory (or NA if <b>schooling</b> is not <b>compulsory).</b> <b>Compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> regulations are sometimes based on grade completion, in which case we have translated that grade to an age using the rates of school completion reported by UNESCO (see the appendix). These imputed <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> ages are marked with an asterisk. Four countries do not have any <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> regulation. Sixteen of the 59 countries have aligned their <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws with their minimum age of employment laws. The next section considers how these minimum age of employment regulations and <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws impact time allocation.|$|R
30|$|Binding <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws may be {{de facto}} or de jure.

Previous studies, for example, report contradictory effects of education and <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> on mortality - ranging from zero to large mortality reductions. Using data from 19 <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> reforms implemented in Europe during the twentieth century, we quantify the mean mortality effect and explore its dispersion across gender, time and countries. We find that men benefit from compulsory education both in the shorter and longer run. In contrast, <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> reforms {{have little or no}} effect on mortality for women...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates whether {{increasing}} mandatory {{educational attainment}} through <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> legislation encourages women to delay childbearing. We use variation induced {{by changes in}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws in both the US and Norway to estimate the effect in two very different institutional environments. We find evidence that increased <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> does in fact {{reduce the incidence of}} teenage childbearing in both the US and Norway, and these estimates are quite robust to various specification checks. These results suggest that legislation aimed at improving educational outcomes may have spillover effects onto the fertility decisions of teenagers. Research suggests that teenage childbearing adversely affects women’s economic out-comes such as the level of completed schooling, labour market participation and wages. 1 Given these deleterious consequences, {{it is important to understand}} what factors contribute to this decision. We know that low-educated women are more likely to have a teenage birth but does this imply that policies that increase educational attainment reduce early fertility? In particular, would increasing mandatory educa-tional attainment (through <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> legislation) encourage women to delay childbearing?

25|$|The Progressive Era {{also brought}} reforms in working {{conditions}} for Maryland's labor force.

The next Habsburg monarch, Maria Theresa (17401780) revived the title of Apostolic Ruler in 1758 as an assertion of her sovereign authority in Church matters.

25|$|Schleswig and Holstein have at {{different}} times belonged in part or completely to either Denmark or Germany, or have been virtually independent of both nations. The exception is that Schleswig had never been part of Germany until the Second Schleswig War in 1864. For many centuries, the King of Denmark was both a Danish Duke of Schleswig and a German Duke of Holstein. Essentially, Schleswig was either integrated into Denmark or was a Danish fief, and Holstein was a German fief and once a sovereign state long ago. Both were for several centuries ruled by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united as a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig, and consequently Schleswig would always follow the same order of succession as the one chosen in the Kingdom of Denmark. In the church, following the reformation, German {{was used in the}} southern part of Schleswig and Danish in the northern part. This would later prove decisive for shaping national sentiments in the population, as well as after 1814 when <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> education was introduced. The administration of both duchies was conducted in German, despite the fact that they were governed from Copenhagen (from 1523 by the German Chancellary which was in 1806 renamed Schleswig-Holstein Chancellary).|$|E

In the early 1950s, the Stalinist regime also carried out major {{changes to the}} education system. The communist program of free and <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> education for all, {{and the establishment of}} new free universities, received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by ideological censorship. During 1951–53, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived as [...] "reactionary" [...] by the new regime was dismissed from universities. The government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style socialist realism became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature presented to the public had to be in line with the views of the party and thus present its propaganda (see also: Socialist realism in Poland).|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 1959, {{speaking}} {{before a}} special {{joint session of}} the Virginia Assembly, Governor Almond announced that Virginia was powerless to prevent school desegregation. Speaking slowly from a typewritten script and with obvious deep emotion, Almond declared [...] "Virginia has not surrendered and does not surrender now", but then {{said he would not}} use the police power of the state to try to force schools to stay segregated. (This was an obvious reference to the incident in which Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to bar nine African American students from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The students were admitted only after President Dwight Eisenhower placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control, and had the students escorted into the high school by the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division.) Almond asked the legislature to repeal all aspects of the Stanley plan which had been overturned by the courts, repeal the state's <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> attendance law, adopt a $3 million tuition grant program to allow students to attend segregated private schools of their choice, and strengthen the penalty for threatening to bomb a church, school, or other meeting place. Almond also announced a study of Section 129 of the Virginia Constitution, a political gesture that was never seriously pursued. Almond's program became known by some as [...] "passive resistance" [...] and [...] "freedom of choice" [...] (although it is also sometimes called [...] "tokenism" [...] or [...] "containment"), a legislative approach intended to shift Virginia toward desegregation {{in the face of a}} hostile electorate.|$|E

In addition, the new policy increases the time to first-birth after marriage. We find conclusive evidence that longer <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> years have human capital effects on the time to first-birth, as well as incarcertation effects on teenage marriage; there is also suggestive evidence for human capital effects on teenage marriage. ...|$|R
40|$|By the mid- 19 th century, America was {{the most}} educated nation on Earth: signifcant …nancial {{investments}} in education were being undertaken {{and the majority of}} children voluntarily attended public schools.

We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence that states adopted <b>compulsory</b> <b>schooling</b> laws as a nation-building tool to instill civic values to the tens of millions of culturally diverse migrants who arrived during the ‘Age of Mass Migration’ between 1850 and 1914.
