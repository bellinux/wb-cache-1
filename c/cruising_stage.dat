25|$|The <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> from the aeroshell. Then the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since the initial size, velocity, density and impact angle of the hardware are known, it will provide information on impact processes on the Mars surface and atmospheric properties.|$|R

40|$|During final {{approach}} and entry, descent, and landing (EDL), the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Navigation team was tasked with the real-time detection based on one-way Doppler {{data of the}} following events for MER-A and MER-B: transition from the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> medium-gain antenna to the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> low-gain antenna, turn-to-entry attitude, venting of the heat rejection system (HRS), <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> separation, atmospheric deceleration, and parachute deployment. In addition, {{an attempt was made}} to ascertain, in near real-time, the relative average density of the atmosphere with respect to the nominal predicted density. Detection of each event from the Doppler data was complicated by several factors, including oscillator instability, acceleration, temperature changes caused by cycling of the HRS thermal valve, pressure effects, and Allan variance. These factors resulted in signatures that could not be modeled predictively. Nonetheless, an understanding of the expected Doppler signatures and the distinct Doppler pattern caused by each event enabled their real-time detection. In particular, comparisons between the pre-arrival predicted Doppler signature and the actual signature for each event are described and differences are explained.

50|$|The <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> is the {{component}} of the spacecraft that is used for travel from Earth to Mars. It {{is very similar to}} the Mars Pathfinder in design and is approximately 2.65 meters (8.7 ft) in diameter and 1.6 m (5.2 ft) tall, including the entry vehicle (see below).|$|R
2500|$|During cruise, eight {{thrusters}} {{arranged in}} two clusters {{were used as}} actuators to control spin rate and perform axial or lateral trajectory correction maneuvers. [...] By spinning about its central axis, it maintained a stable attitude. [...] Along the way, the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> performed four trajectory correction maneuvers to adjust the spacecraft's path toward its landing site. Information was sent to mission controllers via two X-band antennas. A key task of the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> was to control the temperature of all spacecraft systems and dissipate the heat generated by power sources, such as solar cells and motors, into space. In some systems, insulating blankets kept sensitive science instruments warmer than the near-absolute zero temperature of space. Thermostats monitored temperatures and switched heating and cooling systems on or off as needed.|$|R

50|$|While {{traveling}} to Mars, the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> was three-axis stabilized with four hydrazine monopropellant reaction engine modules, each including a 22-newton trajectory correction maneuver thruster for propulsion and a 4-newton reaction control system thruster for attitude control.

50|$|After {{launch and}} a four-month cruise to Venus the descent vehicle {{separated}} from the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> and plunged into the Venusian atmosphere on 1 March 1982. After entering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude of about 50 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking was used {{the rest of the}} way to the surface.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> flew by Venus the bus {{acted as}} a data relay for the lander and then {{continued}} on into a heliocentric orbit. It was equipped with a gamma-ray spectrometer, UV grating monochromator, electron and proton spectrometers, gamma-ray burst detectors, solar wind plasma detectors, and two-frequency transmitters which made measurements before, during, and after the Venus flyby.|$|R
50|$|Sojourner has {{solar panels}} and a non-rechargeable battery, which allowed limited nocturnal operations. Once the {{batteries}} were depleted, {{it could only}} operate during the day.

2500|$|The rover was {{folded up}} within an aeroshell that {{protected}} {{it during the}} travel through space and during the atmospheric entry at Mars. Ten minutes before atmospheric entry the aeroshell separated from the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> that provided power, communications and propulsion during the long flight to Mars. One minute after separation from the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> thrusters on the aeroshell fired to cancel out the spacecraft's 2-rpm rotation and achieved an orientation with the heat shield facing Mars in preparation for Atmospheric entry. The heat shield is made of phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA). The [...] diameter heat shield, {{which is the largest}} heat shield ever flown in space, reduced the velocity of the spacecraft by ablation against the Martian atmosphere, from the atmospheric interface velocity of approximately [...] down to approximately , where parachute deployment was possible about four minutes later. One minute and 15 seconds after entry the heat shield experienced peak temperatures of up to [...] as atmospheric pressure converted kinetic energy into heat. Ten seconds after peak heating, that deceleration peaked out at 15 g.|$|R
50|$|For example, Mars Pathfinder {{entered in}} 1997. About 30 minutes prior to entry, the <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> and entry capsule separated.

As it descended the parachute opened to {{slow it down}} further, and soon after the heat shield was released.

50|$|ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter {{was born}} out of the nexus of ESA's Aurora {{programme}} ExoMars flagship and NASA's 2013 and 2016 Mars Science Orbiter (MSO) concepts. It became a flexible collaborative proposal within NASA and ESA to send a new orbiter-carrier to Mars in 2016 as part of the European-led ExoMars mission. On the ExoMars side, ESA authorized about half a billion Euros in 2005 for a rover and mini-station; eventually this evolved into being delivered by an orbiter rather than a <b>cruise</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 3 December 1999, at 14:39:00 UTC, {{the last}} {{telemetry}} from Mars Polar Lander was sent, {{just prior to}} <b>cruise</b> <b>stage</b> separation and the subsequent atmospheric entry.

An object was visible and believed to be the lander. However, subsequent imaging performed by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter resulted in the identified object being ruled out. Mars Polar Lander remains lost.|$|R
