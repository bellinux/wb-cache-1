60|$|Among the {{flowering}} vines is one deserving of particular notice. Each flower {{is composed of}} six leaves or petals, about three inches in length, of a beautiful crimson, the inside spotted with white. Its leaves, of a fine green, are oval, and disposed by threes. This plant climbs upon the trees without attaching itself to them; when it has reached the topmost branches, it descends perpendicularly, and as it continues to grow, extends from tree to tree, until its various stalks interlace the grove like the rigging of a ship. The stems or trunks of this vine are tougher and more flexible than willow, and are from fifty to one hundred fathoms in length.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of thermally treated temperatures up to 800 °C on the physical properties, microstructure and phase composition of pozzoloanic cement pastes. Pozzolanic cement was prepared from three different pozzolans, namely silica fume (SF), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (WCS) and ground clay bricks (GCB).

60|$|The {{cause of}} all which Phænomena I imagine to be no other then this, That the Parts of the Glass being by the {{excessive}} heat of the fire kept off and separated one from another, and thereby put {{into a kind of}} sluggish fluid consistence, are suffered to drop off with that heat or agitation remaining in them, into cold Water; by which means the outsides of the drop are presently cool'd and crusted, and are thereby made of a loose texture, because the parts of it have not time to settle themselves leisurely together, and so to lie very close together: And the innermost parts of the drop, retaining still much of their former heat and agitations, remain of a loose texture also, and, according as the cold strikes inwards from the bottom and sides, are quenched, as it were, and made rigid in that very posture wherein the cold finds them. For the parts of the crust being already hardened, will not suffer the parts to shrink any more from the outward Surface inward; and though it shrink a little by reason of the small parcels of some Aerial substances dispersed through the matter of the Glass, yet that is not neer so much as it appears (as I just now hinted;) nor if it were, would it be sufficient for to consolidate and condense the body of Glass into a tuff and <b>close</b> <b>texture,</b> after it had been so excessively rarified by the heat of the glass-Furnace.|$|E

We would also recommend the nettle, which, in our opinion, might be made an advantageous substitute for spinach; indeed more than once we proved this by our own experience. The nettle should be gathered quite young, when the leaves are perfectly tender. The plant should be pulled up whole, with {{a portion of the}} root. In order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues from the points, you should wrap them in linen of <b>close</b> <b>texture.</b> When once the nettle is boiled, it is perfectly innocuous; and this vegetable, so rough in its exterior, becomes a very delicate dish. We were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month. Then the little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny, and the stems themselves grew as hard as wood while the nettle, armed with a long white beard, p 203 presented only a menacing and awful aspect." [...] The roots of many kinds of ferns, perhaps of all of them, are edible. Our poor in England will eat neither fern nor nettle: they say the first is innutritious, and the second acrid. I like them both.|$|E

60|$|The {{second part}} of M. Lefebure's book {{is devoted to the}} history of lace, and though some may not find it quite as {{interesting}} as the earlier portion it will more than repay perusal; and those who still work in this delicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it, as well as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs. Compared to embroidery, lace seems comparatively modern. M. Lefebure and Mr. Alan Cole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to prove the existence of lace before the fifteenth century. Of course in the East, light tissues, such as gauzes, muslins, and nets, were made at very early times, and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner of subsequent laces, and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery, or varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads. The threads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted together, and the borders of one of the many fashions of Roman toga were of open reticulated weaving. The Egyptian Museum at the Louvre has a curious network embellished with glass beads; and the monk Reginald, who took part in opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham in the twelfth century, writes that the Saint's shroud had a fringe of linen threads an inch long, surmounted by a border, 'worked upon the threads,' with representations of birds and pairs of beasts, there being between each such pair a branching tree, a survival of the palm of Zoroaster, to which I have before alluded. Our authors, however, do not in these examples recognise lace, the production of which involves more refined and artistic methods, and postulates a combination of skill and varied execution carried to a higher degree of perfection. Lace, as we know it, seems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen. White embroidery on linen has, M. Lefebure remarks, a cold and monotonous aspect; that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect, but is apt to fade in frequent washing; but white embroidery relieved by open spaces in, or shapes cut from, the linen ground, is possessed of an entirely new charm; and from a sense of this the birth may be traced of an art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected between ornamental details of <b>close</b> <b>texture</b> and others of open-work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{turning on the}} {{gradients}} of micro-texture and grain size of Al alloy 7075 processed by turning is studied. Analytical models based on Boussinesq equation and stress/force transformation, predict that the equivalent von-Mises stress penetrate almost 1 mm below the machined surface with a maximum of 1400 MPa. The induced temperature below the surface is and reaches up to 240 °C. As a result of deformation below the machined surface, the grains below the surface show a preferred grain shape orientation different from the grains in the central region. The normalized population of (121) plane increases at the machined surface compared to {{the central part of}} the sample. Orientation distribution functions reveal that at {{the central part of the}} sample, the material is mostly randomly oriented and the <b>closest</b> <b>texture</b> component is the recrystallized texture. On the other hand, the strongest texture attribute at the machined surface is β-fiber torsion. The average grain size shows a 10 % decreases moving away from center while below the machined surface there is a 50 % increase in the average grain size. This can be due to the grain growth caused by higher temperatures right below the machining tool. The reported results provide a toolset to determine the final properties of the material after machining in addition to providing means to more accurately describing the machining mechanics...|$|R

The wild, sky-breaking humour of America has its fine qualities, but it must {{in the nature of}} things be {{deficient}} in two qualities, not only of supreme importance to life and letters, but of supreme importance to humour--reverence and sympathy. And these two qualities were knit into the <b>closest</b> <b>texture</b> of Bret Harte's humour. Everyone who has read and enjoyed Mark Twain as he ought to be read and enjoyed will remember a very funny and irreverent story about an organist who was asked to play appropriate music to an address upon the parable of the Prodigal Son, and who proceeded to play with great spirit, [...] "We'll all get blind drunk, when Johnny comes marching home." [...] The best way of distinguishing Bret Harte from the rest of American humour is to say that if Bret Harte had described that scene, it would in some subtle way have combined a sense of the absurdity of the incident with some sense of the sublimity and pathos of the theme. You would have felt that the organist's tune was funny, but not that the Prodigal Son was funny. But America is under a kind of despotism of humour. Everyone is afraid of humour: the meanest of human nightmares. Bret Harte had, to express the matter briefly but more or less essentially, the power of laughing not only at things, but also with them. America has laughed at things magnificently, with Gargantuan reverberations of laughter. But she has not even begun to learn the richer lesson of laughing with them.|$|R
40|$|The {{texture and}} {{microstructure}} of white-brined cheeses similar to urfa (a traditional Turkish cheese) were studied.

Overall, scalding resulted in a more homogeneous structure, but the unscalded UF cheese had a <b>close</b> <b>texture</b> that resembled the scalded samples.

The {{results showed that the}} formation of different hydrated phases was temperature dependence. The physico-mechanical and microstructural characteristics were investigated after curing at 20, 40 and 60 ° C. The results indicated that for the substitution of calcium aluminate cement (CAC) by air-cooled slag (AS) or water-cooled slag (WS) at 20 ° C, the compressive strength increases with slag content up to 10 wt. %, then followed by a decrease with further slag substitution up to 25 wt. %; but the values are still higher than those of the neat CAC pastes at different curing ages up to 60 days. After 28 days of hydration at 40 - 60 ° C, the compressive strength increases with the slag content. This is attributed to the prevention of the conversion reaction, which was confirmed by XRD, DSC and SEM techniques, and the preferential formation of stratlingite (gehleinte-like) phase.

30|$|SC {{method is}} based on the graph theory and is {{insensitive}} to the structure of data. Many traditional clustering problems have been solved by it. Recently, SC method has successfully been implemented in many fields such as information searching [15], bioinformatics [16], and image segmentation [5, 17 – 20]. In the process of using SC method for image segmentation, the pairwise similarities of all pixels in the image are needed to be computed and the computational cost is huge which restricts the method's application. To solve this problem, Fowlkes et al. [21] proposed an approach based on a classical method for the integral eigenvalue problem known as the Nystrom method. The approach worked by first solving the grouping problem for a small random subset of pixels and then extrapolating this solution to the full set of pixels in the image. The article [5] used watershed algorithm to over segment the input image firstly, then SC method was used for clustering. This method performed well in some cases, but the watershed algorithm was sensitive to noise and <b>close</b> <b>texture</b> and produced a large number of small but quasi-homogenous regions which might lead to performance degradation in the consequent region grouping. The article [22] used mean shift algorithm to segment the input color image firstly, then Ncut was applied to perform the final segmentation. SC method makes use of the mathematics tool spectral-graph-theory commendably and its result is very close to global optimum. It has its own advantages compared to another graph-based method named graph-cuts. Boykov and Kolmogrov [23] borrowed algorithms for network flows to search the minimum cut of graph-cuts problem. It performed well on two-class segmentation but did not work on multi-class segmentation. Although they had proposed alpha-expansion method and alpha-beta-swap method [24] for multi-class problems based on graph-cuts framework, these two methods could approach to a good result but were inefficient when classification number was large which led to much iterative computation.|$|E

Tumor 38, occurring in the subcutaneous tissue of the groin, was a solid, spindle-celled sarcoma of rather <b>close</b> <b>texture,</b> with few blood vessels. Here and there were small areas of softening, and at its center was a large degeneration cyst with ragged walls, containing a clear fluid. There were no metastases. The transplantation tumors from both growths have been characterized by slow growth, tendency to metastasize to the skeletal muscles without involvement of the lungs, and a structure which at one time is that of a very regular spindle-celled sarcoma containing many bands and ribbons of collagen, and at another that of a sarcoma rifted with blood sinuses like the spontaneous tumor No. 18. At present the two strains are practically indistinguishable in appearance and general behavior. Both are caused by filterable agents. The agent causing No. 38, unlike that causing No. 18, retains its activity in tumor tissue which has been dried or glycerinated; and in a Berkefeld filtrate it is much the more active in causing tumors. These differences can hardly be thought of as constituting a fundamental distinction between agents which, to judge from their effects, are almost undoubtedly different strains of a single disease cause. That chicken tumors of markedly different type have different filterable agents as their cause has been proved by experiments already reported. The present findings make it probable that, within certain limits, tumors of rather various character may be dependent upon a single agent. This assumption greatly simplifies the etiological problem.
