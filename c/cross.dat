5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a <b>cross</b> behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The <b>cross</b> of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, {{also known as a}} Latin <b>cross.</b> A patriarch uses the patriarchal <b>cross</b> with two traverses, also called the <b>cross</b> of Lorraine. The papal <b>cross</b> has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} was {{the highest}} award in the military of the Third Reich. Recipients are grouped by grades of the Knight's <b>Cross.</b> During or shortly after World War II, 145 German sailors and officers of the U-boat service {{as part of the}} Kriegsmarine received the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross.</b> Among them, 29 officers received the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), five the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern), and two won the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). Of these, 144 presentations were formally made and one recipient received the award after 11 May 1945, when Großadmiral Karl Dönitz ordered a cease of all promotions and illegalized all subsequent awards. The final recipient is therefore considered to have received the medal without legal authority.|$|E

5|$|The Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments.

5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a <b>Cross</b> of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This <b>cross</b> was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic <b>cross.</b> The <b>cross</b> is normally a freestanding four-point limestone Latin <b>cross,</b> mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded {{on the face of}} the <b>cross.</b> This <b>cross</b> represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, the <b>cross</b> {{was originally}} {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the <b>cross</b> was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The <b>cross</b> was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the <b>cross</b> to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the <b>cross</b> to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an optimisation procedure {{for improvement of}} <b>crossing</b> performance by adjusting the cro sing (including the wing rail) geometry. The improvement of the <b>crossing</b> performance is achieved by reducing the normal contact pressure and wear index, while shifting {{the location of the}} wheel impact (fatigue area) along the <b>crossing.</b> By shifting the fatigue area the life of the <b>crossing</b> can be prolonged. To demonstrate the proposed procedure the geometry of a <b>crossing</b> (<b>crossing</b> angle 1 : 15) has been optimised. The effect of two typical wheel profiles used on the considered <b>crossing</b> is taken in to account during the optimisation. The robustness of the obtained geometries has been verified using the numerical simulations with track geometrical irregularities. Using the optimisation procedure two improved geometries of the <b>crossing</b> have been obtained. In both designs the normal contact pressure was reduced as compared to the reference design, while the fatigue area in the second <b>crossing</b> was shifted further from the tip point of the <b>crossing</b> as compared to the first <b>crossing.</b> Important is that the second <b>crossing</b> geometry can be obtained from the first <b>crossing</b> simply by grinding. To implement the new <b>crossing</b> geometry a new measurement device has been proposed. The device can be used for assessment of wear of existing crossings and during adjusting/restoration of the <b>crossing</b> geometry. Accepted Author ManuscriptRailway Engineerin...|$|R
