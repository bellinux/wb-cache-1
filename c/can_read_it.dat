25|$|The {{main issue}} of gender {{equality}} in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can {{read and write}} and only 32.5% of females can read and write. This shows {{that more than half}} of men can read, and less than half of women <b>can</b> <b>read.</b> <b>It</b> also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa.|$|E

Superintendent of Schools of Cebu (1993), in which the issue was whether the petitioners, who were Jehovah's Witnesses, ought to be expelled from schools for refusing to salute the flag, sing the national anthem and recite the oath of allegiance as required by the Republic Act No. 1265 of 11 July 1955 and other legislation. Cruz J. held that the state could not interpret the Bible for the petitioners as [...] "only they <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> as they see fit.

2500|$|The {{end of the}} Commune {{left the}} city's {{population}} deeply divided. Gustave Flaubert described {{the atmosphere in the}} city in early June 1871: [...] "One half of the population of Paris wants to strangle the other half, and the other half has the same idea; you <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the eyes of people passing by." [...] This sentiment soon became secondary to the need to reconstruct the buildings that had been destroyed in {{the last days of the}} Commune. The Communards had burned the Hôtel de Ville (including all the city archives), the Tuileries Palace, the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture of Police, the Ministry of Finances, the Cour des Comptes, the State Council building at the Palais-Royal, and many others. Several streets, particularly the Rue de Rivoli, had also been badly damaged by the fighting. [...] Besides the cost of reconstruction, the new government was obliged to pay an indemnity of 210 million francs in gold to the victorious German Empire as reparations for the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870. On 4 August 1871, at the first meeting of the city council after the Commune, the new Prefect of the Seine, Léon Say, put forward a plan to borrow 350 million francs for reconstruction and indemnity payments. The city's bankers and businessmen quickly raised the money, and the reconstruction was soon underway.|$|E
2500|$|In Season 3, {{the crash}} {{survivors}} {{learn more about}} the Others and their long history on the mysterious island, along with the fate of the Dharma Initiative. The leader of the Others, Benjamin Linus, is introduced as well and defections from both sides pave the way for conflict between the two. Time travel elements also begin to appear in the series, as Desmond is forced to turn the fail-safe key in the hatch to stop the electromagnetic event, and this sends his mind eight years to the past. When he returns to the present, he is able to see the future. Kate and Sawyer escape the Others, while Jack stays after Ben promises that Jack will be able to leave the island in a submarine if he operates on Ben, who has cancer. Jack does, but the submarine is destroyed by John. Jack is left behind with Juliet, an Other, who also seeks to leave the island, while John joins the Others. A helicopter carrying Naomi crashes near the island. Naomi says her freighter, Kahana, is near and was sent by Penelope Widmore, Desmond's ex-girlfriend. Desmond has a vision in which Charlie will drown after shutting down a signal that prevents communication with the exterior world. His vision comes true, but Charlie speaks with Penelope, who says she does not know any Naomi. Before drowning, Charlie writes on his hand [...] "Not Penny's Boat" [...] so Desmond <b>can</b> <b>read</b> <b>it.</b> Meanwhile, the survivors make contact with a rescue team aboard the freighter. In the season's finale, apparent flashbacks show a depressed Jack going to an unknown person's funeral. In the final scene, these are revealed to be [...] "flash forwards", and Kate and Jack are revealed to have escaped the island. Jack, however, is desperate to go back.|$|E
