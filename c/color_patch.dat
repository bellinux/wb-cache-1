A pair of cloth rank insignia (light yellow on olive drab for army, light yellow on medium blue for air force, and light yellow on navy blue for navy) with velcro is worn on the collars. The service branch cloth badge (military commission headquarters, army, air force, navy and Second Artillery Corps) is worn above the right chest pocket.

5000|$|The {{exhibition}} “Want of Matter” {{presented the}} group of “Tel Aviv Artists” {{as the center of}} contemporary Israel art. In addition to representing the Socialistic-Pioneering spirit, these artists represented the secular character of Tel Aviv, under the banner of “the aesthetic, non-materialistic aspect of the Jewish tradition.” The group strengthened its sense of its own identity by forming a network of personal and professional connections among themselves. In the article, “About Raffi: <b>Color</b> <b>patch,</b> Crown. Catchup, Love” (1999), Yair Garbuz, Lavie’s student, presented his teacher in terms of his originality. “It’s not that we suddenly became the center of art… we’ve remained the provinces ... In a certainly respect, Raffi painted and taught like a pioneer. In order for something to flourish here, it had to be carefully disguised. You couldn’t just say that maybe modernism was developing.” The period before the existence of “Want of Matter” was perceived by this group of artists as a mixture of immature explorations of abstract modernism with overtones of the romantic aesthetic, overtones which Lavie and his followers viewed as a danger capable of reducing art to something lacking in the characteristics and criteria of aesthetic judgment.|$|E

Using a novel image analysis method with a <b>color</b> <b>patch,</b> skin defects were calculated more accurately (range of error rate: - 3. 39 % ~ + 3. 05 %). All patients had smaller scar size than the original defect size after SIH treatment (rates of decrease: 18. 8 % ~ 86. 1 %), and facial area showed significantly higher decrease rate compared with the non-facial area such as scalp and extremities (67. 05 ± 12. 48 vs. 53. 29 ± 18. 11, P < 0. 05). From the result of estimating the date corresponding to the half of the final decrement, all of the facial area showed improvements within two weeks (8. 45 ± 3. 91), and non-facial area needed 14. 33 ± 9. 78 days.

40|$|Training {{attention}} 2 Three {{experiments are}} reported in which we investigate whether the recently reported interactions between central cues (e. g., arrows) and reflexive attention are attributable to the overlearned spatial properties of certain central cues. In all three experiments, a nonpredictive cue with arbitrary spatial properties (a <b>color</b> <b>patch)</b> is presented prior to a detection target in {{the left or right}} visual field. Reaction times to detect targets are compared before and after a training session in which participants are trained to associate each <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> with left and right space, either via a target detection task in which color predicts target location 100 % of the time (Experiments 1 and 3), or via a left/right motor movement as a function of color (Experiments 2 and 3). In the first two experiments, a small but highly significant training effect is observed. Participants are approximately 10 ms faster to detect targets at congruent locations relative to incongruent locations post-training relative to pre-training, despite the fact that cue color was nonpredictive during the test sessions. In Experiment 3, the length of the training session is increased and the magnitude of the training effect also increases as a result. Implications for th...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to develop a}} two-dimensional specular image capture system to quantify print microgloss uniformity for correlation of subjective scores and objective results. Large fov (field of view), on-axis reflection and small fov, off-axis reflection imaging systems were used in analyzing a printed test pattern consisting of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, Red, Green, Blue and Process Black Patches. These test patterns have been rated for microgloss uniformity. Defects affecting the microgloss uniformity include streaks, graininess and mottle. Polarizers and image subtraction techniques were used to minimize the diffuse signal within the images to be analyzed. The small fov, off-axis images were analyzed for standard deviation of the pixel values within the <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> and maximum and average standard deviation within the print (seven patches). The large fov, on-axis images were analyzed for graininess of the <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> and maximum and average graininess within the print (seven patches). Color dependency was also investigated for both systems. Standard deviation in the small fov system did not correlate well with the microgloss uniformity scores. A statistically significant correlation was found in the large fov system between maximum and average graininess and microgloss uniformity scores. The red, yellow and green color patches had the most statistically significant signals with R 2 values of 0. 98, 0. 97 and 0. 90 respectively (logarithmic fit) and black the lowest a...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and empirical studies confirm that male mate choice and/or female [...] female mate competition can be expressed {{in the absence of}} sex-role reversal. Such reproductive patterns may select for the evolution of female traits that indicate female phenotypic or genotypic quality among non [...] role-reversed species. Although attention to the evolution and function of female ornaments is increasing, additional focus is needed on female-specific ornaments (those not expressed in conspecific males) and on nonavian systems in order to gain a broad understanding of how selection acts directly on ornamentation of female animals. In the striped plateau lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, only females develop orange throat patches during the reproductive season. The color peaks in expression near the time of ovulation and appears to stimulate male courtship. Here, I examine whether this female-specific ornament can be used by males to reliably assess female phenotypic quality. Using multivariate regression analyses, I show that the area of the orange <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> predicts body condition and mite load, the chroma (i. e., saturation) of the <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> predicts body size, and both patch area and chroma reliably predict average egg mass. Thus, female reproductive color may function as a condition-dependent signal, indicating phenotypic quality to potential mates.

40|$|One of latest {{developments}} for pre-press applications {{is the concept}} of soft proofing, which aims to provide an accurate preview on a monitor of how the final document will appear once it is printed. At the core of this concept is the problem of identifying, for any printed color, the most similar color the monitor can display. This problem is made difficult by such factors as varying viewing conditions, color gamut limitations, or the less studied color memory shift. Color matching experiments are usually done by examining samples viewed simultaneously. However, in soft proofing applications, the proof and the print are not always viewed together. This paper attempts to shed more light on the difference between simultaneous and time-spaced color matching, in order to contribute to improving the accuracy of soft proofs. A color matching experiment setup has been established in which observers were asked to match a <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> displayed on a LCD monitor, by adjusting its RGB values, to another <b>color</b> <b>patch</b> printed out on paper. In {{the first part of the}} experiment the two colors were viewed simultaneously. In the second part, the observers were asked to produce the match according to a previously memorized color. According to the obtained results, the color appearance attributes lightness and chroma were the most difficult components for the observers to remember, generating huge differences with the simultaneous match, whereas hue was the component which varied the least. This indicates that for soft proofing, getting the hues right is of primordial importance...|$|E
