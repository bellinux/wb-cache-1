25|$|The {{telescope}} became operational in October 1957, {{which was}} just before the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite.

Jodrell Bank continued tracking new artificial satellites in the following years, and also doubled up as a long range ballistic missile radar system, a beneficial trait which helped the telescope gain funding from the British government. The Jodrell Bank Observatory is currently operated by the University of Manchester and was nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Status in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{addition}} of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) fly-by-wire flight control system, which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system. Together with the aircraft's overall high thrust-to-weight ratio and the engine's full authority digital engine control feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems rendered the aircraft extremely manoeuvrable at high angles of attack and low speeds. The aircraft's weapons-control system had also been improved, as it included the N011M Bars (literally [...] "Panther") pulse-Doppler phased-array radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracking</b> twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously. The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.|$|E

Foremost was its size, which would limit it to larger ships, while they were more interested in a system that could be used on {{a large portion of the}} fleet.They also found it to be sensitive to changes in temperature, lacking precision, and given its large number of moving parts, difficult to maintain. A final problem was that they desired a system <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracking</b> hundreds of objects and adding the additional channels to the CDS would be expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Mars – the Martian {{atmosphere}} contains 10 nmol/mol methane. The {{source of}} methane on Mars {{has not been}} determined. Recent research suggests that methane may come from volcanoes, fault lines, or methanogens, {{that it may be}} a byproduct of electrical discharges from dust devils and dust storms, or that it {{may be the result of}} UV radiation. In January 2009, NASA scientists announced that they had discovered that the planet often vents methane into the atmosphere in specific areas, leading some to speculate this may be a sign of biological activity below the surface. Studies of a Weather Research and Forecasting model for Mars (MarsWRF) and related Mars general circulation model (MGCM) suggests that methane plume sources may be located within tens of kilometers, which is within the roving capabilities of future Mars rovers. The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in August 2012, can distinguish between different isotopologues of methane; but even if the mission determines that microscopic Martian life is the source of the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, beyond the rover's reach. Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument is <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracking</b> the presence of methane over time to determine whether it is constant, variable, seasonal, or random, providing further clues about its source. The first measurements with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) indicated that there is less than 5 ppb of methane at the landing site. [...] The Mars Trace Gas Mission orbiter planned for launch in 2016 would further study Mars' methane and its decomposition products such as formaldehyde and methanol. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization. [...] On July 19, 2013, NASA scientists reported finding [...] "not much methane" [...] (i.e., [...] "an upper limit of 2.7 parts per billion of methane") around the Gale Crater where the Curiosity rover landed in August 2012. and H2O of the Martian Atmosphere| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6143| pages = 260–3| year = 2013| last1 = Webster | first1 = C.

On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a [...] "tenfold spike", likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Sample measurements taken [...] "a dozen times over 20 months" [...] showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging [...] "7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere." [...] Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level.|$|E
