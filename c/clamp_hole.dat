50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a <b>clamping</b> <b>hole,</b> each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|R
50|$|Some tank-on-carriage {{printers}} such as Epson use a fold-over {{clamping system}} over the tank to secure {{it in place}} on the print carriage. This clamp blocks the path of tubing from a continuous flow system feeding the tanks, and the print carriage {{may need to be}} modified by removing the <b>clamp,</b> cutting <b>holes</b> in the <b>clamp,</b> or installing a retrofit open-top clamp.|$|R
40|$|Platonic {{crystals}} (PCs) are {{the elastic}} plate analogue of the photonic crystals {{widely used in}} optics, and are thin structured elastic plates along which flexural waves cannot propagate within certain stop band frequency intervals. The practical importance of PCs is twofold: these can be used either {{in the design of}} microstructured acoustic metamaterials or as an approximate model for surface elastic waves propagating in meter scale seismic metamaterials. Here, we make use of the band spectrum of PCs created with very small <b>clamped</b> <b>holes,</b> the nails of the title, to achieve surface wave reflectors at very large wavelengths, a flat lens, an endoscope, a directive antenna near stop band frequencies and cloaking from Dirac cones. The point pinned, Faqir, plate is particularly appealing as there is an exact dispersion relation available so the origin of these phenomena can be explained and interpreted using Fourier series and high frequency homogenization.

40|$|The prokaryotic DNA {{polymerase}} III beta homodimeric clamp {{links the}} replication complex to DNA during polynucleotide synthesis. This clamp is loaded onto DNA and unloaded by the clamp loader complex, the delta subunit of which by itself {{can bind to}} and open the clamp. beta Clamps from diverse bacteria were examined using contrast hierarchical alignment and interaction network (CHAIN) analysis, a statistical approach that categorizes and measures the evolutionary constraints imposed on protein sequences by natural selection. Some constraints are subtle inasmuch as they are unique to certain bacteria. Examination of corresponding molecular interactions within structures of the Escherichia coli beta dimeric and delta-beta complexes reveals that N 320, Y 323 and R 176, which are subject to very strong constraints, form a substructure that {{may serve as a}} platform for leveraging and directing delta-induced conformational changes. N 320 may play a prominent role, as it is strategically situated between this substructure and regions linked to delta binding and opening of beta's dimeric interface. R 176 appears to act as a relay between the delta binding site and the <b>clamp's</b> central <b>hole.</b> Other residues subject to strong constraints are likewise associated with structurally important features. For example, two pairs of interacting residues, R 269 /E 304 and K 74 /E 300, form salt bridges at the dimeric interface, while the C-terminal residues M 362, P 363, M 364 and R 365 appear to play key roles in delta binding. Q 149 and K 198 appear to sense DNA within the <b>clamp's</b> central <b>hole</b> while other residues may relay this information to the delta binding site.

5000|$|Hannay, who in 1851 saw and {{measured}} the bridge, wrote as follows: From the great care {{taken in the}} chiselling, squaring and fitting up of the component parts of the whole, {{as well as the}} great size and weight, the work is one of great strength and solidity. And this accounts for the good state of preservation in which it find it in the present day; for {{with the exception of the}} masonry of the abutment at each end, in which large trees have taken root and displaced the stones, the rest of the structure may be said to be entire. From a fracture in one of the pillars I observed that. the upper blocks were kept in their places by means of iron pins firmly wedged into the lower ones; four apparently through the centre and one on each side of the square of the shaft, and although not visible, other portions of the work may be iron-clamped the slabs of the platform were marked with <b>clamping</b> <b>holes</b> and on the edge of the outside slabs are three square holes (3 inches square) which were no doubt intended for the wooden supports of a balustrade. Several frieze-carved blocks are also lying near the end abutment from which I imagine the entrance of each may have been ornamented or these may have been gateways."

50|$|Wires must be {{protected}} from sharp metal edges of cut conduits or cabinet holes. The NEC specifies measures to protect wire insulation from damage by these edges during installation and use. For example, insulated cables may not be inserted directly through knockouts, due to the sharp edge around nearly all knockout <b>holes.</b> <b>Clamping</b> and other wire protection is often not required for plastic conduit parts, as plastic {{is not likely to}} damage insulation in contact with it.|$|R
30|$|Traditionally, Hough {{transform}} [3, 43] is {{very successful}} in demarcating well-defined shapes. Martins et al. [43] used Hough transform to detect three geometrically well-defined shapes: welding, <b>clamp</b> and identification <b>hole</b> in cold-rolled strips. After homographic filtering to remove illumination variation, Gaussian and morphological filters were applied to reduce noise. Segmentation was realised by applying edge detection method and thresholding. Hough transform {{was performed on the}} binary image for line and circle detection. Three types of defects- welding (diagonal line), clamp (multiple lines in down-web direction) and identification hole (circle with fixed radius {{in the middle of the}} strip)- were identified.|$|R
40|$|Objavljuje se nadgrobni spomenik desetogodišnjega Aurelija Januarina, sina vojničkoga tribuna legije II Adiutrix Aurelija Januarija. Epitaf toga spomenika poznat je od 1880. i često je spomenut u literaturi u vojničkom kontekstu povezanom s navedenom legijom, ali dosad nije doveden u vezu s nadgrobnim kamenom koji se čuva u Arheološkom muzeju u Zagrebu. U ovome radu spomenik se analizira u svom ukupnom povijesnom i arheološkom kontekstu i datira u zadnju trećinu 3. stoljeća. Usto, raspravlja se o naravi vojničkoga utvrđenja u Dobrincima i njegovoj vezi s legijom II Adiutrix. In {{this paper}} a marble funerary stone {{from the site}} of Dobrinci (Caput Bassianense) near Ruma (Bassianae, Serbia) is {{discussed}} extensively for the first time (fig. 2). It was put up by the military tribune of Legio II Adiutrix Aurelius Ianuarius and his wife Aurelia Valeria for their 10 -year-old son Aurelius Ianuarinus and for themselves (CIL 3, 10208). Although the monument has been kept in the AMZ from 1915, this knowledge has subsequently faded, so the author of this contribution mentioned it recently in two different papers as stemming from northern Croatia. This mistake is corrected in the present paper within a full discussion of the whole of the monument. Otherwise, its epitaph (fig. 3) has been known from 1880 and discussed many times in various contexts of the military history of south-eastern Pannonia, but the knowledge that the monument was kept in the AMZ and that its relief was also accessible for an analysis seems to have escaped the commentators. Before tackling the stone, the paper addresses the issue of the nature of its findspot – the surroundings of the military camp at Dobrinci. Its surface (18. 25 ha), as well as the findingss of bricks with legion stamps, suggest that it was built by the Second Assistant Legion, although not as it own camp but for a considerable military corpus made of various units, whose presence was necessary from the 1 st to the 4 th centuries in the much endangered rear of the Danube limes in south-eastern Pannonia. The funerary stone of the Aurelii family is not a stele but a built-in grave relief from an aedicule, as is suggested by five <b>clamp</b> <b>holes</b> on its back side (fig. 4). The relief niche contains the portraits of the son in the middle and his parents at the sides behind him. In spite of a quite incompetent and stiff execution and much damage to the faces, the portrait characteristics and coiffures of all three figures can be connected with imperial portraiture and thus dated to the last third of the 3 rd century AD...|$|R
50|$|Rope-tension is {{the oldest}} system for {{applying}} tension to drum heads and was common until the late 19th Century.A long rope (or less commonly, a series of ropes) is passed alternately between {{the top and bottom}} drum head hoops that are held to the shell by <b>clamps</b> which incorporate <b>holes</b> for the rope(s). The ropes are tightened by sewn-together loops, usually of leather, which are slid downward to tighten the drum heads and which remain in position by surface tension against the rope.The drum heads thus tightened are not as tense as with the more modern single-tension or double-tension systems, but offer a historically deep tone in keeping with the heritage of certain music, such as pipe-and-drum corps, fife-and-drum corps, or bands of the Civil War era.|$|R

50|$|Diamond stones can {{be useful}} in the {{sharpening}} process. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance known and as such can be used to sharpen almost any material. (Coarse diamond sharpening stones can be used for flattening waterstones.) Alternatively, tungsten carbide blades can be used in knife sharpening. Clamp-style sharpening tools use a <b>clamp</b> with several <b>holes</b> with predefined angles. The stone is mounted on a rod and is pulled through these holes, so that the angle remains consistent. Another system is the crock stick setup, where two sticks are put into a plastic or wooden base to form a V shape. When the knife is pulled up the V, the angle is held so long as the blade is held perpendicular to the base. Several cutlery manufacturers now offer electric knife sharpeners with multiple stages with at least one grinding stage. These electric sharpeners are typically used in the kitchen but have the ability to sharpen blades such as pocket or tactical knives. The main benefit of using an electric sharpener is speed with many models that can complete the sharpening process in one to two minutes. The disadvantage is that the sharpening angle is fixed so some specialized knives, like a Japanese style Santoku, may need additional attention to sharpen to the ideal angle.|$|R
