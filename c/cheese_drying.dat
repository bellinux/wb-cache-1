40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess indices of proteolysis and related enzymatic activities of various cheese varieties produced in Greece. Physicochemical composition, extent of proteolysis (nitrogen fraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) profiles of cheese soluble fraction) and residual chymosin and plasmin activities were analyzed in 57 commercial samples, grouped according to cheesemaking technologies. The mean values of soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen and trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen fraction on total nitrogen did not differ significantly between the different cheese varieties, with mean values of 16. 03 % and 9. 97 %, respectively. Brined cheeses had the highest mean residual chymosin activity 0. 166 International Milk Clotting units (IMCU). g(- 1) of <b>cheese</b> <b>dry</b> matter and the lowest mean plasmin plus plasminogen-derived activity 3. 88 U. g(- 1) of cheese. The respective values for GruySre and hard type cheeses were 0. 029 and 0. 047 IMCU. g(- 1) of <b>cheese</b> <b>dry</b> matter for chymosin and 6. 22 and 6. 94 U. g(- 1) of cheese for plasmin.

40|$|The {{demand for}} specific, value added food {{products}} is constantlyincreasing. In order to prepare such {{products for the}} market {{it is necessary to}} understand consumers’ attitudes and preferences towards food products. <b>Dried</b> <b>cheese,</b> one of the traditional products of wider Zagreb region is produced nowadays exclusively on the family farms without proper control of the used inputs and final product, and without any marketing activities.

In this paper the results of the consumer survey are presented and could be used for the determination of the technological parameters of production and especially for marketing of the cheese and its distribution.

40|$|Benzoic acid (BA) and {{sorbic acid}} (SA) are the {{preservatives}} {{most commonly used}} in food. Although BA and SA are generally safe, some previous {{studies have shown that}} consumption of excessive amounts of these food additives can be a health hazard. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the amounts of BA and SA in processed foods in Korea. Different brands of fruit juice, yogurt, <b>cheese,</b> <b>dried</b> fruits, jam, and margarine were purchased at a local market in Daejeon, Korea. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV detector. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a C 18 column. Methanol‐acetate buffer (pH 4. 4) at a 35 : 65 v/v ratio was used as the initial mobile phase to elute BA and SA. The detector wavelength was set at 254 nm. The average test results observed for BA concentrations in fruit juice, yogurt, <b>cheese,</b> <b>dried</b> fruits, jam, and margarine were 40. 26 ± 0. 02, 2. 07 ± 0. 06, 0. 02 ± 0. 09, 0. 36 ± 08, 265. 30 ± 0. 02, and 27. 34 ± 0. 08 mg/kg, respectively. Average concentrations of SA in these samples were 0. 92 ± 0. 06, 1. 06 ± 0. 07, 7. 30 ± 0. 01, 14. 14 ± 0. 08, 25. 65 ± 0. 06, and 4. 81 ± 0. 07 mg/kg, respectively.

40|$|The {{impact of}} Gram-negative {{bacteria}} on sensory characteristics {{and production of}} volatile compounds as well as biogenic amines (BA) {{in the core of}} an uncooked pressed type model cheese was investigated {{in the presence of a}} defined complex microbial consortium. Eleven strains of Gram-negative bacteria, selected on the basis of their biodiversity and in vitro BA-production ability, were individually tested in a model cheese. Four out of 6 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter freundii UCMA 4217, Klebsiella oxytoca 927, Hafnia alvei B 16 and Proteus vulgaris UCMA 3780) reached counts close to 6 log CFU g(- 1), in the model cheese. In core of cheeses inoculated with Gram-negative bacteria, only slight differences were observed for microbial counts (Enterococcus faecalis or Lactobacillus plantarum count differences below 1 log CFU g(- 1)), acetate concentration (differences below 200 mg kg(- 1)) and texture (greater firmness) in comparison to control cheeses. Cheese core colour, odour and volatile compound composition were not modified.
