30|$|<b>Canopy</b> <b>base</b> height, <b>canopy</b> bulk density, and canopy {{fuel loading}} were {{calculated}} using Canopy Fuels Inventory Processor (CFIP) (Larry Wilson; Larkspur, California; unpublished report). The CFIP is a vegetation simulation program {{largely based on}} the algorithms used in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (Crookston and Stage 1991) and the Fire and Fuels Extension (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). The processor incorporates a post-treatment reduction in canopy bulk density and <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height for hardwoods and select conifers in California. To represent changes in canopy bulk density and <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height post-treatment, the fraction of crown length removed was multiplied by the average crown mass (Noonan-Wright et al. 2006). This reduced crown mass value was then applied to the vertical distribution for calculations of <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height and <b>canopy</b> bulk density for each plot. Otherwise, for hardwoods such as black oak, and conifers such as red fir and white fir, measured changes in individual tree crown base height {{would have resulted in}} higher values of crown bulk density, post-treatment. Surface and ground fuel loads were calculated using Brown et al. (1984) with coefficients specific to California tree species (van Wagtendonk et al. 1996).|$|R
30|$|Pre- and {{post-treatment}} shrub {{and herb}} data were exported to FUELCALC (Scott and Lansing 2001).

40|$|Abstract. In {{the solar}} {{photosphere}} {{the magnetic field}} of magnetic elements and sunspots is known to expand with height. In the case of sunspots this expansion {{is known to be}} very rapid, with the field forming an almost horizontal canopy. In this contribution we present new results on the superpenumbral <b>canopy</b> of sunspots <b>based</b> on fits to Stokes I and V profiles of infrared spectral lines. The new models take pressure balance across the boundary of the canopy field into account, which leads to significantly lower <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> heights than previously determined from similar data. Due to the lower <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height, the density above the <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> is larger, so that estimates of the mass transported by the Evershed effect in the canopy need to be revised upwards: approximately 15 – 50 % of the mass flowing through the penumbra travels beyond the sunspot boundary above the <b>canopy</b> <b>base.</b> A comparison with small flux tubes leads to the surprising result that although the two types of features have magnetic fluxes that differ by 5 – 6 orders of magnitude, their relative rate of expansion with height is very similar, suggesting that at least in this respect sunspots can be described by the thin-tube approximation. The remaining small differences between the relative expansion of the two types of flux tubes is qualitatively compatible with the presence of magnetic flux that returns into the solar interior at the spot boundary, as has been proposed by Westendorp Plaza et al. (1997) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) Project is mapping {{wildland}} fuels, vegetation, {{and fire}} regime characteristics across the United States. The LANDFIRE project is unique {{because of its}} national scope, creating an integrated product suite at 30 -m spatial resolution and complete spatial coverage of all lands within the 50 states. Here we describe development of the LANDFIRE wildland fuels data layers for the conterminous 48 states: surface fire behavior fuel models, canopy bulk density, <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height, <b>canopy</b> cover, and canopy height. Surface fire behavior fuel models are mapped by developing crosswalks to vegetation structure and composition created by LANDFIRE. Canopy fuels are mapped using regression trees relating field-referenced estimates of <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height and <b>canopy</b> bulk density to satellite imagery, biophysical gradients and vegetation structure and composition data.

30|$|A {{standard}} 2 -way {{analysis of}} variance (ANOVA) design was applied to pre-treatment vegetation and fuel data, with thin and burn as factors (although treatment had not yet occurred). Treatment effects (pre-treatment minus post-treatment) were analyzed using different techniques for vegetation and fuel characteristics. Those vegetation variables where slightly different methods were employed in the pre- and post-treatment vegetation sampling (herb biomass, shrub biomass, <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height, <b>canopy</b> bulk density, and basal area) were analyzed with a 2 -way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the pre-treatment value used as the covariate. Differences in canopy cover and all fuel characteristics were analyzed using a 2 -way ANOVA. All analyses met normality assumptions as analyzed by rankit plots of standardized residuals. Although ANOVA is relatively robust against heterogeneity of variance, it was analyzed for each variable by comparing the standardized residuals with fitted values, and where needed, a transformation to natural logarithm or square root was attempted. For pre-treatment variables, herb biomass, 1 -hr timelag, and 1000 +-hr rotten were identified as needing a transformation, but transformations did not help. For differences due to treatment, herb biomass, <b>canopy</b> <b>base</b> height, and forest floor biomass were identified as needing a transformation, and transformations were not useful in correcting the problem. The results for those variables, if significant, should be interpreted cautiously.|$|R
