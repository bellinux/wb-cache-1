5|$|The Svatantra-tantra {{mentions}} that Matanga practised austerities {{for thousands of}} years to gain the power to subdue all beings. Finally, goddess Tripura Sundari appeared and from eyes emitted rays that produced goddess Kali, who had greenish <b>complexion</b> and was known as Raja-matangini. With her help, Matanga fulfilled his desire. Many texts including the Shyamaladandakam describe Matangi as the daughter of the sage Matanga.|$|E
5|$|The green <b>complexion</b> is {{associated}} with deep knowledge and is also the colour of Budha, the presiding deity of the planet Mercury who governs intelligence. Matangi is often depicted with a parrot in her hands, representing speech. The veena symbolizes her association with music.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly.

5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his <b>complexion</b> and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, Loving {{returned}} to the Philippines and resumed command of the Philippine Constabulary Band for three years before retiring a second time, moving with his wife, Edith, to Oakland, California. In Oakland, Loving found success in real estate speculation. Because attitudes in Oakland at the time made African American ownership of property in some portions of the city problematic, Loving would dress in a chauffeur's uniform and drive Edith, who had a light <b>complexion</b> and could be mistaken for Caucasian, to view property.|$|E

When he was later presented to King Kamehameha IV as a young child, the king gave him the additional name Piʻehu in respect of his shyness and lighter skin <b>complexion.</b> At court, he was known and referred to by his Hawaiian name Piʻehu.|$|E
40|$|This article explores John Donne’s {{imagery of}} humoral <b>complexions</b> in verse letters to patrons and in sermons. In {{the early modern}} period, the term ‘complexion’ {{referred}} to a person’s unique mixture of humours, the four bodily fluids thought to determine appearance, behaviour, and health. Donne refers to <b>complexions</b> to raise questions of moral responsibility. Whether he seeks a patron’s support or a congregation’s repentance, he reworks humoral theories in elaborate, often playful ways, illustrating the necessity of whichever action he recommends. This article argues that his imagery of <b>complexions</b> warrants close attention, both for its rhetorical innovations and for what it reveals about Donne’s verse letters. By focusing on his <b>complexions</b> trope, we can look past letters’ flattery and recognize the literary trademarks - the imaginative thinking, wordplay, and themes - of Donne’s other texts, and of his sermons, in particular...|$|R

Men use natural-colored lipsticks, lightly applied.|$|R
5|$|Professor Severus Snape, {{who has a}} hooked nose, sallow <b>complexion</b> and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, {{but would}} prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every {{opportunity}} to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.|$|E

Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler <b>complexion</b> {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions {{for violating the}} team's curfew. Maryland took a quick lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the <b>complexion</b> of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game. He {{had been one of the}} suspended players, but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins.|$|E
40|$|This second {{paper in}} a series {{describes}} the relationship between grain growth kinetics and grain boundary <b>complexions</b> in silicadoped alumina. Dense high-purity silica-doped alumina samples were annealed for various times in the temperature range of 13001 and 19001 C and their grain growth behavior was quantified. Four different grain boundary <b>complexions</b> were observed in silica-doped alumina, all of which enhanced the kinetics relative to the intrinsic undoped alumina. These <b>complexions</b> included a thick crystallized film that was likely amorphous at high temperatures, a thin intergranular film, multilayer adsorption, and a type of boundary that showed no observable film by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. A generational change in the population of grains occurred at 15001 C where all of the abnormal grains impinged and reestablished a new normal distribution. At higher temperatures {{a new set of}} abnormal grains containing different <b>complexions</b> formed in the microstructure. The activation energy of the normal and abnormal grains was approximately the same. The effects of varying dopant concentration were analyzed. The results for silica-doped alumina are compared with previous results for calcia-doped alumina in order to draw some generalized conclusions about the effect of <b>complexions</b> on grain growth.

5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{described}} as being as red as the hibiscus flower or as bright as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red or orange in <b>complexion</b> and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or fully clothed.|$|E
5|$|Deivanai is {{generally}} depicted with her husband, particularly in an iconographic form called Senapati. She {{sits on the}} left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left-hand side. Her <b>complexion</b> is yellow; she is often depicted adorned with a crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has two arms. She holds a lotus in her left arm, while his right hand hangs down.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with <b>complexion</b> of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E

40|$|Within each human population, {{skin color}} varies mainly {{by age and}} by sex. These two sources of {{variation}} dominate the range of <b>complexions</b> one sees {{as long as the}} third source, ethnicity, contributes little. This is the situation that once prevailed in most human societies. Relatively pale <b>complexions</b> signified infants or women; red-brown <b>complexions,</b> men. A cult of female whiteness thus developed, especially within a large zone of Eurasia. Today, this mark of femininity is losing its social significance with the growing importance of ethnic differences in skin color and, also, the mounting popularity of tanning among women. These changes are described with respect to France, although many other countries have taken part in them...|$|R
