50|$|Land {{litigation}} {{is the main}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> faced by the judiciary. Justice is dispensed by the District Judge's Court and its subordinate courts. The District Judge is {{the chief of the}} district judiciary. Annada Shankar Ray served as the 32nd District Judge of Mymensingh from 14 January 1946 to 3 October 1946. Courts are situated around the District Collectorate. The head of civil administration, that is, the Deputy Commissioner functions as the District Magistrate, and Magistrate Courts are supervised by him. In 2008, Magistrates Courts were put {{under the control of the}} District Judge. It is amusing to note that government did not want that the judges socialize and thereby get influenced. To limit their movement, they were not provided a motor car although in terms of rank they were no less than the Deputy Magistrate, the top bureaucrat of the district. Even in the 1950s the District Judge would come to the court riding bicycle from his residence which is about 5 kilometers away near the Police Line. It is in the 1980s that the government under president Ershad sanctioned a car for the district judges.|$|E
5000|$|There are no {{de minimis}} {{violations}} of the Constitution [...] - [...] no constitutional harms so slight that the courts are obliged to ignore them. Given the values that the Establishment Clause was meant to serve, however, I believe that government can, in a discrete <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> acknowledge or refer to the divine without offending the Constitution. This category of [...] "ceremonial deism" [...] most clearly encompasses {{such things as the}} national motto ("In God We Trust"), religious references in traditional patriotic songs such as [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", and the words with which the Marshal of this Court opens each of its sessions ("God save the United States and this honorable Court"). These references are not minor trespasses upon the Establishment Clause to which I turn a blind eye. Instead, their history, character, and context prevent them from being constitutional violations at all. &#91;emphasis added, citations omitted&#93;Professor Martha Nussbaum at the University of Chicago Law school stated in 2008 that [...] "'Ceremonial Deism' is an odd name for a ritual affirmation that a Deist would be very reluctant to endorse, since Deists think of God as a rational causal principle but not as a personal judge and father." ...|$|E

The court also found that it [...] "need not decide whether BLAG would have standing to challenge the District Court’s ruling and its affirmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG's own authority." [...] Justice Alito in dissent nevertheless argued that BLAG should have been allowed to defend the statute. He wrote that it was properly authorized to act on behalf of the House and had standing as an aggrieved party once part of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional because [...] "the House of Representatives was a necessary party to DOMA's passage". He concluded: [...] "in the narrow <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in which a court strikes down an Act of Congress and the Executive declines to defend the Act, Congress both has standing to defend the undefended statute and is a proper party to do so." [...] Justice Scalia in his dissent, without addressing the immediate instance of BLAG's standing, wrote that Alito's theory would improperly elevate the role of the courts and substitute lawsuits initiated by Congress or the executive branch for the political process.|$|E

5000|$|Attorney and law {{professor}} Alan Morrison, {{writing for the}} The George Washington Law Review, remarked that: To a non-lawyer trying to decide who should win just on the equity, the Bank’s chances did not look very good, and on April 20, 2016, the Supreme Court ... upheld the constitutionality of § 8772, thereby removing a major barrier to the victims collecting {{at least some of}} their judgments. Those were the atmospherics, but on the legal issues, there was substantial agreement between the two opinions, although in their conclusions they were very far apart. All of the Justices agreed that Congress could pass laws changing the existing law and make those changes generally applicable to pending cases, provided it did so clearly. They also agreed that Congress could not pass a law in a pending case that said something along the lines of, “The Court is directed to enter judgment for the plaintiff,” or that “The plaintiff wins and defendant loses.” To do so would usurp the judicial role and improperly expand that of Congress. Nor could Congress change the law in a way that re-opened a case in which there was a final judgment not subject to further appeal. There was also agreement that Congress could write laws that applied to a limited <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> at least in those cases in which only the Government was adversely affected by the change in the law. The issue here was where § 8772 fell on that spectrum. Morrison expressed [...] "concern ... that what happened here will repeat itself in other circumstances in which the equities are quite different". Although Morrison suggested that an individual aggrieved by such a law could bring a claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he argued that such a claim is unlikely to be successful because the law will likely be upheld when reviewed under the rational basis test. The rational basis test asks [...] "there is some rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the informal sharing {{of information and}} cooperation between police agencies across international borders, {{and how it is}} or should be informed by international human rights law. The author looks at how intelligence-led policing theory has affected transnational policing. A distinction is made between police actions made on domestic soil that have adverse consequences abroad and police actions made on foreign soil that have adverse consequences. The first <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> is firmly within jurisdiction and covered by domestic and international legal obligations. The second <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> introduces the concept of the extraterritorial application of international human rights instruments.

The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that implied contracts linked each of them with the NZRFU.

Here Cooke J said, In cases where an incorporated association {{is alleged to have}} acted against its objects but the plaintiff cannot show a contract, we think that all the circumstances have to be considered - case by <b>case</b> or <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> by <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> - in order to determine as a question of mixed law and fact whether or not he or she has sufficient standing.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of unjust enrichment {{is susceptible to}} varying interpretations, which reflect importantly different conceptions of how courts should decide cases and develop law. The consequences of different possible interpretations of the unjust enrichment principle are nicely illustrated {{by a group of}} cases involving restitution claims between former cohabitants.

In recognizing these claims, the Restatement adopts an “equitable” interpretation of unjust enrichment for this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> one that licenses courts to disregard rules and engage in particularistic decision-making.

40|$|The article {{raises the}} problem of {{constructing}} a semantic model to describe the meaning <b>of</b> the grammatical <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> in the languages of different types. The main objective of this publication - to {{provide an overview of}} different points of view on the semantic structure <b>of</b> the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> and to compare different models <b>of</b> <b>case</b> semantics. Initial impulse to the development <b>of</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>case</b> semantics became the grammar and typological ideas of A. A. Potebnya and R. Jakobson. The basis of these models, which differ from each other in the number and nature of the allocation of features is the idea of the possibility of representing grammatical meaning as a structured set of semantic features. The analysis shows that the construction of formal models <b>of</b> grammatical <b>categories</b> is impossible without referring to the content of the dominant semantic features in the structure of grammatical meaning. Despite all the difficulties of modeling grammatical semantics, to construct a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>case</b> is an interesting and promising task of general morphology and typological linguistics...|$|R
