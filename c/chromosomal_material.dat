40|$|To {{identify}} genetic alterations {{associated with}} the development and progression of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), 57 tumors were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In 47 cases, chromosomal imbalances were found. Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were identified in the present study. The most frequently detected chromosomal gains involved chromosome arms 12 q (24 cases, 51 %), 4 q (17 cases, 36 %), 3 q (16 cases, 34 %), 1 q (15 cases, 32 %), and 18 q (15 cases, 32 %). Common regions of gain involved 12 q 13 -q 15, 4 q 12 -q 21, and 3 q 21 -q 26. High-copy-number increases of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>materials</b> were detected in four chromosomal regions, 3 q 21 -q 26. 2, 4 p 12 -q 21, 8 p, and 12 q 14 -q 15. The most frequently detected loss of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>materials</b> involved chromosome arms 16 q (26 cases, 55 %), 14 q (21 cases, 45 %), 1 p (20 cases, 43 %), 3 p (20 cases, 43 %), 16 p (19 cases, 40 %), 11 q (17 cases, 36 %), and 19 p (16 cases, 34 %). The most common regions of loss involved 14 q 24 -qter, 1 pter-p 36. 1, 3 p 22 -p 21. 3, 11 q 21 -qter, and the distal region of 19 p. Genomic alterations detected by CGH were compared and found to be largely consistent with those identified in banding analysis and loss of heterozygosity studies. However, several previously unrecognized recurrent alterations were also identified in the present study, including gain of 4 q and 18 q, and loss of 16 q, 14 q, and 19 p. In addition, gain of 1 q, 8 q, 18 q, and loss of 9 q showed a statistically significant association with advanced clinical stages (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Yersinia pestis, the causative {{agent of}} plague, has {{recently}} diverged from the less virulent enteropathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Its emergence {{has been characterized}} by massive genetic loss and inactivation and limited gene acquisition. The acquired genes include two plasmids, a filamentous phage, and a few chromosomal loci. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the chromosomal regions acquired by Y. pestis. Following in silico comparative analysis and PCR screening of 98 strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis, we found that eight chromosomal loci (six regions [R 1 pe to R 6 pe] and two coding sequences [CDS 1 pe and CDS 2 pe]) specified Y. pestis. Signatures of integration by site specific or homologous recombination were identified for most of them. These acquisitions and the loss of ancestral DNA sequences were concentrated in a chromosomal region opposite to the origin of replication. The specific regions were acquired very early during Y. pestis evolution and were retained during its microevolution, suggesting that they might bring some selective advantages. Only one region (R 3 pe), predicted to carry a lambdoid prophage, is most likely no longer functional because of mutations. With the exception of R 1 pe and R 2 pe, which have the potential to encode a restriction/modification and a sugar transport system, respectively, no functions could be predicted for the other Y. pestis-specific loci. To determine the role of the eight chromosomal loci in the physiology and pathogenicity of the plague bacillus, each of them was individually deleted from the bacterial chromosome. None of the deletants exhibited defects during growth in vitro. Using the Xenopsylla cheopis flea model, all deletants retained the capacity to produce a stable and persistent infection and to block fleas. Similarly, none of the deletants caused any acute flea toxicity. In the mouse model of infection, all deletants were fully virulent upon subcutaneous or aerosol infections. Therefore, our results suggest that acquisition of new <b>chromosomal</b> <b>materials</b> has not been of major importance in the dramatic change of life cycle that has accompanied the emergence of Y. pestis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Amplification of 3 q 26 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} genetic alterations in many human malignancies. Recently, we isolated a novel oncogene eIF- 5 A 2 within the 3 q 26 region. Functional study has demonstrated the oncogenic role of eIF- 5 A 2 in the initiation and progression of human cancers. In the present study, we aim to investigate the physiological and pathological effect of eIF- 5 A 2 in an eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model. Methods: An eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mouse model was generated using human eIF- 5 A 2 cDNA. The eIF- 5 A 2 transgenic mice were characterized by histological and immunohistochemistry analyses. The aging phenotypes were further characterized by wound healing, bone X-ray imaging and calcification analysis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated to further investigate molecular mechanism of eIF- 5 A 2 in aging. Results: Instead of resulting in spontaneous tumor formation, overexpression of eIF- 5 A 2 accelerated the aging process in adult transgenic mice. This included decreased growth rate and body weight, shortened life span, kyphosis, osteoporosis, delay of wound healing and ossification. Investigation of the correlation between cellular senescence and aging showed that cellular senescence is not required for the aging phenotypes in eIF- 5 A 2 mice. Interestingly, we found that activation of eIF- 5 A 2 repressed p 19 level and therefore destabilized p 53 in transgenic mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells. This subsequently allowed for the accumulation of chromosomal instability, such as errors in cell dividing during metaphase and anaphase. Additionally, a significantly increase in number of aneuploidy cells (p < 0. 05) resulted from an increase in the incidences of misaligned and lagging <b>chromosomal</b> <b>materials,</b> anaphase bridges, and micronuclei in the transgenic mice. Conclusion: These observations suggest that eIF- 5 A 2 mouse models could accelerate organismal aging by increasing chromosome instability. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The material consists of Finnish patients with sex chromosome aneuploidies and normal population controls from the "Kvantti Study" series, which was collected in the 1970 's and 1980 's at the Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku. The patients are five individuals with complete testicular feminization (CTF), eight 47,XYY males, and fourteen 45,X/ 46,XX females. The controls are population female and male controls, as well as five first degree relatives of the individuals with CTF, three of the 47,XYY males and nine of the 45,X/ 46,XX females studied. Dental arch dimensions and occlusion as well as craniofacial cephalometric dimensions, angles and dimensional ratios are measured from dental study casts and standardized lateral cephalograms. The results show that the presence of the Y chromosome in 46,XY females and the supernumerary Y chromosomal gene(s) in 47,XYY males result in the enlargement of the dental arches and craniofacial dimensions without substantial effects on dimensional ratios and plane angles, but with special influence on the growth of the mandibular corpus.

40|$|Background: A {{significant}} number of pregnancies, particularly in women with previous histories of infertility, are associated with fetal abnormalities. Methods such as the nuchal translucency (NT) measurement enable us to identify more pregnancies with <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: This analytic cross-sectional study was performed in 446 pregnant women at 11 - 14 weeks gestation, from 2009 to 2010 in the Fetal Medicine Unit of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences. All NT measurements were performed by a certified sonographer using the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) recommended protocol. FMF first trimester software was used for primary and secondary (adjusted) risk calculation. Results: The average maternal age was 28. 5 years and 15 % of mothers were ≥ 35 years of age. The average crown rump length (CRL), gestational age and NT thickness were 61. 7, 12. 4 weeks and 1. 75 mm, respectively. There were 20 cases with increased adjusted risk (4. 04 %) and 4 cases of documented abnormal karyotype. Conclusion: In our study increased adjusted risk was 4. 04 %. Documented abnormal karyotype were 0. 9 % and 28 % of total and high-risk groups who accepted amniocentesis, respectively. In this study, 50 % of women with high-risk results and {{about half of those}} with abnormal karyotypes were seen in women under age 35. Knowing these risks is of utmost importance in pregnancy, particularly in patients with infertility histories...|$|R
