5000|$|Explosives have {{important}} {{applications in the}} military and in both mining and construction work. In fact, the manufacture of explosives comprises a large amount of the chemical industry. [...] In the course of their production, handling, loading, and disposal, explosives are released into the environment. It is there that they are dispersed by mechanical processes or dissolved or volatilized and partially converted to secondary products. Over the past 150 years, millions of tons of explosives have been produced for military applications and other activities that have led to the accidental contamination of energetic materials in the soil and groundwater. [...] Exact numbers cannot be obtained and estimations are generally conservative, because people make their own bombs, which is not a small activity in regions dealing with armed conflict. The United States Army had estimated that over 1.2 million tons of soils have been contaminated with explosives on their training grounds alone. In the year 2004, it was estimated that 2,520,000 metric tons of explosive agents were sold for consumption in the United States alone. [...] Figure 1 shows the world <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The GWR company {{selected}} two contractors from a tendering process. George Burge of Herne Bay was {{the major}} contractor, responsible for 75% of overall tunnel length working from the west. He appointed Samuel Hansard Yockney as his engineer and manager. The locally based Lewis and Brewer {{were responsible for the}} remainder, starting from the east.Construction began in December 1838, divided into six isolated sections. Access to each was via a [...] diameter ventilation shaft which ranged in depth from 70 ft on the eastern end to 300 ft towards the western end. All men, construction equipment, materials and [...] of extract had to go in and come out of the shafts using steam powered winches. The shafts also functioned as the safety exits from the tunnel. Candles provided the only lighting and were consumed at the rate of one tonne per week, equalled by the weekly <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Due to the time period required to get men {{in and out of the}} workings, blasting occurred with the men inside the tunnel. This, plus the hazard of water influx exceeding the calculated volumes, led to most of the deaths of around 100 navvies (railway construction workers) who worked on the project. Additional pumping and drainage needed to be installed during and after construction.|$|E
40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{are fundamental}} {{operations in the}} mining cycle and consti tute {{an important component of}} the mining costs. Rock fragmentation can in principle be managed by means of two options: by increasing or reducing the specific <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> or by modifying the drilling pattern. The choice of one or other type of control depends on the relationship between the unit costs of drilling and explosives, and on technical restrictions or regulations imposed by different reasons. It is then necessary to identify the link between the blast design and some factors affecting the downstream processing of the product. This paper analyzes the theoretical basis aimed at evaluating the main parameters involved when organizing a production blast in open pit quarries. In particular, a method developed through the analysis of the results in a large number of limestone open pit quarries in Italy is described and commented. The first experimental results in Brazil have been obtained by applying this method at the Experimental Mine of the Research Center of Responsible Mining of the University of São Paulo. Experimental methods and results will be analyzed and discussed in the second part of this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} is to evaluate the most suitable exploitation technique in two underground gypsum quarries, both of them located in Piedmont (Italy). The methods currently adopted pertain to the "Rooms and Pillars" category, but the techniques employed in the two quarries are different, i. e. mechanical (by roadheader) and conventional (by Drill & Blast) respectively. The choice of an excavation technique results from a study which takes into account a number of parameters, such as morphology of the orebody, productivity, depreciation, workforce, plant engineering and <b>consumptions.</b> First <b>of</b> all, a thorough knowledge of the geological characteristics of the area is necessary, and geomechanical properties of gypsum must be known: a wide, bedded and regular orebody favors {{the use of the}} mechanical exploitation, whereas inhomogeneous, non-linear and small orebodies often require the great versatility <b>of</b> the <b>explosive.</b> The technical comparison has highlighted that the productivities obtained by the two excavation techniques are almost equivalent: gypsum allows minimal tools wear, optimizing production times of the cutter head, whereas its plasticity can require specific <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> higher than in rocks of comparable hardness. As to the economical aspect, the total costs of excavation with Drill & Blast are 25 % higher than those with roadheader: indeed, even if the mechanical excavation will lead to higher investment costs for machinery and to large <b>consumptions</b> <b>of</b> electricity, it involves a very important saving on diesel fuel and explosives, which has a fundamental impact, i. e. a third of the costs <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> more than one sixth of the total costs of extraction, as well as an increase in labor costs. Another important aspect is the environmental sustainability of the mechanical excavation, with a diesel consumption much lower than the conventional method, and the possibility of an almost total abatement, if conveyor belts are employed instead of truck dumpers for muck transportatio...|$|R
40|$|A {{force that}} is applied {{dynamically}} {{in a short period}} of time is called an impact force (shock wave). Due to the concentrated application of force on a small area in a fraction of a second, unique applications have emerged that other types of loadings are not capable of performing. Explosions, an impact of a hammer, impact of waves on a shore wall, or the collision of two automobiles are examples where impact waves occur. In this research the effects of impact on solid materials and the motion of stress waves due to the impact are studied and some of their industrial applications are described.   The primary objective of this work is further development of some elastic and plastic impact wave methods, aiming to reduce the energy <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosive</b> welding (EXW) as well as the cost of NDT technologies. Many numerical simulations and a vast amount of experimental work were employed to reach this goal.   The impact wave creates elastic deformations that move the particles of the body. In this research we focused on dimensional measurement by calculating the time of wave travel between the source of energy and a discontinuity in the part studied. The impact echo (IE) method can be used for determining the location and extent of all kinds of flaws, such as cracks, de-lamination, holes and de-bonding in concrete structures, columns and hollow cylinders with different cross-sections and materials. In the present study, simulation of the impact-echo method was carried out numerically using direct and indirect methods. In the direct method a steel ball directly impacts on the upper surface of a concrete plate-like structure, whereas in the indirect method the impact impulse transmits to the concrete plate via a steel bar, in order to adapt the method for situations where there is no access to the plate being measured. In each method a two-dimensional finite element analysis (in axisymmetric geometry) was performed for the thickness measurement of concrete plates using the LS-DYNA program. Numerical results are presented for different values of plate thickness and different projectile speeds for both the direct and the indirect method and the indirect results are validated by comparison with the results obtained by the direct method. The method was validated against experimental measurements.   A high energy impact wave produces plastic deformations in metals. In this research explosive welding was studied as an application of high energy impact waves. A new method for joining different, non-compatible metals (Al and Cu-based materials) was introduced. This method may be extended for use in offshore applications. Many 3 -D numerical simulations were performed using the ABAQUS explicit commercial software. The model was validated against experimental measurements.   The outcome of this research work could be summarized as follows: a)   Introducing an indirect IE method in NDT technology for thickness measurement in particularly inaccessible structures. b)   Introducing a new, grooved method in EXW technology to join surfaces made of different materials, in particular Al-Cu joints. The results could be employed to reduce the energy consumption and cost associated with EXW and IE technologies. The methodology can be used in many other applications in all kinds of process industries...|$|R
