5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSitting for the Examination for Admission to Higher Education (YGS) is {{the first}} phase of the {{university}} entrance examination process in Turkey. High school teachers have raised concerns regarding the inconsistency between the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the YGS mathematics tests and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the 11 th- and 12 th-grade mathematics curricula. Document analysis <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the 2010 – 2012 YGS mathematics tests and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 11 th- and 12 th-grade mathematics textbooks revealed that the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> these tests is 89 % to 93 % inconsistent with the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the 11 th-grade mathematics textbook and 98 % to 99 % inconsistent with the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the 12 th-grade mathematics textbook...|$|R

With regard to the dynamics, the highest <b>content</b> <b>of</b> carotinoides was observed before silking, whick agrees with the sevent stage of the organogenezis of the ear. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> carotinoides agrees with that of chlorophyll, both in dynamics and with regard to the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> individual groups <b>of</b> leaves. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> carotinoides decreases with the density <b>of</b> crops. <b>Content</b> <b>of</b> the amino acids was the highest in the middle and lower leaves, and the to lowest in the upper leaves.

30|$|The sediments from Golden Beach and Silver Beach, Qingdao {{are mainly}} {{feldspar}} and quartz, {{with a relatively}} low <b>content</b> <b>of</b> volcanic rock debris and little biotite and magnetite, and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> feldspar is higher than that <b>of</b> quartz. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> rigid particles, e.g., feldspar and quartz, ranges from 70  % to 80  %, while the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> ductile particles like eruptive rock and mica is generally less than 20  %. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> quartz is relatively {{higher than that of}} feldspar in the sediments from the Mazhan and Feng Rivers, with a low <b>content</b> <b>of</b> volcanic rock debris and visible chert. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> rigid particles is over 85  % and that of ductile particles is less than 15  %. Sediments from Yellow River Estuary, Dongying are fine grained, with a low <b>content</b> <b>of</b> rigid particles and a high clay mineral content, which results in strong ductility.|$|R

5|$|James Broun-Ramsay, the Marquess of Dalhousie became Lord Warden; on his death, the Prime Minister Henry Temple, the Viscount Palmerston, {{took over}} the castle in 1861. Palmerston {{initially}} declined to buy the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the castle from his predecessor's estate on taking up the post, a practice which had become traditional for the Lords Warden, complaining about the high price being proposed. This raised {{the risk that the}} historical <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the castle might be sold off at open auction; and some of Wellington's former belongings were therefore removed by his family for safekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> harbour {{porpoises}} suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> arrays, the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the screen memory, and the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

For Yuxiangyouzhan, shading treatments {{significantly increased}} relative content in (E)- 2 -Hexenal. S 3 significantly increased relative content in 2 -AP. Shading treatments (S 2 and S 3) significantly decreased relative content in Octane. S 1 treatment significantly increased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> Octanal and Benzyl alcohol. For Nongxiang 18, shading treatments (S 2 and S 3) significantly increased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> (E)- 2 -Hexenal. Shading treatments significantly increased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 2 -AP. S 3 significantly decreased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> Octane, while significantly increased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> Octanal. Shading treatment (S 1 and S 3) significantly increased the relative <b>content</b> <b>of</b> Benzyl alcohol.

40|$|A nano-calcium {{carbonate}} supported calcium pimelate (CaHA) β-nucleating {{agent and}} β-nucleated PP was prepared. The influences <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> support nano-calcium carbonate and supported β-nucleating agent on crystallization behaviors, melting characteristics and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> β-PP were investigated by {{differential scanning calorimeter}} (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analyses, and compared with calcium pimelate (CaHA) nucleated PP. The results indicated that PP nucleated by supported β-nucleating agent showed higher crystallization temperature than that of CaHA nucleated PP. The crystallization temperature and melting temperature of PP nucleated by supported β-nucleating agent increased with increasing the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> supported β-nucleating agent and decreased with increasing the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the support nano-calcium carbonate. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> β-iPP in the PP nucleated by supported β-nucleating agent was {{higher than that of}} CaHA nucleated PP.

50|$|The {{nutritional}} {{value of the}} marama bean is astonishingly high for an unimproved legume. The tubers have a high protein <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 9.0% and also have a high amino acid <b>content.</b> The tubers <b>of</b> cassava, for example, only have a protein <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 1-3%, while yam has one of 7%. Also the grain is relatively high in protein with a share of 30-39%. The concentration of sulphur-containing amino acids is high as well (with a lysine <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 5.0% and a methionine <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 0.7%). This shows that the protein <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the seeds {{is comparable to the}} one of commercial soybeans, which have a <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 38-40%. Therefore, the potential of the marama bean is high to replace the soybean as a protein source, once there have been genetical improvements.|$|R
