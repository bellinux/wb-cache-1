First, using non-dimensional scaling of the governing equations, we give the assumptions leading to a bi-temperature model.

The description of the finite volume method that uses the strong conservative form of the equations is given both in Cartesian {{as well as in}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> useful to compute flows inside a torus.
