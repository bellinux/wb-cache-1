Barbirolli's concerts impressed Frederic Austin, director of the British National Opera Company (BNOC), who in the same year invited him to conduct some performances with the company. Barbirolli had never conducted a chorus or a large orchestra, but had the confidence to accept. He made his operatic debut directing Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at Newcastle, followed within days by performances of Aida and Madama Butterfly. He conducted the BNOC frequently over the next two years, and made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with Madama Butterfly in 1928. The following year he was invited to conduct the opening work in Covent Garden's international season, Don Giovanni, with a cast that included Mariano Stabile, Elisabeth Schumann and Heddle Nash.|$|E

Ironically for a company later renowned for its technological developments of recording, auditory evidence from the time suggests that these setups were rather rudimentary affairs, with the recording quality mediocre at best, although from about 1933 onwards, with technological and acoustic changes to these studios, recording quality gradually improved, but was {{still a long way}} short of the standard being produced by HMV at Abbey Road, and it was only with the opening of new purpose built facilities at Broadhurst Gardens that Decca was finally able to compete for acoustic quality.|$|E

50|$|Dobson {{was born}} in central London {{and grew up in}} Clerkenwell. His mother was Alice Mary Owen and his father, who was also named Frank Dobson, was a {{commercial}} artist who specialized in bird and flower designs for greeting card companies. The younger Dobson attended school in Forest Gate and then in Harrow. When his father died in 1900, the fourteen year old Dobson was sent to live with an aunt in Hastings. There he attended evening classes at the Hastings School of Art and was then trained as an apprentice with Sir William Reynolds-Stephens. After eighteen months in Reynolds-Stephen's studio, Dobson moved to Devon and then to Cornwall where he lived, for two years, by selling landscape paintings. In 1906 he obtained a scholarship to study at the art institute in Hospitalfield House in Arbroath and studied there for four years. From 1910 to 1912 Dobson attended the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, after which he returned to Cornwall. In Newlyn, he met Augustus John who used his influence and contacts to enable Dobson to stage a one-man show at the <b>Chenil</b> Gallery in London in 1914. In, or around, 1915 Dobson created his first sculpture, a small piece in wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreword}} of the <b>Chenil</b> Gallery catalogue, 1914, {{contained a}} defiant text not dissimilar to Wyndham Lewis' Manifesto in Blast 1, {{and one that}} {{could just as easily}} apply to the drawings done around this time that would serve as the basis of Russian Ballet;'I appeal to the Sense of Form. In some of the work I show in the first room, I completely abandon Naturalism and Tradition. I am searching for an Intenser expression. In other work in this room, where I use naturalistic Form, I have stripped it of all irrelevant matter. I look upon nature, while I live in a steel city. Where decoration happens, it is accidental. My object is the construction of Pure Form. I reject everything in painting that is not Pure Form. I hate the colours of the East, the Modern Mediævalist, and the Fat Man of the Renaissance.' David Bomberg, 1914While usually considered a vorticist, Bomberg had refused to sign the Vorticist manifesto published in BLAST, July 1914, or allow Lewis to reproduce his work in the magazine alongside contributions from T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Edward Wadsworth, Ford Madox Ford and Jacob Epstein, among others. The only official connection was when he agreed to exhibit with the Vorticists at their single English exhibition at the Doré Gallery, London, July 1915. His work was placed in a separate room as part of the 'invited to show' section.|$|E
40|$|On 20 June 1914, the Vorticists set out {{to shock}} the British {{cultural}} establishment with their journal Blast; its bold type marching diagonally across its bright pink cover. Within, readers found a powerful manifesto, trumpeted in heavy font, specifying individuals, institutions, and items to be blasted or blessed. Amidst those to be blasted, sandwiched between Edward Elgar, cod liver oil and Clan Strachey, was the <b>Chenil</b> Gallery. The Vorticists' indictment, at first glance, seems to support {{the myth of the}} avant-garde with its habitual disavowal of the commercial art world. Yet, the <b>Chenil,</b> the only gallery cited by the magazine, had gained its reputation and visibility since it was founded in 1905 by supporting artists who positioned themselves as outsiders, first by calling upon the paradigm of bohemia, {{as in the case of}} Augustus John, later by adopting the strategies of the urban avant-garde as, for example, with David Bomberg. Why then did the <b>Chenil</b> incur such wrath in 1914...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considered}} {{matters of}} taste, acquisition and display {{in relation to}} the art collection of the civil servant, literary editor and influential patron Sir Edward Marsh. It drew on a range of analyses of the impulse to collect, examining transformations in Marsh’s activities in relation to his social and cultural milieu in the years prior to the First World War. Recent research on the period has centred on themes associated with modernity in contexts of national, racial, gendered and sexual identities. This article extended some of those debates in relation to art collecting and collections. The article was included in the themed issue (edited and Introduction by Holt) of the journal deriving from the conference ‘Visual Culture and Taste in the Late Victorian and Edwardian Period’. This journal issue brought together scholars from Britain, Germany and the US concerned to bring new perspectives to the study of this period. The conference was the culmination of Holt and McConkey’s Leverhulme Trust project ‘Impressionism in Britain’ and received additional funding from the British Academy. Holt has extended her research interests in art collecting and dealerships in new studies to feature in her monograph. She has already explored the relationships between art collecting in England and the US in a conference paper delivered in New York in 2003 on the influential painter John Quinn, again in a New York College Arts Association paper in 2006 on the activities of the Chelsea <b>Chenil</b> Gallery and is currently researching relations between English artists and the New York Knoedler Gallery {{in the early twentieth century}} for a paper to be delivered at the 2008 Annual Association of Art Historians conference [...] Holt’s Ph. D student Kim Pearson’s thesis ‘Patterns of Collecting in British Art, 1890 - 1914 ’ relates to this research...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{critically}} re-evaluates {{the role}} of the art dealer in the modernist enterprise from 1880 to 1920, in order to establish whether England's marginalisation within the European canon was attributable, in part, to its native dealers. Recent discourse on English modernist art history has eschewed direct aesthetic comparisons with the 'isms' along the conventional London-Paris axis, in favour of an account of England's cultural differences with France. As part of that discourse the thesis addresses the differences in art dealing between London and Paris, using the paradigmatic French dealers such as Paul Durand-Ruel and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as benchmarks, in order to critically assess and reframe the contribution that dealers made to English art and its subsequent histories. Against the background of the English cultural milieu of the period, the study, using Tate Gallery archives, focuses on key exhibitions held by two London dealers whose marketing strategies reflected their different origins; the Parisian 'schooled' William Marchant of the Goupil Gallery, and the novice Jack Knewstub who founded the <b>Chenil</b> Gallery. Both dealers predominantly promoted the work of the French “juste-milieu” artists such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and/or the quasi-academic English art of Augustus John and William Orpen, but also sought new opportunities to promote vanguard English artists such as David Bomberg. Within the context of the nuanced relationships artists had with their native dealers, this thesis examines issues of aesthetic judgment, and questions the validity of an 'alternative' English modernism promoted by art historians such as Charles Harrison. By positing the dealer as the central figure within art's infrastructure, the thesis also considers the commercial validation of the modernist canon that saw Paris as its apogee contemporaneously and in subsequent twentieth century art histories. By contrast, the subsequent writing of the histories of English art has continued without commercial considerations given to its proponents. Through a detailed examination of these issues, this thesis creates an enhanced understanding of modernism and stimulates further debate about England's role within the European modernist enterprise...|$|E
