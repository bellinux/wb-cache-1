40|$|Abstract. The {{recommendation}} {{system based on}} collaborative filtering {{is one of the}} most popular recommendation mechanisms. However, with the continuous expansion of the system, several problems that traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm (<b>CF)</b> <b>faced</b> such as cold startup, accuracy, and scalability are worsen. In order to address these issues, a distributed collaborative filtering recommendation model based on expand-vector (CF-EV) is proposed. Firstly, the eigenvector is expanded reasonably to get the expand-vector based on the expand-vector model, a new extension measure created in this paper. Then, the nearest neighbor user is found and a more accurate recommendation to the target user is given based on the calculation results. In addition, the further optimization makes it applied to the parallel computing framework successfully. Using the MovieLens dataset, the performance of CF-EV is compared with CF from both sides of recommendation precision and the speedup ratio. Through experimental results, CF-EV overcomes the problem of cold startup. Moreover, the accuracy and recall ratio has been doubled. With the increasing numbers of the computing nodes, the distributed implementation has linear speedup...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecommendation Systems (RSs) are {{becoming}} tools of choice {{to select the}} online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative Filtering (CF) {{is the most popular}} approach to build Recommendation System and has been successfully employed in many applications. Collaborative Filtering algorithms are much explored technique in the field of Data Mining and Information Retrieval. In CF, past user behavior are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and items to recommend an item to a user based on opinions of other users. Those customers, who had similar likings in the past, will have similar likings in the future. In the past decades due to the rapid growth of Internet usage, vast amount of data is generated and it has becomea challenge for CF algorithms. So, <b>CF</b> <b>faces</b> issues with sparsity of rating matrix and growing nature of data. These challenges are well taken care of by Matrix Factorization (MF). In this paper we are going to discuss different Matrix Factorization models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). This paper attempts to present a comprehensive survey of MF model like SVD to address the challenges of CF algorithms, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area...|$|R

PURPOSE: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate if CF participation contributes to overtraining syndrome. A secondary purpose was to determine if there are differences between CF original methodologies and real-world practice. METHODS: Six recreationally trained males (height, 182. 8 ± 8. 6 cm; weight, 84. 3 ± 12. 4 kg, and age, 25. 0 ± 5. 4 years) were randomized into two groups, either theoretical (TH) or real-world (RW) prior to the intervention. Both groups completed pre-testing assessment of body composition, physiological, biochemical, psychological, and performance-based data. Both groups participated in CF training 5 days/week. However, the TH group completed training designed to follow original CF methodology while the RW group followed programming designed by a randomly selected CF affiliate. At the beginning and end of each week blood was collected for serum analyses and select joint range-of-motions (ROM) were measured. Additionally, prior to each training session, resting heart rate (RHR), blood pressure (BP), muscle soreness (DOMS), and select training variables were collected. Following the completion of each training session, HR and perceived exertion (RPE) were collected. RESULTS: There are no significant differences in physiological, biochemical, immunological, psychological, or performance outcome variables assessed in this study for both between groups and pre-post testing (all p 3 ̆e. 05).

Using Cambodia as a case study, we examine the development of a rigid CF system, review negative factors influencing the upland forested area, clarify the unfavorable situations arising from these factors and discuss likely problems associated with the CF management system. International organizations played a key role in the introduction and maintenance of rigid, complex and high-cost CF systems in Cambodia. Conflicts and crises arise when the administration prosecutes local farmers for illegal cultivation or deprives communities of CF management rights because of the expansion of commercial crop cultivation and the lack of adequate community management in response to unprecedented changes. A likely practical solution to the probable impasse is the development and funding of a functional network of CF management committees, rather than the adoption of an entirely new, alternative system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that emotions play an influential role in cognition. Interference between facial emotional expression processing and selected tasks is measured {{using a variety of}} experimental methods. Prior to the main experimental chapters, the collection and assessment (Chapter 2, Exp. 1) of stimulus materials is described. Experiments 2 - 11 then concentrate on the likelihood of interference with other types of information from the face. Findings using a Garner design suggest that, although identity processing may be independent of expression variation, expression processing may be influenced by variation in identity (Exps. 2 - 4). Continued use of this design with sex (Exps. 6 - 7) and gaze direction (Exps. 9 - 10) information appears to support the (mutual) independence of these facial dimensions from expression. This is, however, in contrast to studies that indicate the modification of masculinity judgements by expression (Exp. 5), and the interaction of gaze direction and expression when participants rate how interesting they find a face (Exp. 8). Further to this, a search task (Exp. 11) shows that slower responses to an angry (<b>cf.</b> happy) <b>face</b> looking at us, {{may be due to the}} presence of an aversive mouth. Experiments 12 - 15 test for interference in the field of time perception: complex interactions between expression and encoder and decoder sex are indicated. Finally, Experiments 16 - 17 find that exposure to a sequence in which the majority of faces are angry depresses probability learning, and that prior exposure to varying quantities of angry and happy faces affects our later memory for them. Overall, there is evidence that exposure to emotional expressions may affect other (selected) c ognitive processesd ependingu pon which expressionsa re used and which experimental methods are chosen.

40|$|There {{are many}} well tested and widely used {{techniques}} for determination of age-at-death of human skeletal remains. Dental development, morphology of the pubic symphysis, and cranial suture progression are all trusted techniques, either {{on their own}} or in combination, in making such determinations. Despite the apparent abundance of ways in which determine age-at-death, there is still considerable interest and research in developing more methods based on other bones. The ribs in particular {{have been the subject of}} much research in developing new age estimation techniques. Kunos’s method (1999) involved analysis of three different variables for each of the three epiphyseal regions of the first rib for a total of nine individual traits (some based on metric measurement) in estimating age to an upper limit of 20 years. In addition, the technique utilizes five different variables for each of three different features for a total of 15 traits in estimating age after 20 years old. This study was successful in its accuracy but is unfortunately difficult and time consuming in practice. DiGangi et al (1990) attempted to simplify and test the technique. DiGangi et al used the traits, descriptions, and scoring protocol described by Kunos and applied them to male remains from a mass grave of modern origin in Yugoslavia. The most pertinent change in the technique from the Kunos study to the DiGangi study is that DiGangi et al were able to narrow the technique down to two traits, the geometric shape of the costal <b>face</b> (<b>CF</b> 1) and the surface texture of the tubercle facet (TF 3). The purpose of this study is to perform a test of the DiGangi method on a sample population that will include female individuals. The methods will be applied exactly as described by DiGangi in an attempt to determine if the test may be used as is, if it needs to be modified for the population being studied, or if it is completely unusable the way it is. The potential usefulness of this technique lay in its simplicity and the high likelihood of finding usable first ribs or first rib fragments.

40|$|Cystic Fibrosis (CF) {{is due to}} {{mutation}} in the chloride channel CFTR gene causing impairment of chloride secretion in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The most common CFTR {{mutation in}} CF is the deletion of the phenylalanine at the position 508 of the protein (DF 508), leading to the retention of the mutant protein within the ER and its rapid degradation via ERAD pathway. More than 1800 mutations have been identified so far, variably affecting CFTR activity, {{but none of them}} have been clearly linked to a certain phenotype. In other words, even if carrying the same genotype, <b>CF</b> patients might <b>face</b> a different development of their disease. Clearly, CF disease also depends on other genetic and/or environmental factors. Lately, a number of studies focused on modifier genes that may determine severity of lung disease, as MBL and TGF-B. Recently, Wright et al. performed whole-genome microarrays assays of nasal cells from non-CF individuals, mild CF and DF 508 -CFTR homozygous patients and found a total of 652 out of 1187 genes differentially expressed in these three groups (1). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 21 - 23 nucleotides in length which regulate gene expression. First described in 1993, miRNAs are non-coding RNA; instead each primary transcript (a pri-miRNA) is processed into a short stem-loop structure called a premiRNA and finally into a functional miRNA. Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to one or more mRNA molecules, and thus down-regulate gene expression by inducing mRNA degradation or repression of protein expression by translation inhibition. Differential expression in miRNAs has been shown to influence disease development in Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, heart failure and COPD. We performed microarray analysis of miRNAs expression using primary bronchial epithelial cells from three different donors (DF/DF) and from three non-CF donors. Among the 856 miRNAs identified in the human genome at the time we performed the study, 94 were expressed in HBE cells, with 16 of them differentially expressed between CF and non CF patients : - miR 22, miR 29 a, miR 29 c, miR 30 a, miR 30 b, miR 30 c, miR 30 d, miR 30 e, miR 151 - 3 p, miR 151 - 5 p were upregulated in CF-HBEs; - miR 103, miR 107, miR 146 a, miR 203, miR 224, miR 1246 were down-regulated in CF-HBEs. Real-time PCR experiments partially confirmed microarrays results, finding significant differences in expression of 11 of the 16 miRNAs.

40|$|Orphan {{diseases}} are often managed according to evidence from similar, more common conditions. This should be avoided, since differences in pathophysiology, morbidity, and prognosis will likely lead to problems of treatment failure {{and lack of}} adherence. The prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) 1 is approximately one-fourth that of cystic fibrosis (CF) (one in 10, 000 and one in 2, 500, respectively), and it is, therefore, not particularly rare. Despite recent advances in PCD research and clinical infrastructure, 2 {{there have been no}} randomized controlled trials, and current management guidelines are mostly limited to expert consensus extrapolated from evidence from CF. 3. The article by Cohen-Cymberknoh et al 4 in this issue of CHEST (see page 738) highlights that PCD is clinically distinct not only from CF with pancreatic insufficiency (CF-PI) but also from CF with pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS). This observational study of the three patient groups attending a single specialist center additionally dispels any myths that PCD is a mild disease.. Similarly to CF-PS, diagnosis of PCD is often delayed, with consequent impact on onset of treatment. 4, 5 The assumption that CF-PS and PCD are milder diseases than CF-PI has falsely reassured us that these patient groups will do reasonably well despite delay in starting appropriate treatment. The findings of Cohen-Cymberknoh et al 4 add to the evidence that some patients with PCD have significant morbidity. 6, 7 The authors unexpectedly found that patients with PCD had substantially lower BMIs than patients with CF-PS or CF-PI (BMI percentiles: PCD, 21; CF-PI, 42; CF-PS, 49). Contrary to patients with CF, their patients with PCD did not receive dietetic input, but care was otherwise similar. From this observational study it is unclear whether the discrepancy in BMI really demonstrates worse nutritional status in patients with PCD than <b>CF,</b> but at <b>face</b> value the data appear clinically relevant and raise an issue that requires further evaluation. Similarly, the data relating to lung function in PCD and CF-PS raises concern for lung disease in these patient groups. Although the cross-sectional data suggest that lung function (FEV 1) declines with age most rapidly in patients with CF-PI, 4 a significant proportion of teenagers and young adults with PCD and CF-PS had clinically relevant low FEV 1. It is worth noting that this study provides further support, that FEV 1 correlates well with high-resolution CT imaging evidence of disease severity in CF, but not in PCD, bringing into question the options for regular monitoring of disease progression in this patient group.. The radiologic distribution of lung disease in patients with PCD (predominantly middle and lower lobes) and CF (upper lobes) 4, 8 highlights differences in underlying cause of lung damage and, therefore, the need to consider different treatment options in the two diseases. Differences in lower airway pathogens and chronic colonization between PCD and CF are likely to reflect impaired mucociliary clearance, a primary defect in PCD and a secondary defect in CF, together with differences between altered mucus properties, inflammatory status, and innate immune responses. As previously described in CF, Cohen-Cymberknoh et al 4 found chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlates with declining FEV 1 in CF. However, they found no correlation with PCD lung disease. This is in contrast to a recent study using molecular techniques to characterize the microbiome of the airways in PCD. 9 Using 16 S rRNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing to determine bacterial load and composition, P aeruginosa was found to correlate positively with patient age and negatively with FEV 1 percent predicted. 9. In addition to comparisons of pulmonary disease and nutrition between PCD, CF-PS, and CF-PI highlighted by Cohen-Cymberknoh et al, 4 other characteristics require consideration. 1 Sinus disease is common in both CF and PCD, but nasal polyps are a feature of CF. Unremitting rhinitis from birth is suggestive of PCD, as is persistent or recurrent serous otitis media (glue ear). 1 The underlying causes of ear, nose, and throat disease in CF and PCD differ and require management by specialists with experience of the idiosyncrasies of each disease. Although male patients with CF and PCD are usually infertile, the underlying cause and the treatment options are different. Men with CF have congenital absence of the vas deferens, whereas male infertility in PCD is generally caused by immotile sperm due to the homologous ultrastructure of sperm flagella and respiratory cilia. Assisted fertility, therefore, requires different approaches. In CF, sperm needs to be aspirated from the epididymis. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is then often used because the sperm retrieval procedure does not achieve sufficient sperm for conventional insemination. In PCD, immotile sperm from the ejaculate are injected directly into ova by intracytoplasmic sperm injection to overcome motility issues.. Approximately one-half of patients with PCD have situs inversus due to immotile cilia on the embryonic node leading to random laterality of organs. A smaller proportion of patients with PCD (6 %) have complex laterality defects, including complex congenital heart disease, polysplenia, and saddle liver. 10. In summary, most doctors have little experience of rarer causes of bronchiectasis such as PCD, and management is based on evidence from CF. Indeed, the evidence base for managing PCD is poor, with no clinical trials in PCD. This is clearly inappropriate, as demonstrated by the data presented by Cohen-Cymberknoh et al 4; PCD is clinically distinct from CF-PI and CF-PS and is likely to benefit from different treatment strategies. Substantial advances have been made in CF management in recent decades, resulting in improved morbidity and mortality. These advances have been beneficial to the care of patients with PCD, but we now require clinical standards and evidence-based guidelines individualized for PCD. ...|$|R
