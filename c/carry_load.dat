50|$|Factors {{of safety}} (FoS), {{also known as}} (and used interchangeably with) safety factor (SF), is a term {{describing}} the load carrying capacity of a system beyond the expected or actual loads. Essentially, the factor of safety is how much stronger the system is than it usually needs to be for an intended load.

5000|$|Velomobiles for cargo use {{often have}} heavy frames to <b>carry</b> <b>load,</b> plus {{the weight of}} the cargo itself. In turn, {{the weight of the}} fairing may be {{relatively}} less important. Also, bulky loads often have poor aerodynamics, and so the quality of aerodynamics of the fairing is less important. This may enable use of a fairing which in hot weather can be converted to a canopy. A canopy provides no aerodynamic benefits, but improves cooling compared to a faired configuration, while also reducing sun exposure compared to riding without a canopy. Thus, a [...] "high speed" [...] velomobile may benefit most from better aerodynamics, even when aerodynamics hurts rider cooling; {{while at the same time}} a [...] "high load" [...] velomobile may benefit most from improved cooling (to maximize power output) even if that hurts aerodynamics.|$|E

5000|$|The Saturn S-Series was {{a family}} of compact cars from the Saturn {{automobile}} company of General Motors. This was the first series of Saturn vehicles. The automobile platform, the Z-body, was developed entirely in-house at Saturn, and it shared very little {{with the rest of}} the General Motors model line. It implemented a spaceframe design, which had been used on some Pontiacs during the 1980s. This meant that the side panels did not <b>carry</b> <b>load</b> and could be made of plastic instead of metal. These polymer panels were dent-resistant, something that remained a selling point for Saturn until just a few years before the Saturn brand was discontinued. The S-series was sold from the fall of 1990 for the 1991 model year through the end of the 2002 model year. Significant design updates were made in 1995, 1996, and 2000 for all cars, and the SC coupes were redesigned significantly in 1997. Nearly every year of the S-Series' existence brought at least some minor changes to the architecture of the car.|$|E
5000|$|Polyamides (PA), high-performance, {{for severe}} environments; {{high-temperature}} glues; typically applied at over 200 °C, but can degrade and char during processing. In molten state can somewhat degrade by atmospheric oxygen. High application temperature. High range of service temperatures, generally showing adequate bonding from -40 to 70 °C; some compositions allow operation to 185 °C {{if they do}} not have to <b>carry</b> <b>load.</b> Resistant to plasticizers, therefore suitable for gluing polyvinyl chloride; only polyamides derived from secondary diamines however provide a satisfying bond. Resistant to oils and gasoline. Good adhesion to many substrates such as metal, wood, vinyl, ABS, and treated polyethylene and polypropylene. Some formulations are UL-approved for electrical applications requiring reduced flammability. Three groups are employed, with low, intermediate, and high molecular weight; the low MW ones are low-temperature melting and easy to apply, but have lower tensile strength, lower tensile-shear strength, and lower elongation than the high-MW ones. The high-MW ones require sophisticated extruders and are used as high-performance structural adhesives. The presence of hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains gives polyamides a high strength at even low molecular weights, in comparison with other polymers. Hydrogen bonds also provide retention of most of the adhesive strength up almost to the melting point; however they also make the material more susceptible to permeation of moisture in comparison with polyesters. Can be formulated as soft and tacky or as hard and rigid. Niche applications, together with polyesters taking less than 10% of total volume of hot melt adhesives market. Absorption of moisture may lead to foaming during application as water evaporates during melting, leaving voids in the adhesive layer which degrade mechanical strength. Polyamide HMAs are usually composed of a dimer acid with often two or more different diamines. The dimer acid usually presents 60-80% of the total polyamide mass, and provides amorphous nonpolar character. Linear aliphatic amines such as ethylene diamine and hexamethylene diamine, provide hardness and strength. Longer chain amines such as dimer amine, reduce the amount of hydrogen bonds per volume of material, resulting in lower stiffness. Polyether diamines provide good low-temperature flexibility. Piperazine and similar diamines also reduce the number of hydrogen bonds. Only polyamides based on piperazine and similar secondary amines form satisfactory bond with polyvinyl chloride; primary amines form stronger hydrogen bonds within the adhesive, secondary amines can act only as proton acceptors, don't form hydrogen bonds within the polyamide, and are therefore free to form weaker bonds with vinyl, probably with the hydrogen atom adjacent to the chlorine.|$|E

30|$|In the {{following}} {{we attempt to}} find the maximum <b>carried</b> <b>loads</b> of each link in various scenarios. One observation from solving the system of equations in Section 5.1 is that the <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> will be smaller than the offered load when the offered load is too large. This corresponds to the instability of 802.11 observed in previous works (e.g., [15]). Therefore, we use binary search to find the maximum <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> under stable conditions. Initially, the search range for the offered load is between 0 and 1 [*]Mbps. We choose {{the midpoint of the}} search range to be the offered load and solve the system of equations. If the resultant <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> {{is the same as the}} offered load, the offered load can be increased, and the next search range will be the upper half of the original one. Otherwise, the offered load results in instability, and the next search range will be the lower half of the original one. This procedure is repeated until the search range is sufficiently small.|$|R

40|$|Two driving {{factors in}} {{aircraft}} panel design are structural efficiency {{and response to}} in-service damage. Stitching through the thickness can improve both of these considerations. Combining stitching with a post-buckling design approach can provide additional improvements. The buckling behavior of stitched structure is considered since lighter structures can be achieved if local skin buckling is allowed to occur at less than design ultimate load. Through-the-thickness stitching can suppress delamination between skin and flange, thereby allowing the structure to reliably <b>carry</b> <b>load</b> into the postbuckling range. Hat-stiffened and rod-stiffened panels in which the skin and flanges were stitched together through-the-thickness prior to curing are considered through experiment and analysis.

40|$|The shear {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete pier caps in existing bridge support {{systems can be}} a factor which limits the {{capacity of}} an existing bridge. In their usual configuration, pier caps behave as deep beams and {{have the ability to}} <b>carry</b> <b>load</b> through tied arch action after the formation of diagonal cracks. Externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement has been shown to increase the shear capacity of reinforced concrete members which <b>carry</b> <b>load</b> through beam action. However, there is an insufficient amount of research to make it a viable strengthening system for beams which <b>carry</b> <b>load</b> through arch action, such as pier caps. Accordingly, this research was aimed at investigating the behavior of reinforced concrete pier caps through a coordinated experimental and analytical program and to recommend an external strengthening method for pier caps with perceived deficiencies in shear strength. The experimental study was performed on laboratory specimens based on an existing bridge in Georgia. A number of factors were examined, including size, percentage longitudinal reinforcement and crack control reinforcement. The results showed that increasing the longitudinal tension reinforcement increased the beam capacity by changing the shape of the tied arch. In contrast, the presence of crack control reinforcement did not change the point at which diagonal cracking occurred, but it did increase the ultimate capacity by reinforcing the concrete against splitting. The results of the experimental study were used in conjunction with a larger database to examine different analytical methods for estimating the ultimate capacity of deep beams, and a new method was developed for the design of external strengthening. Two specimens were tested with externally bonded FRP reinforcement applied longitudinally to increase the strength of the tension tie. The test results correlated well with the proposed method of analysis and showed that increasing the strength of the longitudinal tension tie is an effective way to increase the strength of a reinforced concrete deep beam.
