50|$|As {{a member}} of the genus Lecythophora, it is {{considered}} to be poorly differentiated morphologically. Lecythophora hoffmannii colonies range in colour from a pale salmon to a pallid orange, with degenerate strains presenting a creamy white colour. Colonies are also flat, smooth and moist. Collarettes are distinct, yet unpigmented, while conidia are also hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled. The production of slimy, orange to salmon-colored colonies on short adelophialides with cylindrical collarettes can be quite distinct, with ventricose phialide formations less frequent. Narrow and hyaline, hyphae, through the use of small collarettes, produce conidia directly upon them laterally, directly upon the vegetative hyphae. Alternatively, flask-shaped lateral cells, which are practically <b>cylindrical,</b> <b>can</b> serve as the medium through which conidia are produced; they are sometimes found to be arranged in densely packed groups. Conidia are slightly curved, appearing broadly ellipsoidal to cylindrical to bean-shaped; measurements vary from 3.5-7.0 µm in length by 1.0-2.5 µm in width, to 3.0-3.5 µm by 1.5-2.5 µm.|$|E

However, experimental observation indicates that the shapes are often cylindrical.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{research}} of buoy wave power devices, earlier {{studies have indicated that}} the vertical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> absorb the most power from wave by comparing the loading conditions of several buoys (e. g. cuboid, vertical cylindrical, horizontal cylindrical, sphere, and so on) using the Froude-Krylov theory. However, it is not argued the motion response of buoys with the same basal area and the different basal shapes. In this paper, buoys with the same basal area and the different basal shapes are investigated by the mean of simulation. There are two modes for the floating system, one is with mooring line and the other is without. In both cases, the motions in horizontal(x axis) and vertical (z axis) direction will be studied...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The subject study uses ceramic {{materials}} as a circular burnishing-tool {{connected with a}} ring-form electrode to construct a compound circular finishing-tool. In the machining process, the external cylindrical workpiece is put into the compound circular finishing-tool to execute the finishing process by automatic continuity production. By the compound production effects from the electrode and the burnishing-tool, it achieves synchronous execution of multiple effects of electrochemical finishing and burnishing. Thereby rapidly and highly efficiently making improvement on the surface roughness of external cylindrical surface; and by the burnishing process and electrochemical finishing, it enhances the mechanical properties and cleanliness on the materials surface. It is expected that the entire study could make a comprehensive assessment of the compound process characteristics of the circular burnishing-tool and automatic continuity synchronous burnishing and electrochemical finishing, seeking the optimal electrode design and experimental parameters, so that polishing techniques for the external <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> be extensively applied in the future...|$|E
40|$|Empty {{and water}} filled {{cylindrical}} Tin (Sn) coated steel cans were loaded under axial compression at varying loading rates to study their resistance to withstand accidental loads. Compared to empty cans the water filled cans exhibit greater resistance to axially applied compression loads before a complete collapse. The time and load or stroke and load plots showed three significant load peaks related to three stages during loading until the cylinder collapse. First peak {{corresponds to the}} initial structural buckling of can. Second peak occurs when <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> walls gradually come into full contact with water. The third peak shows the maximum load carrying capability of the structure where pressurized water deforms the can walls into curved shape until can walls fail under peak pressure. The collapse process of water filled cylindrical shell was further studied using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique in LSDYNA. Load peaks observed in the experimental work were successfully simulated which substantiated the experimental work...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSome {{difficulties}} {{have arisen}} on appropriate {{design of the}} graphite dies, on applying the DC pulse resistance pressure sintering process, which is more efficient process than other conventional sintering processes such as hot pressing process, to a complex shaped part of non-conductive ceramics powder such as zirconia powder. In the present paper, the non-steady electro-thermo-mechanical finite element analysis of the sintering process of the zirconia <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> was performed. As a result, {{it was found that}} the enough heating of the graphite dies that contacts with zirconia powder, and heat transmission from the die to zirconia powder was essential for the success of the sintering with adequate density. Moreover, the lower density region was found at the inside of the can during the process, which corresponded to the region where the convex shape formed in experiments. Furthermore, the high tensile residual circumferential stress was observed at the side wall from the simulation of the cooling process, which is caused by the different thermal expansion ratio of the graphite and zirconia materials. This stress was considered to be related with the fracture of the can longitudinally during cooling process in experiments...|$|E
40|$|An {{incompressible}} homogeneous fluid {{is contained}} within a circular <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> {{and the whole}} system is rotating uniformly about the axis of the can. In addi-tion the boundary performs small amplitude torsion&l oscillations about the axis of the cylinder; the oscillations of the flat and curved portions of the cylinder may differ in amplitude and frequency. It is shown that either oscillatory Stewarteon layers or a Stokes layer is formed on the curved portion of the cylinder depending upon {{the magnitude of the}} imposed oscillation on that boundary. In addition it is shown that, except when resonant oscillations are present on the flat surfaces of the can, the effects of the curved side wall are restricted to the immediate vicinity of this boundary and elsewhere in the fluid the solutions agree with the solutions obtained by Jaoobs (1) for the laterally unbounded problem. However when the flat surfaces of the can oscillate at the resonant frequency, the presence of the curved side wall introduces a length scale whioh enables an additional boundary layer to be formed on the flat surfaces of the can. Hence a new solution emerges whioh differs from the solution of the laterally unbounded problem every-where in the fluid. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{study of the}} {{dynamics}} of the break-up of curved liquid jets is presented. This work is motivated by an industrial process called prilling which is used in the manufacture of pellets. In this process a sieve-like <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> spins rapidly on its central vertical axis. Molten liquid is pumped into the top of the can and flows from the holes in the form of curved liquid jets. Experiments are described which were carried out on a pilot scale rig. Some differences between the break-up modes observed in this study and previous work using a small laboratory scale rig are discussed. Previous theories describing break-up mechanisms of curved liquid jets were extended to include viscosity and gravity. Break-up lengths and drop sizes were obtained theoretically and compared with experimental results. Experiments were carried out using insonification, a process where sound waves are fired at the jet to control satellite drop formation. Three different frequencies of wave were used, 10, 100 and 200 Hz at four different rotation rates. It was observed that insonification was successful at eliminating satellite drops at low rotation rates and when frequencies of 100 or 200 Hz were used. Insonification was included in the theory. The theory predicted that insonification eliminated satellite drops for a large range of frequencies in the experimental regimes for sufficiently large acoustic volume. The theory also predicted that satellite drops were eliminated in parameter regimes outside the experimental regimes. The trajectory of the jet was allowed to become unsteady, in a rotating frame of reference. Simulations were carried out in inviscid and viscous regimes.
