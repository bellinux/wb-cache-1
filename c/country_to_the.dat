During World War II, Germany's Nazi regime sent millions of deportees from every European <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concentration camps it {{set up in the}} General Government in occupied Poland. Soon after war had broken out, the Germans began their extermination of Polish Jews, ethnic Polish, Romani, Russians, Czech, and others minorities of Poland. Most were quickly rounded up and imprisoned in ghettos, which they were forbidden to leave.|$|E

5|$|The rivers {{played a}} leading role in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes.

5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers, the II Corps {{had three}} options: to {{pass to the}} east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, {{although}} water would be a problem in that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, to try to get to the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dire's greater {{experience}} {{over long}} distances, it was Kiplagat who forged {{ahead in the}} last kilometre and she won the race with ten seconds to spare over her Ethiopian rival. Arusei was the third across the line half a minute later, while Feyse Tadese, Joyce Chepkirui, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola took places 4–7 around one minute behind the winner. It was Arusei's clear third place which proved {{the difference between the}} top African teams, as Kenya won the team gold by a margin of 34 seconds over Ethiopia. A strong final phase saw Zhu Xiaolin take eighth place for the hosts, which was the best non-African individual performance that year. Japan's Yoshimi Ozaki and Ryoko Kizaki were immediately behind her, failing to get a top eight finish but yet again leading the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team bronze with a buffer of over six minutes between them and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Edward II's close {{relationship}} to Gaveston {{had been a}} source of conflict at court, and Gaveston's execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of civil war. As Edmund came of age, he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to sign this treaty. Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in Avignon, where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set of restrictions imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway {{was very}} {{important}} to Germany for two reasons: firstly as a base for naval units to harass Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less than a day, becoming the briefest invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, leaving the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the <b>country,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the <b>country.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions {{to find the}} Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois <b>Country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom, and this continued through the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army became the VKJ. The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. For example, Yugoslav infantry divisions had twice the number of men of contemporary British infantry divisions. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all aspects of}} the land that is now Scotland, including physical and human, between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what are now the southern borders of the <b>country,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland was defined by its physical geography, with its long coastline of inlets, islands and inland lochs, high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall. It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions, which were subdivided by geological features including fault lines, mountains, hills, bogs and marshes. This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification, but also for invading armies.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the <b>country,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> delight of the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as {{an officer in the}} Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered her belief in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E

5|$|The {{volatility}} of the Dominican situation was severe at the time: Luperón fought a guerrilla {{war against the}} Spanish and Santana and became vice-president of the country (in 1863), only to be exiled to Saint Thomas because of his opposition to president Buenaventura Báez' wishes to annex the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States (in 1864), to later return, provoke a coup d'état {{and be part of}} a three-way presidency (1866), only to be exiled once again (1868).

5|$|Throughout the 1860s, one of Heliade's main {{interests}} was {{an investigation}} into the issues involving Romanian history during the origin of the Romanians and the early medieval history of the Danubian Principalities. At a time when, in Moldavia, the newly surfaced Chronicle of Huru traced a political lineage of the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire through the means of a narrative which was later proven to be entirely fictional, Heliade made use of its theses to draw similar conclusions regarding Wallachia. His conservative views were thus expanded to the level of historiographic thesis: according to Heliade, boyars had been an egalitarian and permeable class, which, from as early as the times of Radu Negru, had adopted humane laws that announced and welcomed those of the French Revolution (he notably claimed that the county-based administration was a democratic one, and that it had been copied from the Israelite model as depicted in the Bible).|$|E
5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is narrow {{in the north}} and west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time, but elsewhere in the country, the landscape is rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus it tends to be mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E
