40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine if two personality factors, egocentricity and paranormal belief, influenced people’s assertions about ostensible psychic factors involved in <b>coincidences.</b> Participants (N = 75) were presented with six <b>coincidences</b> from two literary sources (Jung, 1973; Plimmer & King, 2004), and {{were then asked to}} rate them on degree of paranormality. Since some people believe that some <b>coincidences</b> are too astounding to have normal explanations, it was theorised that there is a relationship between paranormal belief and attribution of psychic causes to <b>coincidences.</b> The egocentricity bias is a bias brought about by egocentrism, which is defined as the belief that another person’s perceptions and knowledge bases are the same as one’s own (Falk, 1989). It was theorised that egocentricity influences the degree to which <b>coincidences</b> are thought to be caused by psychic factors. In the present study, egocentricity was measured on the Selfism Scale (Phares & Erskine, 1984). Participants were divided into ‘High’-, ‘Medium’-, and ‘Low’-Selfism groups, and were designated paranormal believers (sheep), or paranormal nonbelievers (goats), based on Australian Sheep-Goat Scale scores (Thalbourne, 1995 a,b). The High-Selfism group rated the <b>coincidences</b> higher on paranormality than the other two groups, and there was a sheep-goat effect (sheep rated the <b>coincidences</b> higher on paranormality than goats).

40|$|Purpose: Triple <b>coincidences</b> in {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) are events in which three γ-rays are detected simultaneously. These events, though potentially useful for enhancing the sensitivity of PET scanners, are discarded or processed without special consideration in current systems, because {{there is not a}} clear criterion for assigning them to a unique line-of-response (LOR). Methods proposed for recovering such events usually rely on the use of highly specialized detection systems, hampering general adoption, and/or are based on Compton-scatter kinematics and, consequently, are limited in accuracy by the energy resolution of standard PET detectors. In this work, the authors propose a simple and general solution for recovering triple <b>coincidences,</b> which does not require specialized detectors or additional energy resolution requirements. Methods: To recover triple <b>coincidences,</b> the authors’ method distributes such events among their possible LORs using the relative proportions of double <b>coincidences</b> in these LORs. The authors show analytically that this assignment scheme represents the maximum-likelihood solution for the triple-coincidence distribution problem. The PET component of a preclinical PET/CT scanner was adapted to enable the acquisition and processing of triple <b>coincidences.</b> Since the efficiencies for detecting double and triple events were found to be different throughout the scanner field-of-view, a normalization procedure specific for triple <b>coincidences</b> was also developed. The effect of including triple <b>coincidences</b> using their method was compared against the cases of equally weighting the triples among their possible LORs and discarding all the triple events. The authors used as figures of merit for this comparison sensitivity, noise-equivalent count (NEC) rates and image quality calculated as described in the NEMA NU- 4 protocol for the assessment of preclinical PET scanners. Results: The addition of triple-coincidence events with the authors’ method increased peak NEC rates of the scanner by 26. 6 % and 32 % for mouse- and rat-sized objects, respectively. This increase in NEC-rate performance was also reflected in the image-quality metrics. Images reconstructed using double and triple <b>coincidences</b> recovered using their method had better signal-to-noise ratio than those obtained using only double <b>coincidences,</b> while preserving spatial resolution and contrast. Distribution of triple <b>coincidences</b> using an equal-weighting scheme increased apparent system sensitivity but degraded image quality. The performance boost provided by the inclusion of triple <b>coincidences</b> using their method allowed to reduce the acquisition time of standard imaging procedures by up to ∼ 25 %. Conclusions: Recovering triple <b>coincidences</b> with the proposed method can effectively increase the sensitivity of current clinical and preclinical PET systems without compromising other parameters like spatial resolution or contrast.
