40|$|According to the {{literature}} data, the prevalence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy ranges between 6 and 36 %. The etiological factor is intimal hyperplasia for early period, whereas it is atherosclerosis for late period. A 67 -year-old male patient admitted to our clinic {{with a history of}} headache and minor stroke. His medical history was significant for right carotid endarterectomy 8 years ago. Recent Doppler ultrasound and digital substraction angiography revealed 75 % stenosis and kinking <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> distal to the endarterectomy region. Surgical endarterectomy is the treatment of choice in critical carotid stenosis. Endovascular therapy is primarily considered for patients if there is restenosis after carotid endarterectomy.

We have studied the structure and lipid–protein interactions of the synthetic peptides BpH, with sequence <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> 111 – 135 of proSP-B, and BpH-W, bearing the conservative substitution F 127 W to use the tryptophan as an intrinsic fluorescent probe. Peptide BpH-W interacts with both zwitterionic and anionic phospholipid vesicles at neutral pH, as monitored by the blue-shifted maximum emission of its tryptophan reporter. Insertion of tryptophan into the membranes is further improved at pH 5. 0, especially in negatively-charged membranes. Peptides BpH and BpH-W also showed pH-dependent properties to insert into phospholipid monolayers. We have {{also found that the}} single sequence variation F 120 K decreases substantially the interaction of this segment with phospholipid surfaces as well as its pH-dependent insertion into deeper regions of the membranes. We hypothesize that this region could be involved in pH-triggered conformational changes occurring in proSP-B along the exocytic pathway of surfactant in type II cells, leading to the exposure of the appropriate segments for processing and assembly of SP-B within surfactant lipids...|$|E

40|$|Limited {{proteolysis}} of beta- 1, 3 -glucanase A 1 {{by three}} different proteases, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain, gave three major active fragments. The sizes {{of the three}} major fragments generated by each protease treatment were identical to those of beta- 1, 3 -glucanase A 2, A 3, and A 4 detected in both the culture supernatant of Bacillus circulans WL- 12 and the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli carrying a cloned glcA gene. These results indicate a four-domain structure for the enzyme. At the N terminus of the glucanase, duplicated segments of approximately 100 amino acids were observed. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the active fragments with sizes corresponding to those of A 2 and A 3 lack the first segment (domain) and both duplicated segments (domains), respectively. The fragment corresponding to A 4 lacks both duplicated segments and the following ca. 120 -amino-acid region. By losing the first, second, and third (<b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> of 120 amino acids) domains, beta- 1, 3 -glucanase progressively lost the ability to bind to pachyman, beta- 1, 3 -glucan. An active fragment which did not have the three N-terminal domains did not show significant binding to pachyman. Thus, all three N-terminal domains contribute to binding to beta- 1, 3 -glucan, and the presence of three domains confers the highest binding activity on the glucanase. The loss of these binding domains remarkably decreased pachyman-hydrolyzing activity, indicating that the binding activity is essential for the efficient hydrolysis of insoluble beta- 1, 3 -glucan...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an automated system based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) injectors for reliable mass-injection of Drosophila embryos. Targeted applications are high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screens. Our injection needles are made of silicon nitride. The liquid to be injected is stored in an integrated 500 nl reservoir, and an externally applied air pressure pulse precisely controls the injected volume. A steady-state water flow rate per applied pressure of 1. 2 nl s 21 bar 21 was measured for a needle with channel width, height and length of 6. 1 mm, 2. 3 mm and 350 mm, respectively. A typical volume of 60 pl per embryo can be reliably and rapidly delivered within tens of milliseconds. Theoretical predictions of flow rates match measured values within ¡ 10 %. Embryos are attached to a glass slide surface and covered with oil. Packages with the injector chip and the embryo slide are mounted on motorized xyz-stages. Two cameras allow the user to quickly align the needle tip to alignment marks on the glass slide. Our system then automatically screens the glass slide for embryos and reliably detects and injects more than 98 % of all embryos. Survival rates after deionized (DI) water injection of 80 % and higher were achieved.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the complex of lactoperoxidase (LPO) with its physiological substrate thiocyanate (SCN–) has been determined at 2. 4 Å resolution. It revealed that the SCN– ion is bound to LPO in the distal heme cavity. The observed orientation of the SCN– ion shows that the sulfur atom {{is closer to the}} heme iron than the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom of SCN– forms a hydrogen bond with a water (Wat) molecule at position 6 ′. This water molecule is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with Gln 423 Nε 2 and Phe 422 oxygen. In contrast, the placement of the SCN– ion in the structure of myeloperoxidase (MPO) occurs with an opposite orientation, in which the nitrogen atom is closer to the heme iron than the sulfur atom. The site corresponding to the positions of Gln 423, Phe 422 oxygen, and Wat 6 ′ in LPO is occupied primarily by the side chain of Phe 407 in MPO due to an entirely different conformation of the loop <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> Arg 418 –Phe 431 of LPO. This arrangement in MPO does not favor a similar orientation of the SCN– ion.

40|$|Previous {{research}} showing systematic localisation errors in touch perception related to eye and head position {{has suggested that}} touch is at least partially localised in a visual reference frame. However, many previous studies had participants report the location of tactile stimuli relative to a visual probe, which may force coding into a visual reference. Also, the visual probe could itself be subject to an effect of eye or head position. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} assess the perceived position of a tactile stimulus using a within-modality measure in order to make definitive conclusions about the coordinate system in which touch might be coded. Here, we present a novel method for measuring the perceived location of a touch in body coordinates: the Segmented Space Method (SSM). In the SSM participants imagine the region within which the stimulus could be presented divided into several equally spaced, and numbered, segments. Participants then simply report the number <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> in which they perceived the stimulus. The SSM represents a simple and novel method that can be easily extended to other modalities by dividing any response space into numbered segments centred on some appropriate reference point (e. g. the head, the torso, the hand, or some point in space off the body). Here we apply SSM to the forearm during eccentric viewing and report localisation errors for touch similar to those previously reported using a crossmodal comparison. The data collected with the SSM strengthen the theory that tactile spatial localisation is generally coded in a visual reference frame even when visual coding is not required by the task...|$|E

Also let $\kappa= 16 /\gamma^ 2 > 4 $ and let $\eta$ be a whole-plane space-filling SLE$_\kappa$ curve independent from $h$ and parametrized by $\gamma$-quantum mass {{with respect to}} $h$. We study a family $\{\mathcal G^\epsilon\}_{\epsilon> 0 }$ of planar maps associated with $(h,\eta) $ called the LQG structure graphs (a. k. a. mated-CRT maps) which we conjecture converge in probability in the scaling limit {{with respect to the}} Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a random metric space associated with $\gamma$-LQG. In particular, $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ is the graph whose vertex set is $\epsilon \mathbb Z$, with two such vertices $x_ 1,x_ 2 \in\epsilon\mathbb Z$ connected by an edge iff the curve segments $\eta([x_ 1 -\epsilon,x_ 1]) $ and $\eta([x_ 2 -\epsilon,x_ 2]) $ share a non-trivial boundary arc. Due to the peanosphere description of SLE-decorated LQG due to Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield, the graph $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ can be expressed as an explicit functional of a correlated 2 d Brownian motion, so can be studied without any reference to SLE or LQG. We prove non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph-distance ball in $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ which are consistent with the prediction of Watabiki for the dimension of LQG. Using subadditivity arguments, we also prove that there is an exponent $\chi> 0 $ for which the expected graph distance between generic points in the subgraph of $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> $\eta([0, 1]) $ is $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1) }$, and this distance is extremely unlikely to be larger than $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1) }$.

40|$|A nonproducer {{lymphoblastoid}} {{cell line}} (7710) containing the herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) genome was established from the HVS-positive spleen of a male, inbred New Zealand White rabbit (III/J strain) which {{had developed a}} well-differentiated lymphoma after inoculation of HVS and 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Antibodies to HVS early and late antigens were detected in the serum of rabbit 7710 by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. The cell line was of T-cell origin, did not produce HVS, {{and could not be}} superinfected with HVS. However, HVS early antigens could be induced in the cells with n-butyric acid and TPA or TPA alone. On the other hand, late antigens were never observed, and infectious virus could not be rescued by cocultivation of 7710 cell with OMK cells. The 7710 cells were T-cell growth factor dependent, even after many in vitro passages. The 7710 cell line contained multiple copies of a nonintegrated, covalently closed circular HVS genome. As is characteristic of some other HVS-transformed nonproducer lymphoid cell lines, a large segment of unique light (L) DNA was missing in the persistent circular viral DNA present in 7710 cells. This deletion spanned at least 42. 5 kilobases, <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> between 12. 3 and 50. 7 map units of full-length, infectious virion L-DNA. The 7710 cells failed to induce tumors in athymic nude mice, but inbred rabbits inoculated with as few as 100 of these cells developed fatal lymphomas. Chromosomal analysis showed that tumors were due to the growth of donor cells. Cells recovered from one of the rabbits inoculated with 7710 cells also contained HVS DNA and, after in vitro culture, induced the same type of lymphoma when inoculated into two other III/J-strain rabbits. None of the previously described HVS-transformed cell lines have been able to induce tumors in either their host species or nude mice. Thus, our demonstration that the 7710 cell line is readily transplantable in syngeneic rabbits represents the first available model which allows analysis of many biological and molecular aspects of the in vivo oncogenicity of HVS...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} (a) to formulate an efficient and cost effective medium {{for the production of}} proteolytic enzyme(s), and (b) to isolate, purify and characterize new proteolytic enzyme(s) from an indigenous strain of Bacillus subtilis by employing ammonium sulphate fractionation, anion exchange chromatography and cation exchange FPLC. The work presented here reports the primary structure of a variant of subtilisin from Bacillus subills strain RT- 5. Successive fractionations and chromatographies of cell free troth resulted in the isolation of a purified alkaline serine protease subsequently named subtilisin RT- 5. Separation of alkaline and neutral proteases on anion exchanger led to the realization that this approach provides an efficient means of separating the two proteases from each other. The complete primary structure of subtilisin RT- 5 has been established by a combination of direct sequence analysis of the intact protein, digestion and peptide analysis and DNA sequence analysis of PCR-produced fragment <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>segment</b> not recovered in the protein digest. The enzyme consists of 275 amino acid residues. It shows 97 % homology to mesentericopeptidase with 5 exchanges and 87 % homology to subtilisin Novo with 40 amino acid replacements. Though the physico-chemical properties 01 subtilisin RT- 5 {{are similar to those of}} subtilisin Novo, its catalytic efficiency has been found to be 40 fold higher than that of subtilisin Novo. The catalytic prowess of subtilisin RT- 5 might be due to the amino acid replacements in the region around the active site His 64. The isolated enzyme is closely related to mesentericopeptidase, but it is important to note that this closest homologue is thermolabile suggesting that the replacements of Ala by Ser at positions 85, 89 & 183, and Ser by Ala and Asn at positions 88 & 259 respectively in subtilisin RT- 5 might be responsible for its thermostability.
