The setup of railway platforms, use of grade crossing signals and horn blasts {{make up a}} <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> used to communicate movements of commuter trains to pedestrians and vehicles. Outside of these operational components, Metra aggressively pursues safety through public awareness. Metra utilizes its own Operation Lifesaver program and uses it to help spread safety messages. Metra also holds events promoting rail safety at schools and organizes a safety poster contest awarding winners with prizes and features their poster on monthly passes and at stations.|$|E

Characters can be thrown into the series' signature Danger Zones or over a cliff in the multi-level stages; this initiates another new feature, which is a cinematic quick time event called Cliffhanger. With Cliffhanger, if a character can grab onto the stage {{at the last moment}} before falling into a lower level, an action sequence is activated where the opponent character can make an effort to inflict even more damage if the attack succeeds. The game's <b>Critical</b> <b>System</b> features Critical Stuns (after having been hit with specific moves, opponent characters get stunned and are unable to block, but can still perform holds), Critical Combos (striking a character in a Critical Stun state can prolong the amount of time they remain stunned, but the damage that can be inflicted this way is limited) and Critical Bursts (specific strikes over the damage limit of successful Critical Combos that leave the target character completely defenseless for a short while).|$|E

Over the medium term (often taken to be 10 years) and the long term (which can go into 50-60 year timescales), the planning for Mission <b>Critical</b> <b>Systems</b> will clearly differ from short-term Mission <b>Critical</b> <b>Systems</b> planning.

"It doesn't in {{the least}} matter, you know, what you think," [...] Mrs. Farange loudly replied; [...] "and you had better indeed for the future, miss, learn to keep your {{thoughts}} to yourself." [...] This was exactly what Maisie had already learned, and the accomplishment was just the source of her mother's irritation. It was of a horrid little <b>critical</b> <b>system,</b> a tendency, in her silence, to judge her elders, that this lady suspected her, liking as she did, for her own part, a child to be simple and confiding. She liked also to hear {{the report of the}} whacks she administered to Mr. Farange's character, to his pretensions to peace of mind: the satisfaction of dealing them diminished when nothing came back. The day was at hand, and she saw it, when she should feel more delight in hurling Maisie at him than in snatching her away; so much so that her conscience winced under the acuteness of a candid friend who had remarked that the real end of all their tugging would be that each parent would try to make the little girl a burden to the other--a sort of game in which a fond mother clearly wouldn't show to advantage. The prospect of not showing to advantage, a distinction in which she held she had never failed, begot in Ida Farange an ill humour of which several persons felt the effect. She determined that Beale at any rate should feel it; she reflected afresh that in the study of how to be odious to him she must never give way. Nothing could incommode him more than not to get the good, for the child, of a nice female appendage who had clearly taken a fancy to her. One of the things Ida said to the appendage was that Beale's was a house in which no decent woman could consent to be seen. It was Miss Overmore herself who explained to Maisie that she had had a hope of being allowed to accompany her to her father's, and that this hope had been dashed by the way her mother took it. [...] "She says that if I ever do such a thing as enter his service I must never expect to show my face in this house again. So I've promised not to attempt to go with you. If I wait patiently till you come back here we shall certainly be together once more." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of critical systems: mission critical, business critical, safety critical and security critical. The key difference between a safety <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> and mission <b>critical</b> <b>system,</b> is that safety <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> is a system that, if it fails, may result in serious environmental damage, injury, or loss of life, while mission <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> may result in failure in goal-directed activity. An example of a safety <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> is a chemical manufacturing plant control system. Mission <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> and business <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> are similar terms, but a business <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> fault can influence only a single company or an organization and can partially stop lifetime activity (hours or days). So it {{also can be used}} as a mission <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> in the business. Failure of it will cause very high cost loss for the business. Security <b>critical</b> <b>system</b> may lead to loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss. All these four systems are generalized as <b>critical</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
