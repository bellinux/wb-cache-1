The oxide layers were grown {{on a set of}} coupons over 77 and 560 h periods in static stainless steel conditioned autoclaves at 260 °C simulating AVT conditions: I) degassed (hydrazine + ethanolamine) solution and II) degassed (hydrazine + morpholine) solution. The oxide films were studied using SEM, DRX and <b>chemical</b> <b>descaling</b> to evaluate metal corrosion, adherent oxide thickness and oxide release. Up to 560 h of testing, the samples exposed to medium I) showed a slightly lower metal corrosion and oxide release, although of the same order of magnitude for the two media...|$|E
40|$|Wires of SAE 1008 steel, {{processed}} in the coil-forming head at two different temperatures {{to optimize the}} scale, were studied. It is relevant determine {{the impact of the}} changes of hot rolling process conditions in order to predict the mechanical properties of the final product. The structural characteristics of the steel wire and the scale layers generated during the processing conditions are evaluated. The structural study was carried out by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Grain size and the phases percentage in the steel are determined. In addition, the phases present and layer thicknesses in the scale, are determined. Microhardness profiles on the product structure allows evaluating the effect of process conditions on the product. 8 % variation in the coil forming temperature not produce structural changes or behavior in the steel product.

40|$|NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) {{recently}} {{entered into}} a nonexclusive license agreement with Applied Cryogenic Solutions (ACS), Inc. (Galveston, TX) to commercialize its Gas-Liquid Supersonic Cleaning and Cleaning Verification Spray System technology. This technology, developed by KSC, is {{a critical component of}} processes being developed and commercialized by ACS to replace current mechanical and <b>chemical</b> cleaning and <b>descaling</b> methods used by numerous industries. Pilot trials on heat exchanger tubing components have shown that the ACS technology provides for: Superior cleaning in a much shorter period of time. Lower energy and labor requirements for cleaning and de-scaling uper. ninih. Significant reductions in waste volumes by not using water, acidic or basic solutions, organic solvents, or nonvolatile solid abrasives as components in the cleaning process. Improved energy efficiency in post-cleaning heat exchanger operations. The ACS process consists of a spray head containing supersonic converging/diverging nozzles, a source of liquid gas; a novel, proprietary pumping system that permits pumping liquid nitrogen, liquid air, or supercritical carbon dioxide to pressures in the range of 20, 000 to 60, 000 psi; and various hoses, fittings, valves, and gauges. The size and number of nozzles can be varied so the system can be built in configurations ranging from small hand-held spray heads to large multinozzle cleaners. The system also can be used to verify if a part has been adequately cleaned...|$|R
40|$|Ornamental bulbous {{plants have}} great {{value in the}} world {{floriculture}} industry and gladiolus possesses prominent position among them. Gladiolus plant is mainly grown for its flower spike {{but it can be}} used as an bedding and potting plant. The increase in demand of its spikes needs continuous cultivation to meet the market demands throughout the year but occurrence of dormancy in corms limits its cultivation to only one growing season in a year. Various chemicals were used to break corms dormancy and their effect on corm health was also studied. The effect of important factors which affects the breaking of corm dormancy including corm source, scales and varieties was studied. Among treatments the soaking of dormant corms in different concentrations of methanol in combination with plant growth regulators (gibberellic acid, 6 -benzylaminopurine and indole acetic acid) was effective to break corm dormancy rather than individual application of <b>chemicals.</b> The <b>descaled</b> corms responded better to application of chemicals than the scaled ones. In another set of chemical treatments, the combined application of gibberellic acid with benzylaminopurine enhanced their effect to get the maximum germination percentage under controlled conditions of temperature at 26 oC in complete darkness. The combination of gibberellic acid with benzylaminopurine was found the best from the initial experiments and this combination was used to break corm dormancy under field conditions. The germination percentage increased as the concentration of gibberellic acid in combination with benzylaminopurine increased. The chemical analysis of treated and non treated corms revealed that there was maximum increase in total soluble sugars (6. 98 mg/g), gibberellic acid content (112. 80 ηg/g) and decrease in starch content (22. 25 mg/g), total phenolic content (91. 57 μg/g) and abscisic acid (27. 32 ηg/g) was recorded in treated corms. In {{the second part of the}} study, foliar application of gibberellic acid, 6 -benzylaminopurine and salicylic acid was done at three different stages of growth of gladiolus plants. The plants which received foliar application of gibberellic acid showed an improvement in their vegetative characters i. e. the maximum increase in plant height (122. 14 cm), spike length (58. 41 cm), number of florets (13. 49), corm diameter (4. 43 cm), corm weight (25. 34 g), number of cormels plant- 1 (75. 64), cormel weight plant- 1 (20. 45 g), and also the chemical constituents of leaves including, chlorophyll content (7. 72 mg/g), total carotenoids (1. 61 mg/g), total soluble sugars (3. 68 mg/g), nitrogen (1. 52 %), phosphorus (0. 28 %) and potassium (0. 64 %). Whereas benzylaminopurine application increased the spike diameter (7. 23 mm) and salicylic acid application acted to decrease the number of days to flower (64. 93) and total phenolic content (0. 62 mg/g) of leaf compared to control plants. The foliar application of polyamines (putrescine and spermine) and vitamins (ascorbic acid and thiamine) at 0. 1, 0. 4, 0. 7 and 1 mM concentrations improved the morphological and physiological parameters. Putrescine application at 1 mM concentration resulted in increased morphological parameters, the plant height (107. 85 cm), spike length (53. 19 cm), spike diameter (7. 53 mm), florets spike- 1 (13. 99), 1 st floret diameter (9. 66 cm), floret weight (4. 90 g), corm diameter (4. 57 cm) corm weight (26. 16 g), cormels plant- 1 (80. 86), cormel weight (23. 03 g) and also improved the physiological attributes like chlorophyll content (8. 06 mg/g), total carotenoids (1. 66 mg/g), total phenolic content (0. 89 mg/g), total soluble sugars (4. 75 mg/g), nitrogen (1. 42 %), phosphorus (0. 27 %) and potassium (0. 84 %). Thus foliar application of gibberellic acid and putrescine is helpful to improve the economically valuable characteristics of gladiolus plant which may helpful for gladiolus growers to fetch more price in the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of insoluble corrosion {{products in the}} HRT is generally understood and studies of the removal of these solids by hydroclones can logically be terminated after the effect of higher processing rates by the multiple hydroclone has been determined. <b>Chemical</b> <b>descaling</b> {{may be required to}} supplement solids removal by hydroclones. Laboratory studies to find suitable reagents will be continued in conjunction with decontamination work presently in progress. Rare earth solubility levels and thus poison fraction from this group will be measured after the addition of signiflcant quantities of four important elements has minimized analytical detection problems. The role of the tellurium precursor in the interpretation of iodine behavior will be eximined extensively in the present run in an effort to resolve previous discrepancies. Studies of iodine behavior can be continued after shutdown of the hydroclone system if required.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} an {{austenitic stainless steel}} (UNS S 30400) has been characterized in a 10, 000 hour test conducted in hydrogenated, ammoniated water at 260 C. The corrosion kinetics were observed to follow a parabolic rate dependency, the parabolic rate constant being determined by <b>chemical</b> <b>descaling</b> to be 1. 16 mg dm{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 / 2 }. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with argon ion milling and target factor analysis, was applied to provide an independent estimate of the rate constant that agreed with the gravimetric result. Based {{on the distribution of}} the three oxidized alloying constituents (Fe, Cr, Ni) with respect to depth and elemental state, it was found that: (a) corrosion occurs in a non-selective manner, and (b) the corrosion film consists of two spinel oxide layers [...] a ferrite-based outer layer (Ni{sub 0. 2 }Fe{sub 0. 8 }) (Fe{sub 0. 95 }Cr{sub 0. 05 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 } on top of a chromite-based inner layer (Ni{sub 0. 2 }Fe{sub 0. 8 }) (Cr{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }. These compositions agree closely with the solvi phases created by immiscibility in the Fe{sub 3 }O{sub 4 }-FeCr{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } binary, implying that immiscibility {{plays an important role in}} the phase separation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} Alloy 600 (UNS N 06600) is investigated in hydrogenated water at 260 C. The corrosion kinetics are observed to be parabolic, the parabolic rate constant being determined by <b>chemical</b> <b>descaling</b> to be 0. 055 mg dm{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 / 2 }. A combination of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, supplemented by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, {{are used to}} identify the oxide phases present (i. e., spinel) and to characterize their morphology and thickness. Two oxide layers are identified: an outer, ferrite-rich layer and an inner, chromite-rich layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with argon ion milling and target factor analysis is applied to determine spinel stoichiometry; the inner layer is (Ni{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }) (Fe{sub 0. 3 }Cr{sub 0. 7 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }, while the outer layer is (Ni{sub 0. 9 }Fe{sub 0. 1 }) (Fe{sub 0. 85 }Cr{sub 0. 15 }) {sub 2 }O{sub 4 }. The distribution of trivalent iron and chromium cations in {{the inner and outer}} oxide layers is essentially the same as that found previously in stainless steel corrosion oxides, thus confirming their invariant nature as solvi in the immiscible spinel binary Fe{sub 3 }O{sub 4 }-FeCr{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } (or NiFe{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }-NiCr{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }). Although oxidation occurred non-selectively, excess quantities of nickel(II) oxide were not found. Instead, the excess nickel was accounted for as recrystallized nickel metal in the inner layer, as additional nickel ferrite in the outer layer, formed by pickup of iron ions from the aqueous phase, and by selective release to the aqueous phase...|$|E
