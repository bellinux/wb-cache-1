5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the <b>card</b> <b>machine</b> lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, {{many aspects of}} his story were changed in their {{transition}} to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings {{about the end of the}} organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch <b>card</b> <b>machine</b> to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and twisting machine for produce eri fiber and yarn. A <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and twisted in twisting machine. Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of <b>carding</b> <b>machine,</b> it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From twisting machine testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, <b>carding</b> <b>machine</b> and twisting machine developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R
