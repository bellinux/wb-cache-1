5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E

Since 2005 the organization has published Iran's first online magazine on women's rights, Zanestan, with Ardalan as its editor.

500|$|About {{the nude}} {{women in the}} video, an MTV UK {{reviewer}} said that Timberlake drew on Thicke's video. The Huffington Posts Sarah Dean wrote that Timberlake used a tip from Thicke to accompany a [...] "great" [...] song with a video objectifying women who enjoy dancing nude, criticizing the use of three women for a song with lyrics about a single love interest. According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, Timberlake wanted to live his life and celebrate his album's success: [...] "Oh, come on! Don't complain. You bitched and moaned endlessly when Justin Timberlake stopped making music for six years, so don't get all Veruca Salty when he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> boobs to spare and boobs to share." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the video}} ended, she then {{came on the}} stage wearing a tutu shaped dress with pointed {{shoulder}} pads and peplum. Her dancers were clad in Louis Vuitton Steven Sprouse printed trousers which matched Gaga's shoes. The backdrop changed to show blinking disco lights and Gaga {{stood in the center}} wearing her video sunglasses which display the line [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the intro for [...] "Just Dance" [...] started and Gaga was joined by her dancers on stage. When the song shifts to the bridge, Gaga once again is handed her disco stick and performs the bridge with it. The ending shifts to a remixed version of the song. Then Gaga and the dancers, joined by DJ Space Cowboy or DJ Nicodemus, take a bow in front of the audience. Gaga <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> her dance to perform the encore. The encore of the tour consisted of [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys" [...] and the original version of [...] "Poker Face". Gaga was dressed in a khaki leotard embellished with crystals. She wore an admiral's cap and gloves on her hands, both were decorated with the word Gaga on them.|$|E

500|$|He next {{starred in}} Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and {{produced}} by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, [...] "You tell him, 'Okay, you're {{going to play}} a pot dealer', and he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy". In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: [...] "He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious". His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|... 1767: A {{number of}} {{prominent}} Birmingham businessmen, including Matthew Boulton {{and others from}} the Lunar Society, hold a public meeting in the White Swan, High Street, {{to consider the possibility}} of building a canal from Birmingham to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal near Wolverhampton, taking in the coalfields of the Black Country. They commission the canal engineer James Brindley to propose a route. Brindley <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a largely level route via Smethwick, Oldbury, Tipton, Bilston and Wolverhampton to Aldersley. This kick-starts what is to become the Birmingham Canal Navigations.|$|E

2500|$|Hours later, both {{return to}} Walkinshaw's parlour, exhausted. [...] Jenny's father {{has called the}} doctors to report that Foggerty has gone mad. [...] He instructs Walkinshaw to keep him there until he can be hauled off to the asylum, but Walkinshaw hides from Malvina. [...] Threatened with a suit for {{staggering}} damages, and having lost Jenny, Foggerty decides to marry Malvina. [...] He also explains to Malvina that he has lost his memory of the past. [...] Talbot <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the doctors and Blogg, an asylum attendant. [...] Blogg is instructed to stay and watch Foggerty but not to contradict him in any way. [...] Foggerty deduces that Blogg is a policeman, {{and by the time}} he finishes asking Blogg about the crime that he himself must have committed, he thinks that he and Walkinshaw murdered the latter's aunt. [...] Now he believes that he will be [...] "hanged first and confined in a lunatic asylum afterwards".|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{scenario}} basis, the {{clue to the}} phenomenal success {{of the project was}} the work of Ivan Okhlobystin himself: his doctor, Andrei Evgenievich Bykov, the head of the therapeutic department of the hospital {{and the head of the}} internship department, is the central figure of the entire movie, and the importance of this personality is so big that the rest of the hospital employees and, in fact, the interns themselves, seem to be a kind of [...] "Bykov's army", corresponding to one of several traits of his character. Okhlobystin, through a [...] "paradoxical and ironic rationalism with which he tends to percept the reality," [...] according to a TV critic Valery Zaitsev, creates around him a special, [...] "Okhbystin" [...] space. In a way he reminds very much Hugh Laurie, the British actor playing the main role in the American television series Doctor House. [...] However, the similarity ends there: the character of Okhlobystin, as well as the mentality of all the TV series shot by TNT, is purely Russian, full of love, respect and tenderness as to the profession of the doctor and human suffering. It's no accident that Dr. Bykov regularly [...] "mocks" [...] at a foreign colleague, and in one of the first episodes, having learned that the tiresome intern Levin, just like House, is going to treat rare and complex illnesses, he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a question: who is going then to treat ordinary patients, filling up the hospitals? ...|$|E
2500|$|When Edmund {{reveals that}} he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and {{attempts}} to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and most importantly {{the severity of the}} situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.|$|E
