5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Curing</b> <b>salt,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "Prague powder" [...] or [...] "pink salt", is {{typically}} a combination of sodium chloride and sodium nitrite that is dyed pink to distinguish it from table salt.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Frankfurters {{were made}} without nitrite <b>curing</b> <b>salt.</b> After the special ageing and smoking methods, the sausages, now {{of a golden}} colour, are put into wooden boxes with small {{parchment}} paper between layers. Therefore, the traditional sausages are square in shape {{but there are a}} few exceptions where the sausage is circular.|$|E
5000|$|The second <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> blend {{is called}} [...] "prague powder II" [...] or [...] "insta-cure #2". Also colored pink to {{differentiate}} it from table salt, this blend is produced from salt and sodium nitrate. This mixture {{is used for}} dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>curing</b> <b>salts</b> often {{specific}} to a country or region.|$|R
50|$|<b>Curing</b> <b>salts</b> {{are used}} in food {{preservation}} to prevent or slow spoilage by bacteria or fungus. Generally they are used for pickling meats {{as part of the}} process to make sausage or <b>cured</b> meat. <b>Curing</b> <b>salts</b> are generally a mixture of table salt and sodium nitrite, which serves to inhibit the growth of bacteria, specifically Clostridium botulinum in an effort to prevent botulism, and helps preserve the color of cured meat. Many also contain red dye that makes them pink to prevent them from being confused with common table <b>salt.</b> <b>Curing</b> <b>salts</b> are {{not to be confused with}} Himalayan pink salt, which is pure salt with trace elements that give it a pink color.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common curing salts. It is also called Insta Cure #1 or Pink <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> #1. It {{contains}} 6.25% sodium nitrite and 93.75% table salt. It is recommended for meats that require short cures and will be cooked and eaten relatively quickly. Sodium nitrite provides the characteristic flavor and color associated with curing.|$|E
50|$|Summer sausage is any sausage {{that can}} be kept without refrigeration. Summer sausage is usually a mixture of pork and other meat such as beef or venison. Summer sausage can be dried or smoked, and while curing {{ingredients}} vary significantly, <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> is almost always used. Seasonings may include mustard seeds, black pepper, garlic salt, or sugar.|$|E
50|$|Also called Pink <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> #2. It {{contains}} 6.25% sodium nitrite, 4% {{sodium nitrate}}, and 89.75% table salt. The sodium nitrate found in Prague powder #2 gradually breaks down over time into sodium nitrite, {{and by that}} time a dry cured sausage is ready to be eaten, no sodium nitrate should be left. For this reason it is recommended for meats that require long (weeks to months) cures, like hard salami and country ham.|$|E

50|$|Slocumb was a “shoreman” (one {{involved}} in the <b>curing,</b> <b>salting,</b> drying and storage of fish) and a “joiner” (carpenter) by trade. On June 24, 1728, he sold the house to Bowdoin for 400 li.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a benthopelagic fish of {{the family}} Gadidae, widely {{consumed}} by humans. It is also commercially known as cod or codling. Dry cod may be prepared as unsalted stockfish or as <b>cured</b> <b>salt</b> cod or clipfish.|$|R
50|$|On December 20, 1924, Denke {{was arrested}} after attacking {{a man at}} his house with an axe. Police searched Denke's home and found human flesh stored in huge jars of <b>curing</b> <b>salt.</b> A ledger {{contained}} the details of at least 42 people whom Denke had murdered and cannibalized between 1914 and 1918. It is thought he even sold the flesh of his victims at the Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) market as pork.|$|E
5000|$|Scientists have {{previously}} recovered similar genetic {{material from the}} Michigan Basin, the same region where the latest discovery was made. But that DNA, discovered in a salt-cured buffalo hide in the 1930s, was so {{similar to that of}} modern microbes that many scientists believed the samples had been contaminated. [...] The <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> had been derived from a mine in Saskatchewan, the site of the most recent sample described by Jong Soo Park of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Two main {{types of}} <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> mixture {{are used by}} the charcutier. The first is known by {{multiple}} names, including [...] "tinted cure mix", [...] "pink cure", [...] "prague powder", or [...] "insta-cure #1". The mixture is 93.75% sodium chloride and 6.25% sodium nitrite. When used, the recommended amount is a ratio of 4 oz for each 100 lb (1 kg for each 400 kg) of meat or 0.25% of the total weight of the meat. This blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular salt.|$|E
50|$|Chermoula recipes {{vary widely}} by region. In Sfax, Tunisia, chermoula with <b>cured</b> <b>salted</b> fish is often {{prepared}} during Eid al-Fitr. This regional variety {{is composed of}} dried dark grape purée mixed with onions cooked in olive oil and spices such as cloves, cumin, chili, black pepper, and cinnamon.|$|R
50|$|Making dry {{sausages}} involves <b>curing</b> <b>salts,</b> which incorporate {{sodium nitrite}} and sodium nitrate. Nitrites {{are used for}} all types of sausages and are the most common. Nitrates are used only in the preparation of the cured dry style of sausages. Over a period of time the nitrates are converted into nitrites by endogenous or added bacteria.|$|R

50|$|Lloyd Hall devoted much of {{his life}} and efforts to food science curing meat, {{particularly}} to improving a <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> marketed by Griffith Laboratories known as flash-drying. This product originated with German chemist Karl Max Seifert, developer of a process whereby solutions of sodium chlorine and one or more secondary salts were sprayed onto hot metal and rapidly dried, producing crystals of the secondary salts encased inside a shell of sodium chloride. Seifert patented the process in 1934 and sold the rights to Griffith Laboratories. The adaptation of Seifert's process specifically for meat curing was then patented by company owner Enoch L. Griffith, who proposed nitrates and nitrites, well-known curing agents, as the secondary butt salts.|$|E
50|$|A small {{building}} of conventional meat house design with an enclosed butchering {{room at the}} core, shaded on all four sides by an overhanging pyramidal roof. The building is supported by bush timber uprights and top plates of local ironwood. Roof rafters and purlins are of milled timber. The lower walls of the butchering room are clad with corrugated iron on a milled timber frame. The upper sections are enclosed with flyproof wire gauze. The interior of the room is dominated by a large tree-trunk chopping block. A high-set bush timber bench for <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> corn beef is located outside the room under the verandah roof. The floor of the meat house is of cement and the floor under the verandah is of antbed and cement.|$|E
50|$|Important {{place in}} Pskov export to the Hanse was salo (cured slabs of fatback). A {{dedicated}} quality control facility was organized in Dorpat {{to test the}} imported salo from Pskov. One {{of the most valuable}} imported commodities for Pskovians was salt. The importance of salt during the Middle Ages times was caused by its wide range of application. Salt was used as not only in food preservation but also in leather <b>curing.</b> <b>Salt</b> was produced in high quantities only in a few remote regions. It was expensive and very early became an important trade commodity. In Russia, including Pskov, the amount of produced salt was not enough to satisfy the demand, thus salt {{was one of the most}} imported commodities.Hanseatic traders sold salt not by its weight but by a bag volume. This often led to fraud. At the same time in the Hanseatic cities salt was sold by weight.|$|E
5000|$|In the Caspian {{provinces of}} Gilan and Mazandaran, {{several types of}} roe are used. Called ashpal or ashbal, roe is {{consumed}} grilled, <b>cured,</b> <b>salted,</b> or mixed with other ingredients. If <b>salted</b> or <b>cured,</b> it is consumed as a condiment. If used fresh, it is usually grilled, steamed, or mixed with eggs and fried to form a custard-like dish called [...] "Ashpal Kuku".|$|R

50|$|Methods {{exist to}} achieve a smoke ring on cooked meats that can be {{achieved}} outside of a smoker (or utilized when a propane or electric smoker are used). Marinating or soaking meats in <b>curing</b> <b>salts</b> is one methodology to cure the exterior layers of meat (in similar fashion to how a ham is cured) and cause the perimeter of the meat to remain pink throughout the cooking process.|$|R
50|$|The {{cervelat}} {{is often}} referred to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 cervelats per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage.Swiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, <b>curing</b> <b>salt</b> and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants. A cervelat may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams.|$|E
5000|$|Salami is a raw-fermented sausage {{consisting}} of raw comminuted pork and/or beef meat, fat, and additives, such as <b>curing</b> <b>salt,</b> spices, sugar, and a starter culture. There are multiple {{different types of}} Salami meat in various markets around the world. In northern and central Europe, smoked salamis are preferred, and ripening {{is controlled by the}} addition of lactic acid-producing starter cultures, whereas in southern Europe, salami is slowly air-dried and mostly mold-ripened. Therefore, different preservation and drying methods are used around the world to prepare salami. Hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. The salami that is of Hungarian origin, the so-called [...] "Hungarian Winter salami", is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. Szegedi téliszalámi (winter salami) is made of mangalitsa pork breed, with horse large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months. [...] Hungarian salami is one of the world's two trade names for salami, Milano salami being the other. These fermented sausages combine smoke and mold application in one. The traditional technology used to produce them is based on the Italian pre-drying technique developed during the nineteenth century, but they are smoked and their pH does not drop below 5.5, so the final flavor of the product is not acidic.|$|E

50|$|Many {{cultures}} consume {{blood as}} food, often {{in combination with}} meat. The blood {{may be in the}} form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, a <b>cured</b> <b>salted</b> form for times of food scarcity, or in a blood soup. This is a product from domesticated animals, obtained at a place and time where the blood can run into a container and be swiftly consumed or processed. In many cultures, the animal is slaughtered. In some cultures, blood is a taboo food.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} time, temperature, {{and the presence of}} sodium chloride, nitrates, and nitrites in the medium on the growth and production of enterotoxin B by Staphylococcus aureus. Assays by the double gel-diffusion method showed that maximal enterotoxin B production occurs {{at the beginning of the}} stationary phase of growth. Lowering the temperature of incubation decreased the amount of toxin produced without affecting the total amount of growth. Increases in concentration of <b>curing</b> <b>salts</b> reduced toxin production more rapidly than cell growth. The relationship of these observations to food-poisoning outbreaks is briefly discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{importance}} of fish has governed Swedish population and trade patterns {{far back in}} history. For preservation, fish were <b>salted</b> and <b>cured.</b> <b>Salt</b> became a major trade item {{at the dawn of}} the Scandinavian middle ages, which began circa 1000 AD. Cabbage preserved as sauerkraut and various kinds of preserved berries, apples, etc. were used once as a source of vitamin C during the winter (today sauerkraut is very seldom used in Swedish cuisine). Lingonberry jam, still a favourite, may be the most traditional and typical Swedish way to add freshness to sometimes rather heavy food, such as steaks and stews.|$|R
