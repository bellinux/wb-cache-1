40|$|A note on {{the minimum}} {{cardinality}} <b>of</b> <b>critical</b> sets <b>of</b> inertias for irreducible zero-nonzero patterns of order 4 Ber-Lin Yu and Ting-Zhu Huang Abstract—If there exists a nonempty, proper subset S of the set of all (n + 1) (n + 2) / 2 inertias such that S⊆i(A) is sufficient for any n × n zero-nonzero pattern A to be inertially arbitrary, then S is called a <b>critical</b> set <b>of</b> inertias for zero-nonzero patterns of order n. If no proper subset of S is a critical set, then S is called a minimal <b>critical</b> set <b>of</b> inertias. In [Kim, Olesky and Driessche, <b>Critical</b> sets <b>of</b> inertias for matrix patterns, Linear and Multilinear Algebra, 57 (3) (2009) 293 - 306], identifying all minimal <b>critical</b> sets <b>of</b> inertias for n×n zero-nonzero patterns with n ≥ 3 and the minimum cardinality of such a set are posed as two open questions by Kim, Olesky and Driessche. In this note, the minimum cardinality <b>of</b> all <b>critical</b> sets <b>of</b> inertias for 4 × 4 irreducible zero-nonzero patterns is identified.

5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
