As the event had happened, they had come together, under those extraordinary circumstances of common trial and <b>common</b> <b>peril,</b> in a strange country, which would especially predispose two women of the same nation to open their hearts to each other. In no other way could Mercy have obtained at a first interview that fatal knowledge of Grace's position and Grace's affairs which had placed temptation before her as the necessary consequence that followed the bursting of the German shell.|$|E

Common exclusions on open peril policies include damage resulting from earthquakes, floods, nuclear incidents, acts of terrorism, and war. Named perils require the actual cause of loss to be listed in the policy for insurance to be provided. The more <b>common</b> named <b>perils</b> include such damage-causing events as fire, lightning, explosion, and theft.|$|R

On the rear are the words of Charles W. Eliot: The White Officers taking life and honor in their hands cast in their lot with men of a despised race unproven in war and risked death as inciters of servile insurrection if taken prisoners besides encountering all the <b>common</b> <b>perils</b> of camp march and battle. The Black rank and file volunteered when disaster clouded the Union Cause. Served without pay for eighteen months till given that of white troops. Faced threatened enslavement if captured. Were brave in action. Patient under heavy and dangerous labors. And cheerful amid hardships and privations. Together they gave to the Nation and the World undying proof that Americans of African descent possess the pride, courage and devotion of the patriot soldier. One hundred and eighty thousand such Americans enlisted under the Union Flag in MDCCCLXIII-MDCCCLXV.|$|R
6000|$|Next year {{accordingly}} (year 1027), tenth or eleventh year of Olaf's reign, {{there came}} bad rumors out of England: That Knut was equipping an immense army,--land-army, {{and such a}} fleet as had never sailed before; Knut's own ship in it,--a Gold Dragon with no fewer than sixty benches of oars. Olaf and Onund King of Sweden, whose sister he had married, well guessed whither this armament was bound. They were friends withal, they recognized their <b>common</b> <b>peril</b> in this imminence; and had, in repeated consultations, taken measures the best that their united skill (which I find was mainly Olaf's but loyally accepted by the other) could suggest. It was in this year that Olaf (with his Swedish king assisting) did his grand feat upon Knut in Lymfjord of Jutland, which was already spoken of.

60|$|Never {{had there}} been so full an assembly, for, mysteriously united {{in spite of all}} their differences, they had taken arms against a <b>common</b> <b>peril.</b> Like cattle when a dog comes into the field, they stood head to head and {{shoulder}} to shoulder, prepared to run upon and trample the invader to death. They had come, too, no doubt, to get some notion of what sort of presents they would ultimately be expected to give; for though the question of wedding gifts was usually graduated in this way: 'What are you givin'? Nicholas is givin' spoons!'--so very much depended on the bridegroom. If he were sleek, well-brushed, prosperous-looking, it was more necessary to give him nice things; he would expect them. In the end each gave exactly what was right and proper, by a species of family adjustment arrived at as prices are arrived at on the Stock Exchange--the exact niceties being regulated at Timothy's commodious, red-brick residence in Bayswater, overlooking the Park, where dwelt Aunts Ann, Juley, and Hester.|$|E
60|$|He {{realized}} that in no case could her concealment have continued long. Eleven mortal hours had she {{spent in the}} cramped and almost suffocating space of that pannier, {{in which he had}} intended to do no more than carry her aboard. The uneasiness which had been occasioned him by the impossibility to deliver her from that close confinement when Asad had announced his resolve to accompany them upon that voyage, had steadily been increasing as hour succeeded hour, and still he found no way to release her from a situation in which sooner or later, when the limits of her endurance were reached, her presence must be betrayed. This release which he could not have contrived had been contrived for him by the suspicions and malice of Marzak. That was the one grain of consolation in the present peril--to himself who mattered nothing and to her, who mattered all. Adversity had taught him to prize benefits however slight and to confront perils however overwhelming. So he hugged the present slender benefit, and resolutely braced himself to deal with the situation as he found it, taking the fullest advantage of the hesitancy which his words had sown {{in the heart of the}} Basha. He hugged, too, the thought that as things had fallen out, from being oppressor and oppressed, Rosamund and he were become fellows in misfortune, sharing now a <b>common</b> <b>peril.</b> He found it a sweet thought to dwell on. Therefore was it that he faintly smiled as he looked into Rosamund's white, strained face.|$|E
60|$|First: I have {{personally}} known three {{instances where}} a whale, {{after receiving a}} harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think {{it may have been}} something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other <b>common</b> <b>perils</b> incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.|$|R
40|$|With the {{explosion}} of information hungry computational and multimedia applications, the need for exceptionally high communication data rates has leapt {{to the forefront of}} electronic design. Advances is silicon technologies, manifested both in the speed of the transistors and complexity of the IC wiring stack, has bolstered the ability to meet new communication needs on a platform common to most consumer electronics. This ability becomes beneficial to historical approaches, both in system performance and costs, with the later being a huge benefit over existing solutions. 	In this work the design of high speed wireless and wired communications on silicon platforms is investigated. The work uses both standard silicon CMOS technologies and silicon germanium BiCMOS technologies to demonstrate operations beyond 100 GHz and 100 GB/s. Activities in the wireless domain investigate both receivers and transmitters up to 100 GHz, with the most substantial work performed on the design and analysis of voltage controlled oscillators and low noise amplifiers. Differential and quadrature VCOs have been designed for operation between 16 - 64 GHz, with innovation in design methodologies and varactor degeneration. LNA design has been performed for operation from 20 - 110 GHz, with emphasis on balanced/unbalanced operations. Wireline development has focused on the design of two parallel systems for operation beyond 80 GB/s and 120 GB/s. Parallel development of half-rate 4 to 1 multiplexers and 1 to 4 demultiplexers has been performed, as well as development of a 60 GB/s full rate flip-flop and 60 GHz static divider. Aggressive clocking techniques were developed to enable broadband operation from below 1 GB/s to the upper frequency bounds, and an area-centric design methodology was developed to mitigate the <b>common</b> <b>perils</b> of high frequency design. 	Collectively, the circuits demonstrated here show a methodology aimed at enabling high frequency design despite the hurdles inherent in silicon processes. Most of these techniques are aimed at combating the limitations of the silicon substrate, even beyond the frequency limitations of the devices, and towards overcoming the amplified effects of interchip wiring at increased frequencies. In many instances the latter effects drive the electrical design of the circuits, where certain conventional techniques for high frequency design become impaired and undesirable...|$|R
40|$|Summary: In medical sciences, {{statistical}} analyses based on observational studies are <b>common</b> phenomena. One <b>peril</b> of drawing inferences {{about the effect}} of a treatment on subjects using observational studies is the lack of randomized assignment of subjects to the treatment. After adjusting for measured pretreatment covariates, perhaps by matching, a sensitivity analysis examines the impact of an unobserved covariate, u, in an observational study. One type of sensitivity analysis uses two sensitivity parameters to measure the degree of departure of an observational study from randomized assignment. One sensitivity parameter relates u to treatment and the other relates u to response. For subject matter experts, {{it may be difficult to}} specify plausible ranges of values for the sensitivity parameters on their absolute scales. We propose an approach that calibrates the values of the sensitivity parameters to the observed covariates and is more interpretable to subject matter experts. We will illustrate our method using data from the U. S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey regarding the relationship between cigarette smoking and blood lead levels...|$|R
60|$|Our {{material}} prosperity {{for nearly}} half a century has been so unparalleled that the minds of men have become gradually more and more absorbed in matters of personal concern; and our institutions have practically worked so well and so easily that we have learned to trust in our luck, and to take the permanence of our government for granted. The country has been divided on questions of temporary policy, and the people have been drilled to a wonderful discipline in the manoeuvres of party tactics; but no crisis has arisen to force upon them a consideration of the fundamental principles of our system, or to arouse in them a sense of national unity, and make them feel that patriotism was anything more than a pleasant sentiment,--half Fourth of July and half Eighth of January,--a feeble reminiscence, rather than a living fact with a direct bearing on the national well-being. We have had long experience of that unmemorable felicity which consists in having no history, so far as history is made up of battles, revolutions, and changes of dynasty; but the present generation has never been called upon to learn that deepest lesson of polities which is taught by a common danger, throwing the people back on their national instincts, and superseding party-leaders, the peddlers of chicane, with men adequate to great occasions and dealers in destiny. Such a crisis is now upon us; and if the virtue of the people make up for the imbecility of the Executive, as we have little doubt that it will, if the public spirit of the whole country be awakened in time by the <b>common</b> <b>peril,</b> the present trial will leave the nation stronger than ever, and more alive to its privileges and the duties they imply. We shall have learned what is meant by a government of laws, and that allegiance to the sober will of the majority, concentrated in established forms and distributed by legitimate channels, is all that renders democracy possible, is its only conservative principle, the only thing that has made and can keep us a powerful nation instead of a brawling mob.|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich Wilhelm and the Czar, like {{in several}} points, though so {{dissimilar}} in others, had always a certain regard for one another; {{and at this}} time, they had been brought into closer intercourse by their <b>common</b> <b>peril</b> from Charles XII., ever since that Stralsund business. The peril was real, especially with a Gortz and Alberoni putting hand to it; and the alarm, the rumor, and uncertainty were great in those years. The wounded Lion driven indignant into his lair, with Plotting Artists now operating upon the rage of the noble animal: who knows what spring he will next take? George I. had a fleet cruising in the Baltic Sounds, and again a fleet;--paying, in that oblique way, for Bremen and Verden; which were got, otherwise, such a bargain to his Hanover. Czar Peter had marched an Army into Denmark; united Russians and Danes count fifty thousand there; for a conjunct invasion, and probable destruction, of Sweden: but that came to nothing; Charles looking across upon it too dangerously, [...] "visible in clear weather over from the Danish side." [...] [1716: Fassmann, p. 171.] So Peter's troops have gone home again; Denmark too glad to get them away. Perhaps they would have stayed in Denmark altogether; much liking the green pastures and convenient situation,--had not Admiral Norris with his cannon been there! Perhaps? And the Pretender is coming again, they say? And who knows what is coming?--How Gortz, {{in about a year}} hence was laid hold of, and let go, and then ultimately tried and beheaded (once his lion Master was disposed of); [19th March, 1719: see Kohler (Munzbelustiggungen, vi. 233-240, xvii. 297-304) for many curious details of Gortz and his end.] how, Ambassador Cellamare, and the Spanish part of the Plot, having been discovered in Paris, Cardinal Alberoni at Madrid was discovered, and the whole mystery laid bare; all that mad business, of bringing the Pretender into England, throwing out George I., throwing out the Regent d'Orleans, and much more,--is now sunk silent enough, not worthy of reawakening; but it was then a most loud matter; filling the European Courts, and especially that of Berlin, with rumors and apprehensions. No wonder Friedrich Wilhelm was grateful for that Swedish Peace of his, and named his little daughter [...] "Ulrique" [...] in honor of it. Tumultuous cloud-world of Lapland Witchcraft had ceased hereby, and daylight had begun: old women (or old Cardinals) riding through the sky, on broomsticks, to meet Satan, where now are they? The fact still dimly perceptible is, Europe, thanks to that pair of Black-Artists, Gortz and Alberoni, not to mention Law the Finance-Wizard and his French incantations, had been kept generally, for these three or four years past, in the state of a Haunted House; riotous Goblins, of unknown dire intent, walking now in this apartment of it, now in that; no rest anywhere for the perturbed inhabitants.|$|E

It protects the insured in the event he or she is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy. Originally, individual companies that faced a <b>common</b> <b>peril</b> formed a group and created a self-help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss (in other words, a mutual insurance arrangement).

40|$|In a {{stratified}} analysis, {{the results}} from different strata if homogeneity assumption is met are pooled together to obtain a single summary estimate for the common effect parameter. However, the effect can appear homogeneous across strata using one measure but heterogeneous using another. Consequently, two researchers analyzing the same data can arrive at conflicting conclusions if they use different effect measures. In this paper, the author draws on the sufficient component cause model to develop a stratified-analysis method regarding a particular effect measure, the ‘peril ratio’. When there is no mechanistic interaction between the exposure under study and the stratifying variable (i. e., {{when they do not}} work together to complete any sufficient cause), the peril ratio is constant across strata. The author presents formulas for the estimation of such a <b>common</b> <b>peril</b> ratio. Three real data are re-analyzed for illustration. When the data is consistent with peril-ratio homogeneity in a stratified analysis, researchers can use the formulas in this paper to pool the strata...|$|E
