40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} and analytical {{study of the}} thermal fragmentation of a turbulent flow of interstellar hydrogen. We first present the different dynamical processes and the large range of spatial (and temporal) scales {{that need to be}} adequately represented in numerical simulations. Next, we present bidimensionnal simulations of turbulent converging flows which induce the dynamical condensation of the warm neutral phase into the cold phase. We then analyse the cold structures and the fraction of <b>unstable</b> <b>gas</b> in each simulation, paying particular attention to the influence of the degree of turbulence. When the flow is very turbulent a large fraction of the gas remains in the thermally unstable domain. This <b>unstable</b> <b>gas</b> forms a filamentary network. We show that the fraction of thermally <b>unstable</b> <b>gas</b> is strongly correlated with the level of turbulence of the flow. We then develop a semi-analytical model to explain the origin of this <b>unstable</b> <b>gas.</b> This simple model is able to reproduce quantitatively the fraction of <b>unstable</b> <b>gas</b> observed in the simulations and its correlation with turbulence. Finally, we stress the fact that even when the flow is very turbulent and {{in spite of the fact}} that a large fraction of the gas is maintained dynamically in the thermally unstable domain, the classical picture of a 2 -phase medium with stiff thermal fronts and local pressure equilibrium turns out to be still relevant in the vicinity of the cold structures.

Carbonate (calcite, siderite) microconcretions occur locally within intergranular pores and open fractures, and some sands are cemented by microcrystalline calcite. Calcite cement at 115. 12 mbsf (metres below sea floor) and possibly microconcretionary calcite at 44. 62 mbsf record infiltration of meteoric waters into the section, consistent with sequence stratigraphic evidence for multiple glacial advances over the CRP- 1 drillsite.

40|$|Within nuclear {{thermodynamics}} and an isospin-dependent {{transport model}} we investigate respective {{roles of the}} nuclear mean field and the 2 -body stochastic scattering {{on the evolution of}} density and isospin fluctuations in either mechanically or <b>chemically</b> <b>unstable</b> regions of neutron-rich matter. It is found that the mean field dominates overwhelmingly the fast growth of both fluctuations, while the 2 -body scattering influences significantly the later growth of the isospin fluctuation only. Moreover, both fluctuations grow in mechanically unstable systems, while only the density fluctuation grows significantly in <b>chemically</b> <b>unstable</b> ones. Furthermore, the magnitude of both fluctuations decreases with the increasing isospin asymmetry because of the larger reduction of the attractive isoscalar mean field by the stronger repuslive neutron symmetry potential in the more neutron-rich matter. Finally, several experimental measurements are proposed to test these findings. Comment: 11 pages and 4 figures. Phys. Rev. C, Rapid Communication, (2001) in pres...|$|R
