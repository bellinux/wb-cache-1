50|$|In the commando-transport configuration, the Panther {{may carry}} up to 10 fully armed {{soldiers}} on board {{at a time}} in addition to the two pilots flying the aircraft. The main cabin can be rapidly reconfigured to conduct various roles, such as troop-transport, SAR, and MEDIVAC missions; optional equipment includes a full medical suite, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera, emergency flotation, loudspeaker, variable-speed hoist, <b>cargo</b> <b>sling,</b> search light, and a stretcher-support structure.|$|E
50|$|During {{her time}} in the Guard, in {{addition}} to the deployments to Afghanistan, Hegar flew marijuana eradication missions, wildfire suppression with buckets of water on <b>cargo</b> <b>slings,</b> evacuated survivors from hurricane-devastated cities, and rescued many civilians on civil Search and Rescue missions in California and out at sea. On her third tour to Afghanistan on July 29, 2009, she was shot down on a Medevac mission and sustained wounds resulting in her being awarded the Purple Heart. Her actions on this mission saved the lives of her crew and patients, earning her the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor Device (making Hegar the sixth woman in history to receive the DFC—the first was Amelia Earhart—and only the second ever to receive it with the Valor Device). In 2012, Hegar filed suit against the U.S. Secretary of Defense asserting that the Combat Exclusion Policy was unconstitutional. In 2013, the Secretary of Defense repealed the policy effective immediately.|$|R
5000|$|The S-70 {{can perform}} {{a wide array}} of missions, {{including}} air cavalry, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation: several versions are used to transport the President of the United States, which while carrying the President is known as [...] "Marine One". In air assault operations it can move a squad of 11 combat troops and equipment or carry the 105 mm M102 howitzer, thirty rounds of ammunition, and a six-man crew. Alternatively, it can carry 2600 lb of <b>cargo</b> or <b>sling</b> load 9000 lb of cargo. The S-70 is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics, such as the Global Positioning System.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} table {{includes a}} list of helicopter models {{that are designed to}} carry underslung loads. Cargo capacities provided reflect the airframe manufacturer's specifications; when put into practice the actual maximum load capacities may be less, depending on the rating of the cargo hook equipment. For example, if a helicopter model is rated by the manufacturer as having a maximum <b>cargo</b> <b>sling</b> load capacity of 4,000 LB, but the cargo hook equipment is only rated for 3,000 LB, then the pilot can only carry loads weighing 3,000 LB or less.|$|E
50|$|The main {{fuselage}} of the rotorcraft {{comprises the}} cabin area, a separate luggage compartment, and a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} arrangement; {{a total of four}} conventional doors to access the main cabin are typically installed, which can be optionally replaced by a single clamshell air stair entrance instead. Various portions of the rotorcraft are made from composite materials, such as the rotor blades that made of carbon fiber, other materials are used in portions of the fuselage. The fuselage features anti-corrosion protection, and is structurally reinforced for an optional hoist or <b>cargo</b> <b>sling</b> to be installed, various other mooring and gripping points are also fitted on the rotocraft's exterior surface. Various types and models of radar can be installed in the Dauphin's nose.|$|E
40|$|When a {{helicopter}} performs an air operation and aerial work using external sling there may occur special situa- tions, {{as the result}} of unfavourable conditions impact. The most difficult and dangerous stages of flight are the takeoff and landing. To study an aircraft flight dynamics in extreme flight conditions, including {{a helicopter}} with <b>cargo</b> on external <b>sling,</b> the most effective is to use the theoretical methods, mathematical modeling in particular, which is relatively cheap, able to model the abnormal situation including disasters, and able to set the necessary environ-mental effect. During the theoretical studies it is impractical and impossible to simulate all the abnormal situations that may oc- cur at the given phases of flight. Therefore, at the initial stage of the research it is necessary to deal with making up a list of the most typical abnormal situations - the scheme of simulation cases. This issue {{is the subject of this}} article. The article describes the typical errors of piloting a helicopter with <b>cargo</b> on external <b>sling</b> at takeoff and landing, as well as the most dangerous equipment failures and noncalculated operating conditions, based on the analysis of which the scheme of simulation cases has been made. After modeling in accordance with the scheme of simulation cases, it will be possible to determine the effect of the cargo parameters, flight parameters, the impact of unfavourable factors on the dynamics of the system "helicopter - cargo on external sling" at takeoff and landing, which theefore will determine the boundaries of the system safe operation on these phases of flight, and to formulate recommendations for the crew to pre- vent abnomal situations or to get out of them. For further research it is expected to use the earlier developed HeliCargo software application, which allows to simulate the dynamics of helicopter with <b>cargo</b> on external <b>sling...</b>|$|R
60|$|There was, however, no {{suspicious}} {{movement on}} the saloon-deck, and Jake, walking to the rail, saw the peons putting {{the last of the}} barge's <b>cargo</b> into the <b>sling.</b> It came up with a rattle of chain, and the barge sheered off. Somebody gave an order, and there was a bustle on deck. In another few minutes Kenwardine's last chance of escape would be gone, because a British ship is British territory, and her captain can enforce his country's laws.|$|R
50|$|Various {{optional}} equipment can be installed, such as removable co-pilot flight controls, wire-string protection, a forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor system, instrument flight rules (IFR) training fittings, radio altimeter, emergency medical system, moving map, external loudspeakers and/or search light, flotation gear, and an external <b>cargo</b> <b>sling.</b> Much {{of the external}} equipment {{is designed to be}} held on external extension arms; overall, the SW-4 can mount/carry a useful payload of up to nearly 600 kilograms. Both basic and advanced trainer variants of the SW-4 have been developed to conform with NATO standards and military pilot training regulations, it is promoted as possessing a high level of inherent flight stability and safety; the advanced model is compatible with night vision goggles (NVG) and is equipped with an emergency simulation unit.|$|E

50|$|In the {{emergency}} medical services (EMS) role, various interior configurations {{have been developed for}} the type; optional equipment includes customised mounting points for medical equipment, air compressors and liquid oxygen tanks, and United Rotorcraft’s Lowered Patient Loading System (LPLS). The EC130 has been popular with Air medical services (AMS) operators due to its large cabin being capable of accommodating up to two stretchers and two attendees, as well as a baggage area for storing equipment, wide side doors for access, and its enclosed Fenestron tail for safety. For law enforcement roles, the ability for various optional equipment to be installed on the EC130 is promoted, such as electro-optical systems, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, and search lights. In a cargo capacity, it is common for the rotorcraft to be fitted with additional external mirrors and a <b>cargo</b> <b>sling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to various civil roles, the EC120 {{has also been}} used by several military operators to conduct training, observation and light utility missions. Airbus Helicopter has promoted the type in a training capacity due to features such as positive control response, performance computation systems, modern instrumentation for ease of use, overall compact size, and {{a high level of}} cabin visibility. A wide range of optional equipment can be installed upon the EC120 B, this includes a wire strike protection system, air conditioning, sand filter, skis, windshield wipers, electrical external mirrors, a <b>cargo</b> <b>sling,</b> emergency flotation gear, forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, and external spotlights.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} wide, ergonomic cabin {{with high levels}} of external visibility, which can accommodate a single pilot along with four passengers in typical passenger configuration. The design of the cabin is suitable {{for a wide variety of}} civilian and parapublic missions, such as utility transport, offshore transport, training, law enforcement, casualty evacuation and corporate transport. In the casualty evacuation role, the rotorcraft can carry one pilot and one stretcher patient as well as one or two medical attendants. In a cargo-carrying capacity, the EC120 can carry one pilot plus [...] of total useful load volume spread between the cabin and the [...] hold, which is externally accessible from the right-hand side and to the rear, as well as from the cabin in some configurations. To ease cargo operations, the cabin floor is flat and unobstructed; alternatively, a <b>cargo</b> <b>sling</b> can be installed to carry cargo of up to 700 kg.|$|E
50|$|The flight at Da Nang {{performed}} several {{missions in}} the six months they were located there. One of the missions was to support the Forward Air Controller units at the Kham Duc and Khe Sahn Green Beret bases, which involved carrying 500 gallon fuel cells and Conex boxes of supplies on the cargo sling.The flight performed many general support missions such as retrieving downed Marine H-34 and Huey helicopters from remote sites, slinging fully equipped radio jeeps to hilltop reconnaissance sites; and ferrying wounded soldiers to the hospital at Da Nang or to the Hospital Ship USS Repose which was stationed off the coast of Da Nang. One major mission was to work with the Marines to support Operation Double Eagle by emplacing 105 mm Howitzers at forward firing positions by carrying them on the <b>cargo</b> <b>sling</b> under the aircraft and placing them in position at the forward firing site. One of the Pony pilots was awarded the Silver Star when he was diverted on the way back from Dong Ha to evacuate wounded soldiers from the A Shau Valley which was under attack by heavy mortar and machine gun fire. He escaped ground fire after takeoff by immediately pulling up into the low-lying clouds.|$|E
