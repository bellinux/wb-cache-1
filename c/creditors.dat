5|$|Enron's {{shareholders}} lost $74 {{billion in}} the four years before the company's bankruptcy ($40 to $45 billion was attributed to fraud). As Enron had nearly $67 billion that it owed <b>creditors,</b> employees and shareholders received limited, if any, assistance aside from severance from Enron. To pay its <b>creditors,</b> Enron held auctions to sell assets including art, photographs, logo signs, and its pipelines.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. <b>Creditors</b> {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that <b>creditors</b> who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for <b>creditors</b> who would not accept notes from either.|$|E

This was increased by NOK300,000 in December. The company was insolvent at this time, but the <b>creditors</b> chose to instate a lawyer as chairman and continue operations. The airline met with its largest <b>creditors</b> on 25 February in an unsuccessful attempt to refinance the company's debt.|$|E
5|$|Beshear {{continued}} his legal practice at Stites and Harbison following his defeat by McConnell. In 2001, {{the firm was}} hired to represent <b>creditors</b> in a bankruptcy case against Wallace Wilkinson, Beshear's opponent in the 1987 gubernatorial primary. The firm also represented four <b>creditors</b> of Wallace's Bookstore, the company through which Wilkinson had made his fortune. Wilkinson unsuccessfully sought to have the firm removed from the case, citing a potential conflict of interest stemming from his old political rivalry with Beshear. The case was eventually settled in 2002, four months after Wilkinson's death.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, {{citing a}} drop in {{production}} and difficulty servicing significant debt {{as a result of}} the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder MacAndrews & Forbes agreed to a debt restructuring arrangement with Panavision's <b>creditors.</b> Private equity firm Cerberus Capital was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer has any equity in the company. In June 2013, its <b>creditors</b> sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.|$|E

30|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} commitment operations on trust. Before we {{describe the}} effects, let us consider some situations wherein a commitment exists from a debtor toward a <b>creditor.</b> Effect of discharge. When a commitment is discharged, the <b>creditor’s</b> trust for the debtor increases. Effect of violation. When a commitment is violated, the <b>creditor’s</b> trust in the debtor decreases. Effect of delegation and discharge. When a commitment is delegated by the original debtor to a new debtor, and the new debtor satisfies it, the <b>creditor’s</b> trust in both the original and the new debtor increases. Effect of delegation and violation. When a commitment is delegated from the original debtor to a new debtor and the new debtor violates it, the <b>creditor’s</b> trust in both the original and the new debtor decreases. Effect of assignment and discharge. When the commitment is assigned from the original <b>creditor</b> to a new <b>creditor</b> and the original debtor discharges it, {{the trust of the}} original and new <b>creditor</b> for the original debtor increases.

When the commitment is assigned from the original <b>creditor</b> to the new <b>creditor</b> and the debtor violates it, the trust of the original and the new <b>creditor</b> for the original debtor decreases.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model {{predicting}} two channels through which <b>creditor</b> protection affects stock prices: (1) {{the probability of}} a liquidity crisis leading to a binding investment-finance constraint falls with better <b>creditor</b> protection; (2) the stock prices under the investment-constrained regime increase with better <b>creditor</b> pro-tection. We find evidence for both predictions using data on stock markets and <b>creditor</b> protection for 52 countries from 1980 to 2008. In particular, better <b>creditor</b> protection is correlated with lower stock market volatility and lower frequency of crises. Moreover, during crises, stock prices and investment fall more in countries with poor <b>creditor</b> protection...|$|R
5|$|On 5 November, TPD was {{formally}} liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to {{the anger of}} the <b>creditors,</b> that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary <b>creditors</b> faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to <b>creditors,</b> of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the <b>creditors,</b> as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled <b>creditors</b> challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of the <b>creditors.</b> Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E

5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of <b>creditors</b> demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the <b>creditors</b> of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, debtors in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their <b>creditors.</b> Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their <b>creditors</b> were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to have been there for 30years.|$|E

5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign <b>creditors</b> of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the <b>creditors</b> – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for <b>creditors</b> into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E
