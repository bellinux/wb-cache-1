25|$|During February the {{regiment}} began {{to receive the}} latest AA No 2 Mk VIII* SLC <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> to improve {{the coverage of the}} AA Inner Artillery Zone. However, the threat of serious air raids diminished as the war drew to its close, and the Diver defences were closed down on 20 April. While some other AA units were disbanded or moved up into Germany, 1st S/L Rgt maintained its deployment throughout the final weeks of the war.|$|E
25|$|The first hand-built Mk. VIIIA {{arrived at}} Christchurch in March 1942, {{but does not}} appear to have been passed to the FIU. At this point the entire <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> {{development}} became embroiled in new concerns about the increasing effectiveness of the Luftwaffe signals intelligence and night fighter defences. In June 1942 the first evidence that the Germans were jamming the 1.5m radars was seen, and this led to calls for the AIS team to assist bringing the Mk. VIIIA into service as soon as possible, thereby once again delaying development of improved versions.|$|E
25|$|According to Lovell {{this did}} not {{represent}} {{as much of a}} disruption as Dee believed; to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had been instigated by the Army for GL purposes, so it was not entirely fair to complain. Lovell's primary task during this period was developing a conical scanning system that improved the accuracy of the radar beam many times, enough to allow it to be used directly to lay the guns (that is, about the same accuracy as optical instruments). This did not really require much effort, and would be useful for any <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar,</b> including AIS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centimetric</b> {{contour mapping}} <b>radars</b> like H2S greatly {{improved}} {{the accuracy of}} Allied bombers in the strategic bombing campaign. <b>Centimetric</b> gun-laying <b>radars</b> were much more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly, and with the newly developed proximity fuse, made anti-aircraft guns more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the German V-1 flying-bomb flight paths to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the war, an {{arms race}} evolved between the Allies and the Kriegsmarine, {{especially}} in detection and counterdetection. Sonar (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in radar became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, {{as well as more}} anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Centimetric</b> <b>radar,</b> made {{possible}} by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign, despite the existence of the German FuG 350 Naxos device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed proximity fuze, made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German V-1 flying bombs on their way to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.|$|E
500|$|Coastal Commands's primary task {{became the}} {{protection}} of Allied convoys from attacks by the German Kriegsmarines U-boats, groups of which were known as [...] "wolfpacks". It also protected Allied shipping from aerial attacks by the Luftwaffe. The main operations of Coastal Command were defensive, defending supply lines in the various theatres of war, most notably the Mediterranean, Middle East and African, and {{the battle of the}} Atlantic. It also had an offensive capacity. In the Mediterranean theatre and the Baltic sea it attacked German shipping carrying war materials from Italy to North Africa and from Scandinavia to Germany. By 1943 Coastal Command finally received sufficient Very Long Range [...] aircraft it needed and its operations proved decisive in the victory over the U-boats. These aircraft were Consolidated B-24 Liberators and, from early 1943, these, and other Coastal Command aircraft, were fitted with Mark III ASV [...] <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar,</b> the latest depth charges, including homing torpedoes, officially classed as Mark 24 mines [...] and even rockets.|$|E
5000|$|Sir John Turton Randall, [...] (23 March 1905 - 16 June 1984) was a British {{physicist}} and biophysicist, credited with radical {{improvement of the}} cavity magnetron, {{an essential component of}} <b>centimetric</b> wavelength <b>radar,</b> {{which was one of the}} keys to the Allied victory in the Second World War. It is also the key component of microwave ovens.|$|R
50|$|The systems {{used the}} same concept of small {{aluminium}} strips (or wires) cut to a half of the target radar's wavelength. When hit by the radar, such lengths of metal resonate and re-radiate the signal. Opposing defences would find {{it almost impossible to}} distinguish the aircraft from the echoes caused by the chaff. Other radar-confusing techniques included Mandrel, Piperack and Jostle. Ignorance about the extent of knowledge of the principle in the opposing air force led planners to judge that it was too dangerous to use, since the opponent could duplicate it. The British government's leading scientific adviser, Professor Lindemann, pointed out that if the Royal Air Force (RAF) used it against the Germans, the Luftwaffe would quickly copy it and could launch a new Blitz. This caused concern in RAF Fighter Command and Anti-Aircraft Command, who managed to suppress the use of Window until July 1943. It was felt the new generation of <b>centimetric</b> <b>radars</b> available to Fighter Command would cope with Luftwaffe retaliation.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of magnetron, transmit-receive (T-R) switch, small antenna and high resolution allowed small, powerful radars {{to be installed}} in aircraft. Maritime patrol aircraft could detect objects as small as submarine periscopes, allowing aircraft to track and attack submerged submarines, where before only surfaced submarines could be detected. In addition, radar could detect the submarine at a much greater range than visual observation, both in the daylight and at night, when submarines had previously considered themselves safe to surface and recharge their batteries. <b>Centimetric</b> contour mapping <b>radars</b> like H2S, and the even higher frequency American-created H2X, allowed new tactics in the strategic bombing campaign. <b>Centimetric</b> gun-laying <b>radars</b> were much more accurate than the older technology. Allied naval gunnery improved and, along with the proximity fuze, radar made anti-aircraft guns much more effective. The two new systems used by anti-aircraft batteries are credited with destroying many V-1 flying bombs {{in the late summer}} of 1944.|$|R
500|$|Strothers married Curran on 7 November 1940. Soon {{afterwards}} {{they were}} transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment near Swanage, where Sam worked on <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar,</b> while Joan joined the Counter Measures Group in an adjoining lab. It was with this group, at Swanage, and later at Malvern, that Joan devised the technique that was codenamed Window, which {{is also known as}} chaff. She tried various types of radar reflectors, including wires and sheets, before settling on strips of tin foil [...] wide and [...] long that could be scattered from bombers, thus disrupting the enemy's radar. Window was first employed in Operation Gomorrah, a series of raids on Hamburg, and resulted in a much lower loss rate than usual. As part of Operation Taxable on 5â€“6 June 1944, Window was dropped by Avro Lancasters of 617 Squadron to synthesise a phantom invasion force of ships in the Straits of Dover and keep the Germans unsure as to whether the brunt of the Allied assault would fall on Normandy or in the Pas de Calais area. R. V. Jones later declared: [...] "In my opinion, Joan Curran made an even greater contribution to victory, in 1945, than Sam." ...|$|E
2500|$|As May 5 {{faded into}} darkness, Tay counted seven U-boats {{surfaced}} in the convoy's path; but ONS 5 was entering the fog formed where the warm Gulf Stream meets the cold Labrador Current off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Visibility dropped to [...] by 2202 and to [...] by 0100. British <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> enabled the escorts to see while the U-boats could not. Many of the U-boats involved never returned to base to file their reports; so historians still struggle to correlate individual reports {{of the dozens of}} ships interacting briefly in no fewer than 24 attempted attacks on the night of 5/6 May.|$|E
2500|$|As Autolycus {{detected}} fumes {{from the}} submarine, {{rather than the}} hull, it could detect {{the passage of a}} submarine for some time after it had passed. This aided searching, as it did not need to pass directly overhead. [...] A zig-zag search pattern was flown, passing at right-angles over the likely direction of submarine movements. When an exhaust plume was detected, the aircraft would begin to fly a tracking pattern of progressively shorter zig-zags. Each crossing of the plume trail would be plotted, giving a map plot of the submarine's likely track. As the track was narrowed down, the aircraft would switch sensors to a more precise method, such as <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> or dropping sonobuoys before potentially closing for an attack.|$|E

50|$|The commanders were {{impressed}} and, on 1 January 1942, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) {{set up a}} team under Bernard Lovell to develop an S-band airborne targeting radar based on AIS. An initial order for 1,500 sets was placed. It was clear even {{at this point that}} a Plan Position Indicator (PPI) display would be desirable, but this would require a complex scanning parabolic antenna, compared to the very simple set of fixed antennas used in the A-scope system. The new targeting radar was designed to fit in an aerodynamic blister on the belly of a bomber. In March, it was decided that both H2S and a new <b>centimetric</b> Air-Surface-Vessel <b>radar</b> (ASV) radar, ASV Mk. III, would be built using the same components, reducing competition for parts.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the final}} G-series models {{received}} updates to the engines, using a pair of high-altitude Jumo 213E inverted V-12s with the same revised annular radiator design as the 213As already used, or to the radar, using the mid-VHF band FuG 218 Neptun AI radar with either the standardized Hirschgeweih aerials with shorter dipoles to suit the higher frequencies used, [...] or more rarely the advanced Morgenstern 90Â° crossed-element, six-dipole Yagi-form antenna. Only a very few Ju 88G-6 night fighters were ever fitted with the semi-experimental FuG 240 Berlin N-1 cavity magnetron based, 3GHz-band (<b>centimetric)</b> <b>radar,</b> whose dish antenna was housed in a smoothly contoured radome on the G-6's nose. Only about 15 of the Berlin systems were completed before V-E Day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{winter weather}} {{provided}} a respite in early 1943, {{but in the}} spring, large [...] "wolf packs" [...] of U-boats attacked convoys and scored big successes without taking large losses in return. However, in May 1943 a sudden turnaround happened. Two convoys were attacked by large wolf packs and suffered losses. Yet unlike {{earlier in the year}} the attacking submarines were also mauled. After those battles merchant ship losses plummeted and U-boat losses rocketed, forcing Karl DÃ¶nitz to withdraw his forces from the Atlantic. They were never again to pose the same threat. What had changed was a sudden convergence of technologies. The large gap {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic that had been unreachable by aircraft was closed by long range B-24 Liberator aircraft. <b>Centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> came into service, greatly improving detection and nullifying German radar warning equipment. The introduction of the Leigh Light enabled accurate attacks on U-boats re-charging their batteries on the surface at night. With convoys securely protected there were enough resources to allow escort carrier groups to aggressively hunt U-boats.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{many other}} wartime aircraft, {{efforts were made}} to {{disperse}} production and to employ the use of shadow factories to minimise the damage caused by Luftwaffe bombing raids. Major sub-assemblies for the Swordfish were produced by a total of four subcontractors based in neighbouring Leeds, these were transported by land to Sherburn for final assembly. Initial deliveries from Sherburn were completed to the Swordfish I standard; from 1943 onwards, the improved Swordfish II and Swordfish III variant came into production and superseded the original model.

50|$|The concept {{behind the}} Turbinlite-equipped Havoc was {{rendered}} obsolete {{with the introduction}} of <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> along with suitable high-performance night fighters such as the Bristol Beaufighter and the later de Havilland Mosquito, although one of the latter, the Mosquito II, serial W4087, was itself experimentally fitted with a Turbinlite installation.|$|E
50|$|The {{improvements}} to the cavity magnetron by John Randall and Harry Boot of Birmingham University in early 1940 marked a major advance in radar capability. The resulting magnetron was a small device that generated high-power microwave frequencies and allowed the development of practical <b>centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> that operated in the SHF radio frequency band from 3 to 30 GHz (wavelengths of 10 to 1 cm). <b>Centimetric</b> <b>radar</b> enables the detection of much smaller objects {{and the use of}} much smaller antennas than the earlier, lower frequency radars. A radar with a wavelength of 2 meters cannot detect objects that are much smaller than 2 meters and requires an antenna whose size is on the order of 2 meters (an awkward size for use on aircraft). In contrast, a radar with a 10 cm wavelength can detect objects 10 cm in size with a reasonably-sized antenna.|$|E
