50|$|In late 1964, Saunders-Roe {{commenced}} {{design work}} on multiple hovercraft designs; {{in addition to}} the relatively huge SR.N4 and studies into a prospective 2,000 ton freighter, there was also interest in developing its existing smaller hovercraft range. In particular, the firm had observed customer demand for a model of the SR.N5 that would be capable of carrying a much greater payload; there was a view that the existing craft was uneconomic for what payload it could carry and that an expanded, or 'stretched', model would be able to rectify this. According to Saunders-Roe's own projections, an increase of the craft's payload by 110 per cent would only reduce performance by 10 per cent as the increased payload was in part offset by the expanded <b>cushion</b> <b>area,</b> which meant that cushion pressure would not need to be substantially increased instead.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{measurement}} of the anal <b>cushion</b> <b>area</b> using static transperineal ultrasound in a group of patients with symptomatic grade III and IV haemorrhoids about to undergo haemorrhoidectomy and compare them with a group of age-matched normals and the measured area following haemorrhoidectomy. Methods: Transperineal sonography was performed using a linear transducer measuring the anal <b>cushion</b> <b>area</b> by subtracting the measured luminal diameter of the undisturbed anal canal from the inner border of the internal anal sphincter. Measures were made 6 weeks following haemorrhoidectomy. Results: Comparisons were made between 22 normals and 36 patients with haemorrhoids (31 evaluable post-operatively). The median area of normals was 0. 78 cm², that of pre-operative patients 2. 25 cm² and that of post-operative cases 1. 20 cm². There was a significant difference between pre- and post-operative cases with cushion areas of normal patients being significantly lower than post-operative cases. Variance of measurement in all 3 groups was negligible. Conclusion: Static transperineal sonography measuring the anal <b>cushion</b> <b>area</b> is reproducible and shows marked differences between normals and patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids. There is a marked effect on measured area resultant from haemorrhoidectomy...|$|E
25|$|The {{manner of}} {{receiving}} the Eucharist differs throughout the world. In most American Lutheran churches, an older Latin Rite custom is maintained, where a <b>cushioned</b> <b>area</b> and altar rails {{sit at the}} front of the altar where the congregation can come to kneel down and receive the sacrament (as seen in the picture below). Traditionally, only those within the holy office of the ministry distributed both of the communion elements, but it is now the prevailing practice that the Pastor distributes the host and an assistant then distributes the wine. The congregation departs and may make the sign of the cross.|$|R
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a <b>cushioned</b> <b>area.</b> Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the {{starting}} position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|R
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a <b>cushioned</b> landing <b>area.</b> The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|R
50|$|The Mercurial Vapor II was {{released}} in January 2004 in two colourways: team red and photo blue. The photo blue boots were debuted by Ronaldo a month earlier, in Real Madrid's clash with Barcelona at the Camp Nou, whilst Thierry Henry debuted the red pair in Arsenal's 5-1 win over Internazionale in Milan, with Henry scoring two goals. The revised version of the boot differed from the original Vapors in three respects: first, the material from which the boot was constructed was made marginally thicker; second, a <b>cushioned</b> <b>area</b> around the ankle with a slightly larger heel tab was added midway through the MVII run (generally known as v2.1); and finally, the pattern {{down the sides of}} the boot was modified to make the indentations more pronounced, along with a thin coloured stripe to complement the colour of the boot. The boot still maintained the same upper material, sole plate, and external heel counter. The boot was also released in many other colourways, which included cinder/maize; mist blue/navy; gunmetal; orange blaze/black; navy/silver; gold/black; white/red; chrome/photo blue; chili red/silver; and the final colourway, aluminium/gold, {{was released}} as an homage to the colours of Real Madrid, which were to be worn by Ronaldo. Once again, Nike also released a kangaroo leather version, in a white/ black colourway. The photo blue, orange blaze, gold, aluminium and chrome colourways all sported the 'R9' brand.|$|R
2500|$|The {{congregation}} is {{to remain}} kneeling in adoration during the distribution. The pastor first receives communion and then [...] "those who will be assisting him". [...] "By Christ's own words, [...] "Given and shed for you for the remission of sins", in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper God offers, gives, and seals for us forgiveness of sins, life and salvation." [...] The manner of receiving the Eucharist differs throughout the world. Sometimes there is a <b>cushioned</b> <b>area</b> {{at the front of}} the church where the congregation can come to the front to kneel and receive this sacrament. Typically, the pastor distributes the host and an assistant (the deacon) then distributes the wine. The congregation departs and may make the sign of the cross. In other Lutheran churches, the process is much like the Post-Vatican II form used in the Catholic Church, the eucharistic minister (most commonly the pastor) and his assistants/deacons line up, with the eucharistic minister in the center, holding the hosts, and the two assistants on either side, holding the chalices. The people process to the front in lines and receive the Eucharist standing When a person receives the bread, the eucharistic minister may say [...] "The Body of Christ, given for you." [...] When a person receives the wine, the assistant/deacon may say [...] "The Blood of Christ, shed for you." [...] Following this, the people make the sign of the cross (if they choose to) and return to their places in the congregation.|$|R

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{procedures}} for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch, incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, {{and the sound of}} the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called [...] "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action". This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby <b>cushioning</b> the <b>area</b> to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet pile.|$|R
50|$|Heath {{is found}} {{commonly}} inland, {{made up of}} either grass or shrubs. The most common grass species is whitegrass (Cortaderia pilosa), and this grass heath covers {{the majority of the}} main islands. These grasses support other flowering plants, along with insects and birds. The shrub heath is composed mostly of low-growing shrubs such as diddle-dee, and also hosts many other plant species along with invertebrates and small birds. In the feldmark environments formed on exposed ridges and higher <b>areas,</b> <b>cushion</b> plants such as balsam bog (Bolax gummifera). Species of fern can also grow in such areas. In the most extreme areas, only lichen and specialised plants such as snakeplants can grow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Seat {{pressure}} {{is known as}} a major factor of seat comfort in vehicles. In passenger vehicles, there is lacking research into the seat comfort of rear seat occupants. As accurate seat pressure measurement requires significant effort, simulation of seat {{pressure is}} evolving as a preferred method. However, analytic methods are based on complex finite element modeling and therefore are time consuming and involve high investment. Based on accurate anthropometric measurements of 64 male sub-jects and outboard rear seat pressure measurements in three different passenger vehicles, this study investigates if a set of pa-rameters derived from seat pressure mapping are sensitive enough to differentiate between different seats and whether they correlate with anthropometry in linear models. In addition to the pressure map analysis, H-Points were measured with a coor-dinate measurement system based on palpated body landmarks and the range of H-Point locations in the three seats is pro-vided. It was found that for the <b>cushion,</b> <b>cushion</b> contact <b>area</b> and <b>cushion</b> front area/force could be modeled by subject anthro-pometry, while only seatback contact area could be modeled based on anthropometry for all three vehicles.

40|$|We {{studied the}} seated buttock {{pressure}} distribution in six paraplegic patients {{by means of}} computerized pressure mapping. They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair cushions were studied: an air cushion, a contour cushion, a polyurethane foam cushion, a Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and a silicone gel cushion. A tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer. Peak pressures measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the Cubicushion, the polyurethane foam cushion, the contour cushion, the silicone gel cushion, and the air <b>cushion.</b> The <b>areas</b> of total contact measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the air cushion, the silicone gel cushion, the polyurethane foam cushion, the contour cushion and the Cubicushion. Based on these findings, we conclude that the most advantageous cushion is the air cushion or the silicone gel cushion. Likewise, we conclude that the Cubicushion is not practical for pressure sore prevention. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} the initial period {{and type of}} lipid accumulation during spontaneous atherosclerosis, quantitative chromatographic profiles of major lipid classes in upper thoracic aortas (non-lesion areas) and celiac artery <b>cushions</b> (lesion <b>areas)</b> were obtained from atherosclerosis-susceptible White Carneau (WC) and atherosclerosis-resistant Show Racer (SR) pigeons from 1 day to 6 months of age. Thoracic aortas of WC and SR pigeons contained similar amounts of cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acids, triacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, and hydrocarbon at each age studied. However, celiac sites in WCs contained more total lipid than corresponding SR sites at 6 weeks and 6 months of age. This initial increase at 6 weeks in WCs was characterized by invreased concentrations of nonesterified saturated fatty acids. By 6 months of age, WC celiac cushions had greater concentrations of each lipid class except hydrocarbon than did SR cushions. This initial lipid accumulation was accompanied by ultrastructural changes within the arterial wall, which included the presence of extracellular, vesiclelike structures and extensive accumulation of basal lamina-like material between cells. This material was not present in aortic regions that are not predisposed to lesion formation. This material increased by 6 months {{of age in the}} enlarging WC fibromuscular intimal cushions. These morphologic changes paralleled the quantitative lipid increases and represented the first morphologic changes detectable at this site. Age-related changes in arterial lipid content and ultrastructure in SRs are different from those related to early spontaneous atherogenesis in WCs...|$|R
40|$|Stress urinary {{incontinence}} {{is a major}} problem at the field of female urology and urogynecology. Symptom-atically, this is a losing of the urine on physical efforts, coughing or sneezing. Incompetency of the urethral closing mechanisms are causing urine loss. Mid-ure-thral synthetic slings are the gold standard of the treat-ment of the stress {{urinary incontinence}}. At the same time, different urethral bulking injections are creating an artificial <b>cushioning</b> at the <b>area</b> around the urethra [1]. Bulking agents may work by increasing the cen-tral filler volume and thereby increasing the power of sphincter. The timing of the procedures are rarely evidence approved, and mainly they are empirical, based on personal experience, availability of the injec-tions and dedicated patients. So called “Bad urethra ” patients are the main can-didates for the injectables. While women with mixed incontinence, patients in childbearing age who are warned about uncertain outcome of synthetic slings during delivery or the patients with concomitant se-vere somatic pathology could get benefit from the bulk-ing agents. According to the Cochrane Review “the available evidence base remains insufficient to guide Bulking agents for urinary incontinence: what, when and where...|$|R
40|$|This study {{conducted}} {{a series of}} road tests in the regular fleet operations of a revenue service to better understand the relationship between vehicle seat design and driver fatigue, improve two newly proposed objective methods for evaluating driver fatigue, and provide design guidelines for evaluating and improving vehicle seat characteristics in terms of driver fatigue. Each driver completed a test session on two seat cushions – one a polyurethane foam cushion and one an air-inflated cushion. Objective measurements of pressure distribution were taken throughout each test session, while subjective measurements were collected using surveys taken at one-hour intervals. Based on these results, we find that the air-inflated seat cushion has advantages in terms of subjective measures of comfort, support, and fatigue. We show that the objective measure aPcrms highlights characteristic differences between seat cushions, as the air-inflated seat <b>cushion</b> provides less <b>area</b> in high pressure regions, thus occluding less blood flow to tissue in the seated area. While we were unable to effectively assess the validity of the proposed measures or improve them further, the characteristic difference between seat cushions is not highlighted by using previously existing objective measures. This implies that aPcrms is a more useful measure and should be considered when evaluating the subjective quality of seat cushion designs under dynamic conditions, such as those existing in commercial truck driving. ii...|$|R
40|$|Questions What is the community-level {{consequence}} of biotic processes, {{in particular the}} importance of facilitation, in determining patterns of diversity in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains? Does facilitation intensity change with environmental severity, and are these changes due to environmental severity or nurse trait effects? Location Eleven alpine plant communities dominated by cushion plants in the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, within the mountain system of south-central China. Methods We determined plant species richness and abundance in habitats created by <b>cushions</b> and cushion-free <b>areas,</b> and assessed the cushion effects on species richness and abundance with rarefaction curves and the relative interaction index, respectively. We {{examined the relationship between}} cushion effects on diversity and habitat severity and tested if changes in the net cushion effects along the severity gradient were due to a change in the performance of species without cushions (environmental severity effect) and/or with cushions (nurse trait-mediated effect). Results The presence of cushion plants increased species richness and abundance in most studied plant communities. The net facilitation effect of cushions increased with increasing habitat severity, an effect that could be attributed mainly to a reduction in species richness in cushion-free areas with increasing severity. However, the changes in magnitude of facilitation of particular cushion species growing in high and low severity habitats could be attributed to both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. Despite the overall positive effect of cushion plants on plant species richness, not all cushion species contributed to higher species richness. The deviation of individual cushion species from the general pattern of increasing facilitation with increasing severity indicated the species specificity of facilitation depends on the traits of nurse species. Conclusion The presence of cushion plants generally increased species richness in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, with the importance of the cushion effect increasing with habitat severity due to a buffering effect by cushions of the negative effect of habitat severity on species richness observed in cushion-free areas. This indicates the pivotal role of facilitative interactions among plant species in supporting high diversity in these severe environments...|$|R
