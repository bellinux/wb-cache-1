50|$|The {{anchoring}} of the extremities {{of a bar}} under traction {{can also}} be ensured by adherence, as is usually {{the case for the}} rebars in elements made of reinforced concrete. In this specific case, it is necessary to have an anchoring length at least 30 times the diameter of the bar. The bar then has a length L + 60H for a useful length L; its theoretical volume indicator W = 1 becomes W = 1 + 60H/L. Consequently, L/H must be greater than 240 (which is always theoretically possible) so that W does not increase by more than 25%. This observation also helps to show another reason for taking into account n bars with a <b>crosssection</b> Ω/n instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω.|$|E

The target used for the <b>crosssection</b> measurements was made at N. C. S. R. "Demokritos" using the evaporation technique. At first, a small quantity of highpurity, isotopically enriched 6 LiF powder (97 % in 6 Li) was evaporated on selfsupporting carbon foils and an ultrathin Au layer was subsequently evaporated on top for normalization purposes. The detection system consisted of five Si surface barrier detectors (SSB) which were mounted at the laboratory scattering angles of 125, 140, 150, 160, and 170, along with the corresponding electronics. The spectra from all five detectors were simultaneously recorded for each deuteron beam energy. The determination of the differential <b>crosssection</b> values for 6 Li was carried out using the relative measurement technique making use of the differential <b>crosssection</b> values of gold that follow the Rutherford formula. Moreover, the enrichment of the target had to be determined. For this purpose, proton EBS spectra from a similarly prepared thin natLiF target were used at Ep;lab = 1600 keV and 1700 keV in five scattering angles (125, 140, 150, 160, 170) along with the deuteron spectra.

40|$|For {{accurate}} {{determination of}} thickness-profile in vessel quantification, {{it is important}} to find appropriate vessel <b>crosssections.</b> To obtain vessel cross-sections, a centerline-based approach has been widely used, but it has several inherent problems causing improper cross-sections. First, this approach cannot define cross-sections in a unique way. Second, cross-sections are sensitive to the degree of smoothness of a detected vessel centerline. Third, a small variation in a centerline causes a considerable change in the resultant cross-sections and this phenomenon brings about improper <b>crosssections</b> in the abnormal vessel of asymmetric structure. Finally, wrong cross-sections may be detected due to the intersection with the other cross-sections in a region of high curvature. In this paper, instead of a centerline, we propose and adopt a complementary geodesic distance field. Then, we detect a sequence of equidistant lines by using the proposed distance field. Finally, we determine cross-sections by refining the obtained equidistant lines. Due to the prospective properties of the proposed distance field, we can alleviate all of the conventional problems and obtain the cross-sections more proper for vessel quantification. Through the intensive simulation using various 2 -D synthesized images, we prove that the proposed method provides non-intersecting cross-sections which are insensitive to local variation of geometrical shapes in abnormal vessels...|$|R
