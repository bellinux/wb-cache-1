40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts in Serbian ski areas are very strong, leading to landscape degradation and functionality losses. Construction or improvement works cause serious destruction of topsoil and native vegetation. Some activities enhance erosion production and sediment yield: clear cuttings; trunk transport down the slope; road construction and large excavations. Also, lack of erosion <b>control</b> <b>works</b> in ski <b>areas,</b> especially between April and October, result {{in various forms}} of land degradation such as furrows, gullies, landslides, or debris from rock weathering. The consequences of mismanagement in ski areas are noticeable in downstream sections of river beds, causing floods and bed-load deposition. Planning and designing activities, with the application of technical and biotechnical erosion control structures, through the concept of restoration, are necessary measures in the protection of ski areas...|$|R
40|$|In work environments, {{considered}} as pervasive environments with persons, materials, and tools {{which can be}} controlled via heterogeneous technological devices, several risks can be corrected and even prevented if properly managed. We propose an approach to address risks in work environments through trusted web services widespread on the various devices which monitor and control the safety status of the environment. We integrate the notion of risks in an environment with trust, such that one drives the other providing feedback for dynamic alerts based on the environment's constraints. A trusted cooperation protocol for services is outlined so that services can interact along wireless lines or service grids. We outline the technological features of a service system, which collects data from sensors and implements safety <b>control</b> technologies in <b>work</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

Data from altogether eight industrial <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> in production plants of nanostructured TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles were obtained and {{used to test the}} methodology and to derive a first assessment of possible exposure of workers. Particle size distributions were determined in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> environments with concurrent measurements at a comparison site. Data from the comparison site were used to estimate the particle background level in the <b>work</b> <b>area</b> and distinguish it from potentially released nanomaterial. The analysis is based on the comparison of time resolved data from the <b>work</b> <b>area</b> and the comparison site as well as data determined during periods with and without work activities in the <b>work</b> <b>area.</b> The data analysis method introduced delivers size-resolved information on the potential nanoparticle exposure of workers. A significant release of particles in the size range 100 – 562 nm was observed in the <b>work</b> <b>area</b> of bagging aluminum oxide and is stemming from damaging or overfilling of bags, and the necessary activities during the cleaning of the <b>work</b> <b>area.</b> The maximum particle diameter of these particles was around 340 nm.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the mortality from non-respiratory cancers by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> among active and retired male {{workers of the}} German rubber industry. METHODS: A cohort of 11, 633 male German workers was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) on 1 January 1981 and had been employed {{for at least one}} year in one of five study plants producing tyres or technical rubber goods. Work histories were reconstructed from routinely documented "cost centre codes" and classified into six categories: I preparation of materials; II production of technical rubber goods; III production of tyres; IV storage and dispatch; V general service; VI others. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs), controlling for age and calendar year and stratified by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (employment in respective <b>work</b> <b>area</b> for at least one year) and time related variables (year of hire, lagged years of employment in <b>work</b> <b>area)</b> were calculated from national mortality rates as the reference. RESULTS: Significant increases in mortality were found for pharyngeal cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> IV (three deaths, SMR 486, 95 % CI 101 to 1419), oesophageal cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> III (11 deaths, SMR 227, 95 % CI 114 to 407), and leukaemia in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (11 deaths, SMR 216; 95 % CI 108 to 387) and II (14 deaths, SMR 187; 95 % CI 102 to 213). Furthermore, increased SMRs were found for stomach cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> I (22 deaths, SMR 134; 95 % CI 84 to 203), colon cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> II (27 deaths, SMR 131, 95 % CI 86 to 191), prostatic cancer in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> V (27 deaths, SMR 152, 95 % CI 99 to 221), and bladder cancer in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> IV (six deaths, SMR 253; 95 % CI 93 to 551) and V (12 deaths, SMR 159, 95 % CI 82 to 279). Mortality from cancer of the liver or gall bladder, pancreas and kidney, and from lymphomas was not substantially increased in any of the <b>work</b> <b>areas.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from cancer of several sites was associated with specific <b>work</b> <b>areas.</b> Some of these associations have been reported previously.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects on upper limb and lower back muscles activities during prolonged sitting in two different <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundaries. The effects are measured from the muscle activities of subjects performing two repetitive tasks at the near <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary and at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. Subjects consisted of 10 males (age 27. 7 +/- 5. 42) and 10 females (age 27. 5 +/- 5. 91) with no history of musculoskeletal injury or back problem at the time of participation. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal were recorded from the right and left Levator Scapulae, Upper Trapezius, Anterior Deltoid and Erector Spinae which are known as the weaken and tighten muscles due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The EMG signal was processed and normalized in the form of % MVC for analysis. The overall results indicated that muscle activities in the upper limb and lower back increased significantly when performing work at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. The most active muscle is the Left Erector Spinae (2. 37 % MVC at the near, 2. 91 % MVC at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary), while the lowest active muscle is the Left Anterior Deltoid (0. 09 % MVC at the near, 0. 13 % MVC at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary). The muscle activity at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary is on average 17 % greater than at the near <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary. Females showed greater muscular activity compared to males at the near (average difference, 1. 28 % MVC) and at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary (average difference, 1. 56 % MVC). The result of independent sample t-test showed significant differences on muscle activities at the near and at the far <b>work</b> <b>area</b> boundary between males and females. The results above indicate the importance to predict the muscle activity and time to fatigue.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the cancer specific mortality by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> among active and retired male {{workers in the}} German rubber industry. METHODS: A cohort of 11, 663 male German workers was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were classified as active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) as of 1 January 1981 and had been employed {{for at least one}} year in one of five study plants producing tyres or technical rubber goods. Work histories were reconstructed with routinely documented "cost centre codes" which were classified into six categories: I preparation of materials; II production of technical rubber goods; III production of tyres; IV storage and dispatch; V maintenance; and VI others. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age and calendar year and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs), stratified by <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (employment in respective <b>work</b> <b>area</b> for at least one year) and time related variables (year of hire, lagged years of employment in <b>work</b> <b>area),</b> were calculated from national reference rates. RESULTS: SMRs for laryngeal cancer were highest in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> I (SMR 253; 95 % CI 93 to 551) and were significant among workers who were employed for > 10 years in this <b>work</b> <b>area</b> (SMR 330; 95 % CI 107 to 779). Increased mortality rates from lung cancer were identified in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (SMR 162; 95 % CI 129 to 202), II (SMR 134; 95 % CI 109 to 163), and V (SMR 131; 95 % CI 102 to 167). Mortality from pleural cancer was increased in all six <b>work</b> <b>areas,</b> and significant excesses were found in <b>work</b> <b>areas</b> I (SMR 448; 95 % CI 122 to 1146), II (SMR 505; 95 % CI 202 to 1040), and V (SMR 554; 95 % CI 179 to 1290). CONCLUSION: A causal relation between the excess of pleural cancer and exposure to asbestos among rubber workers is plausible and likely. In this study, the pattern of excess of lung cancer parallels the pattern of excess of pleural cancer. This points to asbestos as one risk factor for the excess deaths from lung cancer among rubber workers. The study provides further evidence for an increased mortality from laryngeal cancer among workers in the rubber industry, particularly in <b>work</b> <b>area</b> I...|$|R
