The famous Black-Scholes model is the most widely used model for option pricing and hedging. However, because of the existence of transaction costs and it is unrealistic to hedge continuously in the real world, the Black-Scholes model and the delta dynamic hedging strategy which based on the Black-Scholes model are no longer effective. Thus this paper discussed and simulated 6 alternative discrete hedging strategies in evidence.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 1990 s, the {{issuance}} of option contracts was mostly a privilege of the official option exchange, but around the years 1998 - 1999 banks started to issue {{a large number of}} option-like securities named warrant or, as in Italy, <b>covered</b> <b>warrant.</b> These instruments are expected to have the same price of traditional options when they carry the same payoff structure. This paper compares the Italian <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> market with the traditional option market. We perform such a comparison by matching covered warrants written on Italian stocks with comparable options on the IDEM (Italian Derivatives Market), that is to say, options having the same underlying, strike price and maturity. Otherwise, when the match is not possible with options available on this market, we generate market-consistent prices of comparable options by means of pricing models. The results confirm the presence of a systematic overpricing of the warrants with respect to the options; in line with the evidences from other European <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> market. In particular, we find that the overpricing is relevant with respect to the option, but also among the different issuers. It seems clear that the theoretical argument does not hold because {{the differences between the two}} instruments, in terms of financial products, are not marginal as supposed and that the specific nature of the issuers, banks, influences the overpricing. The results of the regression analysis performed to test the relationship between the overpricing and market variables offer only weak evidences. As possible explanation, we emphasize that the participation costs, as defined by Allen and Santomero (1997, 2001), play a crucial role in explaining why the investors are willing to pay a higher price for the covered warrants. Another possible explanation is that the lower number of issuers implies a higher market power and allows banks for setting higher prices...|$|E

Overall, the hypotheses of there are significant price effect and abnormal trading volume around the warrant expirations cannot be rejected. The hypotheses of different price effect and trading volume in sub groups also have been confirmed. This study makes extensive of data from Taiwanese market and several sample groups; the empirical analysis can also serve as a means to improve academic knowledge of impact derivative expiration event on the underlying shares.

40|$|The <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> {{market in}} the UK has gained in {{popularity}} over time since first launched in 2002. This has opened up an alternative investment choice which offers derivative securities with a life of typically one to two years. It seems to fulfill many of the functions of a traded options market. Since most research {{has been focused on}} options trading, the investigation on covered warrants trading is still very limited. This is also largely {{due to the lack of}} readily available data for end-traded covered warrants and the existing covered warrants. A unique set of hand-collected data, supplemented by public and private data from main covered warrants issuer and the financial database are employed, making this thesis possible. The sample periods can be divided into two separate sets. The UK covered warrants trading during the period July 2004 - December 2006 are used to examine the impact of warrant introduction and expiration on the price, volume and volatility of the underlying securities. For the introduction analyses, both the announcement and listing of covered warrants have negative impacts on the price of underlying securities for both call and put features, though the impact of the announcement is more pronounced than that of the listing. These affects are temporary and do not persist much beyond the introduction of the warrants. Negative price impacts of the expiration event are also reported for both call and put covered warrants. However, this study finds no significant impacts on the volume of underlying securities trading from the announcement, listing and expiration of call and put covered warrants. Further evidence indicates an increase in volatility of the underlying securities during the announcement and listing of covered warrants. The results hold true for both call and put warrants cases. On the other hand, a decreasing stock volatility is found as a consequence of the expiration of both call and put covered warrants. The second data set involves the call covered warrants traded in the UK market between April 2007 and December 2008; this was analysed for evidence of the best appropriate covered warrants pricing model. This study suggests default risk as a major concern for the warrant price which is called the Vulnerable warrant price. The reasons behind this arise from concern about the issuer’s creditworthiness due to traders’ fraudulent action and the recent subprime problem, the difficulties of dynamic hedging by issuers because of market imperfections, as well as the no guarantees on <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> trading provided by the London Stock Exchange. The most salient findings of the study are the following. The Vulnerable warrant price is generally lower than both the Black-Scholes price and warrant market price throughout the warrant’s lifetime. The evidence suggests an overvalued warrant price in the UK market. Moreover, the in-the-money warrants indicate a higher rate of default in comparison to the out-of-the-money warrants. An additional finding shows that the market becomes aware of the default risk only on a short-term basis. The presentation of negative abnormal returns of both market and the Black-Sholes prices support the assumption that default risk is a relevant factor in pricing the UK covered warrants. These findings add to the literature dealing with the effect of derivatives trading on the underlying securities as well as providing more empirical evidence on a particular <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> market. This could be of interest not only for practitioners to widen their investment opportunities but also for regulators to have this as a guideline for their future related policies planning.

5000|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>warrants</b> {{are very}} similar to options—much more so than [...] "traditional" [...] warrants. This is because <b>covered</b> <b>warrants,</b> just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants.

In most markets around the world, <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> are more popular than the traditional warrants described above.

40|$|Problem: Investors are {{dependent}} on the issuers’ valuation of covered warrants because the issuers also act as market makers. Hence {{it is crucial that}} the issuers value each of the five variables used in the Black & Scholes pricing formula in the same way at both the buying and selling occasion. For a <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> investor the most important is-sue is the volatility and how it changes over time. This thesis will therefore search for differences in changes of implied volatility between the different issuers. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to analyze differences and similarities between the issuers’ changes of their covered warrants implied volatility. Method: The authors have calculated the implied volatility for a sample of warrants with H&M and Ericsson as underlying assets. Black & Scholes formula has been used and this part of the thesis is made with a quantitative approach. After the implied volatility had been calculated correlation tests to the mean {{as well as to the}} stock were made. When analyzing the results the authors, in addition to the calculation, used a qualitative method by interviewing market makers. This was made in order to find better explanations to the results. Conclusions: The differences in changes of implied volatility found between different warrants were small. In general, one warrant changed in the same way as the other ones from one day to another. These results reject the rumors that single issuers adjust their implied volatility in order to make more money. When single events in form of reports were analyzed, the authors found that the issuers changed their volatility in the same way to adjust for the changed uncertainty about the stocks future price. Further, these events clarifies that the basic dynamics of implied volatility is followed by the market. The analysis of how the implied volatility changes with respect to the stock price movements indicates a negative correlation. This implies that an increase in the stock price will lower the implied volatility and vice verse...|$|E
