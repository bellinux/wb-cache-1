50|$|Hemorrhagic {{cystitis}} is rare when ifosfamide {{is given}} with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is encephalopathy (brain dysfunction). It occurs {{in some form}} in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by <b>chloroacetaldehyde,</b> one of the breakdown products of the ifosfamide molecule, which has chemical properties similar to acetaldehyde and chloral hydrate. The symptoms of ifosfamide encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate (delirium, psychosis), to severe (nonconvulsive status epilepticus or coma). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, ifosfamide can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the National Cancer Institute or the Meanwell criteria (grade I-IV).

(some col.) 29 cmSeveral {{groups of}} chemicals {{are known to}} react with DNA. Some of these are known mutagens while others are potential carcinogens. In this work, {{an attempt was made}} to observe if such reactions were random or if indeed there are preferred bases / sequences where adduct formation occurs. A simple model was used for this work in which the DNA chain synthesis is terminated when the Sequenase™ enzyme reaches an adduct. The DNA used was M 13 mp 18 (7. 30 kilobases). This DNA is available from commercial sources in either the single or the double stranded circular form. The reactions were carried out with <b>chloroacetaldehyde,</b> or with the methyl, ethyl and propyl derivatives of N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, or with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine, phenyl hydrazine, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydrazine hydrate or with methyl methanesulfonate. Position 81 (thymidine) was found to be a common fall off point. with all these chemicals. The other positions of fall off had some overlap but each chemical class had a unique adduct pattern. The methyl, ethyl and propyl derivatives of N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine had the same positions of chain termination. Varying the salt concentration had a significant effect on the number of adducts formed when M 13 mp 18 DNA was reacted with <b>chloroacetaldehyde.</b> A large number of termination points were observed in the presence of 100 mM sodium acetate. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine if in fact the <b>chloroacetaldehyde</b> was reacting with the DNA or if the mutagen merely prevented the enzyme from acting in the labeling step. It was found that the <b>chloroacetaldehyde</b> reacted with the DNA both in the single and the double stranded forms. Both the absorption and the fluorescence spectra indicated this and that nearly every base was adducted in most of the experiments reported here. <b>Chloroacetaldehyde</b> was also found to affect the Sequenase™ enzyme causing additional points of chain termination when it was added in the labeling step. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that <b>chloroacetaldehyde</b> did not alter the migration pattern of either M 13 mp 18 single or double stranded DNA or of the Hind III linear double stranded mixture.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of 1, 2 -dichloroethane and 2 -chloroethanol by Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10 proceeds via <b>chloroacetaldehyde,</b> a reactive and potentially toxic intermediate. The organism produced {{at least three}} different aldehyde dehydrogenases, of which one is plasmid encoded. Two mutants of strain GJ 10, designated GJ 10 M 30 and GJ 10 M 41 could no longer grow an 2 -chloroethanol and were found to lack the NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase that is the predominant protein in wild-type cells growing on 2 -chloroethanol.

This adduct is formed in the {{reaction of}} <b>chloroacetaldehyde</b> with the free base as well. After DNA hydrolysis followed by isolation of this new adduct by h. p. l. c, its mass spectrum and fluorescence spectrum are identical with those published in the literature for the chemi-cally synthesized N 2, 3 -ethenoguanine.

The affinity of strain DCA 1 for DCA is very high, with a Km value below the detection limit of 0. 5 μM.

40|$|Chemical probing of two {{predominantly}} alternating purine-pyrimidine d(CA/TG) n repeats led us {{to propose}} previously that in supercoiled plasmids these elements adopt a non-B-DNA structure distinct from that of Z-DNA formed by d(CG) n sequences. Here, we present further evidence supporting this contention. Reactivity with the conformation-sensitive reagent <b>chloroacetaldehyde,</b> which reacts with unpaired adenines and cytosines, was confined strictly to adenines in the d(CA/TG) n repeat. In contrast, only bases outside the d(CG) n repeat exhibited <b>chloroacetaldehyde</b> reactivity. Two-dimensional gel analysis of topoisomers containing d(CA/TG) n tracts with bases out of strict purine-pyrimidine alteration revealed multiple superhelical-dependent transitions to an alternative left-handed structure. Within individual plasmid molecules, these multiple transitions resulted from the stepwise conversion of contiguous segments of alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence, which are delimited by bases out of alternation, to the full-length alternative conformation. When the left-handed helices increased in length to include more bases out of alternation, the average helical pitch changed substantially to produce a less tightly wound left-handed helix.

Furthermore, the exchange rate for hydrogens of amino and imide groups of DNA bases in DNA strands with deuterium in the solvent was totally unaffected upon complexing of DNA with the DNA helix-destabilizing protein as examined by stopped-flow ultraviolet spectroscopy. These results indicate that the DNA helix-destabilizing protein forms a complex with single-stranded DNA, leaving DNA bases uncovered by the protein.
