40|$|Excerpt} Mind {{maps are}} a visual means that represent, link, and arrange <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes,</b> or tasks, with {{connections}} usually extending radially from a central topic. They {{are used by}} individuals and groups (informally and intuitively) to generate, visualize, structure, and classify these. Intelligence is a potential, and thinking is the operating skill through which it acts upon experience. Outside highly technical matters, perception {{is the most important}} part of thinking. If most errors of thinking are errors of perception—that being colored by emotions and values—thinking as a skill can be improved by practice and education. Numerous straightforward yet powerful tools encourage creativity and flexibility, and help optimize different styles of reasoning (including analyzing, integrating, planning, and problem solving). They include APC, OPV, PMI, brainstorming, lateral thinking, and mind maps. After they are mastered, these tools can be applied explicitly. We usually write notes as sentences that we break into paragraphs, lists, or bullet points. A mind map is a circular, nonlinear way of organizing information: it shows the connections between a central topic and the relative importance of the <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes,</b> or tasks that one relates to it. It can be applied by individuals and groups to generate, visualize, structure, and classify these whenever clearer thinking and improved learning will enhance performance and effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Employees of {{manufacturing}} companies are often {{asked to participate}} in the implementation of firm strategic initiatives such as innovation, customer relationship management, entering new overseas markets and competitive actions within the marketplace. Previous studies that examined this participation invariably looked at employee participation and involvement in the implementation of one of these intervention strategies in isolation, rather than considering employee behaviours and involvement when a company simultaneously implements two or more of these initiatives. This study explored the interaction between both innovation and market orientation using a series of interviews with key managers from manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Greater Western Sydney economic development zone in NSW, Australia. Interview transcripts were analysed and key <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes</b> and connections identified using word frequency analysis software, Leximancer...|$|E

We will investigate human thought and behavior from a variety of different theoretical perspectives, including the biological (evolutionary and physiological), cognitive, social, and personality perspectives. We will also consider the history and methodology of the science of psychology and conclude with an integrative examination of selected topics in psychopathology and health...|$|E
40|$|Research {{related to}} {{leadership}} and well-being {{has been gaining}} momentum in this past decade (Donaldson-Feilder, Munir, & Lewis, 2013; Kuoppala et al., 2008). However, upon examining {{the vast majority of}} the literature, we notice that it is lacking in a particular area: qualitative research. Are we certain then that the bulk of current research, being quantitative in nature, is providing us with a complete picture of leadership and its effect on employee well-being? With this question in mind, it is the aim of this study to bring together current qualitative literature relating to leadership and organizational well-being. By bringing together the <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes,</b> and findings of the qualitative literature we can broaden our understandings of leadership and well-being in general, while also becoming informed on the approaches of this qualitative research...|$|E

Philosophy as hermeneutics is a justified concept, especially with regard to defining the <b>concept</b> <b>theme</b> of the world of the text and the self-understanding, the reflection acting as a force, not only over the unfamiliar, but also on the self as subject matter of knowledge, creation and value acts...|$|R
40|$|Education for {{sustainability}} {{is becoming}} a critical component in achieving a sustainable life and protecting our planet and human habitats. However, {{a review of the}} sustainability literature reveals a great deal of confusion and misinterpretation regarding the <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes,</b> and goals of education for sustainability. Education for sustainability, including the themes that should be derived and taught, lacks an interdisciplinary conceptual framework. In addition, the literature of education for sustainability mostly lacks the aspects of urban and community planning and the significant contribution of the planning profession. This paper proposes a new conceptual framework, Sustainability Education Framework, which is composed of concepts that derived from different disciplines. At the heart of the conceptual framework rests the normative category and its concepts. The epistemological foundation of the conceptual framework of education for sustainability is based on the unresolved paradox between ‘sustainability’ and ‘development’...|$|E

40|$|Prior and {{conflicting}} stakeholder concerns can make projects complex. Listening to, and integrating, this concern {{into the project}} is easier said than done. However the pragmatic ethics of the Australian 'fair-go' argues long term success requires an attempt be made. This pragmatic philosophy provides a solution by explaining the relationship between community, conceptualization and agreed reasonable action. After introducing pragmatism, this paper uses an Australian based re-organization project to explain why linguistic concepts {{might be used to}} conceive projects made complex by conflicting stakeholders. The philosophy is made operational by using idea networking to reveal the concepts underpinning stakeholders' comments. This method clusters similar statements to enable exposure of these underlying <b>concepts</b> (<b>themes,</b> meta narrative), which are named. It was found that using this concept driven method provides an internally consistent means of conceptualizing projects with conflicting stakeholders' concerns.

40|$|Minnesota Contextual Content Analysis (MCCA) is a {{technique}} for characterizing the <b>concepts</b> and <b>themes</b> occurring in text (sentences, paragraphs, interview transcripts, books). MCCA gs each word with a category and examines the distribution of categories against norms representing general usage of categories. MCCA also scores texts {{in terms of social}} contexts that are similar to different functions of language.

The defining characteristics that emerge from the mapping and the statistical techniques used in MCCA for analyzing <b>concepts</b> and <b>themes</b> suggest that tagging with WordNet synsets or MCCA categories may produce epiphenomenal results that are misleading. We suggest that WordNet synsets and MCCA categories be augmented with further lexical semantic information for use alter text is tagged or categorized. We suggest that such information is useful not only for the primary purposes of disambiguation in parsing and text classification in content analysis and information retrieval, but also for tasks in corpus analysis, discourse analysis, and automatic text summarization...|$|R

40|$|Enquiring about hermeneutical {{and methodological}} {{considerations}} appropriate to {{studies on the}} modern concept of ‘human dignity ’ in the New Testament, some initial concerns are raised about the potential benefit of such work. Investigations of human dignity in the New Testament secondly requires appreciation for the complex and multi-facetted way in which first-century people and their value or worth or dignity were in play; for accounting for first-century CE considerations or contexts, where honour and shame were pivotal values within a hierarchical and patriarchal society of limited good; and, for an environment that was thoroughly saturated with the omnipresent and hugely influential Roman Empire on socio-political, {{as well as economical}} and religious levels. Thirdly, a range of <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes</b> and topics found in the New Testament – some of which are invoked in theological discussions on human dignity, but others whose potential in this regard has perhaps not been adequately recognised – are briefly identified and considered for their possible contribution to conceptualising human dignity in biblical and theological discourse...|$|E
40|$|On 20 November 1989, the United Nations General Assembly, {{comprised}} of delegates representing {{a wide spectrum}} of legal systems, cultures and religious traditions, unanimously adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Now, {{more than a quarter of}} a century on, the CRC is ratified by almost the entire international community and is widely regarded as the most important advocacy tool for children’s rights. Incorporating the full range of human rights – civil, cultural, economic, political and social – it creates an international legal framework for the protection and promotion of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons under the age of 18. This introductory chapter establishes the motivation and rationale for and aims and objectives of the book and outlines the overarching conceptual framework for the chapters that follow; namely a critical exploration of the ways in which the CRC has informed, presently informs and may in future inform educational research in various contexts internationally.

The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate existing indexing frameworks in the context of reportage photographs and to find out how the use of this particular image genre influences the results. The effect of different tasks on image description and categorization was also studied. Subjects performed keywording and free description tasks and the elicited terms were classified using the most extensive one of the reviewed frameworks. Differences were found in the terms used in constrained and unconstrained descriptions. Summarizing terms such as abstract <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes,</b> settings and emotions were used more frequently in keywording than in free description. Free descriptions included more terms referring to locations within the images, people and descriptive terms due to the narrative form the subjects used without prompting. The evaluated framework was found to lack some syntactic and semantic classes present in the data and modifications were suggested. According to the results of this study image categorization is based on high-level interpretive concepts, including affective and abstract themes. The results indicate that image genre influences categorization and keywording modifies and truncates natural image description...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{representation}} of a live, audio-visual keynote address given at the Creative Citizens Conference in London (September 2014), co-presented by Hargreaves (IH) and Hartley (JH). It seeks to combine (i) autobiographical narrative storytelling – two of them, in fact; with (ii) an attempt to build <b>concepts,</b> <b>themes</b> and strategies out of that narrative, and how the two stories did indeed arrive at ‘one destination’; and (iii) plentiful use of visual prompts, combined with part-scripted, part-improvised dialogic commentary. This approach was risky on the day; it is even harder to render into two dimensions, not least because a vital element, the audience, cannot be represented in that format. Nevertheless, we offer the ‘paper’ as a record of how two intersecting lives and careers were both drawn to the ‘Creative Citizens’ idea, {{not only as a}} research problem but also as a component of the speakers’ own practice – one as a high profile journalist turned academic; the other as an academic with interests in alternative models of journalism. We think that our bio-trajectories are relevant to the way that the research project led by Hargreaves has been tackled...|$|E
