40|$|Variability in the {{infrared}} emission from disks around pre-main sequence stars {{over the course of}} days to weeks appears to be common, but the physical cause of the changes in disk structure are not constrained. Here we present coordinated monitoring of one young cluster with the Spitzer and <b>Chandra</b> <b>space</b> <b>telescopes</b> aimed at studying the physical source of the variability. In fall 2011 we obtained ten epochs of Chandra ACIS photometry over a period of 30 days with a roughly 3 day cadence contemporaneous with 20 epochs of Spitzer [3. 6],[4. 5] photometry over 40 days with a roughly 2 day cadence of the IC 348 cluster. This cadence allows us to search for week to month long responses of {{the infrared}} emission to changes in the high-energy flux. We find no strong evidence for a direct link between the X-ray and infrared variability on these timescales among 39 cluster members with circumstellar disks. There is no significant correlation between the shape of the infrared and X-ray light curves, or between the size of the X-ray and infrared variability. Among the stars with an X-ray flare none showed evidence of a correlated change {{in the infrared}} photometry on timescales of days to weeks following the flare. This lack of connection implies that X-ray heating of the planet forming region of the disk is not significant, although we cannot rule out rapid or instantaneous changes in infrared emission.

Astrometric comparisons of the X-ray transient positions and the HST images reveal the XRFs to be associated with faint blue galaxies. Photometric evidence of these putative hosts suggests that these two XRFs originated from redshifts less than z ~ 3. 5, and thus cannot be due to GRBs at very high redshifts. In both host-burst offsets and host properties, these XRFs could have been drawn from distributions similar to those measured of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

50|$|Using {{data from}} the <b>Chandra</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> {{scientists}} have deduced that an eruption has been occurring for the last 100 million years {{at the heart of}} the galaxy cluster, releasing as much energy over this time as hundreds of millions of gamma ray bursts. (The amount of energy released in a year is thus equivalent to several GRBs.) The remnants of the eruption are seen as two cavities on either side of a large central galaxy. If this outburst, with a total energy budget of more than 1055 J, was caused by a black hole accretion event, it must have consumed nearly 600 million solar masses. Work done by Brian McNamara et al. (2008) point out the striking possibility that the outburst was not the result of an accretion event, but was instead powered by the rotation of the black hole. Moreover, the scientists mentioned the possibility that the central black hole in MS 0735.6+7421 could be one of the biggest black holes inhabiting the visible universe. This speculation is supported by the fact that the central cD Galaxy inside MS 0735.6+7421 possess the largest break radius known, as of today. With a calculated light deficit of more than 20 billion solar luminosities and an assumed light to mass ratio of 3, this yields a central black hole mass much above 10 billion solar masses, as far as the break radius was caused by the merger of several black holes in the past. In combination with the gargantuan energy outburst it is therefore very likely that MS 0735.6+7421 hosts a supermassive black hole in its core.The cluster has a red shift of 64,800 ± 900 km/s and an apparent size of 25&prime;.|$|E

The <b>Chandra</b> (X-ray) <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> has helped us to discover 33 Black Holes. There are some extremely fascinating things out there in our Universe to explore. In order to travel greater distances into our Universe, and to reach planetary bodies in our Solar System in much less time, new and innovative space propulsion systems must be developed. To this end NASA has created the Prometheus Program. When one considers space missions to the outer edges of our Solar System and far beyond, our Sun cannot be relied on to produce the required spacecraft (s/c) power. Solar energy diminishes as the square of the distance from the Sun. At Mars it is only 43 % of that at Earth. At Jupiter, it falls off to only 3. 6 % of Earth's. By the time we get out to Pluto, solar energy is only. 066 % what it is on Earth. Therefore, beyond the orbit of Mars, it is not practical to depend on solar power for a s/c. However, the farther out we go the more power we need to heat the s/c and to transmit data back to Earth over the long distances. On Earth, knowledge is power. In the outer Solar System, power is knowledge. It is important that the public be made aware of the tremendous space benefits offered by Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) and the minimal risk it poses to our environment.

Despite their significance, {{unambiguously}} confirmed cases remain scarce {{and most have}} been discovered serendipitously.

Here we present <b>Chandra</b> and Hubble <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3) imaging of these four systems.

We find tentative evidence for a systematically smaller X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio and/or higher Compton-thick fraction in optically selected kpc-scale binary AGNs than in single AGNs, possibly caused by a higher nuclear gas column due to mergers and/or a viewing angle bias related to the double-peak narrow line selection.

Peacock et al. (2014) searched for evidence of this trend and found that the observed number of LMXBs per unit K-band luminosity (N/L_K) was nearly constant.

40|$|Winds are {{predicted}} to be ubiquitous in low-mass, actively star-forming galaxies. Observationally, winds {{have been detected}} in relatively few local dwarf galaxies, with even fewer constraints placed on their timescales. Here, we compare galactic outflows traced by diffuse, soft X-ray emission from <b>Chandra</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> archival observations to the star formation histories derived from Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the resolved stellar populations in six starburst dwarfs. We constrain the longevity of a wind to be of order 25 Myr based on galaxies whose starburst activity has already declined, although a larger sample is needed to confirm this result. Compared to estimates from spiral galaxies, we find a higher average efficiency for converting the mechanical energy of stellar feedback to thermal, soft X-ray emission. The outflows have likely been sustained for timescales comparable to {{the duration of the}} starbursts (i. e., 100 's Myr), after taking into account the time for the development and cessation of the wind. The wind timescales imply that material is driven to larger distances in the circumgalactic medium than previously thought from assuming 5 - 10 Myr starburst durations, and that less material is recycled back to the host galaxy on short timescales. In the detected outflows, the expelled hot gas shows various morphologies which are not consistent with a simple biconical outflow structure.

This analysis is done in a residual image that {{is the result of the}} subtraction of a surface brightness model, obtained by fitting a two-dimensional analytical model (beta-model or Sérsic profile) with elliptical symmetry, from the X-ray image. Our method is applied to 34 clusters observed by the <b>Chandra</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> that are in the redshift range 0. 02 <z< 0. 2 and have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. We present the calibration of the method and the relations between the substructure level with physical quantities, such as the mass, X-ray luminosity, temperature, and cluster redshift. We use our method to separate the clusters in two sub-samples of high and low substructure levels. We conclude, using Monte Carlo simulations, that the method recuperates very well the true amount of substructure for small angular core radii clusters (with respect to the whole image size) and good signal-to-noise observations. We find no evidence of correlation between the substructure level and physical properties of the clusters such as mass, gas temperature, X-ray luminosity and redshift. The scaling relations for the two sub-samples (high and low substructure level clusters) are different (they present an off-set, i. e., given a fixed mass or temperature, low substructure clusters tend to be more X-ray luminous), which is an important result for cosmological tests using the mass-luminosity relation to obtain the cluster mass function, since they rely on the assumption that clusters do not present different scaling relations according to their dynamical state.
