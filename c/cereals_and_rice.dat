50|$|Although {{there is}} {{sufficient}} iron in most soils for plant growth, plant iron deficiency {{is a problem in}} calcareous soil, due to the low solubility of iron(III) hydroxide. Calcareous soil accounts for 30% of the world's farmland. Under such conditions graminaceous plants (grasses, <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice)</b> secrete phytosiderophores into the soil, a typical example being deoxymugineic acid. Phytosiderophores have a different structure to those of fungal and bacterial siderophores having two α-aminocarboxylate binding centres, together with a single α-hydroxycarboxylate unit. This latter bidentate function provides phytosiderophores with a high selectivity for iron(III). When grown in an iron -deficient soil, roots of graminaceous plants secrete siderophores into the rhizosphere. On scavenging iron(III) the iron -phytosiderophore complex is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using a proton symport mechanism. The iron(III) complex is then reduced to iron(II) and the iron is transferred to nicotianamine, which although very similar to the phytosiderophores is selective for iron(II) and is not secreted by the roots. Nicotianamine translocates iron in phloem to all plant parts.|$|E

40|$|The EU is {{to revise}} {{the basis for the}} {{calculation}} of tariffs applied to <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice.</b> The existing system is based on US commercial exchange prices, but in recent years new exporters have started to sell grain at prices well below other 'world market' prices. This has led to abnormally high EU imports of <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice.</b> The new system of tariffs that the commission is proposing will be based on a more representative calculation of actual world-market prices. The new system may use fixed duties and tariff quotas, but will have to be negotiated with concerned exporters in the WTO. The Commission asserts that the EU has 'no intention to be more restrictive concerning access for <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> to the EU market. ' The aim it claims is merely to 'improve the system to more accurately fulfil our WTO obligations and protect our rights'. The USA has complained about the new EU proposals, which it sees as restrictive. The Commission however sees it simply as an administrative measure designed to bring representative prices used for calculating import duties more into line with actual world-market prices. The Commission maintains that the new system will be WTO-compatible since it will be negotiated with the concerned trading partners. Comment: This EU measure follows high EU imports of cereals and demonstrates the willingness of the EU to revise its import regime whenever the implementation of the existing regime threatens the disruption of EU markets.

40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} {{the effects of the}} reforms proposed by the European Commission in July 2002 for the Mid Term Review (MTR) of Agenda 2000. The proposals are described in the framework of the long standing CAP reform process driven by political priorities such as the enlargement to the Central and Eastern European countries, the budget issues, and the ongoing WTO negotiations. The most important measures proposed are the full decoupling of direct payments, the modulation of direct payments, and changes in the support regimes for <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice.</b> Altogether, the proposals for the MTR appear substantial, especially considering the conservative attitude of the EU decision-making process. The Applied General Equilibrium model provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project was employed to simulate the effects of the MTR. Scenarios were designed to highlight especially the impact of the full decoupling and the modulation of direct payments. The Eastward enlargement of the EU was also introduced; in this case, direct payments were calculated starting from the financial perspectives indicated by the Commission after the Brussels Council. Results indicate that the full decoupling of direct payments {{is by far the most}} significant change proposed, whereas both the changes in the CMOs and the payment modulation appear to have a more limited impact.

40|$|Waste {{prevention}} {{is the top}} priority of the European waste management strategy. In fact, as indicated in the latest Waste Framework Directive, the best option to deal with waste is not to generate it at all. In this framework, the distribution of loose dry food products through self-dispensing systems (so-called “loose distribution”) is being considered worldwide as a practice to reduce the generation of packaging waste. This life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the environmental convenience of the loose distribution of dry pasta, breakfast <b>cereals,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice,</b> {{in comparison with the}} traditional method of distribution. For each product, several baseline scenarios based on single-use packaging were compared with different waste prevention scenarios in which the product is distributed loose. The comparison addressed waste generation, 13 impact categories on the environment and human health, and the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) indicator. The results are significantly different for the 3 products. The loose distribution of pasta allows a 50 % waste reduction and a decrease in the potential impacts only when compared with single-use cartonboard boxes. Conversely, when the comparison is made with single-use polypropylene bags, the loose distribution can even cause an increase in waste generation (up to 15 %) and in the potential life cycle impacts. For breakfast cereals, the loose distribution allows a significant reduction in both the amount of waste (up to 84 %) and the potential impacts, compared to the sale of traditional single-use bag-in-box packages. Finally, the loose distribution of rice permits a reduction in both waste generation (up to 86 %) and most of the potential impacts. In particular, the impact reduction is higher when the reference single-use packaging that is replaced includes a cartonboard box.

40|$|Proposals for the {{mid-term review}} of the Common Agricultural Policy were set out in a Communication issued by the European Commission on July 10 th 2002. They {{can be divided into}} two categories: those {{extending}} the current process of reform initiated since 1992; those for completing the shift from product support to producer support. The extension of the 1992 reform process calls for: a final 5 % cut in the cereals intervention price (involving a reduction from Euro 101. 31 to Euro 95. 35 from 2004 / 5, with compensation in line with the Agenda 2000 formula), and a modification of the EU's import regime for <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> (see accompanying article); a modification of special payments for durum wheat to encourage quality production for manufacturing purposes; a reduction of the rice intervention price by 50 % to bring it into line with world market prices (to Euro 150 per tonne by 2004 / 5), with compensation being paid equivalent to 88 % of the reduction in line with the Agenda 2000 cereals sector reforms; in the beef sector a major simplification of the direct aid payments to encourage safer and more quality focused production methods; an extension of reforms in the dairy sector. It is believed that in the cereals sector these final modifications will bring prices into line with world market prices and allow exports (except for rye) without any need for export refunds. In the beef sector it is believed that by decoupling the headage payment and replacing it with a single income payment per farm based on historical entitlement, less intensive forms of beef production will be encouraged. The overall aim of these reforms is to 'enhance the competitiveness of EU agriculture by setting intervention as a real safety-net measure, allowing EU producers to respond to market signals while protecting them from extreme price fluctuations'. The longer term objective involves finalising the shift from product support to producer support through 'the introduction of a decoupled system of payments per farm, based on historical references and conditional upon cross compliance to environmental, animal-welfare and food-quality criteria. ' This will take account of the Agenda 2000 reforms and will cover as many sectors as possible. Under this scheme EU farmers will have complete flexibility to determine what they produce in response to market signals. In the first stage the scheme will cover all products currently subject to reform, with the dairy sector being added when the Agenda 2000 decisions have been implemented. Other sectors still scheduled for reform, such as the sugar, olive oil and certain fruit and vegetable regimes will be incorporated into this wholly decoupled farm payment scheme later on. According to the Commission proposals 'although the new scheme will not cover all sectors at this stage, farmers revceiving the new decoupled farm payments will have flexibility to farm all products on their land including those which are still under coupled support, except if these productions have been exceptionally and explicitly excluded. ' A system of farm audits to ensure cross compliance with the various standards established will be supported through payments of Euro 5000 per annum made available for this purpose. A system of compulsory long term environmental set-aside will also be introduced. A system of 'dynamic modulation' is also being proposed through which 'all direct aid payments will be reduced progressively in arithmetic steps of 3 % per year to reach 20 %, the maximum agreed in Agenda 2000 '. However, this is to be applied selectively on the basis of farm size in order to rebalance the current flow of resources between larger and smaller EU farms. By the end of these changes the 'maximum sum paid to a farm will be Euro 300, 000 '. Direct aid beyond this amount will be transferred to the rural development pillar of the CAP, which is to be considerably strengthened. Both the scope and level of funding for rural development is to be expanded. New chapters will be added to the rural development regulation dealing with food quality-assurance and certification schemes and support to producer groups for the promotion of products produced under quality-assurance and certification schemes (including geographically designated and organic products). These new elements will allow for the payment of 'temporary and degressive [progressively declining] aid to farmers to help them implement demanding standards based on Community legislation in the fields of environment, food safety, animal welfare and occupational safety standards' and are intended to promote good farming practices. Payments will start at Euro 200 per ha in year one and be phased down over five years. This reflects EU concerns over the difficulties of 'simultaneously enhancing the competitiveness of EU agriculture and rural areas while responding to the higher costs resulting from requirements of promoting higher environmental, food safety, food quality and animal welfare standards'. Comment: The final cereals-sector price reduction will complete EU efforts to enhance the competitiveness of cereal and cereal-based value-added food products, by bringing EU prices into line with world market prices. This, along with the modification of direct aid payments for durum wheat will do away with the need for export refunds and will fuel the continued expansion of simple EU cereal-based value-added food-product exports, which has been underway since 1996. The 50 % reduction in the rice intervention price will greatly reduce the value of the trade preferences extended under the Cotonou Rice Declaration and the EBA initiative. The proposed reforms will also seek to insulate EU farmers from the cost-increasing effects of higher EU standards. ACP suppliers will however have to carry these extra costs on the sale price of their products and this will squeeze profit margins at a time of declining EU prices. The introduction of wholly decoupled farmer support will make the EU's farm support programmes more WTO compatible, whilst protecting EU farmers from extreme price fluctuations. As the European Commission has pointed out with reference to the US Farm Bill, this is likely to shift the burden of price fluctuations onto third-country producers, who enjoy no such safety net protection. ACP governments will need to look carefully at the implications this will have for the positions they adopt in both the on-going WTO agriculture negotiations and the forthcoming economic partnership agreement negotiations with the EU.

40|$|The {{policies}} {{needed to}} underpin water savings in the Murray-Darling Basin still haven 2 ̆ 7 t been announced, writes WAYNE CHAMLEY IN MID AUGUST the Water Bill 2007 {{was passed by}} federal parliament. The legislation proposes new management powers and statutory arrangements over the Murray-Darling Basin, {{as well as new}} roles for the Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Competition and Consumer Council. The environment and water minister, Malcolm Turnbull, claims that the legislation is necessary to enable the commonwealth government to implement the prime minister’s ten-point National Plan for Water Security, which was supported by the governments of Queensland, NSW and South Australia. The government of Victoria has always been opposed to the plan and has yet to indicate whether it will challenge the new legislation in the High Court of Australia. Even today very little detailed information is available about the government’s intentions, beyond what was released by the prime minister when he launched the plan in January this year. Other data about water in the Murray-Darling Basin has been published by the consultants CapitalAG, who were engaged by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission some five years ago to provide detailed options for making water savings. It’s interesting to compare the consultant’s published data and the information in the prime minister’s plan. Essentially the actions proposed in the prime minister’s plan aim to achieve an increase in water efficiency within the Murray-Darling Basin in four sectors of agricultural production: pastures, cotton, <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice.</b> These sectors account for about 93 per cent of the area irrigated and 92 per cent of all the water used in the basin. In 1999 - 2000 this was about 9000 billion litres of surface water and 2000 billion litres of groundwater. Using Australian Bureau of Statistics data and mathematical modelling, the consultants identified substantial potential water savings if four actions were taken across the basin: Low-cost, on-farm investments: These investments would aim to lift a substantial number of irrigators to world best practice. If just 50 per cent of the irrigators adopted new practices over ten years, the saved surface water would be around 900 billion litres. Changes in irrigators’ practices would be brought about through their participation in activities such as online education, TAFE courses and mentoring; ramping up advisory services about irrigation; and demonstration farms, field days and a yearly program of farm tours. While not costed in detail, if between 200 million and 500 million were allocated then the unit cost for the expected water savings would be between 200 and 500 per million litres. High-cost, on-farm investments: This action requires investment in available technologies, as well as an ability and interest by the user in operating the technology to get maximum performance. The consultants calculated that if 50 per cent of the irrigators adopted this scenario, the saved surface water would be about 1240 billion litres. The prime minister’s plan indicates that this action or something close to it will be promoted. But the plan does not make clear who will pay for the technologies and how irrigators will be educated about their use. No estimate is given for the number of irrigators who must make these investments so that the water savings are realised. It so happens that the figure for saved water in the prime minister’s plan (1200 billion litres) is very close to the figure calculated by the consultants (1240 billion litres). In the Murray-Darling Basin there are 20, 884 farms involved with irrigated crops and pasture. Although water-saving technologies have been available for at least twenty years, only about 15 per cent of all the irrigators in Australia use them. Government ministers and bureaucrats are being very optimistic if they believe that over ten years or so, some 10, 000 farmers are suddenly going to go “high tech”. Refurbishing and modernising irrigation infrastructure: The consultant’s report and the prime minister’s plan are in agreement on this proposed action. From the consultant’s work it can be calculated that moving from an average water loss figure of 25 per cent to 20 per cent will achieve a water saving of about 300 GL, and that savings double with every further 5 per cent reduction in water loss. Reducing losses from say 25 per cent to 10 per cent would therefore save about 1200 billion litres. The prime minister’s plan identifies an investment of 3 billion and a water saving of around 1500 billion litres. This works out at around 2000 per million litres saved. Getting the policy settings right: This scenario is the least developed by the consultants and will usually {{turn out to be the}} most dangerous for any government. What is required here is a major change in government policies and, as a consequence, practices both on and off the farm. Policy changes would have to be linked to major structural change in some sectors of the irrigation industry and the government would have to be prepared to: • close off taxation loopholes and regulate some forms of corporate investment, • clarify the national objectives in relation to trading in water entitlements, • inquire into the introduction of differential water pricing, • link taxation incentives to environmental targets and objectives, • define the opportunities for legitimate carbon emissions trading by rural enterprises, • overall, present a better policy environment which provides greater investment security. The prime minister’s plan avoids any mention of policy changes and instead proposes a buy-back of over-allocated water entitlements. It can be expected that most of this proposed purchasing will go on in NSW, if irrigators agree to sell. The target must be about 300 billion litres and this action is costed at 3 billion. On the information so far presented, the federal government is in fact offering to pay 10, 000 per million litres. As with all behavior change, the extent of the savings realised will depend on the level of participation and the degree of compliance, as well as the dollars that might have to be spent by the irrigators, in addition to the proposed government spending. Whether all of this achieves any level of water security remains to be seen. • Wayne Chamley works as a consultant in the areas of environment and health.

This hypothesis stimulated a search for the evolutionary roots of the seed storage globulins which include such food proteins as the legume soy protein—the gold standard for plant-based proteins—due to its balanced content of 7S and 11S globulin protein, other beans, the pseudocereals buckwheat, & quinoa, pumpkin seeds, cocoa, coffee, nuts, <b>and</b> the two <b>cereals</b> oats <b>and</b> <b>rice.</b>|$|R
50|$|In principle, any plant fibers can be {{considered}} as raw material. However, bast fibers of annuals (flax, hemp, jute, kenaf et al.) are preferred. Appropriate are stem fibers of perennial plants (nettle, ramie), leaf fibers (sisal, abaca, cabuja, curaua) plus seed and fruit fibers (cotton, kapok, coir). In contrast, the application of the Setralit technique to herbage (bamboo, miscanthus, bagasse, <b>cereal,</b> <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> corn straw) and wood has only been explored rudimentarily.|$|R
40|$|A {{standardized}} {{reference method}} for dermatophyte in vitro susceptibility testing is lacking. In a previous study, Norris et al. (H. A. Norris, B. E. Elewski, and M. A. Ghannoum, J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 40 (6, part 2) :S 9 –S 13) established the optimal medium and other growth variables. However, the earlier {{study did not}} address two issues: (i) selection of an optimal medium for conidial formation by dermatophytes and (ii) validation of the method {{with a large number}} of dermatophytes. The present study addresses these two points. To select which agar medium best supported conidial growth, representative isolates of dermatophytes were grown on different agars. Preliminary experiments showed that only oatmeal cereal agar supported the production of conidia by Trichophyton rubrum. We tested the abilities of 251 T. rubrum isolates to form conidia using three different <b>cereal</b> agars <b>and</b> potato dextrose agar. Overall, oatmeal <b>cereal</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> agar media were comparable in their abilities to support T. rubrum conidial growth. Next, we used the oatmeal cereal agar for conidial formation along with the optimal conditions for dermatophyte susceptibility testing proposed by Norris et al. and determined the antifungal susceptibilities of 217 dermatophytes to fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, and terbinafine. Relative to the other agents tested, terbinafine possessed the highest antifungal activity against all of the dermatophytes. The mean ± standard error of the mean MICs of fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, and griseofulvin were 2. 07 ± 0. 29, 0. 13 ± 0. 01, 0. 002 ± 0. 0003, and 0. 71 ± 0. 05 μg/ml, respectively. This study {{is the first step in}} the identification of optimal conditions that could be used for the standardization of the antifungal susceptibility testing method for dermatophytes. Inter- and intralaboratory agreement as well as clinical correlations need to be established...|$|R
50|$|When Beyonce {{worked with}} Tommy Hilfiger on this perfume, {{she wanted the}} {{fragrance}} to be smart, sexy, yet innocent. True Star was created by using top perfume notes of honeysuckle, sweet pea, <b>cereal,</b> wheat notes, <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> pudding. True Star by Tommy Hilfiger perfume can be classified as a floral, oriental, and fresh scent that can be worn for any occasion by women of all age. Beyonce wanted to endorse a versatile fragrance; thus, creating True Star by Tommy Hilfiger. This Tommy Hilfiger fragrance has an average longevity compared to other perfume products available.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractAgriculture {{is a major}} {{driver of}} climate change, {{particularly}} when all indirect emission sources are accounted for. Mitigation options targeted on one process are often proposed, ignoring their secondary effects on the overall greenhouse gas balance. Integrative methodologies such as life cycle assessment (LCA) are often applied without adjusting emission factors to specific site characteristics. Here, we used LCA to calculate the global warming potential of 38 pairs of organic and conventional herbaceous cropping systems and products in Spain. Crop products included rainfed <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> pulses, <b>rice,</b> open-air vegetables, <b>and</b> greenhouse vegetables. We used data from farmer interviews and published conversion factors. Our {{results show that the}} emission balances were dominated by fossil fuel use rather than by direct field emissions. Organic management reduced crop emissions by 36 – 65  %, with the exception of rice showing an increase of 8  % due to methane generation. Product-based emissions of organic crops were also lower by 30  % on average, except for rice...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{projections}} for China's food demand, and the projection results {{differ significantly from}} each other. Different values for income elasticities could be a major reason. This study projects meat <b>and</b> <b>cereals</b> demand for China based on a meta-analysis of the income elasticity estimates using a collection of 143 and 240 income elasticity estimates for <b>cereals</b> <b>and</b> meat products, respectively, from 36 primary studies. We find that income elasticities for most <b>cereals</b> (general <b>cereals,</b> <b>rice,</b> <b>and</b> coarse grains) and all meat products (general meat, pork, poultry, beef & mutton) tend to decline as per capita income increases, except for wheat, which increases. Taking this into account, differences between consumption projections based on time-varying income elasticities and values based on constant elasticities are substantial in quantities and increase over time...|$|R
