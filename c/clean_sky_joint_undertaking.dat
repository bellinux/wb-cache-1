40|$|The {{expected}} {{growth in}} air traffic {{combined with an}} increased public concern for the environment, have forced legislators to rethink the current air traffic system design. The current air traffic system operates at its capacity limits {{and is expected to}} lead to increased delays if traffic levels grow even further. Both in the United States and Europe, research projects have been initiated to develop the future Air Transportation System (ATS) to address capacity, and environmental, safety and economic issues. To address the environmental issues during descent and approach, a novel Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) concept, named Time and Energy Managed Operations (TEMO), has been developed co-sponsored by the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking.</b> It uses energy principles to reduce fuel burn, gaseous emissions and noise nuisance whilst maintaining runway capacity. Different from other CDO concepts, TEMO optimizes the descent by using energy management to achieve a continuous engine-idle descent, while satisfying time constraints on both the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) and the runway threshold. As such, TEMO uses timemetering at two control points to facilitate flow management and arrival spacing. TEMO is in line with SESAR step 2 capabilities, since it proposes 4 D trajectory management and is aimed at providing significant environmental benefits in the arrival phase without negatively affecting throughput, even in high density and peak-hour operations. In particular, TEMO addresses SESAR operational improvement (OI) TS- 103 : Controlled Time of Arrival (CTA) through use of datalink [1]. TEMO has been validated starting from initial performance batch studies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3, up to Human-in-the-Loop studies in realistic environments using a moving base flight simulator at TRL 5 ([2]-[6]). In this paper the definition, preparation, performance and analysis of a flight test experiment is described with the objective to demonstrate the ability of the TEMO algorithm to provide accurate and safe aircraft guidance toward the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), and further down to the Stabilization Point (1000 ft AGL), to demonstrate the ability of the TEMO algorithm to meet absolute time requirements at IAF and/or runway threshold and to evaluate the performance of the system under test (e. g. fuel usage).

The reference device is a regional aircraft single slotted flap, enhanced with deforming capabilities to obtain improved hyper-lift performance. The design {{started with the}} identification of the internal architecture, intended to allow camber variations. A concentrated-hinge architecture was selected, for its ability to fit different curvatures and for the possibility of easily realizing an “armadillo-like” configuration, then avoiding the use of a complicate deformable skin. The flap layout is made of segmented ribs, elastically hinged each other and span-wise connected by conventional spars. Relative rotations of the rib elements are forced by SMA structural actuators, i. e., cooperating in the external loads absorption. Super-elastic SMA are used to make up recovery elastic elements, necessary to regain the original shape after activation. These further elements in turn contribute to the overall flap rigidity. After assessing the hinge number {{and the size of the}} SMA active and passive elements, the advanced design phase was dealt with.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} collaborative research effort {{between members of}} the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>Joint</b> Technology Initiative (JTI), within the broader area of novel rotorcraft engine technology and rotorcraft operations. The <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> JTI was created as a public/private partnership between the European Commission and the aeronautical industry. The paper assesses the impact of innovative engine technologies to {{be integrated into the}} next generation of rotorcraft and evaluates their potential towards meeting the ACARE 2020 goals. The focus is on the lower segment of the light helicopter class with a particular interest in the performance of two innovative powerplants: an advanced turboshaft with Lean Premixed Prevaporised (LPP) combustor design and a supercharged diesel cycle engine. In order to evaluate their benefits alongside other <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> technologies, a multi-disciplinary rotorcraft performance analysis framework (PhoeniX) is employed. Two variants of the same light helicopter platform with year 2020 technology plus <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> innovations are modelled, named hereafter as Single Engine Light (SEL) Y 2020 and High Compression Engine (HCE) Y 2020, respectively. A turboshaft engine-powered helicopter, representative of year 2000 technology (SEL Y 2000) is also modelled and used as reference. Payload-Range diagrams (PR) of the three vehicles were generated. The HCE Y 2020 reached a maximum range 83 % greater than the SEL counterparts. The gaseous emissions of the helicopters were also evaluated over three notional scenarios representative of light helicopter activities. The HCE Y 2020 emitted 60 % less carbon dioxide (CO 2) and 63 % less nitrogen oxides (NOx) than the SEL Y 2000. The SEL Y 2020 emitted on average 19 % and 49 % less CO 2 and NOx, respectively, compared with the SEL Y 2000. It was also observed that the NOx production rate of the LPP technology integrated in the SEL Y 2020 combustor depends strongly on engine power setting. At certain power settings, the SEL Y 2020 emitted less NOx than the HCE Y 2020 even though the HCE Y 2020 emitted less NOx over the complete mission.

40|$|Following a {{comparative}} study on shape morphing and adaptive systems to improve rotorcraft efficiency, the Green Rotorcraft consortium has selected the Gurney flap technology as demonstrator of a smart adaptive rotorblade within the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>Joint</b> Technology Initiative [1]. The aim {{of such a}} system is to actively increase helicopter overall performance by improving lift and alleviating static and dynamic stall on the retreating side of the helicopter [2, 3]. The Gurney flap technology will be subjected to various tests, prior to manufacturing a full-scale demonstrator. Along with wind tunnel and whirl tower tests on full blade sections, a reduced-scale blade is required to be tested on a rotary support in a wind tunnel. The aim {{is to have a}} fully operational mechanism in a 1 / 8 th-scale blade. A specific system needs to be designed for this smaller model blade. The specifications for the model blade mechanism are more challenging compared to the full model blade. The blade tip speed must remain the same between the two blades. Therefore, the model blade rotation speed and centrifugal loads greatly increase. Piezoelectric patch actuators combined with flexible beams are chosen to design a fast and robust mechanism, which would fit inside the model blade and support the large centrifugal loads. A mechanism is modeled using Finite Element Analysis tools and its geometry is optimised using a surrogate optimisation to maximise displacement and force. The optimised geometry has a Z-shape profile and maximise displacement and force. The force generated is sufficient to counter directly the force of the airflow on the flap. However, the displacement and the mechanical work are not large enough to deploy directly the Gurney flap as a conventional flap. The deployment time remains insufficient as well. Building on these results, refined geometries are under investigation using the same optimisation process...|$|R
40|$|Local {{air quality}} {{is one of}} several issues {{constraining}} the development of air- ports. Ongoing research shows that takeoff contributes considerably to the level of near airport pollution. Installation of a wind-brake system behind the runway threshold has been recently proposed as a way to accelerate natural lift-off of the exhaust plumes. This thesis aims to validate large eddy simulations (LES) for the numerical investigation of this problem, and contribute to a joint effort towards the installation of baffles in major airports. Ways to limit the enormous cost of such simulations are suggested, and methods to reduce the problem complexity are established by means of parametric analyses and staged cross-validations. In particular, wall-jet simulations are performed alongside wind-tunnel experiments. Results reveal that LES accurately predicts the baffle induced drag force, as well as scalar dispersion. One source of weakness in this study is the level of accu- racy of the numerical representation of the wind tunnel boundary layer. Lift-off of the plume was not observed within the investigated range (380 nozzle diam- eters), neither in the absence of baffles, nor {{in the presence of the}} basic baffle arrangement. Certain geometrical modifications, however, have shifted the onset of lift-off upstream enough, so that it is identified by the streamwise evolution of mean flow characteristics. An additional achievement of this work was to devise and validate a dynamic response algebraic model for the representation of the baffles in the flow. The established numerical approach, together with the baf- fle representation model is promising for the numerical investigation of the real scale situation at longer distances, up to 2000 nozzle diameters.

To support this the <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>Joint</b> Technology Initiative (JTI) is developing and improving breakthrough technologies, that will be demonstrated on a flying prototype. The <b>Clean</b> <b>Sky</b> JTI is split up into six technology domains; {{one of these is}} the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA). This domain aims to develop and test a new wing design that makes use of passive and active flow and load control technologies. Department of Systems Engineering and Aircraft Design (SEAD) at Delft University of Technology has been asked to develop a simulation framework to support the internal systems design on the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft. During this thesis work a parametric model and framework has been created for two flow control technologies and their pneumatic supply system. The model is based on Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques, which aim to increase the productivity of engineers and allow more detailed and fair concepts trade-offs. The two selected ‘smart technologies’ are Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) and Fluidic Actuated Flow Control (FAFC). The first extends laminar flow using a combination of Natural Laminar Flow and Boundary Layer Suction. The second delays separation, stalling and buffeting by reenergising the boundary layer using pulsating or synthetic jets. The parametric model creates a 3 D representation of various internal system concepts, which is used to evaluate the Internal Aerodynamics, External Aerodynamics (HLFC only), weight and cost. The internal aerodynamic analysis uses handbook relations and has been incorporated into the KBE environment. It has been validated for conceptual design with limited success. External aerodynamics is performed with a link to Xfoil-suc. The cost and weight are currently based on component and (sheet-) material price and weight. The product model created in this thesis work can evaluate multiple concepts of the internal system for both ‘smart technologies’ and thereby allow a more detailed and fair trade-off. Due to the lack of available input specifications, e. g. aircraft-type and external aerodynamic data, a trade-off between the concepts could unfortunately not yet be made.

40|$|With the {{application}} of appropriate surface structuring on aircrafts, up to 8 % fuel may be saved in regular air traffic. Before these techniques can be introduced into productive environments, a controlling method {{for the quality of}} surface structuring is needed to be used during fabrication and service, ensuring persistent quality of the structured coatings and a justified decision for surface renewal. In this project, these important requirements for achieving the improvements defined above are fulfilled. We have shown that fast sampling is possible using noncontacting laser probing, and we have presented a working preliminary configuration for the sensor. In the theoretical part, a model for the interaction between a probing laser beam and the surface is developed and the resulting wavefront is derived. This is done using a combination of Huygens-Fresnel diffraction theory and geometrical optics. The model is then used to counsel the design of the experimental setup, to interpret the emerging data and to develop characteristic quantities for the sample, their derivation from the data and their SNR ratio. In the experimental part, the interaction of laser light with the structured riblet surface is studied. For this purpose an optical setup was installed to perform measurements of undegraded and degraded surfaces depending on a variety of experimental parameter. The results of these measurements are constantly compared and checked with the theoretical calculations. It allows for very sensitive measurements of even slight degradations of the surfaces. Here, it is regardless if the damage to the riblets is symmetrical or asymmetrical due to mechanical loss of material or if it is deriving from changes of reflectivity due to chemical processes of the riblet material itself.

Many optimization techniques exist and are being studied for this purpose. The <b>CLEAN</b> <b>SKY</b> <b>Joint</b> Technology Initiative for aeronautics and Air transport, a European research activity run under the Seventh Framework program, is a collaborative initiative involving industry, research organizations and academia to introduce novel technologies to improve the environmental impact of aviation. As part of the overall research activities, "green" aircraft trajectories are addressed in the Systems for Green Operations (SGO) Integrated Technology Demonstrator. This paper studies the impact of large commercial aircraft trajectories optimized for different objectives applied to the on board systems. It establishes integrated systems models for both conventional and more electric secondary power systems and studies the impact of fuel, noise, time and emissions optimized trajectories on each configuration. It shows the significant change in the fuel burn due to systems operation and builds up the case as to why a detailed aircraft systems model is required within the optimization loop. Typically, the objective in trajectory optimization is to improve the mission performance of an aircraft or reduce the environmental impact. Hence parameters such as time, fuel burn, emissions and noise are key optimization objectives. In most instances, trajectory optimization is achieved by using models that represent such parameters. For example aircraft dynamics models to describe the flight performance, engine models to calculate the fuel burn, emissions and noise impact, etc. Such techniques have proved to achieve the necessary level of accuracy in trajectory optimization. This research enhances previous techniques by adding in the effect of systems power in the optimization process. A comparison is also made between conventional power systems and more electric architectures. In the conventional architecture, the environmental control system and the ice protection system are powered by engine bleed air while actuators and electrics are powered by engine shaft power off-takes.
