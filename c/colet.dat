5|$|The new {{learning}} of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies, and John <b>Colet,</b> the noted biblical scholar.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, Proba and {{her work}} were praised as {{examples}} of scholarship. Petrarch implicitly referenced De laudibus Christi in a letter discussing female geniuses, and in 1374 Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled De mulieribus claris. In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer Michael Wenssler, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by a printing press. During the Renaissance, Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi was printed many times (for instance, Italian scholar Filippo Ermini lists seven incunabula and fourteen 16th-century editions of the poem), and Proba's poem was openly admired by thinkers like John <b>Colet</b> and Maffeo Vegio.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John <b>Colet,</b> Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the plan}} {{develops}} a hitch when François Filiba (Edward Everett Horton), one of <b>Colet's</b> suitors, sees Monescu at a garden party. He {{is unable to}} remember where he knows him from, but when another of <b>Colet's</b> suitors, The Major (Charles Ruggles), tells Filiba that he once mistook Monescu for a doctor, Filiba suddenly remembers that he knows Monescu from Venice, where the thief robbed him, {{pretending to be a}} doctor. Monescu and Lily plan an immediate getaway that night, after they take {{all the money in the}} safe.|$|R
50|$|Erasmus’s Sileni Alcibiadis {{is one of}} {{his most}} direct {{assessments}} of the need for Church reform. Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the Adagia in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517. This essay has been likened to John <b>Colet’s</b> Convocation Sermon, though the styles differ.|$|R
25|$|The celebrated grammarian William Lilye was {{the first}} master, and the company of mercers were (in 1510) {{appointed}} trustees, the first example of non-clerical management in education. Some held <b>Colet's</b> religious opinions to be heretical, but William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to prosecute him. King Henry VIII also held him in high esteem despite his sermons against the French wars.|$|R
25|$|<b>Colet</b> {{has been}} studied {{frequently}} over time and has experienced resurgences in popularity. Bishop Kennett studied <b>Colet</b> during {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Kennett passed his notes to Samuel Knight who used them to write a biography of <b>Colet</b> which was published in 1724. During the nineteenth century, interest in <b>Colet</b> increased. Several editions of his works and an additional biography were published during that time. Scholars believed <b>Colet</b> strongly impacted Erasmus and the English Reformation. Later critics went on view <b>Colet</b> as Protestant-like, though historical revisionists believe that <b>Colet</b> was a reform preacher that wanted {{to improve the quality of}} the Church.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus said of <b>Colet,</b> “When I {{listen to}} <b>Colet</b> {{it seems to}} me that I am {{listening}} to Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed <b>Colet</b> to show that one could be highly critical of the Church while still a loyal priest. His depiction of <b>Colet</b> was partly a depiction of himself.|$|E
25|$|The John <b>Colet</b> School in Wendover, Buckinghamshire {{is named}} after him, as well as <b>Colet</b> Gardens, a road in the London suburb of Hammersmith, W6, and John <b>Colet</b> School in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Berthelet printed many Humanist texts {{important}} to his age. Among {{them are the}} English Bible of Richard Taverner; the original works and translations of Sir Thomas Elyot; Thomas Lupset's Counsels of Saint Isidore of Seville, his Treatise of Charity, his Sermon of St Chrysostom, his Exhortation to Young Men, his Treatise on the Art of Dying well, and his edition of Dr <b>Colet's</b> sermon delivered at the convocation at St Paul's; Sir Thomas Chaloner's translation of The Praise of Folly by Erasmus, and several other works of Erasmus translated by Thomas Paynell.|$|R
60|$|Sooth to say, Ambrose was {{relieved}} by his rejection. If he {{were not to}} obtain admission in any capacity to St. Paul's School, he felt more drawn to Tibble's friend the printer; for the self-seeking luxurious habits into which {{so many of the}} beneficed clergy had fallen were repulsive to him, and his whole soul thirsted after that new revelation, as it were, which <b>Colet's</b> sermon had made to him. Yet the word heresy was terrible and confusing, and a doubt came over him whether he might not be forsaking the right path, and be lured aside by false lights.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a younger}} son {{excluded}} from his patrimony by primogeniture, {{he was expected}} to make his own fortune and left Clopton for the City of London at an early age, where he was apprenticed in 1457 to the mercer John Roo, and was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1464. He served as Warden of the Company three times, in 1479, 1484 and 1488. On 15 October 1485 he was chosen as Alderman for Dowgate ward. In 1486 he was elected Sheriff of London during Sir Henry <b>Colet's</b> term as mayor, and was himself chosen Lord Mayor of London in 1491. By 1495 he was living in Bread Street. Although some biographers have stated that he was knighted, this {{does not appear to have}} been the case as he described himself in his will merely as [...] "citizen, mercer and alderman".|$|R
25|$|<b>Colet</b> was an English scholar, Renaissance humanist, theologian, {{member of}} the Worshipful Company of Mercers, and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, London. <b>Colet</b> wanted people to see the scripture as their guide through life. Furthermore, he wanted to restore {{theology}} and rejuvenate Christianity. <b>Colet</b> is an important early leader of Christian humanism as he linked humanism and reform. John <b>Colet</b> {{was a friend of}} Erasmus, a key figure in Christian humanism.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, <b>Colet</b> concludes {{by stating that}} his presence {{is due to the}} need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, <b>Colet</b> criticises the living style of the priests. <b>Colet</b> explains that the priests should set an example for others as be a beacon of light, because if they are instead figures of darkness, the Church will be engulfed by darkness. <b>Colet</b> cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.|$|E
25|$|To this day, Colet's {{achievement}} is celebrated by St Paul's School, St Paul's Girls' School and St Paul's Juniors (formerly known as <b>Colet</b> Court) on John <b>Colet</b> Day at St Paul's Cathedral (having begun in 2003).|$|E
60|$|Ambrose's {{mind was}} made up on one point. Whatever he did, and {{wherever}} he went, he felt the doctrine he had just heard as needful to him as vital air, and he must be within reach of it. This, and not the hermit's cell, was what his instinct craved. He {{had always been a}} studious, scholarly boy, supposed to be marked out for a clerical life, because a book was more to him than a bow, and he had been easily trained in good habits and practices of devotion; but all in a childish manner, without going beyond simple receptiveness, until the experiences of the last week had made a man of him, or more truly, the Pardon chapel and Dean <b>Colet's</b> sermon had made him a new being, with the realities of the inner life opened before him.|$|R
6000|$|Richard saw Goatley and set him {{to prepare}} the Mastiff for an {{immediate}} voyage. Her crew, somewhat {{like those of a}} few modern yachts, were permanently attached to her, and lived in the neighbourhood of the wharf, so that, under the personal superintendence of one who was as much loved and looked up to as Captain Talbot, all was soon in a state of forwardness, and Gillingham made himself very useful. When darkness put a stop to the work and supper was being made ready, Richard found time to explain matters to Mr. Heatherthwayte, for his honourable mind would not permit him to ask his host unawares to perform an office that might possibly be construed as treasonable. In spite of the preparation which he had already received through <b>Colet's</b> communications, the minister's wonder was extreme. [...] "Daughter to the Queen of Scots, say you, sir! [...] Yonder modest, shamefast maiden, of such seemly carriage and gentle speech?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Master Heatherthwayte bade {{them good}} speed, and Master Langston {{stood at the}} door of his office and waved them a farewell, both alike {{unconscious}} of the rejoicing with which they were left behind. Mistress Talbot rode on the palfrey sent for her use, with the little stranger slung to her neck for security's sake. Her boy rode [...] "a cock-horse" [...] before his father, but a resting-place was provided for him on a sort of pannier on one of the sumpter beasts. What these animals could not carry of the household stuff was left in <b>Colet's</b> charge to be despatched by carriers; and the travellers jogged slowly on through deep Yorkshire lanes, often halting to refresh the horses and supply the wants of the little children at homely wayside inns, their entrance usually garnished with an archway formed of the jawbones of whales, which often served for gate-posts in that eastern part of Yorkshire. And thus they journeyed, with frequent halts, until they came to the Derbyshire borders.|$|R
25|$|In addition, <b>Colet</b> gave {{a notable}} sermon before the royal court on Good Friday, 1513. He gave this {{speech in the}} wake of {{political}} tension; specifically, an English push for war against France. In his speech, <b>Colet</b> condemned war and prompted Christians to fight only for Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|John <b>Colet</b> (January 1467 – 16 September 1519) was an English churchman and {{educational}} pioneer.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{stated that}} <b>Colet</b> {{was a man}} for the ages and a true Christian.|$|E
25|$|In his writings, <b>Colet</b> {{refers to}} Italian humanists and Platonists Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Colet</b> {{is not as}} {{well known}} a Christian humanist as Erasmus, his {{writings}} are reflective of Christian humanism. He studied Cicero, Augustine, Jerome, John Chrysostom, Ignatius of Antioch, Lactantius and Polycarp.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colet</b> {{believes}} {{several things}} are important: a good, pure, and holy life, approved morals, moderate {{knowledge of the}} Scriptures, knowledge of the Sacraments, the fear of God and love of the heavenly life.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. <b>Colet</b> calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests forget that they should be interested in the good they can do more than the amount of riches that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. <b>Colet</b> states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E
25|$|First, {{in regard}} to pride of life, <b>Colet</b> {{believes}} that priests of the day were more consumed by the honour and dignity one could receive by {{being a part of}} the priesthood. Service to the Church must be only humble service.|$|E
25|$|Around 1508, having {{inherited}} his father's wealth, <b>Colet</b> formed {{his plan}} for the re-foundation of St Paul's School, which he completed in 1512, and endowed with estates of an annual value of £122 and upwards. The school, dedicated to the Child Jesus, was in place to give young boys a Christian education.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's School {{originally}} {{takes its}} name from St Paul's Cathedral in London. A cathedral school had existed since around 1103. By the 16th century however, it had declined, and in 1509, a new school was founded by John <b>Colet,</b> Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, on a plot of land {{to the north of the}} Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Finally, <b>Colet</b> urges {{people to}} “return to the God {{of love and}} peace; return to Christ, in whom is the true peace of the Spirit which passeth all understanding; return to the true priestly life”. “Be ye {{reformed}} in the newness of your minds, that ye may know those things which are of God; and the peace of God shall be with you”.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest son}} of Sir Henry <b>Colet</b> (Lord Mayor of London 1486 and 1495), {{he was born}} in London in January 1467, and was educated at St Anthony's school and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took his M.A. in 1490. He was already nonresident rector of Dennington, Suffolk, and vicar of St Dunstan's, Stepney, and now became rector of Thurning, Hunts. In 1493 he went to Paris and then to Italy, {{studying}} canon and civil law, patristics and Greek.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} abroad he became acquainted with Budaeus (Guillaume Budé) and Erasmus, {{and with the}} {{teaching}} of Savonarola. On his return to England in 1496 he took orders and settled at Oxford, where he lectured on the epistles of Saint Paul, replacing the old scholastic method of interpretation with one more {{in harmony with the}} new learning. Due to their influences, when he arrived back in England, he returned more than just a humanist; he returned a Christian reformer. His methods did much to influence Erasmus, who visited Oxford in 1498, and who later received an annuity from <b>Colet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{filming of}} each episode {{normally}} took ten working days, shooting {{about five minutes}} of edited screen time per day. Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to 10, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in <b>Colet</b> Court, there was a standing set of the Flying Squad offices, which provided an alternative option should the weather restrict a day's filming. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling 10 minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter months so, exterior night shooting was expensive and was limited to three minutes of external night material in any episode.|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{has also}} {{produced}} at least 12 saints, and 20 Archbishops of Canterbury, {{the most recent}} Archbishop being Rowan Williams, who studied at Wadham College and was later a Canon Professor at Christ Church. Duns Scotus' teaching is commemorated with a monument in the University Church of St. Mary. Religious reformer John Wycliffe was an Oxford scholar, for a time Master of Balliol College. John <b>Colet,</b> Christian humanist, Dean of St Paul's, and friend of Erasmus, studied at Magdalen College. Several of the Caroline Divines e.g. in particular William Laud as President of St. John's and [...] Chancellor of the University, and the Non-Jurors, e.g. Thomas Ken had close Oxford connections.The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, studied at Christ Church and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College. The Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was {{closely associated with the}} Oriel Fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baha'i faith and Joseph Cordeiro, the only Pakistani Catholic cardinal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Colet</b> {{had many}} {{distinguished}} sermons. One {{is the beginning}} of the Convocation of the clergy of Canterbury province at the London Cathedral on 6 February 1512. Archbishop Warham of Canterbury invited <b>Colet</b> to make the speech. Colet's speech is both direct and insightful. It represents his work, or as <b>Colet</b> said himself, he is [...] "speaking out of zeal, a man sorrowing for the ruin of the Church". Furthermore, <b>Colet</b> stated that he came [...] "…here today, fathers, to admonish you with all your minds to deliberate, in this your Council, concerning the reformation of the Church".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his sermons Colet's works include some scriptural commentary and works entitled Daily Devotions and Monition to a Godly Life. [...] Together with Lilye, Erasmus, and Wolsey, <b>Colet</b> produced materials forming {{the basis of the}} authorised Latin Grammar, used for centuries in the English schools. [...] A number of letters from <b>Colet</b> to Erasmus also survive.|$|E
