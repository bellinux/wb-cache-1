5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering.</b> This collision {{results in a}} transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E
5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, {{and with the}} measurement of <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Einstein's 1905 {{predictions}} were verified experimentally {{in several}} ways {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan's Nobel lecture. However, before Compton's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering,</b> where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E

To date, effective and efficient {{modeling of}} 3 D <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> in parallel-beam SPECT has been made possible by Frey and Tsui [1], Zeng et al [2], and Bai et al [3].

40|$|<b>Compton</b> <b>scattered</b> x-rays can be {{generated}} using a configuration consisting of a single, ultra-intense laser pulse, and a shaped gas target. The gas target incorporates a hydrodynamically formed density spike, which nonlinearly scatters the incident pump radiation, to produce a counter-propagating electromagnetic wiggler. This self-generated wiggler field <b>Compton</b> <b>scatters</b> from electrons accelerated in the laser wakefield of the pump radiation. The nonlinear scattering mechanism in the density spike is examined theoretically and numerically in order to optimize the <b>Compton</b> <b>scattered</b> radiation. It is found that narrow-band x-rays are produced by moderate intensity pump radiation incident on the quarter-critical surface of the density spike, while high fluence, broadband x-rays are produced by high intensity pump radiation reflected near the critical surface...|$|R

He remained there for the remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering,</b> an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration of the cosmos through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering</b> by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light {{was composed of}} photons, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and John C. Slater, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation {{on the basis of}} the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.|$|E

25|$|X-rays {{interact}} with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering,</b> and Rayleigh scattering.

40|$|Reconstruction of cone-beam {{projections}} from <b>Compton</b> <b>scattered</b> data The {{problem of}} reconstructing a 3 D source distribution from <b>Compton</b> <b>scattered</b> {{data can be}} separated into two tasks. First, the angular distribution of line projections at different observation points within the detector volume are reconstructed. Then, reconstruction techniques are applied to the resulting cone-beam projections to synthesize the 3 D source distribution. This paper describes an analytic solution for the first, yet unsolved, task. Building on the convolution theorem in spherical coordinates, a back-projection and inverse filtering technique in terms of spherical harmonics is formulated. The rotation invariance of the point response of the back-projection in spherical coordinates is proved; and the corresponding inverse filter function is derived. The resulting filtered back-projection algorithm then consists of a summation over all detected events of fixed and known event response functions. Measurement errors, which for <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> detectors are typically different for each detected event, can easily be accounted for in the proposed algorithm. The computational cost of the algorithm is O(NT 2), where N {{is the number of}} detected events and =T is the desired angular resolution. I...|$|R
40|$|In SPECT imaging of the chest, {{nonuniform}} attenuation correction requires use of {{a patient}} specific attenuation (p) map. Such a map {{can be obtained by}} estimating the regions of 1) the lungs and 2) the soft tissues and bones, and then assigning an appropriate value of attenuation coefficient (p) to each region. We proposed a method to segment such regions from the <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> and photopeak window SPECT slices of Tc- 99 m Sestamibi studies. The <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> slices are used to segment the body outline and to estimate the regions of the lungs. Locations of the back bone and sternum are estimated from the photopeak window slices to assist in the segmentation. To investigate the accuracy of using <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> slices in estimating the regions of the body and the lungs, a Monte-Carlo SPECT simulation of an anthropomorphic phantom with an activity distribution and noise characteristics similar to patient data was conducted. Energy windows of various widths were simulated for use in locating a suitable <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> window for imaging. The effects of attenuation correction using a p map based on segmentation were also studied. The results demonstrated for the activity and p maps studied herein that: 1) reasonable contrast could be obtained from <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> data for the segmentation of the lung regions, 2) true positive rates of 99 % and 89 % for determining the body and lung regions, respectively, with total error rates of 4 % and 29 %, could be achieved, 3) usage of a p map based on segmentation for attenuation correction improved relative quantification over filtered backprojection, 4) variations in the assigned p value of 40 % smaller or 40 % larger in the lung regions had an insignificant impact on the results of relative quantification, 5) a wide energy window away from the photopeak window for recording scattered events could benefit both the segmentation of the lung regions and the attenuation correction of the activity in the myocardium region, and 6) usage of a smaller than true p value in the lung regions of an assigned p map might benefit attenuation correction for absolute quantification...|$|R
25|$|<b>Compton</b> <b>scattering</b> is the {{predominant}} interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging. <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering</b> is an inelastic scattering of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part {{of the energy}} of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the Klein–Nishina formula. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the conservation of energy and momentum.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the utility of}} fusing energy-resolved observations of <b>Compton</b> <b>scattered</b> photons with traditional attenuation data for the joint recovery of mass density and photoelectric absorption {{in the context of}} limited view tomographic imaging applications. We begin with the development of a physical and associated numerical model for the <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> process. Using this model, we propose a variational approach recovering these two material properties. In addition to the typical data-fidelity terms, the optimization functional includes regularization for both the mass density and photoelectric coefficients. We consider a novel edge-preserving method in the case of mass density. To aid in the recovery of the photoelectric information, we draw on our recent method in r 15 and employ a non-local regularization scheme that builds on the fact that mass density is more stably imaged. Simulation results demonstrate clear advantages {{associated with the use of}} both scattered photon data and energy resolved information in mapping the two material properties of interest. Specifically, comparing images obtained using only conventional attenuation data with those where we employ only <b>Compton</b> <b>scatter</b> photons and images formed from the combination of the two, shows that taking advantage of both types of data for reconstruction provides far more accurate results...|$|R

25|$|The {{probability}} of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is {{the energy of the}} incident photon. This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where <b>Compton</b> <b>scattering</b> takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher.
