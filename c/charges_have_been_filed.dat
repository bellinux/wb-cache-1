5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

25|$|Both Lester and Foster {{were arrested}} at the {{residence}} and {{were charged with}} aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. Upon search of the residence the officers found a few legally owned handguns and small amounts of marijuana. They alleged they had evidence of other illegal activities. Both men were jailed and held in lieu of 3 million dollar bonds. Other than the charges stemming from the club's unmasking of the undercover officer, however, no other <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed.</b>|$|E

25|$|John, Patsy and Burke {{have denied}} {{involvement}} {{in the death of}} JonBenét. No <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> in the case, as of September 2016. Several days prior to the airing of this mini-series, Burke Ramsey was interviewed on the Dr. Phil show in a three-episode series about the death of his sister. It was his first public interview. The Ramsey family lawyer, L. Lin Wood, has threatened to sue CBS for libel (defamation) based on its conclusion that JonBenét was killed by Burke.|$|E
25|$|Though initial {{protests that}} day against the ruling were peacefully organized, after dark there were {{incidents}} of looting, arson, destruction of property, and small riots. Nearly 80 people were eventually arrested. On July 9, 2010, the U.S. Justice Department opened {{a civil rights}} investigation against Mehserle. The federal government can prosecute independently for the same act under the separate sovereigns exception to double jeopardy. No <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> to date. On November 5, 2010, Mehserle was sentenced to two years, minus time served. He served {{his time in the}} Los Angeles County Jail protective custody, held in a private cell for his safety. On June 13, 2011, Mehserle was released under parole after serving 11 months.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the alleged}} acts fall outside the {{statutes}} of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil lawsuits are active against Cosby. Gloria Allred is representing 33 {{of the alleged}} victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex, involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic methaqualone (Quaaludes), {{with a series of}} young women, and acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal.|$|E
5000|$|Governor Rolph {{praised the}} action, stating that California {{had sent a}} message to future kidnappers, and promised to pardon anyone {{involved}} in the lynching. However, Rolph died on June 2, 1934, before any <b>charges</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> in the case.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994, the United States Congress {{passed the}} Violence Against Women Act, which {{contained}} a provision at [...] {{for a federal}} civil remedy to victims of gender-based violence, even if no criminal <b>charges</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against the alleged perpetrator of that violence.|$|R
25|$|McLaws {{remained}} {{bitter about}} his court-martial, {{especially as the}} <b>charges</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> by James Longstreet, his friend and classmate at West Point, {{with whom he had}} served for years. Although he defended Longstreet against Lost Cause proponents who blamed him for losing the war, McLaws never fully forgave Longstreet for his actions.|$|R
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{to build the}} pipeline was signed ten days before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, {{a few weeks before}} Schröder had stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover €1billion of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee expired at the end of 2006 without ever having been needed. Soon after leaving the post of Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder agreed to head the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG. This has been widely described by German and international media as a conflict of interest, the implication being that the pipeline project may have been pushed through for personal gain rather than for improving gas supplies to Germany. Information about the German government's guarantee was requested by the European Commission. No formal <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against any party despite years of exhaustive investigations.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2015, {{the city}} {{announced}} {{that there was}} a video of a fatal police shooting that took place on October 12, 2014. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's office investigated possible criminal charges against Officer George Hernandez (whose name was revealed on December 7), who shot Ronald Johnson III in the back during a foot chase. The officer opened fire seconds after arriving on the scene, when Johnson was moving away from police. Johnson was allegedly a known gang member and also allegedly armed; a gun was recovered at the scene. The attorney for Johnson's family contends police planted the weapon. The city fought to keep the video of the incident secret so as not to jeopardize the officer's right to a fair trial should he be indicted. As in the McDonald case, the video lacks audio. The city released the video on December 7 due to pressure for transparency prompted by the McDonald case. No <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against Hernandez.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not {{to react to the}} pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched. The practice is sometimes called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Some trainers use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present. Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years, soring is still practiced and criminal <b>charges</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>filed</b> against people who violate the Act. Enforcement of the HPA is difficult, due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police. As a result, while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs, by 2010, only three organizations remained certified as HIOs, all known to be actively working to end soring.|$|E
5000|$|Doctinal {{opposition}} against Smith first arose {{after his}} 1875 encyclopaedia article [...] "Bible" [...] which covered similar ground.
