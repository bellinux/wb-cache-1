40|$|An {{effective}} {{model of}} single and multilayered thin panels, including those formed using <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> (CFC) <b>materials,</b> is {{incorporated into the}} Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) method. The thin panel model is a one-dimensional (1 D) one based on analytical expansions of cotangent and cosecant functions {{that are used to}} describe the admittance matrix in the frequency domain; these are then converted into the time domain by using digital filter theory and an inverse Z transform. The model, which is extended to allow for material anisotropy, is executed within 1 D TLM codes. And, for the first time, the two-dimensional (2 D) thin surface model is embedded in unstructured three-dimensional (3 D) TLM codes. The approach is validated by using it to study some canonical structures with analytic solutions, and against results taken from the literature. It is then used to investigate shielding effectiveness of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> in a practical curved aerospace-related structure.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Civil engineering. The goal of this research is to examine the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a method of condition assessment for <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composites</b> are used in high performance situations such as overwrapping of composite over-wrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) in aerospace applications and hydrogen and natural-gas transportation systems. The composites will play a larger role in the future due to the materials high strength to mass ratio. There are currently limited nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies to evaluate these <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> in-situ. NDE technologies will be critical for analyzing environmentally caused degradation that can reduce strength and service life of the materials. Variations in elastic strain in the <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> can manifest from degradation or damage, and can be analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The characterization of active Raman bands and the strain sensitivity of these bands for commercially available <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers</b> are reported. Additionally carbon fiber/epoxy matrix strands and burst COPV samples are investigated. These results indicate that Raman spectroscopy has some ability to make strain measurements in commercially available <b>carbon</b> <b>fibers.</b> Such measurements have the potential {{to be used as a}} tool for NDE in inspections and reliability assessment of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{transportation}} engineering, {{and particularly}} in aerospace and automotive engineering, reducing the weight of structures has for decades {{been one of the}} primary concerns. A structure achieving the same mechanical properties, while being lighter than the currently used one, leads to a reduced fuel consumption, serving economics and environmental impact. Thanks to their low density and good mechanical properties, <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> are used more and more often in those industries, especially since they are getting more affordable and easier to manufacture. The present paper stands in this context, aiming at making use of the very high tensile strength of <b>carbon</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced polymers to design lightweight structures for the industries looking for weight reduction.|$|R
