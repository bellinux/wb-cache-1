5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head over his shoulders to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E
