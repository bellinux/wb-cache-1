40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} finding minimum <b>guard</b> <b>covers</b> is NP-hard for simple polygons and open for simple {{orthogonal}} polygons. Alternative definitions of visibility {{have been considered}} for orthogonal polygons. In this paper we try to determine the complexity of finding <b>guard</b> <b>covers</b> in orthogonal polygons by considering periscope visibility. Under periscope visibility, two points in an orthogonal polygon are visible {{if there is an}} orthogonal path with at most one bend that connects them without intersecting the exterior of the polygon. We show that finding minimum periscope guard (as well as k-periscope and s-guard) covers is NP-hard for 3 -d grids. We present an O(n 3) algorithm for finding minimum periscope <b>guard</b> <b>covers</b> for simple grids and discuss how to extend the algorithm to obtain minimum k-periscope <b>guard</b> <b>covers.</b> We show that this algorithm can be applied to obtain minimum periscope <b>guard</b> <b>covers</b> for a class of simple orthogonal polygon in O(n 3) ...|$|R
40|$|For a {{polygonal}} region P with n vertices, a <b>guard</b> <b>cover</b> G {{is a set}} {{of points}} in P, such that any point in P can be seen from a point in G.

The Chromatic Art Gallery Problem (CAGP) asks for the minimum number of colors for which a colored <b>guard</b> <b>cover</b> exists. We provide first complexity results for the general CAGP, in which arbitrary guard positions are allowed. We show that it is already NP-hard to decide whether two colors suffice for covering a polygon with holes, as well as for any fixed number k ≥ 2 of colors. For simple polygons, we show that computing the minimum number of colors is NP-hard for Θ(n) colors. ...|$|R

In a colored <b>guard</b> <b>cover,</b> every element in a <b>guard</b> <b>cover</b> is assigned a color, such that no two guards with the same color have overlapping visibility regions. The Chromatic Art Gallery Prob-lem (CAGP) asks for the minimum number of colors for which a colored <b>guard</b> <b>cover</b> exists. We discuss the CAGP for the case of only two colors. We show that it is already NP-hard to decide whether two colors suffice for covering a polygon with holes, even when arbitrary guard positions are allowed. For sim-ple polygons with a discrete set of possible guard loca-tions, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a two-colorable guard set exists. This algo-rithm can be extended to optimize various additional objective functions for two-colorable guard sets, in par-ticular minimizing the guard number, minimizing the maximum area of a visibility region, and minimizing or maximizing the overlap between visibility regions. We also show results for a larger number of colors: comput-ing the minimum number of colors in simple polygons with arbitrary guard positions is NP-hard for Θ(n) col-ors, but allows an O(log(OPT)) approximation for the number of colors. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this talk}} (draft paper) we develop {{the theory of}} {{structural}} decompositions for the CSP. We begin with the very general notion of a guarded decomposition and make several simplifying assumptions to arrive a the definition of an acyclic <b>guarded</b> <b>cover.</b> We show how many existing decompositions can seen as acyclic <b>guarded</b> <b>covers.</b> We develop a generic algorithm for discovering acyclic <b>guarded</b> <b>covers</b> under the further assumption {{that they have a}} join tree satisfying a simple extra condition. We show that many existing decompositions do in fact satisfy this extra condition. Using this theory we are able to describe a new class of structural decompostion which we call spread cuts. These generalise many existing decomposition methods. We present a class of hypergraphs whose spread cut width is significantly smaller than their hypertree width. The definition of a guarded decomposition and the algorithm for discovering them were motvated by the similar algorithms developed by Gottlob, Scarcello and Leone in their work on hypertrees. The authors also wish to acknowledge that an acyclic guarded decomposition is very similar to a generalised hypertree decomposition as described in the hypertree literature...|$|R

Upper bounds are provided by showing that the proposed algorithm is optimal for all of them...|$|R
