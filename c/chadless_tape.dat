50|$|The bulletins {{and look}} angles were {{initially}} typed by hand by airmen in the communications office and sent by teletypewriter {{to all the}} participating sensors. The teletypewriter machines used punched paper tape, before the invention of <b>chadless</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the tape punch was a device called a Chadless Printing Reperforator. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on {{it at the same}} time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no chad would be produced; the [...] "hole" [...] was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, of course, there was no [...] "chad box" [...] to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that <b>chadless</b> <b>tape,</b> once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read <b>chadless</b> <b>tape</b> by optical means employed by later high-speed readers. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with <b>chadless</b> <b>tape,</b> because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.|$|E
5000|$|The plural chads is attested {{from about}} 1939, along with chadless, meaning [...] "without loose chad". Clear {{definitions}} for both terms are offered by Walter Bacon in a patent application filed in 1940 assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories: [...] "... In making these perforations, the perforator cuts small round pieces of paper, {{known in the}} art as chads, out of the tape. These chads are objectionable ... <b>Chadless</b> <b>tape</b> is prepared by feeding blank tape through a device which will not punch a complete circle in the tape but, instead, will only cut approximately three-quarters of the circumference of a circle ... thereby leaving a movable, or hinged, lid of paper in the tape." ...|$|E
50|$|The CX readers {{operate at}} 107 {{characters}} per second, with two fixed-level versions for reading either 6-level or 8-level fully punched or <b>chadless</b> paper <b>tape,</b> and an adjustable-level version for reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape. All CX version readers were packaged for table-top use {{and have a}} parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the reader tape sensing contacts.|$|R
50|$|The DX {{paper tape}} readers operate at any speed up to 360 {{characters}} per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA tape readers operate at 120 {{characters per second}} if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX paper tape readers are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or <b>chadless</b> paper <b>tape.</b> The DX series of paper tape readers were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R
