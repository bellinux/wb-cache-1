500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, and he sat on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948. [...] "But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and <b>college.</b> <b>I</b> think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year." ...|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in <b>college,</b> <b>I</b> had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E

There, Bourguiba found, with great pleasure, his old Sadiki friend, Tahar Sfar, who studied in another classe de première. Two or three weeks later, he was summoned by Tahar Zouiten who announced the decision to downgrade him to classe de seconde. Bourguiba stated years later: [...] "Despite the chagrin caused by this downgrade, I executed the decision. But three months later, I visited Mr. Zouiten to tell him how much I was thankful to his initiative which helped me learn new disciplines I did not master in Sadiki <b>College.</b> <b>I</b> had just discovered Mathematics. I did not learn algebra or geometry in Sadiki where we were spending our mathematics classes laughing and having fun".|$|E

[...] He later wrote, [...] "Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even before I left <b>college</b> <b>I</b> had an idea that I might be a doctor some day."

2500|$|In 1917, it {{was decided}} to re-establish the liberal arts college, and on June 14, 1918, the Eastern Nazarene College was {{chartered}} with degree-granting authority in the state of Rhode Island, while secondary education would remain as the Eastern Nazarene Academy. Choosing a new name, however, would be difficult: the school was now a liberal arts college and a Nazarene institution. Candidates included: [...] "Northeastern Nazarene College", [...] "Bresee Memorial College", [...] "Nazarene College of the Northeast", and [...] "Nazarene College and Bresee Theological Institute". General Superintendent John W. Goodwin can be credited with the chosen name, as he wrote to Hiram F. Reynolds, also a general superintendent and a long-time supporter of the school: [...] "I know you will do your best for our New England <b>College.</b> <b>I</b> should be glad if they would change the name to the Eastern Nazarene College, or something like that.

2500|$|Former {{president}} of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers, responded to Michael Skube's rebuttal in the 12 July 2007 Letter to the Editor for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Argument {{may be a}} rank disgrace." [...] On the general topic of U.S. News methodology, she states, [...] "what many of us dispute is the validity of a single score computed by using [...] "data points" [...] to which weights are arbitrarily ascribed (why should retention count for 20% instead of 30%; why is peer assessment 25% instead of 10%; and who decides?). How can a single measure be valid when, in some cases, values are made up {{when they are not}} provided (the case of the missing SATs at Sarah Lawrence — the point of my Washington Post Op-Ed)? However, that's exactly what U.S. News does each year. Professional statisticians have reported that the methodology used by the magazine is seriously flawed and cannot be trusted." [...] She also responds to Skube's discussion of Sarah Lawrence's decision not to consider SAT or ACT scores by stating, [...] "Skube says he knows 'all he needs to know about Sarah Lawrence' because the college does not use SAT scores in its admission process, and therefore he infers we don't take aptitude seriously. Perhaps he doesn't know the research showing that SAT tests do not measure aptitude and at best provide a guess about academic performance {{in the first year of}} <b>college.</b> <b>I</b> do not think Elon University's SAT scores tell all there is to know about Elon. To think so would be falling into the trap of using one single measure as a proxy for the complex nature of any college. Which is precisely why the rankings are flawed." ...|$|E
