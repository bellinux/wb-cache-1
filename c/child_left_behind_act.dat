40|$|This article {{examines}} early {{implementation of the}} No <b>Child</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>Act’s</b> (NCLB) accountability provisions. Theoretically, the author explains how executing education policy in the United States requires federal officials to employ tactics designed to assert control over state implementers while persuading them to adopt federal priorities as their own. Empirically, the main objective is to reveal how control and persuasion have been integral to early federal efforts to keep NCLB on track. The data come from several sources describing state implementation of NCLB and federal efforts to influence state actions during 2002 to 2004. Overall, the author argues that understanding NCLB implementation {{as a series of}} control and persuasion challenges confronting federal officials will enable observers to better assess the law’s performance...|$|R
