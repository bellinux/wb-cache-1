40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through rotary valve in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, rotary valve air leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass flowrate in the <b>conveying</b> <b>line</b> will be less than the total supplied air mass flowrate due to air leakage through the rotary valve. By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the total supplied air mass flowrate to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the <b>conveying</b> <b>line,</b> a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after rotary valve air leakage has been taken into account. These results show that rotary valve air leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass flowrate through the rotary valve...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Johnson-Jackson {{boundary}} conditions {{are included in}} the twoPhaseEulerFoam solver of OpenFOAM- 2. 2. x in order to consider the wall-friction effect on the movement of particles. A straight <b>conveying</b> <b>line</b> using Johnson-Jackson {{boundary conditions}} is simulated. The results show that the particles’ velocity at the wall is in better agreement with the experimental results [1], compared to the results of the original solver neglecting wall-friction. However, the model is valid only for a specific adjusted value of the specularity coefficient. Thus, Johnson-Jackson model is revisited {{based on the work of}} Li and Benyahia [2]. To improve the accuracy of the granular temperature contribution, a new boundary condition, which incorporates sliding and non-sliding collisions, proposed by Schneiderbauer et al. [3], is included in the solver. The velocity profiles of the particles, using the latter boundary conditions, are compared to that of the Johnson-Jackson cases as well as the experimental results. It appears that the boundary conditions of Schneiderbauer et al. [3] yield better agreement with experimental data since these are based on the physical properties and incorporate the coulomb limit to particle-wall collision. Furthermore, based on the experimental study of Sommerfeld and Kussin [1], wall-roughness appears to be an important factor for the transfer of tangential momentum in vertical direction. Accordingly, wall-roughness and shadow effect [4] are studied in order to propose a new model for including wall-roughness in TFM simulations. Finally, the proposed model is implemented in twoPhaseEulerFoam, and the effect of this phenomenon on the particle's velocity profile is studied. The results show that wall-roughness has a strong effect on rebound and redispersion of the particles and accordingly changes the particles’ concentration in the section of <b>conveying</b> <b>line</b> significantly...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe micro-conveyor is a 9 x 9 mm 2 {{manipulation}} surface {{able to move}} millimeter-sized planar {{objects in}} the four cardinal directions using air flows. Thanks to a specific design, the air flow comes through a network of micro-channels connected to an array of micro-nozzles. Thus, the micro-conveyor generates an array of tilted air jets that lifts and moves the object in the required direction. In this paper, we characterize the device for transport and positioning tasks and evaluate its performances in terms of speed, resolution and repeatability. We show that the micro-conveyor is able to move the object with a speed up to 137 mm* s- 1 in less than 100 ms whereas the positioning repeatability is around 17. 7 µm with feedback control.

Work in this area has been on-going for many years with only marginal improvements in the accuracy of prediction being achieved. Experimental and theoretical investigations undertaken by the authors suggest that the flow mechanisms involved in dense phase conveying are dominated by transient effects rather than those of steady state and are possibly the principal reasons for the limited improvement in accuracy. This paper reports on investigations on the pressure fluctuation behaviour in dense phase pneumatic conveying of powders.

40|$|Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a widely}} used method of transporting particles in industrial processes. Two {{of the most important}} parameters needed to effectively design <b>conveying</b> <b>lines</b> are the <b>conveying</b> gas velocity and pressure drop. Estimation of pickup velocity, defined as the fluid velocity required to pick up a particle from rest, is a suitable way to approximate the minimum conveying gas velocity for a particular type of material. Pickup velocity is a function of many factors, including particle characteristics, fluid properties, moisture content, degree of electrostatic charging, and conduit dimensions and shape. This work assesses the effect of particle size, shape, density, and electrostatic behavior on the pickup velocity of various materials in a cylindrical pipe. Trends, rather than absolute values, are presented so that the effect of each variable becomes apparent. One of the main results of this analysis identifies the dominant forces within specific particle size ranges that determine the velocity required for incipient motion. In addition to this work, an experimental investigation of vertical gas-solids flows is used to determine the effect of particle size and shape, mass loading (ratio of solids mass flow rate to gas mass flow rate), and Reynolds number on pressure drop. The experimental results are compared to predictions made by a commonly-used pressure drop correlation and a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model developed and refined by our research group. Deficiencies in the model are identified and suggestions for improvement are made based on comparisons with the experimental data. ...|$|R

However, most of two-interconnected {{fluidized bed}}s systems require riser and/or pneumatic transport <b>line</b> for solid <b>conveying</b> and loopseals or seal-pots for gas sealing, recirculation of solids to the riser, and maintaining of pressure balance. The riser (transport bed) is operated at the high velocity fluidization condition and residence times of gas and solid in the riser are very short. If the reaction rate of catalyst or sorbent is slow, the riser can not ensure sufficient contact time between gas and solid {{and we have to}} use two bubbling beds for each reaction to ensure sufficient contact time. In this case, additional riser must be installed for solid circulation. Consequently, conventional two-interconnected fluidized bed systems are very complex, large, and difficult to operate. To solve these problems, a novel two-interconnected fluidized bed system has been developed. This system has two bubbling beds, solid injection nozzles, solid <b>conveying</b> <b>lines,</b> and downcomers. In this study, effects of operating variables on solid circulation rate, gas leakage between two beds have been investigated in a cold mode two-interconnected fluidized bed system. Moreover, long-term operation of continuous solid circulation up to 60 hours has been performed to check feasibility of stable operation.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was carried out as part of the PARDEM project. The overall aim was to quantify the predictive capability of a coupled CFD-DEM approach to simulating the horizontal pneumatic conveying of spherical and low-aspect-ratio non-spherical particles. Carefully controlled experiments were carried out in a 6. 5 m long, 0. 075 m diameter horizontal <b>conveying</b> <b>line</b> with the aid of the laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Three different sizes of spherical glass beads, ranging from 0. 8 mm to 2 mm and low-aspect-ratio cylindrical shaped particle of size 1 × 1. 5 mm were employed. Simulations of the experiments were performed using a two-way coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) implemented in the commercial software FLUENT-EDEM in an Eulerian–Lagrangian framework. Experimental and simulation results of gas and particle velocities for particle laden flow with spherical particles were compared, showing that the CFD-DEM method could capture the experimental trends. However, quantitative discrepancies between simulation and experimental results were observed. Further modelling of low-aspect-ratio cylindrical particles was conducted using a multi-sphere model to represent cylindrical particles in the DEM code.

40|$|Slug-flow {{pneumatic}} conveying is a full-bore mode of flow within the dense-phase flow regime where bulk materials are transported {{in the form}} of slugs at conveying speeds below saltation velocity. The mechanism of slug-flow {{pneumatic conveying}} consists of the particles being picked up from the stationary bed in front of a moving slug while the same amount of material is deposited behind the slug. Stress field modeling of the material slug {{is the first step in}} developing a prediction model for the pressure drop along a pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>line.</b> However, a reliable prediction strongly relies on an accurate assessment of several factors, including the particle properties, pipeline dimensions, and operating conditions. So far, the particle diameter has always been one of the crucial parameters, which is not desirable in regards to the limitations it imposes on the choice of bulk materials. This article focuses on one parameter, the stress transmission coefficient kw, which relates the lateral wall stress within a slug of material to the axial stress. To date, this parameter could not be measured directly in an aerated material bed and had to be estimated. Inaccuracies within the prediction were therefore unavoidable. A newly designed test chamber now enables the measurement of the lateral and axial stresses within a slug, which leads directly to this stress transmission coefficient. This article outlines the design of the test apparatus and reports on the experimental results. For the two materials tested, an exponential correlation between the pressure on top of the slug (frontal stress) and the stress transmission coefficient was obtained. Calculating the wall friction coefficient leads to a constant value above a certain material-specific air velocity...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the interaction between rotary valves and pneumatic conveying pipelines and the effect which this can have on overall system performance. A review of previous work and current industrial practice revealed that very little work has been published on this subject, although it was evident that some manufacturers of pneumatic conveying systems do have preferred entrainment configurations. Consequently, a preliminary experimental investigation was undertaken with a transparent model of a rotary valve and drop-out box in order to observe the air and solid flow patterns inside the drop-out box. This provided the most important outcome {{of this work}}, that is, the discovery that two distinctly different modes of flow can exist in the chamber of a conventional drop-out box. The first of these is a turbulent swirling motion caused by the conveying airstream and is the most desirable operating condition because it results in the most effective entrainment of material into the <b>conveying</b> <b>line.</b> The second is a situation where the drop-out box is effectively 'choked' with product. Models to explain these two conditions have been developed and subsequently tested against data obtained from a full size positive pressure conveying system specifically constructed for this purpose. An extensive experimental programme has been carried out in which the performance of this system was examined with a selection of different entrainment configurations and different test materials. The principal variables investigated were the height and volume of the drop-out box, the orientation of the rotary valve with respect to the pipeline and the conveying air velocity. As a result of this work guidelines have been produced for interfacing rotary valves with pneumatic conveying pipelines. These have been presented as a simple list of eight points and it is anticipated that they will enable systems to be designed with more confidence than has been possible previously...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{rheological}} {{characterization of}} mineral slurries {{is fraught with}} many problems {{and the need to}} pump higher concentrations, especially in tailings disposal, has meant that more and more slurries exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour. Capillary tube viscometry is the preferred method of testing and apparently credible results obtained from stable &# 039;homogeneous&# 039; suspensions, containing particles with diameters of 10 s and 100 s of microns, are the rule rather than the exception. Settleable solids suspended in visco-plastic fluids may be stable in the un-sheared condition, but will stratify when the fluid is sheared. This behaviour results in an unobserved stratified flow within the <b>conveying</b> <b>line.</b> For small pipes, such as those used for rheological characterization, the stratified bed flow effect is small and is masked by the viscous nature of the suspending medium. Unfortunately, the stratified bed flow dominates the transport pressure gradients in larger pipes, resulting in often gross under-prediction of full size behaviour. To illustrate this effect, tests conducted with a non-Newtonian carrier fluid in 12 and 25 NB (nominal bore) pipes were found to be insensitive to the addition of large (- 1 mm) particles at concentrations up to 20 % w/w. Conversely, transport characteristics for these suspensions are a strong function of solids concentration in larger pipes, e. g 100 NB. Analysis presented in the paper shows that such behaviour is consistent with the behaviour of high viscosity stratified flows. In practice, tests would not be attempted with such large particles, which make the results obtained even more surprising. The behaviour casts doubts upon the validity of much of the capillary tube data obtained with &# 039;normal&# 039; slurry size distributions. This phenomenon needs to be understood, if the design of high concentration pumping systems for industrial slurries and pastes is to be performed with any certainty...|$|E

40|$|Under microgravity, {{the usual}} methods of placing {{granular}} solids into, or extracting them from, containers or storage vessels will not function. Alternative methods {{are required to}} provide a motive force to move the material. New configurations for microgravity regolith storage vessels that do not resemble terrestrial silos, hoppers, or tanks are proposed. The microgravity-compatible bulk-material storage vessels and exit feed configurations are designed to reliably empty and feed cohesive material to transfer vessels or <b>conveying</b> ducts or <b>lines</b> without gravity. A controllable motive force drives the cohesive material to the exit opening(s), and provides a reliable means to empty storage vessels and/or to feed microgravity <b>conveying</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed designs will function equally well in vacuum, or inside of pressurized enclosures. Typical terrestrial granular solids handling and storage equipment will not function under microgravity, since almost all such equipment relies on gravity to at least move material to an exit location or to place it {{in the bottom of}} a container. Under microgravity, there effectively are no directions of up or down, and in order to effect movement of material, some other motive force must be applied to the material. The proposed storage vessels utilize dynamic centrifugal force to effect movement of regolith whenever material needs to be removed from the storage vessel. During simple storage, no dynamic motion or forces are required. The rotation rate during emptying can be controlled to ensure that material will move to the desired exit opening, even if the material is highly cohesive, or has acquired an electrostatic charge. The general concept of this Swirl Action Utilized for Centrifugal Ejection of Regolith (SAUCER) microgravity storage unit/dynamic feeder is to have an effective slot-hopper (based on the converging angles of the top and bottom conical section of the vessel) with an exit slot around the entire periphery of the SAUCER.
