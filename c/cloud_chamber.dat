5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
5|$|The summit, {{which is}} the {{collapsed}} dome of an ancient volcano, features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to invent the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> after a period spent working at the observatory.|$|E
5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber,</b> used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E
25|$|A fourth method {{involves}} the use of <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> to detect the secondary muons created when a pion decays. <b>Cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> in particular can be built from widely available materials and can be constructed even in a high-school laboratory. A fifth method, involving bubble chambers, can be used to detect cosmic ray particles.|$|R

50|$|Ultramicroscopes {{have been}} used for general {{observation}} of aerosols and colloids, in studying Brownian motion, in observing ionization tracks in <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> and in studying biological ultrastructure.|$|R
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of the pion in 1947, the search for new elementary particles became a popular research topic. By operating fast ionization chambers within a <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber,</b> Herbert showed that the bursts of ionization they recorded were primarily produced by relatively low energy cosmic rays, whose nuclear interactions typically involve the ejection of several heavily ionising nuclear fragments. On the basis of this effect, he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions {{is similar to that of}} penetrating showers.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 and 1933, the {{scientists}} at the Cavendish Laboratory {{made a series of}} ground-breaking discoveries. Cockroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the atomic nucleus of one element to another by artificial means. Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the neutron. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron pair production.|$|E
5|$|Neddermeyer {{contributed to}} the {{research}} {{which led to the}} 1932 discovery of the positron, for which Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. That year, Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon, using <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements of cosmic rays. Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.|$|E
50|$|The {{bubble chamber}} {{was invented by}} Donald A. Glaser of the United States in 1952, and for this, {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1960. The bubble chamber {{similarly}} reveals the tracks of subatomic particles, but as trails of bubbles in a superheated liquid, usually liquid hydrogen. Bubble chambers can be made physically larger than <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> and since they are filled with much-denser liquid material, they reveal the tracks of much more energetic particles. These factors rapidly made the bubble chamber the predominant particle detector for a number of decades, so that <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> were effectively superseded in fundamental research by the start of the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Powell {{became a}} {{research}} fellow at the Franklin Institute’s Bartol Laboratory and began investigation of cosmic rays. During the Depression years, funds for research were difficult to secure. Powell managed to obtain financing for his research on cosmic rays and the construction of bigger and better <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> from the Rumford Fund of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Carnegie Institute, the Committee on Research of the American Philosophical Society and the Fund for Astrophysical Research. While at Bartol, Powell constructed two <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> for cosmic ray study and developed a source of light at a much lower cost than the lighting used at the time.|$|R
50|$|He did {{important}} {{work in the}} development of high-pressure <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> for the study of neutrons produced by accelerators. He invented a neutron-counter-ratio technique for the determination of neutron emission thresholds. He also invented a sphere-moderated neutron spectrometer.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1938, Maier-Leibniz built a Wilson <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber.</b> Images {{from the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> {{were used by}} Bothe, Gentner, and Maier-Leibniz to publish, in 1940, the Atlas of Typical <b>Cloud</b> <b>Chamber</b> Images, which became a {{standard}} reference for identifying scattered particles.|$|E

The lowest number is closest to the source. All except the first chamber have some thin metal filters to attenuate the flux and harden the spectrum. <b>Cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> 10, 12, and 14 are shielded by a collimator with about 200 pinholes in it. The flux in these chambers is attenuated by {{the ratio of the}} pinhole area to total beam area which is a factor of 50. Various gases and gas pressures are used to obtain suitable track lengths and interaction cross sections. Neon, argon, and krypton are used to obtain photo electrons.

50|$|<b>Cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> work on {{the same}} {{principles}} as bubble chambers, but are based on supersaturated vapor rather than superheated liquid. While bubble chambers were extensively used in the past, they have now mostly been supplanted by wire chambers and spark chambers. Historically, notable bubble chambers include the Big European Bubble Chamber (BEBC) and Gargamelle.|$|R
500|$|To {{study the}} new {{elementary}} particles, Bridge and Martin Annis operated a large rectangular multi plate <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> at Echo Lake. [...] This investigation provided {{the basis for}} a 1951 PhD thesis by Annis, supervised by Rossi. The next year, these authors, with another student of Rossi's, Stanislaw Olbert, showed how to derive information on particle energies from measurements of their multiple scattering. This added another way to use cloud chambers to measure the properties of elementary particles. In early 1953, with Bridge, Richard Safford and Charles Peyrou, Rossi published results of a comprehensive <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> study of the elementary particles that became known as kaons. Peyrou was a visitor from at the École Polytechnique, where he had obtained an accurate value of the muon mass in 1947, and Safford was Rossi's student.|$|E
500|$|Rossi's group {{focused on}} the use of cloud {{chambers}} to study their properties and interactions. [...] In 1948, {{with the aid of a}} multi-plate <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> in which lead plates alternated with aluminium ones, Gregory, Rossi and Tinlot showed that the source of the electromagnetic component of cosmic ray interactions was predominantly energetic photons, rather than electrons. [...] This result confirmed Oppenheimer's suggestion of 1947 that neutral pions are produced in interactions, along with charged ones, and that this component arises from their rapid decay into photons.|$|E
500|$|Late in 1931, Rossi {{arranged}} for Occhialini {{to work in}} the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge with Patrick Blackett, whom he had met in Berlin. [...] With the aid of the new technique of electronic coincidence, Occhialini helped Blackett develop the first counter-controlled <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber,</b> with which they confirmed Carl Anderson's discovery of the positron and deduced that the positive electrons are produced in association with negative ones by pair production. [...] Up to 23 positive and negative electrons were observed in some events, which were clearly related to the showers of Rossi's soft component.|$|E
40|$|Several new {{examples}} of the decay of neutral V-particles (1 - 4) have been obtained recently at Pasadena, using two new magnet <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> arranged to respond to cosmic-ray penetrating showers. Nine of these are of special interest {{in that it is}} possible to draw some conclusions as to the identity of the charged secondaries in each case...|$|R
40|$|The various {{techniques}} for detecting subatomic particles are reviewed. The evolution of detectors {{in recent years}} is examined {{in the context of the}} increasing number of elementary particles under investigation. Specific techniques discussed include <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> bubble chambers (enhanced with holographic techniques), together with wire chambers and other exotic detectors developed at CERN. Applications of such detectors are also dealt with. (0 refs) ...|$|R
5000|$|In the old bubble <b>chambers</b> and <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> [...] "events" [...] {{could be}} seen by observing charged {{particle}} tracks emerging from {{the region of the}} event before they curl due to the magnetic field through the chamber acting on the particles. At modern particle accelerators, events are the result of the interactions which occur from a beam crossing inside a particle detector.|$|R
500|$|By this time, <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> {{observations}} had clarified {{the nature}} of the hard component. [...] In 1936, Anderson and his student, Seth Neddermeyer, discovered cosmic ray particles with mass intermediate between those of the electron and the proton, [...] which Anderson called [...] "mesotrons". [...] The mesotron subsequently became the known as the [...] " [...] meson", which was shortened to [...] "muon". Just before the Copenhagen conference, Blackett suggested that observed variations of cosmic ray intensity with atmospheric temperature could be an indication that mesotrons are unstable, and he held intense discussions with Rossi on this subject. [...] As a result, Rossi left Manchester determined to confirm their decay and to measure the lifetime.|$|E
500|$|A {{highlight}} was Leprince-Ringuet's declaration in {{his closing}} talk that: [...] "...in {{the future we}} must use particle accelerators." [...] With the 3 GeV Cosmotron already in operation at Brookhaven National Laboratory, this declaration reflected a consensus among the participants. As a result, Rossi's group began to wind down their <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> experiments. [...] However, in 1954, Bridge, Hans Courant, Herbert DeStaebler, Jr. and Rossi reported on an unusual event in which a stopping singly charged particle decayed into three photons whose energies totaled more than the proton rest energy. [...] This is the signature of an antiproton annihilation. The next year, a group led by Owen Chamberlain and Emilio Segrè detected antiprotons, {{for which they were}} awarded Nobel Prize in Physics in 1960.|$|E
500|$|Burhop listed [...] "furtherance of {{international}} scientific cooperation" [...] {{as one of}} his hobbies. He worked with the University of Edinburgh and the University of Padua to establish a high-altitude <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> on Marmolada that commenced operation in 1953. In 1957, he collaborated with Occhialini and C. F. Powell on a five-nation study of K mesons and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years, and produced a wealth of new results, including the first observation of a double lambda hypernucleus. He spent the 1962–63 academic year on secondment to CERN, and was secretary of a committee chaired by Edoardo Amaldi that drew up its policy for accelerator development. The machines the committee recommended, the Intersecting Storage Rings and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) were built, and became an important part of physics research in Europe for decades to come.|$|E
50|$|In {{particle}} {{and nuclear}} physics, a nuclear emulsion plate is a photographic {{plate with a}} particularly thick emulsion layer and with a very uniform grain size. Like bubble <b>chambers,</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> and wire chambers nuclear emulsion plates record the tracks of charged particles passing through. They are compact, have high density and produce a cumulative record, but have the disadvantage that the plates must be developed before the tracks can be observed.|$|R
500|$|Returning to England, Titterton {{joined the}} Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, heading [...] a group {{responsible}} for research with nuclear emulsions and <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers.</b> He investigated ternary fission, a comparatively rare type of nuclear fission {{in which the}} nucleus breaks into three pieces instead of two, and the photodisintegration of light nuclei by gamma rays. He was also {{a consultant to the}} Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston that designed and developed Britain's first nuclear weapons.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett, Baron Blackett [...] (18 November 1897 - 13 July 1974) was an English {{experimental}} physicist {{known for}} his work on <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> cosmic rays, and paleomagnetism, winning the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1948. He also made a major contribution in World War II advising on military strategy and developing operational research. His left-wing views saw an outlet in third world development and in influencing policy in the Labour Government of the 1960s.|$|R
500|$|In 1946, after World War II ended, Neddermeyer left Los Alamos {{to become}} an {{associate}} professor at the [...] University of Washington, where he would {{spend the rest of his}} career. In due course he became a full professor. He resumed his studies of cosmic rays using a <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> and a new device that he invented to measure the speed of charged particles known as a [...] "chronotron". He was particularly interested in the properties of the muon, and conducted experiments with muons at SLAC. He participated in the DUMAND Project, for which he helped design large-scale underwater neutrino detectors. Neddermeyer became interested in parapsychology, insisting, in spite of the skepticism of many colleagues, that it warranted proper scientific investigation. He retired in 1973, becoming a professor emeritus, but he continued his research activities for as long as his health permitted. He was afflicted with Parkinson's disease.|$|E
500|$|Returning to England, Titterton {{joined the}} Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire. He headed {{a group that}} was part of Herbert Skinner's General Physics Division, {{responsible}} for research with nuclear emulsions and cloud chambers. Using photographic techniques, he investigated ternary fission, a comparatively rare type of nuclear fission in which the nucleus breaks into three pieces instead of two. This occurs in only about one in 500 fission events, so was not easy to observe. He examined the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> tracks of over one million events, finding about a thousand ternary alpha particle tracks with energy of between 15 MeV and 30 MeV, emitted at 90° to the two heavy fragments. He also researched the photodisintegration of light nuclei by gamma rays. Unfortunately, the synchrotron at Harwell was not powerful enough to create pions as he hoped, so he investigated [...] "stars" [...] (multi-particle disintegrations) in nuclear emulsions. In all, he published 28 papers between 1949 and 1952. He was also a consultant to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston that designed and developed Britain's first nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Brode {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with the British physicist P.M.S. Blackett. He was impressed by Blackett's <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> and set his graduate students to work on projects using them, starting with Dale R. Corson.|$|R
25|$|Typical {{particles}} {{produced in}} such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as {{positive or negative}} pions and kaons. Some of these subsequently decay into muons, which are able to reach {{the surface of the}} Earth, and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines. The muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors, such as <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers,</b> bubble chambers or scintillation detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time is an indication that all of the particles came from that event.|$|R
