President Jimmy Carter and President-elect Ronald Reagan made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed. In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its revolutionary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways. The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to [...] "recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party". On 16 December 1980, a monument dedicated to the memory of the victims of the 1970 protests on the coast was officially unveiled in Gdańsk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.|$|E

40|$|As constructed, the Standard Model {{does not}} include genuine Second <b>Class</b> <b>Currents,</b> however these can be induced through the {{breaking}} of isospin or charge conjugation. The experimental limits from B-Factories are getting closer to the predictions made for induced Second <b>Class</b> <b>Currents</b> through isospin breaking in the processes τ→πη^(') ν_τ, therefore a more careful analysis of the background in these decays becomes necessary. In this work we analyze the τ→πη^(') γν_τ decays as background of the non-radiative process. We find that the radiative processes are very important background for the non-radiative ones whenever the photon escapes detection. Photons cannot be completely excluded since {{they need to be}} kept for the identification of the eta and eta' in the final state. However, we find that making appropriate cuts in the energy of the photon, this process can be disregarded as an important background.

40|$|The {{absence of}} second <b>class</b> <b>currents</b> {{together}} with the assumption of factorization for non-leptonic B decays provide new constraints on CP observables in decay B to a 0 (980) (to eta pi) pi. The kinematics of this decay do not allow interference between the oppositely charged resonances in the Dalitz plot as in B 0 to rho(770) pi.
