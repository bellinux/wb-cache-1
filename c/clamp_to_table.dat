5000|$|In his {{own words}} (1992): [...] "Music on a Long Thin Wire is {{constructed}} as follows: the wire is extended across a large room, <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> <b>tables</b> at both ends. The ends of the wire {{are connected to the}} loudspeaker terminals of a power amplifier placed under one of the tables. A sine wave oscillator is connected to the amplifier. A magnet straddles the wire at one end. Wooden bridges are inserted under the wire at both ends to which contact microphones are imbedded, routed to a stereo sound system. The microphones pick up the vibrations that the wire imparts to the bridges and are sent through the playback system. By varying the frequency and loudness of the oscillator, a rich variety of slides, frequency shifts, audible beats and other sonic phenomena may be produced." ...|$|R

5000|$|During the 18th century, {{weighted}} pincushions {{became popular}} among seamstresses. In England, seam <b>clamps</b> attached <b>to</b> a <b>table</b> and designed for holding hems for sewing became common, and were {{often in the}} shape of a bird (the tail would be pinched to open and close the [...] "beak" [...] to hold the fabric); attached to the back of the bird was a velvet pin cushion.|$|R
50|$|The daxophone {{consists}} of a wooden piece called a tongue, approximately 330 mm in length, 30 mm in width, and 5 mm in height, and fixed to a wooden block (often attached to a tripod, but also <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> a <b>table</b> top), which holds one or more contact microphones. This wooden block has a cavity which is carved with a chisel for the insertion of two contact microphones, and a snakewood soundboard laid on top with the contact microphones glued to it. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on {{the shape of the}} tongue and the type of wood. The tongue shape is made with a bandsaw or jigsaw. Denser woods such as ebony and oak produce a mellower sound than light woods. These sounds are notable for their comical, often human sounds.|$|R
40|$|We report {{collision}} {{experiments with}} Delrin disks and a steel plate. The disks floated on an air table, and collided at low speeds {{with a thick}} plate <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> the <b>table.</b> The collision angle was varied. The observed normal restitution was consistent with other studies. The frictional interaction differed from that reported for spheres and thick disks, and from predictions of standard rigid-body collision models. For `sliding' 2 D collisions, most authors assume the ratio of tangential to normal impulse equals (friction coefficient). The observed impulse ratio was appreciably lower: roughly = 2 slightly into the sliding regime, approaching only for grazing collisions. Separate experiments were conducted to estimate; check its invariance with force magnitude; and check that the anomalies observed are not from dependence on velocity magnitude. We connect our ndings {{with the nature of}} deformation elds in disks, and with `force-response' and `impulse-response' rigidity...|$|R
5000|$|An alarm {{goes off}} that night and the Flock see Fang coming. Max and him {{reconcile}} making Dylan very angry. Fang tells them about a comment on his blog saying that a kid knows where Angel is. They go to where he said Angel was. Earlier in the book, Angel describes how smoke filled the building and they left her <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> the <b>table.</b> The rest of the Flock sees the fire. Once it dies down they go inside the building to search for Angel. They find the dead bodies of whitecoats in a circle suggesting they {{knew what was going}} to happen. They see Mark again who jumps out of the window onto the broken concrete and dies. They find Angel, and it turns out that she is not completely blind, for as she says, [...] "Everything is kind of a blur." [...] Reunited, the flock heads back to Oregon.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} 2 D {{collision}} experiments with 9 thin Delrin disks with variable axisymmetric mass dis-tributions. The disks floated on an air table, and collided at speeds of about 0. 5 to 1. 0 m/s with a flat-walled stationary thick steel plate <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> the <b>table.</b> The collision angle was varied. The observed normal restitution was roughly independent of angle, {{consistent with other}} studies. The fric-tional interaction diered from that reported for spheres and thick disks, and from predictions of most standard rigid-body collision models. For " 2 D collisions, most authors assume the ratio of tangential to normal impulse equals (friction coecient). The observed impulse ratio was appreciably lower: roughly = 2 slightly into the sliding regime, approaching only for nearly grazing collisions. Separate experiments were conducted to estimate; check its invariance with force magnitude; and check that the anomalies observed are not from dependence on velocity magnitude. We speculate that these slightly anomalous ndings {{are related to the}} 2 D deformation elds in thin disks, and with the disks being only -response " rigid and not -response " rigid. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the per-operative process of shoulder joint replacement, time-action analysis can be used. Material/Methods: Forty procedures performed by 7 surgeons with different experience rising 5 different prostheses and 3 different Surgical approaches were analyzed. Results: The surgical procedures showed a large variation in, for example, duration, tasks of team members, and protocol used. The surgical procedure {{was influenced by}} several factors, such as the prosthesis used, the surgical approach, the patient's condition, {{and the experience of}} the surgeon. Exposure of the glenoid was difficult and several retractors were needed, which were held by an extra assistant or <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> the <b>table</b> or the surgeon. Two main limitations were seen in all procedures: repeated actions and waiting. Also, five errors could be identified. None of the alignment instruments was completely reliable and they allowed the surgeon to make major errors. Conclusions: Better alignment instruments, pre-operative planning techniques, and operation protocols are needed for shoulder prostheses. The training of resident surgeons should be focused on the exposure phase, the alignment of the humeral head, the exposure of the glenoid, and the alignment of the glenoid. Evaluating the surgical process using time-action analysis can be used to determine the limitations during surgical procedures. Furthermore, it shows the large variation in factors affecting surgical performance, indicating that a system approach is needed to improve surgical outcome...|$|R

5000|$|The clover <b>clamp,</b> also {{referred}} <b>to</b> as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The clamp itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The <b>clamp</b> is applied <b>to</b> the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place. The clamp usually provides {{a very high}} pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can {{be attached to the}} ends of the clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied <b>to</b> the <b>clamp,</b> it will cause the jaws of the <b>clamp</b> <b>to</b> close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is <b>to</b> use the <b>clamps</b> <b>to</b> keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the <b>clamp</b> <b>to</b> a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.|$|R
