Information sources related to the utilization of goatskin as a raw material for food packaging are still lacking. One of type of food packaging that environmental friendly was edible film. One of the advantages of edible film as the packaging material is can be consumed along with the product, so that no waste. Edible films need to be developing as an effort to create an environment zero waste. In the formation, process of edible film requires a precise formulation in order to form a mass that is able to function properly. Edible film formation influenced by the type and composition of the constituent materials. One of using collagen as an edible film today is as a packaging in the meat industry (Wang et al., 2015). The use of whey protein combined with glycerol also been developed as a packaging material (Perez et al., 2016). During this time, the manufacture of edible film comes from of starch, whereas, the basic ingredient of the protein has not been widely used. Edible films of three types of material (glycerol, starch and gum nuts) developed as a <b>composite</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>material</b> for fruit products (Saberi et al., 2016). The use of essential oils incorporated to carrageenan as material for edible film developed by Soni et al. (2015) as the packaging material in the chicken patties product. Edible films are one of packaging products that environmental friendly. Edible films can produce from the by-products of the slaughtering of livestock locally. Edible films used as materials packaging of foodstuff to protect food products of contamination of air, light, lipid, dissolved substances and microorganisms. One of the main advantages of edible film packaging is a natural character, so it can consume together with such food products. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the properties of edible film that produced from a combination of collagen extracts from glycerol as a plasticizer.

For that purpose, three types of fibres obtained by successive grindings (from the micrometric up to the millimetric scale) were used. It was shown that the highest possible filler level {{was all the more}} high when decreasing fibre size (over 50 wt% in the case of micrometric fibres), due to reduced film heterogeneity and improved fibre wetting by the polymer. As regards functional properties, increasing fibre size and/or content led to a significant degradation of ultimate tensile properties, while Young’s modulus was not significantly affected. At the same time, water vapour transmission rate was significantly increased from 11 up to 110 g m− 2 day− 1, which could extend the applicability of PHBV/WSF <b>composites</b> as food <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> to respiring fresh products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{widespread}} use of metal matrix <b>composites</b> as the <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> is due to their tailorable thermal conductivity and {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE). For the same reason, silicon carbide reinforced copper matrix (Cu-SiCp) composites are highly rated as thermal management materials in the electronic packaging applications. However, the Cu-SiCp composites fabricated via the conventional powder metallurgy methods have inferior thermophysical properties due to the presence of porosity in the interface of copper matrix and the SiCp reinforcement. In order to improve the bonding between the two constituents, the SiCp were coated with copper via electroless coating process. Based on the experimental results, the CTE values of the copper coated Cu-SiCp composites were found significantly lower than those of the non-Coated Cu-SiCp composites. The CTEs of the composites tend to decrease as the porosity increases. The significant difference in the CTE values was related to the presence of sub-micron gap between the copper matrix and the SiCp reinforcement...|$|R

Some of their properties include light weight, tiny structures, remote sensing, electro-magnetic interference, and more importantly they are immune to any hazardous environment, particularly they can withstand a high temperatures up to over 1000 ° C, and they are immune to electro-magnetic interference. They can be easily embedded inside the materials like composites with minimum effect on their original structure. The light weight of composite materials makes optical sensors embedded in <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> very suitable for many applications including airspace industry. The <b>composite</b> <b>packages</b> can be tailored to achieve desired mechanical characteristics. Moreover, they can be applied as extra protection for embedded fiber optics. In this work, phase-modulated sensor, Michelson interferometer, was fabricated and embedded in <b>composite</b> <b>package.</b> Then the package was glued on an aluminum substrate. The resultant structure {{was used to measure}} strain in the aluminum substrate. The comprehensive study was performed in evaluating different lay-ups of the <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> in order to find the best match between the composite materials and the substrate in term of stiffness. ANSYS simulations were performed to study the influence of the resin pocket on the strain transmission to the optical sensor, dependence of the thickness of the adhesive layer on the strain readings on the <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> and on the optical sensor. The results of the simulations showed that optical sensor within resin pocket created by the resin and carbon fiber will give small alteration in strain readings between composite material and optical fiber. Static tensile tests were investigated on different lay-ups of the laminate, adhesives, composite materials, and thickness of the adhesive layers. Difference in strain readings between aluminum and optical sensor were smaller due to good transmission of the strain through epoxy adhesive layer with thickness a 100 om.
