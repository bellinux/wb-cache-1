50|$|Chronoamperometry is an {{electrochemical}} {{technique in}} which {{the potential of the}} working electrode is stepped and the resulting current from faradaic processes occurring at the electrode (caused by the potential step) is monitored as a function of time. Limited information about the identity of the electrolyzed species can be obtained from the ratio of the peak oxidation current versus the peak reduction current. However, as with all pulsed techniques, chronoamperometry generates high charging currents, which decay exponentially with time as any RC circuit. The Faradaic current - which is due to electron transfer events and is most often the current <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> - decays as described in the Cottrell equation. In most electrochemical cells this decay is much slower than the charging decay-cells with no supporting electrolyte are notable exceptions. Most commonly investigated with a three electrode system. Since the current is integrated over relatively longer time intervals, chronoamperometry gives a better signal to noise ratio in comparison to other amperometric techniques.|$|E

40|$|Sound feed {{formulation}} {{is dependent}} upon precise evaluation of energy and nutrients values in feed ingredients. Hence the methodology to determine the digestibility of energy and nutrients in feedstuffs should be chosen carefully before conducting experiments. The direct and difference procedures are widely {{used to determine the}} digestibility of energy and nutrients in feedstuffs. The direct procedure is normally considered when the test feedstuff can be formulated as the sole source of the <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the test diet. However, in some cases where test ingredients can only be formulated to replace a portion of the basal diet to provide the <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> the difference procedure can be applied to get equally robust values. Based on components of interest, ileal digesta or feces can be collected, and different sample collection processes can be used. For example, for amino acids (AA), to avoid the interference of fermentation in the hind gut, ileal digesta samples are collected to determine the ileal digestibility and simple T-cannula and index method are commonly used techniques for AA digestibility analysis. For energy, phosphorus, and calcium, normally fecal samples will be collected to determine the total tract digestibility, and therefore the total collection method is recommended to obtain more accurate estimates. Concerns with the use of apparent digestibility values include different estimated values from different inclusion level and non-additivity in mixtures of feed ingredients. These concerns can be overcome by using standardized digestibility, or true digestibility, by correcting endogenous losses of components from apparent digestibility values. In this review, methodologies used to determine energy and nutrients digestibility in pigs are discussed. It is suggested that the methodology should be carefully selected based on the <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> feed ingredients, and available experimental facilities...|$|E

40|$|Other {{papers in}} this conference discuss the {{experimental}} requirements for high quality outdoor testing of building components {{and the subsequent}} analysis procedures for identifying key parameters that quantify performance. This is important for achieving standardised metrics that characterise the building <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> {{whether it is a}} passive solar component such as a ventilated window, or an active component such as a hybrid photovoltaic module. However, such testing and analysis does not determine how the building component will perform when placed in a real building in a particular location and climate.

Multivariate filters {{can be used to}} isolate an ERP <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> without the averaging procedure. However, {{we would like to have}} certainty that the output of the filter accurately represents the component. Methods: We extended the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which is traditionally used as a spatial filter for source localization, to be a flexible spatiotemporal filter for estimating the amplitude of ERP components in sensor space. In a comparison study on both simulated and real data, we demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the beamformer as well as a range of supervised learning approaches. Results: In the context of measuring the amplitude of a specific ERP component on a single-trial basis, we found that the spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer is a filter that accurately captures the <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> even in the presence of both structured noise (e. g., other overlapping ERP components) and unstructured noise (e. g., ongoing brain activity and sensor noise). Conclusion: The spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer method provides an accurate and intuitive way to conduct analysis of a known ERP component, without averaging across trials or subjects. Significance: Eliminating averaging allows us to test more detailed hypotheses and apply more powerful statistical models.

40|$|Abstract Value-added {{processing}} {{with respect}} to rice milling has traditionally treated the rice bran layer as a homogenous material that contains significant concentrations <b>of</b> high-value <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. Investigators have shown that high-value components in the rice bran layer vary from differences in kernel-thickness, bran fraction, rice variety, and environmental conditions during the growing season. The objectives {{of this study were}} to quantify the amount of rice bran removed at pre-selected milling times and to correlate the amount of rice bran removed at each milling time with the concentration of vitamin E, gamma-oryzanol, rice bran saccharide, and protein obtained. The ultimate goal of this research is to show that rice bran fractionation is a useful method to obtain targeted, nutrient-rich bran samples for value-added processing. Two long grain rice cultivars, Cheniere and Cypress, were milled at discrete times between 3 and 40 seconds using a McGill mill to obtain bran samples for analysis. Results showed that the highest oryzanol and protein concentrations were found in the outer portion of the rice bran layer, while the highest rice bran saccharide concentration was found in the inner portion of the bran layer. Vitamin E concentration showed no significant difference across the bran layer within a variety, though the highest magnitude of concentration occurs within the first 10 seconds of milling for both varieties. To extract the higher concentration of oryzanol and protein only the outer portion of the bran layer requires processing, while to extract the higher concentration of rice bran saccharide, only the inner portion of the bran layer requires processing. Rice bran fractionation allows for the selective use of portions of the bran layer and is advantageous for two reasons: (1) bran fractions contain higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{with respect to}} the overall bran layer average, and (2) less bran needs to be processed to obtain <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> </p...|$|R
