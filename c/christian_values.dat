5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported <b>Christian</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} {{coincided with}} a religious revival in Belgium which had always been overwhelmingly Catholic. The Primate of Belgium, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, became {{an outspoken critic of}} the German occupation regime. Mercier published a celebrated pamphlet entitled Patriotisme et Endurance (Patriotism and Endurance) on Christmas Day 1914 which called for civilians to observe occupation laws only which were consistent with Belgian patriotism and <b>Christian</b> <b>values.</b> The pamphlet attacked the authority of the German occupying government, stating that any rule legitimised by force alone should not be obeyed.|$|E

5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis {{remained}} {{the basis of}} Byzantine law until {{the publication of the}} Ecloga legum in 741 by Emperor Leo III and his son and co-regent Constantine V. The Ecloga was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with <b>Christian</b> <b>values.</b> It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in Slavic, Armenian and Arabic. Emperor Basil I, who ruled in the 9th century, issued the Prochiron and the Epanagoge, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the Ecloga and restoring the Justinian laws. The Prochiron served {{as the basis for the}} legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, Saint Sava. His legal compilation was intended for the Serbian church but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches. Around 900, Emperor Leo VI commissioned the Basilica, a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Klossowski, in his 1947 book Sade Mon Prochain ("Sade My Neighbour"), {{analyzes}} Sade's {{philosophy as}} a precursor of nihilism, negating <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> and the materialism of the Enlightenment.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} the novel {{revolves}} around Jestyn's struggle to find belonging, as he is caught between conflicting values, conflicting cultures, and conflicting religions. The historical background depicts the Christianization of Kievan Rus', and Jestyn's mixed feelings as he carries an original <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> system of his youth alongside the commitment of blood feud and blood brotherhood of Norse paganism.|$|R
50|$|Alcuin, the {{suspected}} {{author of the}} letter, expressed views on the intrinsic <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> of the liberal arts that were not widely accepted by many. However, Alcuin influenced {{some of the most}} sophisticated Carolingian thinkers {{of the first half of}} the 9th century. The original letter by Charlemagne was likely written to Baugulf, but the text would reach Baugulf at a later time after the written date.|$|R

25|$|The Eric Liddell Centre {{was set up}} in Edinburgh in 1980 to honour Liddell's {{beliefs in}} {{community}} service whilst he lived and studied in Edinburgh.

50|$|The body must wear a belt {{during its}} burial because the {{deceased}} will need {{it when he}} or she is resurrected during the Last Judgment. Belts are significant in both Christian and folk rituals. <b>Christians</b> <b>value</b> them babies receive them, along with a cross, at their christening. Thus, it symbolizes a person’s commitment to Christianity. In folk tradition, belts mark out an individual’s private space and prove {{that he or she is}} a member of society and protect the wearer from dark forces.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid a relapse into Platonic idealism or asceticism, the {{creation}} of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts {{that gave birth to}} those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Übermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see Nietzschean affirmation).|$|R
2500|$|Despite these issues, Hayward clearly upholds {{the sound}} and {{accepted}} scholarly assessment of the Holocaust. In 2010 he described it as [...] "one of history’s vilest crimes … involving the organised murder of millions of Jews" [...] and in 2011 he similarly wrote: [...] "The Holocaust of the Jews in the Second World War, one of history’s vilest crimes, involved the organised murder of six million Jews by Germans and others who considered themselves Christians or at least members of the <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> system." ...|$|R
25|$|Additional {{adherents of}} this view include Rainey, James Dobson, Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical ethicists Franklin E. Payne and John and Paul Feinberg. Although most Protestants adhere to this view, some such as Rainey may {{nonetheless}} advocate {{for one of the}} categories he describes, depending upon which <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> they deem most important.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch's {{original}} conception as a {{goal for}} his epic poem was {{to bring back the}} glorious days of ancient Rome. There was a clash however between this fame for glory at his coronation and <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> he was trying to impart to his readers. The story of the death of Mago Barcid (Book 6) and the Dream of Scipio (Books 1 and 2) entered in at this point. In the 1350s Petrarch reworked the Africa extensively to reflect this. These events ultimately established the main concepts of the poem. Petrarch was writing his third book of the Secretum, a sort of self investigation of moral values especially as it related to fame, structured as an imaginary dialogue with Saint Augustine, also in the 1350s. From this developed the Secretum's Africa, a conflict between the vanity of the glory for Rome and <b>Christian</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{supplement}} its publications, the EMMS {{also drew}} {{the interest of}} the general public through its monthly prayer and lecture series held at No. 57 George Square and other locations. These prayer meetings served to reinforce the <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> of the society and to provide insight from first-hand experience from those who served abroad.|$|E
50|$|Referencing the paradoxes {{provided}} in Christ's teachings, I See Things Upside Down investigates {{the idea that}} perhaps, contrary to our religious and social standards, failure equals success, poverty equals riches, weakness equals strength, and foolishness equals understanding. “What {{are the things that}} we American <b>Christians</b> <b>value</b> in our culture and how is that different and often ‘upside down’ from true Kingdom values? I’ve found that often success looks more like failure, riches more like poverty, and that real life often feels more like death,” Webb said in a press release.|$|R
5000|$|His {{next major}} book, Architects of the Culture of Death, co-written with veteran Catholic ethicist Donald DeMarco, looks {{at how the}} most {{influential}} thinkers of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} from Schopenhauer to Peter Singer have undermined the <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> of [...] "sanctity of life". 2008's 10 Books That Screwed Up the World looks at fifteen important books from The Prince to The Feminine Mystique and aims, following Paul Johnson and E. Michael Jones, to show how the actual lives of these thinkers led to fundamentally distorted views about human nature, morality, and sexuality.|$|R
50|$|In all its aspects {{and ways}} of operating, St Patrick's College, as a <b>Christian</b> community, <b>values</b> the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the norm for its life and work.|$|R
25|$|The Boys' Brigade (BB) is an interdenominational Christian youth organisation, {{conceived}} by Sir William Alexander Smith to combine drill and fun activities with <b>Christian</b> <b>values.</b> Following {{its inception in}} Glasgow in 1883, the BB quickly spread across the United Kingdom and became a worldwide organisation by the early 1890s. As of 2003, there were 500,000Boys' Brigade members in 60countries.|$|E

50|$|However, {{later that}} year, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was introduced, {{ensuring}} {{freedom of conscience}} and religion, regardless of existing federal or provincial laws. On 24 April 1985 - the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Lord's Day Act violated Canadians' freedom of religion. The 1985 ruling examined the original purpose of the act. It found that the <b>Christian</b> <b>value</b> of keeping Sunday holy had been incorporated into a law that affected all Canadians, Christian or not. This law—the Lord's Day Act—prevented non-Christians from performing otherwise legal activities on Sundays. This was inconsistent with the Canadian charter.|$|R

25|$|In mid-1890s Nocedal {{realized}} that his bid to launch a nationwide Catholic ultraconservative party had failed; clinging to his intransigence, he nevertheless refused to reconsider the Integrist project and thought it his moral duty to represent orthodox <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> and confront liberalism against all odds. Other members of the party were not so principled and until his death Nocedal {{had to deal with}} successive defections, though there was no-one who posed a serious threat to his personal lead.|$|E
25|$|The Romanticism {{coincided with}} some {{ideas of the}} Risorgimento, the {{patriotic}} movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. The Betrothed by Alessandro Manzoni, the leading Italian Romantic, was the first Italian historical novel to glorify <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> of justice and Providence, {{and it has been}} called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Christian</b> <b>values</b> were {{supposed}} to be spread through the population, missionaries and priests soon realized that they'd be better off adapting their doctrine as much as possible to the local customs, rather than trying to impose it. As it happened all over Asia, women in the Philippines were expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children and take care of most household chores. Also a trait found all over Asia was the preference of most families to have male children instead of females.|$|E
50|$|From 1998 to 2004, Reid was the {{president}} of the evangelical Christian organization Focus on the Family Canada. He promoted conservative <b>Christian</b> family <b>values,</b> while actively campaigning against issues such as divorce, abortion and same-sex marriage.|$|R
40|$|The work {{is focused}} on how it is {{possible}} to stabilize and develop ethical values in children camps. First the work {{is focused on}} a value concept and determinates a <b>Christian</b> ethical <b>value.</b> Further it describes pubescence season characteristics and its specifics, where ethical development, identity and socialization inherently belong to. Then basic mechanisms analyses which are helpful for values education follow. Next part of the work is focused on camp and games dramaturgy. In the end an application of gained knowledge is shown on particular Christian camp preparation {{which is going to be}} focused on <b>Christian</b> ethical <b>values</b> development and stabilisation.
