5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|Chicken fingers: {{also known}} as chicken tenders or chicken strips, {{this is one of}} the most common forms of fried chicken, {{generally}} pieces of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> (sometimes with rib meat) cut into long strips, breaded or battered dipped, and deep fried.|$|E

40|$|The {{top surface}} of {{boneless}} skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> was inoculated with either Green Fluorescent Protein labeled Escherichia coli (E. coli-GFP) or rifampicin-resistant E. coli (E. coli-rif) {{and subjected to}} electrically-generated hydrodynamic shock wave treatment (HVADH). Cryostat sampling in concert with laser scanning confocal microscopy or plating onto antibiotic selective agar {{was used to determine}} if HVADH treatment resulted in the movement of the inoculated bacteria from the outer inoculated surface to the interior of intact boneless skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts.</b> In HVADH-treated boneless skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts,</b> marker bacteria were detected within the first 200 µm below the inoculated surface, 50 - 100 µm beyond the depth of untreated surface inoculated boneless skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts.</b> The exact depth in which the marker bacteria were found was dependent on the cryostat sampling distance used. This suggests that HVADH treatments affect the movement of surface bacteria...|$|R

5|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} run for {{the governorship}} in 1987, Brown resumed {{his career in the}} restaurant industry. He started the Chicken Grill restaurant in Louisville and helped his wife, Phyllis, launch Chicken By George, a line of boneless, skinless <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> products designed for sale in supermarkets and preparation at home. In 1988, Hormel made Chicken By George one of its subsidiaries. Brown expanded several other restaurants including Miami Subs, Texas Roadhouse, and Roadhouse Grill. None of these ventures matched the success he experienced early in his career.|$|E
5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

25|$|McChicken LT (McDonald's Chicken Lettuce and Tomato) was {{the chicken}} {{version of the}} McDLT {{featuring}} the same two-sided container as the McDLT except the packaging was yellow instead of white. It was introduced {{about the same time}} as the McDLT in the mid-1980s. The chicken was a grilled, unbreaded <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> placed on the heel of the bun in one of the compartments. The toppings were shredded lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise assembled on the top half of the bun in the other compartment. Cheese was an optional addition for an extra US$0.10. The grilled <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> was then basted with a brushing of melted butter. As with the McDLT, the consumer would finalize preparation of the sandwich by combining the hot and cool sides just prior to eating. The McChicken LT was discontinued in the Fall of 1987.|$|E

500|$|The {{derivative}} phrases [...] "country fried" [...] and [...] "chicken fried" [...] often {{refer to}} other foods prepared {{in the manner}} of fried chicken.

The fried products were analysed for coating adhesion, moisture content and yield parameters. Yield parameters measured were coating pickup, cooking loss and cooked yield. Coating adhesion {{was found to be}} highest in coating formed from the small particle size breading. Coating formed from the large particle size breading had the lowest coating adhesion. <b>Chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> coated using the small particle size breading showed significantly higher moisture content in the surface region of the chicken meat {{as well as in the}} coating.

Angelou has become truly herself and is no longer defined as someone's wife or mother. Scholar Wallis Tinnie calls this moment one of [...] "illusive transcendence" [...] and [...] "a scene of hope and completion". For {{the first time in many}} years, Angelou will be able to eat a <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> alone, something that is valued throughout her books.

500|$|Returning to the {{practice}} of targeting the adult demographic as it had in 1978, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003. The new products included new or revamped chicken sandwiches, a new salad line, and its BK Joe brand of coffee. The first of these items was the TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, an entirely new sandwich which featured a fried [...] whole-muscle <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> on a corn-dusted roll. The sandwich was part of then-CEO Greg Brenneman's plans to bolster the company's revived [...] "Have it your way" [...] advertising program, which was designed to draw younger people to its stores. Some items, including the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats, and the presence of trans-fats. At the time, many of the products featured higher-quality ingredients like whole <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> Angus beef, Cheddar cheese, and pepper jack cheese. Not all the products new products introduced under Blum's tenure met corporate sales expectations, the Baguette Chicken sandwiches being an example. Others products, such as Burger King's line of [...] "indulgent" [...] burgers originally called the Angus Burger, have undergone multiple reformulations. The Angus Steak burger was originally based around a [...] frozen patty; despite high expectations from the company, the sandwich fared poorly. After a reformulating program, it was relaunched in 2008 as the [...] Angus Steakhouse burger. With the introduction of a new multifunction broiler capable of cooking a more diverse set of products, Burger King replaced the Angus Steakhouse burger with the [...] Steakhouse XT burger in 2009. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice Burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.|$|E
