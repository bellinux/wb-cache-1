5|$|A <b>crowdsourcing</b> {{project called}} Condor Watch (CW) was started on April 14, 2014, {{hosted by the}} web portal Zooniverse. Volunteers are asked to examine motion-capture images of California condors {{associated}} with release sites managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society. The tasks on the website include identifying tagged condors and marking the distance to feeding sources such as animal carcasses. Biologists can then use this data to deduce which birds {{are at risk of}} lead poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{documented}} {{the lives of}} Day, Haggart, Hill and McDonnell as they attempted to write, record and release a charity single through <b>crowdsourcing.</b> The series was shown in real time, {{with each of the}} first ten episodes detailing the events of the previous seven days. On 5 September 2009, one week before the programme's first episode aired, the group announced on the YouTube channel ChartJackersProject their intention to release a number one single within their ten-week time frame. A different task would be undertaken each week, so that, {{by the end of the}} project, the song would be completed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crowdsourced</b> data, the {{collective}} messages from citizens through social media like Twitter® or Facebook®, have been increasingly {{recognized as a}} vital information source in a catastrophic disaster. Because there is often insufficient emergency personnel to gather situational information during a big disaster, the <b>crowdsourced</b> data can offer a supplemental means for data collection or dissemination immediately after the disaster. In addition, <b>crowdsourced</b> maps can empower citizens with their involvement. In the Haiti earthquake of 2010, <b>crowdsourced</b> data was first {{used to create a}} web map application to aid the humanitarian effort. With some success in Haiti, these <b>crowdsourced</b> maps have since been created for other disasters in many countries. However, although the <b>crowdsourced</b> map showed great potential, it also revealed a major shortcoming: most first responders did not use the <b>crowdsourced</b> map. This thesis addresses the issues associated with using <b>crowdsourced</b> maps in the responder community and seeks a possible solution for increasing utilization by first responders during catastrophic disasters. Citizen messages from the Japan earthquake of 2011 were analyzed and filtered by categories best suited for responders. Then, considering the technological difficulties experienced immediately following the disaster, the best communication means were explored to complete two-way communication between responders and citizens...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of O 2 O (online to offline) business, the {{existing}} logistics models cannot meet the demand of dealing with the random, decentralised orders with their high timeliness requirements. Therefore, the appearance of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics, such as the case project - JD <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics, is identified as a potential solution to meet such demand. When compared to traditional logistics models, <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics is quite different, which has led to various debates and worries about it. Exactly what the new business model looks like in reality, and how we should look at its future regarding its present situation is identified as an interesting topic by the researchers. Therefore, the purpose of this research is focussed on gaining a deep understanding of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics, as well as using the example of JD <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics to analyse whether there is a place for <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics and what the status of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics is in China. Based on that, the research objectives and questions were determined as: 1. Gaining a deep understanding of the concept of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics. 2. How is <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics currently implemented in China? 3. What are the prospects of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics in China? In order to find answers to these questions, a case study was identified as the best research method, and interviews were determined to be the main research strategy for the research. Not only was secondary data from previous research and other online sources of information collected for frame of reference, but primary data through an interview with Mr. Wang, the first product manager for JD <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics, was also gathered for the empirical study section. Further, both the PESTLE and SWOT models were pursued for the comprehensive analysis of the gathered data, so that the conclusion could be presented finality Following the guidance of scientific research, {{the reliability and validity of}} the research can be confirmed. As this research found, JD <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics made significant achievements during its one year of implementation. The value it brings are irreplaceable for O 2 O ii business at this current stage. But in the meantime, some risks associated with it are significant and hard to avoid. Depending on the current development situation, the future of <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics is full of opportunities and threat. Finally, some general recommendations are presented for potential participants in the <b>crowdsourced</b> logistics industry. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R

5|$|The British {{documentary}} series Chartjackers {{ran for a}} single season of eleven weekly episodes during the autumn of 2009. The series documents the lives of four teenage video bloggers—Alex Day, Johnny Haggart, Jimmy Hill and Charlie McDonnell—from the video-sharing website YouTube {{as they attempt to}} write, record and release a pop song by <b>crowdsourcing</b> through social media in ten weeks. When initially aired, the first ten episodes of Chartjackers, each five minutes in length, detailed the events of the previous seven days. The final episode, broadcast on 21 November 2009, compiled highlights from the previous ten weeks into one 30-minute episode, which was narrated by British DJ MistaJam. All eleven episodes were produced by Adam King and Jonathan Davenport of the production company Hat Trick Productions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Crowds {{of people}} can solve some {{problems}} faster than individuals or small groups. A crowd can also rapidly generate data about circumstances affecting the crowd itself. This <b>crowdsourced</b> data can be leveraged to benefit the crowd by providing information or solutions faster than traditional means. However, the <b>crowdsourced</b> data can hardly be used directly to yield usable information. Intelligently analyzing and processing <b>crowdsourced</b> information can help prepare data to maximize the usable information, thus returning the benefit to the crowd. This article highlights challenges and investigates opportunities associated with mining <b>crowdsourced</b> data to yield useful information, as well as details how <b>crowdsource</b> information and technologies {{can be used for}} response-coordination when needed, and finally suggests related areas for future research...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>crowdsource</b> testing and software testing outsourcing is that, in <b>crowdsource</b> testing, testers may belong to different workplaces. When outsourcing testing, the testers {{are from the}} same company or workplace {{that is responsible for}} outsourcing. In <b>crowdsource</b> testing, people voluntarily test software with the possibility of not being paid (if no bugs are discovered). Outsource testers always get paid for their work.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCycling volumes are {{necessary}} to understand what influences ridership and are essential for safety studies. Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged {{as a result of}} <b>crowdsourced</b> data from fitness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if <b>crowdsourced</b> data from fitness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava. com, we quantify how well <b>crowdsourced</b> fitness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between <b>crowdsourced</b> data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r 2 0. 40 to 0. 58) between <b>crowdsourced</b> data volumes and manual counts, with one <b>crowdsourced</b> data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, traffic speeds, on street parking, time of year, and <b>crowdsourced</b> ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62 %. <b>Crowdsourced</b> fitness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation. <b>Crowdsourced</b> fitness apps offer a new source of data for transportation planning and can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of official count programs...|$|R

40|$|The phenomenal {{success of}} certain <b>crowdsourced</b> online platforms, such as Wikipedia, is {{accredited}} {{to their ability}} to tap the crowd's potential to collaboratively build knowledge. While {{it is well known that}} the crowd's collective wisdom surpasses the cumulative individual expertise, little is understood on the dynamics of knowledge building in a <b>crowdsourced</b> environment. A proper understanding of the dynamics of knowledge building in a <b>crowdsourced</b> environment would enable one in the better designing of such environments to solicit knowledge from the crowd. Our experiment on <b>crowdsourced</b> systems based on annotations shows that an important reason for the rapid knowledge building in such environments is due to variance in expertise. First, we used as our test bed, a customized <b>Crowdsourced</b> Annotation System (CAS) which provides a group of users the facility to annotate a given document while trying to understand it. Our results showed the presence of different genres of proficiency amongst the users of an annotation system. We observed that the ecosystem in <b>crowdsourced</b> annotation system comprised of mainly four categories of contributors, namely: Probers, Solvers, Articulators and Explorers. We inferred from our experiment that the knowledge garnering mainly happens due to the synergetic interaction across these categories. Further, we conducted an analysis on the dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Overflow and noticed the ecosystem presence in these portals as well. From this study, we claim that the ecosystem is a universal characteristic of all <b>crowdsourced</b> portals. Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures, 7 table...|$|R
