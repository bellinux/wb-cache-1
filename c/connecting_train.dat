25|$|The fate of any {{possible}} resurgence in {{freight and passenger}} traffic on the tracks west of Kentville was sealed {{with the construction of}} final links in the all-weather Highway 101 between Kentville and Yarmouth in the mid to late 1980s; in addition, there were several large steel bridges on this section of the railroad that were nearing the end of their maintenance lifecycle, thus requiring major expenditures. By 1989, almost the only trains using this portion of the DAR were the Via RDCs, which were experiencing passenger declines due to recent highway expansion and competing bus services, as well as changes to Via <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> schedules. In the January 15, 1990, cuts to Via Rail by the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the RDC service between Halifax and Yarmouth was abolished.|$|E
500|$|The {{theft of}} cash and valuables, {{collected}} from the victims of gassing, was conducted by the higher-ranking SS men on an enormous scale. It was a common practice among the concentration camps' top echelon everywhere; two Majdanek concentration camp commandants, Koch and Florstedt, were tried and executed by the SS for the same offence in April 1945. When the top-ranking officers went home, they would sometimes request a private locomotive from Klinzman and Emmerich at the Treblinka station to transport their personal [...] "gifts" [...] to Małkinia for a <b>connecting</b> <b>train.</b> Then, they would drive out of the camp in cars without any incriminating evidence on their person, and later arrive at Małkinia to transfer the goods.|$|E

Originally a <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> from the main-line {{junction}} of Hamlet, North Carolina, to Atlanta, {{in the early}} 1920s it began operating as a through service from Washington to Birmingham. [...] It was renamed the Seaboard Express on April 12, 1903, later the Atlanta-Birmingham Special in 1911. [...] With the addition of air-conditioned cars on April 28, 1935, it was renamed the Robert E. Lee, and on May 18, 1947, the Cotton Blossom. [...] On April 24, 1955, the name was dropped, and it continued as a mail and express train until discontinued in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|Train Operating Companies {{may make}} special {{arrangements}} for disabled passengers, who have further exemptions {{on an individual}} case basis. This allows for different routes in certain situations, such as where normal practice is to walk between two nearby stations on different lines to catch a <b>connecting</b> <b>train,</b> which wheelchair users might find difficult. There are however no clear stated rules for defining what is [...] "reasonable" [...] for disabled peoplethis is presumably a matter of discretion. Some journeys must involve walks of up to 10 minutes in some cases between stations to make a connection (e.g. Farnborough (Main) to Farnborough North, Ash Vale to North Camp) ...|$|E
2500|$|Joint {{running with}} the Night Limited for the Tauramunui-Auckland leg was the pattern for the 1930s, with the service {{provided}} thrice weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. AB class steam locomotives were typical motive power at this stage, and a train from Hawera connected with the Express in Stratford. [...] At holiday times, the New Plymouth Night Express was run separately from the Night Limited due to large volumes of passengers, and as this service ran directly between New Plymouth and Auckland, it did not pass through Taumarunui, which is seven {{miles to the south}} of the junction in Okahukura; accordingly, a <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> ran between Taumarunui and Okahukura.|$|E

5000|$|To {{access the}} airport spur without {{crossing}} the Main Lines, trains {{in both directions}} use the flyover track originally built for Heathrow Express trains heading towards Paddington. This arrangement means Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> to the airport use the flyover {{in the opposite direction}} to normal operation, and trains from Heathrow must cross both slow lines on the flat. [...] As part of Crossrail works, a new flyover is being rebuilt to overcome these limitations. The new flyover will allow Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> returning from the airport, to reach the 'up' track (relief line towards London), without crossing the 'down' track (relief line towards Reading). [...] At present, Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> traveling towards the airport, may have to wait at Hayes & Harlington for either Heathrow Express or <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> to use the flyover returning from the airport.|$|R

2500|$|The {{line had}} a good safety record: {{there was only one}} {{reported}} accident on the line. On 1 September 1897 at Tooth's Bank, 2 miles north of Heathfield, the 08:18am service from Eastbourne was running around 4 minutes late and was trying to pick up time in order to meet a <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> at Groombridge. As the train entered the curve at around 40mph it left the tracks. Driver James McKinlay was killed and Fireman Lewis Minns seriously injured, whilst 30 passengers suffered minor injuries. At the subsequent inquiry, Lt. Col. G. W. Addison reported that the main cause of the accident was excessive speed as the driver was attempting to make up lost time {{in order to make a}} connection at [...] The track itself was in poor shape with many rotten sleepers and [...] "curves having irregular elevation" [...] which contributed to the accident. Following the inquiry, much of the track was relaid and the train scheduling was altered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, the {{independent}} service began operating thrice weekly year-round. [...] It departed Auckland at 7:50pm on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, made refreshment stops in Frankton and Taumarunui as NZR did not operate dining cars {{at this point}} in history, and arrived in New Plymouth at 7:19am the next morning. [...] The opposite working left New Plymouth at 7:08pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, made the same refreshment stops, and arrived in Auckland at 6:30am the next morning. [...] Operating through to Taumarunui removed the need for a <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> between Taumarunui and Okahukura, but it did mean the front of the train {{at the start of the}} journey became the back for the second leg and the seats were reversed. [...] Sleeping car facilities were removed in 1944 due to restrictions caused by World War II, and by 1950, the train ran only twice weekly due to coal shortages. At this stage, J class locomotives had become the primary motive power and the train typically comprised two first class carriages, three second class carriages, and a guard's van.|$|E

The old Squire seemed anxious to be alone, and he restlessly escaped from Marcia's care. He sat all the first day apart, chewing upon some fragment of wood that he had picked up, and now and then putting up a lank hand to rasp his bristling jaw; glancing furtively at people who passed him, and lapsing into his ruminant abstraction. He had been vexed {{that they did not}} start the night before; and every halt the train made visibly afflicted him. He would not leave his place to get anything to eat when they stopped for refreshment, though he hungrily devoured the lunch that Marcia brought into the car for him. At New York he was in a tumult of fear lest they should lose the <b>connecting</b> <b>train</b> on the Pennsylvania Road; and the sigh of relief with which he sank into his seat in the sleeping-car expressed the suffering he had undergone. He said he was not tired, but he went to bed early, as if to sleep away as much of the time as he could.|$|E

[...] She touched the bell again, and when the man appeared, [...] "My sleigh at once, James," [...] she commanded. [...] "I will drive you home, Mr. Wade, {{on my way to the}} station. Of course I shall not leave anything in doubt about this silly scare. I fancy it will be no great difficulty to find out where father is. Where is that railroad guide? Probably my father took it up to his room." [...] She ran upstairs and came down with the book in her hand. [...] "Now we will see. I don't believe he could get any train at Springfield, where he would have to change for the Mills, that would take him beyond the Junction at that hour last night.
