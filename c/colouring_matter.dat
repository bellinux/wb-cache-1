Partly in conjunction with the late Prof J J Hummel he investigated Chay Root, Rubia Sikkimensis, and other similar plants, and succeeded in isolating and clearly proving the constitution of the Anthracene derivatives which they contain. His researches on Mang-kondu, Ventilago madraspatana , and many other plants largely used in India, Java, and elsewhere, on account of their valuable dyeing properties, have not only made us acquainted with the dyeing principles contained in these plants, but their chemical investigation has, in nearly all cases, led to a clear conception of their constitution. During the course of his researches on luteolin, morin, apinin, quercitin, and other flavone compounds, he discovered and investigated curious compounds which such dyestuffs forms with acids. This work has afforded a valuable means of determining the molecular weight of such substances. In another paper he has described a new behaviour of <b>colouring</b> <b>matters,</b> which consists in their forming crystalline potassium salts when treated with potassium acetate. As only <b>colouring</b> <b>matters</b> which contain two hydroxyls relatively in the other position show this behaviour, the test affords further means of determining constitution.

30|$|The {{bleaching}} process is applied after degumming and neutralization in the chemical refining {{and it is}} more appropriately referred to as adsorption treatment. Crude edible oil still contains undesirable substances such as FFA, gummy materials and <b>colouring</b> <b>matters.</b> <b>Colouring</b> <b>matters</b> are due {{to the presence of}} pigments in the crude edible oil. These pigments are carotenoids, chlorophyll, gossypol and related compounds. These impurities from crude oils are removed by using the materials with a strong adsorption power. The usual method of bleaching is the adsorption of the colouring substances on an adsorbent material. Refiners have a wide choice of adsorbents for using and their main criteria are cost and performance of the adsorbent materials. Examples of bleaching agents are natural bleaching earth, acid-activated bleaching earth, synthetic silicates, synthetic resins and activated carbons. Bleaching agents normally possess a large surface that has a more or less specific affinity for pigment-type molecules, thus removing them from oil without damaging the oil itself. Acid-activated bleaching earth is sometimes called bentonite; it is the adsorbent material that has been used most extensively. This substance consists primarily of hydrated aluminium silicate. Usually, bleaching earth does not remove all the colour-producing materials; the majority of them are actually removed by thermal destruction during the deodorization process. Anhydrous silica gel and activated carbon are also used as bleaching adsorbents [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].|$|R

60|$|With {{birds and}} many other animals, it seems to follow from the {{comparison}} of allied species that circular spots are often generated by the breaking up and contraction of stripes. In the Tragopan pheasant faint white lines in the female represent the beautiful white spots in the male (49. Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. iii. p. 517.); and something {{of the same kind}} may be observed in the two sexes of the Argus pheasant. However this may be, appearances strongly favour the belief that on the one hand, a dark spot is often formed by the <b>colouring</b> <b>matter</b> being drawn towards a central point from a surrounding zone, which latter is thus rendered lighter; and, on the other hand, that a white spot is often formed by the colour being driven away from a central point, so that it accumulates in a surrounding darker zone. In either case an ocellus is the result. The <b>colouring</b> <b>matter</b> seems to be a nearly constant quantity, but is redistributed, either centripetally or centrifugally. The feathers of the common guinea-fowl offer a good instance of white spots surrounded by darker zones; and wherever the white spots are large and stand near each other, the surrounding dark zones become confluent. In the same wing-feather of the Argus pheasant dark spots may be seen surrounded by a pale zone, and white spots by a dark zone. Thus the formation of an ocellus in its most elementary state appears to be a simple affair. By what further steps the more complex ocelli, which are surrounded by many successive zones of colour, have been generated, I will not pretend to say. But the zoned feathers of the mongrels from differently coloured fowls, and the extraordinary variability of the ocelli on many Lepidoptera, lead us to conclude that their formation is not a complex process, but depends on some slight and graduated change {{in the nature of the}} adjoining tissues.|$|E

The typical plant is, on whole, passive and synthetic, or anabolic; the typical animal, active and katabolic; and the excess of kataboly over anaboly in the animal is compensated for by the anabolic work stored up, as it were, by the plant, which is, directly or indirectly, the animal's food.|$|E
