500|$|Pickett made a {{colorful}} general. He rode a sleek black charger named [...] "Old Black," [...] {{and wore a}} small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was {{the talk of the}} Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Eliot. Adam Bede, [...] Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1859. Reprinted, e.g., {{edited by}} Carol A. Martin, page 445. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. (When Adam was reading his Bible, “Sometimes [...] [...] [...] his eyebrows would be raised, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> would quiver {{a little with}} sad sympathy — something, perhaps old Isaac’s meeting with his son, touched him closely [...] [...] [...] [...]”).|$|E
60|$|He {{wrinkled}} his forehead, {{and drew}} in the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|The workman {{replaced}} the pipe in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and nodded deliberately.|$|R
60|$|The sage sedately smiled, a queer incredulity just {{lurking in}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{regarded}} me for {{my opinion}} very earnestly, with his pipe in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rochester {{looked down}} at her. The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> slowly unbent.|$|E
60|$|The long-nosed man did so, {{and drew}} down the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> twitched in {{the attempt}} to repress a smile.|$|E
60|$|His {{voice was}} {{slightly}} husky and strained, and a nervous twitch in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> followed speech.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} murmur of sympathy. Ralph Conyers, however, his cigar in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> smiled imperturbably.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} a little abruptly. Huntley's unsympathetic face, with the big cigar in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> choked the flow <b>of</b> <b>his</b> words.|$|R
60|$|Farrar {{pulled down}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> with trying not to smile.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he shrugged}} his {{shoulders}} and pulled down the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|At this Mr Brandon {{raised his}} eyebrows, {{and lowered the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lapham slowly {{shut his}} eyes and slowly dropped his head for assent, letting out a white volume of smoke from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|The cobbler put {{his pipe}} in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> while he smiled, and then {{brought it back}} to its old place again; but said nothing.|$|R
60|$|McGinty {{took his}} eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and {{proceeded}} to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook.|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{shook his}} head. The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> tightened. He spoke with grave seriousness.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{frowned and}} {{nodded his head}} slowly with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> drawn in.|$|E
60|$|Flower {{stood in}} amaze, pondering the situation, and a grin slowly broke the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he remarked, {{removing}} his cigar to the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{in order to}} facilitate conversation, [...] "this old city of yours don't change any." ...|$|R
60|$|He left Bert on his wall, {{grave and}} pensive, with his {{cap on the}} back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, and a {{cigarette}} smouldering in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Coulson {{moved his}} cigar into a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{as though to}} obtain a clear view <b>of</b> <b>his</b> questioner's face. His {{expression}} was one of bland interest.|$|R
60|$|His uncle {{looked through}} {{him with his}} keen, half-suffering glance, and up went the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gorman promised, and a {{very slight}} but {{peculiar}} smile turned up the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> as he did so.|$|E
60|$|The shot told. Percy colored to {{the roots}} of his reddish hair, and drew down the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{leaned back}} in his padded chair, his hands folded in front <b>of</b> him, <b>his</b> cigar in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Arnold {{smoothed}} the paper out and read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fifty dollars reward, for {{my fellow}} Edward. He has {{a scar on}} the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> two cuts on and under his arm, and the letter E on his arm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} other, in a drawling manner, {{for he was}} fixing a very small patch of {{sticking}} plaster on a very small pimple near the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> 'What else?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Swithin Forsyte lay in bed. The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{under his}} white {{moustache}} drooped towards his double chin. He panted: ...|$|E
60|$|He put {{his head}} on one side, pulled down the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{and looked at her}} over his glasses.|$|E
60|$|He looked anxiously {{into his}} mate's face, and felt {{relieved}} {{to observe a}} little smile curl slightly the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said George, {{trying a}} sort of vocal chip-shot out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{designed}} to lift his voice backwards and lay it dead inside the cab.|$|R
50|$|Yan {{rips the}} mask off Shu Nian’s face {{and sees the}} thick {{vertical}} scar that runs down from his eye to the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{on the right side}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
60|$|For several minutes, {{although}} he looked me {{full in the}} face, he said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> he condescended to speak.|$|R
