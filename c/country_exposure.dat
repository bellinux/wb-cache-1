40|$|Global equity {{management}} {{has historically been}} structured primarily around country asset allocation. This approach {{was supported by the}} usual observation that the country factor is the major source of influence on stock price behavior and that the correlation between equity and currency is close to zero and unstable, so <b>country</b> <b>exposure</b> matches currency exposure. This logic breaks down in a world where companies work and compete on a global basis and are recognized as such by investors in their pricing of securities. As corporations expand and diversify their international activities, the relative importance of domestic factors for such corporations should decline. If a corporation is regarded as a portfolio of international activities, its stock price should be influenced by international factors in relation to the geographical breakdown of its activities. Similarly, the currency exposure should be influenced by the geographical distribution of the firm's activities, rather than by the domicile of incorporation or by the location where the stock is mainly traded. Under integrated or “global pricing” the marketplace would reflect the value and changes to value of the foreign activities of the firm.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we disentangle, {{analytically}} and empirically, {{the roles of}} the unit-exposure restriction in Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994). We show that if the purpose is to construct factors, the unit-exposure variance-analysis model can be viewed as just an algorithm that does not really assume a return-generating process; and in practice the effect of relaxing the restriction is immaterial. The restriction is more important if one wants to estimate whether, for a typical stock, the country factor generates more variance than the sector factor: exposure estimation becomes more important (i) the further the average exposures are from unity; or (ii) the higher the dispersion of the exposures. With respect to (i), the more important the corrections for sector (or geographical) structure in country (or sector) factors are, the more the average exposure falls below unity. Thus, the average exposure provides an alternative indicator of the importance of country versus sector effects. We empirically find that the average sector exposure is low (0. 3) compared to the average <b>country</b> <b>exposure</b> (0. 9). With respect to (ii) we correct the dispersion of exposures for estimation error in the exposures. We find that in our sample these estimation error corrections are more important for sector factors than for country factors, and that country factors are generating far more variance, in a typical stock's return, than do sector factors. © 2010 Elsevier B.

The study is initiated by the discrepancies found in recent research projects against the current design wind loading provisions for such roofs. Five building models with roof angles of 10 ∘, 15 ∘, 20 ∘, 25 ∘ and 30 ∘ equipped with an interchangeable roof slope panel have been tested in a typical open <b>country</b> <b>exposure</b> in the boundary layer wind tunnel of the Centre for Building Studies at Concordia University. The experimental settings satisfy the corresponding wind tunnel simulation criteria specified in the wind load test standards of American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|The present {{wind tunnel}} study {{examines}} the suitability of the current wind provisions in wind codes and standards {{for the design of}} roof zones of flat-roofed low-rise buildings with large dimensions. Current wind codes and standards have load provisions dealing with low buildings of common configurations. Large buildings, say 100 m long, have not been considered when these provisions were established. As a result, the interaction between wind and buildings of such geometries should be investigated for the assessment of current wind provisions in terms of their applicability to such configurations. Nine large low-rise buildings of 5, 7. 5 and 10 m high with flat roofs have been tested in a typical open <b>country</b> <b>exposure</b> in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel of Concordia University. The models have been tested for wind directions ranging from 0 ° to 90 ° at increments of 15 °. The buildings have large square plan with equivalent full-scale horizontal dimensions ranging from 60 to 180 m. Local roof pressure coefficients have been obtained from the wind tunnel measurements. Moreover, area-averaged negative peak pressure coefficients have been established using numerical integration of individual pressure coefficients. The effects of building dimensions on the generated roof pressures have been addressed in this study. This thesis presents a comparative study based on code provisions and experimental results. The first part compares the application of the current code roof zone systems and the design wind pressures specified in codes and standards. The second part of the study compares the experimental results with the respective values specified in code/standard provisions in terms of wind pressures and roof zone sizes to assess the suitability of these provisions. These comparisons show significant differences in the patterns of the design pressure coefficients among the current wind codes and standards. Application of the current provisions of ASCE 7 - 10 and NBCC 2010 on building geometries of large roofs and low height may lead to considerably conservative and uneconomic roof design. An exception for very long low buildings, as far as the determination of the sizes of roof edge and corner zones is concerned, has been recommended to rectify the deficiency of wind codes and standards for these building geometries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{comprehensively}} examines in {{four key}} empirical chapters, if and how traits {{of the top}} management teams (TMTs) affect cross-border acquisition choices as well as consequential outcomes {{from the perspective of}} acquiring firms. Three aspects of the TMTs which are particularly relevant to these types of deals have been considered: their international experience, host country knowledge and national diversity. These TMT characteristics, has been termed as ‘international orientation’ here. The underlying premise of this thesis is that information asymmetry prevalent in these complex decisions are likely to be mitigated if and only if these specially-endowed TMTs are optimally orientated. A comprehensive dataset of listed cross-border acquirers from the United Kingdom from 1999 - 2008 with their TMT characteristics has been used here with a variety of methodologies and modelling techniques, including short and longer window event study methods, multilevel modelling, etc. The first and second chapters explores the consequences of the decision-making process by the TMTs, as the returns to these bidder firms; while the third chapter looks at one of the key elements of the process itself in terms of payment mode choices by bidder TMTs. The final chapter investigates whether the moderating role these internationally oriented TMTs play, is recognised in the investors’ reaction to frequent cross-country acquisition announcements. The first chapter examined the short-term wealth effects of international orientation of TMTs, focusing on when it may (not) improve performance due to internationalization decisions, synthesising the views expressed in prior research. Although not robust, a negative effect of international experience on abnormal returns in line with the hubris hypothesis was observed. Further, some discernible benefits from national diversity or country-specific experience in TMTs in consonance with the view of TMT ‘international orientation’ as a valuable resource were also detected. However, additional analyses revealed that performance benefits may only accrue to the most experienced TMTs and may be detrimental if too many of TMT members have same host <b>country</b> <b>exposure.</b> Generally, the acquirer announcement performance seemed to be affected by TMT orientation in opposite ways with different TMT proxies. The second chapter extended the investigation to both financial and operating performance for a one-year post-acquisition period to delve deeper into the effects of having globally-oriented TMTs in acquirer boards, motivated by lack of consensus on two counts. First, as to whether acquirers create or destroy wealth as far as the longer term outcomes are concerned; second, in respect of whether the TMTs of these firms act competently or take inefficient decisions on international expansions. The ‘international orientation’ of acquirer executives from two angles, i. e. their international experience and national diversity amongst them were examined. The findings presented strong evidence of curvilinear relationships of the chosen TMT proxies, although, in this case too, the effects observed were opposite for the different proxies. In particular, inadequate international knowledge of the team members at initial levels were likely to generate unfavourable outcomes, which could transform favourably at higher levels after a cut-off point. An opposite curvilinear relationship between the TMT proxy of foreigners’ presence and such performance was observed, however. The third chapter looked at the decision-making role of internationally-orientated TMTs of acquiring firms so as to whether and how such TMTs may(not) influence the preferred mode of payment, mitigating information asymmetry with a level of high uncertainty and complexity in deals involving international targets. In consonance with the findings of the previous chapters, non-linear effects of TMT ‘international orientation’ on the possibilities of making an appropriate choice of method of payment in cross-border transactions were proposed and tested. It was revealed that only the most experienced TMTs and/or executive-teams with a greater diverse mix of nationalities were more likely to opt for pure cash or a mixed payment mode as against pure stock exchange, amidst high environmental uncertainties, often prevalent in decisions relating to expansion abroad. Specifically, internationally-oriented TMTs seem to be positioned to act more competently after surpassing a threshold of this orientation, thereby mitigating environmental uncertainties under extreme country risk and cultural distance. These findings shed new light on alleviation of information asymmetry in cross-border payment mode decisions, hitherto studied from the perspective of returns to acquirers in the domestic context. The final core chapter concentrated solely on short-term value creation serial acquirers in cross-border deals as against in extant literature where mostly these firms are studied with one-time acquirers. Taking a more comprehensive view of earlier research, in this study the potential role of previously identified factors affecting their short-run returns against the backdrop of ‘international orientation’ of their top managerial teams (TMTs) is demystified. In other words, which of the forecasted effects, i. e. learning or post-acquisition integration issues, predominate, when TMTs of such firms have either international experience or host country familiarity or mix of diverse nationalities were analysed. Testing for the non-linear moderating influence of TMT orientation, the negative influence of indigestion, as an outcome of both frequent acquisitions and higher transaction values, cumulated over a prior three-year event window was documented. Nevertheless, this detrimental impact was likely to be mitigated at higher levels of international experience of acquirer executives. However, the findings failed to substantiate either the postulated benefits of ‘organizational learning’ or any moderating impact of TMT orientation thereon. These empirical results highlighted that when the hypothesized notion of indigestion effects outweighed that of learning for these serial bidders, moderating benefit of their internationally oriented TMTs is non-linear. This implied that beyond a cut-off point, more of these TMTs seem to mitigate either acquisition-indigestion or the memory-lapse, although the latter effect is not robust. Overall, the findings from the core chapters indicated that international orientation of bidder TMTs are beneficial after an optimal point, in respect of improved decision-making, favourable longer terms returns and finally, moderating the detriments of multiple acquisitions.

The low overall {{access to health care}} has been documented to contribute to the high diabetes-related mortality. Due to economic, demographic, epidemiological and nutrition transitions in SSA, the growing prevalence of diabetes appears to be related to obesogenic lifestyles and the intergenerational impact of malnutrition in women of childbearing age.

40|$|We {{explore the}} role of {{inflation}} credibility in self-fulfilling debt crises. In particular, we propose a continuous time model of nominal debt {{with the potential for}} selffulfilling debt crises as in Calvo (1988) and Cole and Kehoe (2000). We characterize crisis equilibria conditional on the level of commitment to low inflation. With strong commitment, which can be interpreted as joining a monetary union or issuing foreign currency debt, the environment is a version of the one studied by Cole and Kehoe. The paper contrasts this framework with one in which sovereign debt is nominal and is vulnerable to ex post devaluation. Inflation is costly, but reduces the real value of outstanding debt without the full punishment of default. In a debt crisis, a government may opt to inflate away a fraction of the real debt burden rather than explicitly default. This flexibility potentially reduces the <b>country’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to self-fulfilling crises. On the other hand, the government lacks commitment not to inflate in the absence of crisis. This latter channel raises the cost of debt in tranquil periods and makes default more attractive {{in the event of a}} crisis, increasing the country’s vulnerability. We characterize the interaction of these two forces. We show that there is an intermediate level of commitment that minimizes the <b>country’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to rollover risk. On the other hand, low inflation credibility brings the worst of both worlds – high inflation in tranquil periods and increased vulnerability to a crisis. Weak inflationary commitment also reduces the country’s equilibrium borrowing limit. These latter results shed light on the notions of original sin and debt intolerance highlighted in the empirical literature; that is, the fact that developing economies issue debt exclusive in foreign currency to international investors as well as encounter solvency issues at relatively low ratios of debt-to-GDP.
