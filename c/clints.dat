50|$|Conditions for {{limestone}} pavements are created when an advancing glacier scrapes away overburden and exposes horizontally bedded limestone, with subsequent glacial retreat {{leaving behind a}} flat, bare surface. Limestone is slightly soluble in water and especially in acid rain, so corrosive drainage along joints and cracks in the limestone can produce slabs called <b>clints</b> isolated by deep fissures called grikes or grykes (terms derived from a northern English dialect). If the grykes are fairly straight and the <b>clints</b> are uniform in size, the resemblance to man-made paving stones is striking, but often they are less regular. Limestone pavements that develop beneath a mantle of topsoil usually exhibit more rounded forms.|$|E
50|$|Wholesaling was {{commenced}} {{to increase}} purchasing power and credibility overseas. The continuing growth of <b>Clints</b> and similar chains {{in other states}} brought about fanatic import volume increases. From 100 containers in 1987 to over 3000 in 1995.

His plan was foiled when Kay's son Brock Reynolds and lawyer Mitchell Sherman revealed their plot and saved Kay and Esther's lives. <b>Clint</b> went to prison after Marge decided to help out Kay. <b>Clint</b> escaped a few months later and Kay nearly attacked him when he showed up on her doorstep, but she was stopped by Gina who declared she still had feelings for <b>Clint.</b> Realizing Kay was upset over her encounter with <b>Clint,</b> Brock decided to talk some sense into Gina.

While Gina was begging <b>Clint</b> not to turn himself in, Brock was attacked by an armed robber. <b>Clint</b> arrived on the scene, {{but it was too late}} to stop the robber from shooting Brock. Although <b>Clint</b> wanted to help Brock, <b>Clint</b> decided to make a run for it. Kay later assumed <b>Clint</b> was responsible for Brock's shooting.

Gina was mortified when <b>Clint</b> admitted he called the police. <b>Clint</b> was taken back to prison.|$|R

40|$|Epidermal hyperproliferation and {{inflammation}} are {{hallmarks of}} the human condition psoriasis. Here, we report that a zebrafish line with a mutation in the cargo adaptor protein <b>Clint</b> 1 exhibits psoriasis-like phenotypes including epithelial hyperproliferation and leukocyte infiltration. <b>Clint</b> 1 is an ENTH domain-containing protein that binds SNARE proteins and functions in vesicle trafficking; however, its in vivo function in animal models has not been reported to date. The <b>clint</b> 1 mutants exhibit chronic inflammation characterized by increased Interleukin 1 Î² expression, leukocyte infiltration, bidirectional trafficking and phagocytosis of cellular debris. The defects in <b>clint</b> 1 mutants can be rescued by expression of zebrafish <b>clint</b> 1 and can be phenocopied with <b>clint</b> 1 specific morpholinos, supporting an essential role for <b>Clint</b> 1 in epidermal development. Interaction studies suggest that <b>Clint</b> 1 and Lethal giant larvae 2 function synergistically to regulate epidermal homeostasis. Accordingly, <b>clint</b> 1 mutants show impaired hemidesmosome formation, loss of cell-cell contacts and increased motility suggestive of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our findings describe a novel function for the ENTH domain protein <b>Clint</b> 1 in epidermal development and inflammation and suggest that its deficiency in zebrafish generates a phenotype that resembles the human condition psoriasis...|$|R
