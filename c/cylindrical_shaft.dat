The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft,</b> decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

25|$|The strong taper of the shepherd's hook eases the {{production}} of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time. Early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops. The design with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft</b> that is commonplace today was largely reserved for tambour-style steel needles. Both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared {{toward the end of}} the 19th century, including both tapered and cylindrical segments, and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until World War II.|$|E
60|$|It may perhaps appear, also, {{that this}} {{arrangement}} of the materials in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> at all would hardly have suggested itself to a people who possessed no large blocks out of which to hew them; and that the shaft built of many pieces is probably derived from, and imitative of the shaft hewn from few or from one.|$|R

In {{every one}} of the {{buildings}} above mentioned, except the Rio-Foscari House (which has only one great entrance between its wings), the central arcades are sustained, at least in one story, and generally in both, on bold detached <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts,</b> with rich capitals, while the arches of the wings are carried on smaller shafts assisted by portions of wall, which become pilasters of greater or less width.|$|R
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk {{he realized it was}} a perfectly <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft.</b> At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands of}} tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
2500|$|... two roughly spoon-shaped blades {{at either}} end of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft.</b> This paddle style was {{developed}} for fast acceleration and sudden maneuvering in Whitewater kayaking, and then back-ported to sea-kayaking. Euro [...] paddles can be made of aluminum, plastic or even wood, but the best are usually formed of more expensive materials like carbon-fiber for lightness. Often the two blades are feathered, or set at an angle relative to each other (both for ergonomic efficiency, and so that as one blade moves backwards through the water, the opposite blade moving forward through the air presents its edge, rather than its face). This does make it less efficient with the wind on the side or behind.|$|E

We {{have seen}} in the last Chapter how, in {{converting}} the wall into the square or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft,</b> we parted at every change of form with some quantity of material. In proportion to the quantity thus surrendered, is the necessity that what we retain should be good of its kind, and well set together, since everything now depends on it.|$|E
50|$|Cahuachi’s {{architecture}} and its organization {{are characteristic of}} a ceremonial center, and is not urban (Silverman 1986: 186). At Cahuachi, there are mound and room constructions, a structure called the “Great Temple”, walls that form corridors and passageways, as well as major walls, circular depressions, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> on top of mounds, and kanchas. Kanchas are the bounded open spaces beneath and between mounds and {{can be defined as}} a walled field or patio area that does not necessarily insinuate any specific function. The following analyses are largely based on Strong’s excavations and Silverman’s survey and reanalysis of the site.|$|R
50|$|Burials at Cahuachi vary {{in content}} and effort. Burial {{excavations}} at Cahuachi {{were carried out}} by Strong, Kroeber, Doering, Farabee, Orefici, and Silverman. Types of graves include some human remains crudely buried in shallow graves, while others are in somewhat more complex, underground tombs. Almost all of the tombs at Cahuachi have wooden cane roofs covered by huarngo logs. The huarango plant, {{it is important to}} recall, has ancestral connotations and symbolism in the region surrounding Cahuachi. These tombs were also found with grave markers, which were upright canes, sticking out of the ground from the roof of the tomb. Other types of graves include <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts,</b> or large vessel urns. The most abundant grave goods are Nasca pottery.|$|R

60|$|Bradley's {{ingenuity}} {{had come}} up against a stone wall. There seemed no possibility of escape. He looked about him. They were {{in a small room}} where lay a litter of rubbish--torn bits of cloth, old hides, pieces of fiber rope. In {{the center of the room}} was a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft</b> with an opening in its face. Bradley knew it for what it was. Here the arch-fiend dragged his victims and cast their bodies into the river of death far below. The floor about the opening in the shaft and the sides of the shaft were clotted thick with a dried, dark brown substance that the Englishman knew had once been blood. The place had the appearance of having been a veritable shambles. An odor of decaying flesh permeated the air.|$|E
60|$|Those of {{the earlier}} times were, in the {{plurality}} of instances, composed of alternate square and cylindrical shafts, variously associated and proportioned. Where concave cuttings occur, as in the beautiful west doors of Bayeux, they are between cylindrical shafts, which they throw out into broad light. The eye in all cases dwells on broad surfaces, and commonly upon few. In course of time, a low ridgy process is seen emerging along {{the outer edge of}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft,</b> forming a line of light upon it and destroying its gradation. Hardly traceable at first (as on the alternate rolls of the north door of Rouen), it grows and pushes out as gradually as a stag's horns: sharp at first on the edge; but, becoming prominent, it receives a truncation, and becomes a definite fillet on the face of the roll. Not yet to be checked, it pushes forward until the roll itself becomes subordinate to it, and is finally lost in a slight swell upon its sides, while the concavities have all the time been deepening and enlarging behind it, until, from a succession of square or cylindrical masses, the whole moulding has become a series of concavities edged by delicate fillets, upon which (sharp lines of light, observe) the eye exclusively rests. While this has been taking place, a similar, though less total, change has affected the flowerwork itself. In Plate I. fig. 2 (a), I have given two from the transepts of Rouen. It will be observed how absolutely the eye rests on the forms of the leaves, and on the three berries in the angle, being in light exactly what the trefoil is in darkness. These mouldings nearly adhere to the stone; and are very slightly, though sharply, undercut. In process of time, the attention of the architect, instead of resting on the leaves, went to the stalks. These latter were elongated (b, from the south door of St. Lo); and to exhibit them better, the deep concavity was cut behind, so as to throw them out in lines of light. The system was carried out into continually increasing intricacy, until, in the transepts of Beauvais, we have brackets and flamboyant traceries, composed of twigs without any leaves at all. This, however, is a partial, though a sufficiently characteristic, caprice, the leaf being never generally banished, and in the mouldings round those same doors, beautifully managed, but itself rendered liny by bold marking of its ribs and veins, and by turning up, and crisping its edges, large intermediate spaces being always left to be occupied by intertwining stems (c, from Caudebec). The trefoil of light formed by berries or acorns, though diminished in value, was never lost up to the last period of living Gothic.|$|E

40|$|An {{extension}} of current methodologies is introduced for optimization of graded microstructure subject to local stress criteria. The method {{is based on}} new multiscale stress criteria given by macrostress modulation functions. The modulation functions quantify the intensity of local stress fluctuations at {{the scale of the}} microstructure due to the imposed macroscopic stress. The methodology is illustrated for long <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> reinforced with stiff cylindrical elastic fibers with generators parallel to the shaft. Examples are presented for shaft cross sections that possess reentrant corners typically seen in lap joints and junctions of struts. It is shown that the computational methodology delivers graded fiber microgeometries that provide overall structural rigidity {{while at the same time}} tempering the influence of stress concentrations near reentrant corners...|$|R
50|$|The minar {{made with}} {{numerous}} superimposed flanged and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> in the interior, and fluted columns on the exterior, {{which have a}} 40 cm thick veneer of red and buff coloured sandstone; all surrounded by bands of intricate carving in Kufic style of Islamic calligraphy, giving the minar the appearance of bundled reeds. It stands just outside the Quwwatul mosque, and an Arabic inscription suggests {{that it might have}} been built to serve as a place for the muezzin, to call the faithfuls for namaz. Also marking a progression in era, is the appearance of inscriptions in a bold and cursive Thuluth script of calligraphy on the Qutb Minar, distinguished by strokes that thicken on the top, as compared to Kufic in earlier part of the construction.|$|R
50|$|Touristic {{visitors}} {{often have}} perceived the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> with the thicker top as depictions of male phalli. This {{gave rise to}} popular guesses about pre-Islamic fertility cults as background to such perceived depictions. Consequently, the rounded type 2 stones were attributed to female forms and graves. Such descriptions have added to {{the popularity of the}} site for visitors from distant parts of Iran. The cemetery according to legend contains stones of people who were cursed by god for their sins and belonged to people who believed in fetishism centuries ago. The tomb is a religious pilgrimage place where women pray seeking boons for their welfare, by way of tying ribbons in closeby trees. The isolated cemetery has become popular tourist attraction in Iran and a source of amusement amongst visitors.|$|R

40|$|Construction {{should be}} {{taking into account the}} {{influence}} of time factor on the stability of the structures. In the paper hereditary creep and homogenization theories are used to determine stresses in the layered elastic creeping array with a vertical shaft. Volterra correspondence principle was applied. As a result, the reduction of a time-dependent elastic creeping problem to a corresponding elastic problem became possible. The method proposes a way to determine average (effective) elastic creeping properties and homogenized stress field from known properties of the layers’ components. Creep kernels are of a convolution type and are taken in the exponential form. The problem of heterogeneous elastic creeping environment is reduced to a problem of homogeneous transversely isotropic medium. Different boundary conditions on the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shaft’s</b> surface were considered. An analytical solution was obtained. These explicit expressions can be useful for the necessary calculations in the construction practice...|$|R

40|$|Cracking of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> is an {{important}} area for research, since the changes observed in their vibration characteristics even during large-sized cracking are much smaller than those observed for rectangular beams; hence early identification of crack existence becomes essential to prevent sudden failures in rotating shafts. In this paper experimental and numerical investigations are carried out to identify {{the presence of a}} crack in a <b>cylindrical</b> overhanging <b>shaft</b> with a propeller at the free end. In the experimental study, cracks of different depths are located at the (un-cracked) maximum bending moment position. Shaft response parameters for lateral (using an accelerometer) and torsional vibrations (using shear strain gages fixed at three different locations) are obtained using the modal analysis software, LMS Test Lab TM. The experimental results are used to validate the numerical results obtained using the three-dimensional isoperimetric elements available in the ANSYS FEM program; the open crack is embedded in the shaft and the mesh generation is suitably modified to incorporate the stress intensity effects present at the crack tip. The results indicate that the use of the rate of change of frequencies, modal amplitudes (of displacements, velocities and accelerations) as a function of crack depth ratio will indicate the presence of crack in the shaft from a crack depth ratio of 0. 2. Also the use of the rate of change of torsional frequency will indicate the presence of a crack in the shaft from the initiation of the crack. The approach indicated in this paper will provide a sound and robust procedure for a first level of damage assessment by using vibration techniques...|$|R

The aim of the study is to investigate the optimization of processing parameters in order to enhance the surface micro-finish and geometrical accuracy of the recovered functional surfaces made of SS 316 material using a newly developed electrochemical honing (ECH) machine. ECH is a prominent hybrid machining process, which is widely used for precision finishing of intricate shapes and hard materials with an efficient and effective manner. In this work, discarded functional surface of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shafts</b> is recovered using twin wire arc (TWA) technique and its surface topography was studied using developed micro-finish machine. The results show that the ECH of recovered surfaces gives a glazed texture and produce an average surface roughness of 0. 347 3 ̆bcm with the processing time of 90 s. The monitored outputs such as surface roughness (average, Ra and maximum, Rt) and geometrical accuracy such as out-of-roundness (OR) was measured during the investigation to optimized the process performance characteristics...|$|R
