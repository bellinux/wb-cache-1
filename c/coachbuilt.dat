25|$|As was {{the custom}} among the luxury car brands, only the chassis and engine were displayed, since the {{interior}} and body of the car would be <b>coachbuilt</b> to the owner's specifications. The chassis on most Model Js were the same, as was the styling of such elements as fenders, headlamps, radiator, hood and instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|Rolls-Royce {{was persuaded}} to {{re-enter}} the high-end luxury market {{and built the}} straight-eight Phantom IV solely for royalty, heads of state, and their chairman. Former Daimler customers, including British royals and the Aga Khan, switched to the Phantom IV, while the Emperor of Ethiopia and the King and Queen of Greece ordered <b>coachbuilt</b> six-cylinder Silver Wraiths.|$|E
25|$|The Daimler Majestic DF316/7 and DF318/9 luxury saloon was {{launched}} by the Daimler Company of Coventry in July 1958 and was in production until 1962. Edward Turner had been appointed Chief Executive of BSA Automotive in 1957 and promised new products, this car was to carry his new V8 engine still under development. The six-cylinder, four-door saloon, with new three-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission, power steering and vacuum-servo assisted four-wheel disc brakes was mechanically up-to-date for its time, {{but it had a}} heavy <b>coachbuilt</b> body of outdated construction on a separate chassis which kept the car's mass well above more modern designs and made it difficult to manoeuvre, despite the modern steering. The styling was already becoming outdated when the car appeared and became increasingly dated as lighter cars with monocoque construction appeared during the Majestic's production run.|$|E

50|$|Smaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class {{vehicles}} {{are also popular}} in Europe, similar in size to Overcab <b>Coachbuilts,</b> but without the base vehicles cab.

2500|$|Dusio {{commissioned}} several automobiles from Europe's leading designers. He provided Pinin Farina {{with the}} chassis, on which an aluminum body was handcrafted. When first {{presented to the}} public at the Villa d'Este Gold Cup show in Como, Italy, and at the 1947 Paris Motor Show, the two-seat 202GT was a resounding success. The 202 was an aesthetic and technical achievement that transformed postwar automobile body design. The Pinin Farina design was honored by New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1951. In the MOMA's first exhibit on automotive design, called [...] "Eight Automobiles", the Cisitalia was displayed with seven other cars (1930 Mercedes-Benz SS tourer, 1939 Bentley saloon with coachwork by James Young, 1939 Talbot-Lago by Figoni teardrop coupé, 1951 Willys Jeep, 1937 Cord 812 Custom Beverly Sedan, 1948 MG TC, and the 1941 Lincoln Continental coupe). It is still part of the MoMA permanent collection. It was not, however, a commercial success; because it was <b>coachbuilt,</b> it was expensive, and only 170 were produced between 1947 and 1952. Most cars were <b>coachbuilt</b> by Pinin Farina with some by Vignale and Stabilimenti Farina.|$|E
2500|$|Only made in Gran Turismo guise with a [...] wheelbase, the 6C 1900 {{replaced}} the corresponding 6C 1750 model. Besides the larger displacement, other notable mechanical changes were aluminium cylinder heads, an improved frame {{and a new}} transmission. The same upgrades were applied to the 1933 model 6C 1750 Gran Sport, which together with the 6C 1900 forms the sixth series of the 6C. Alfa Romeo offered the 6C 1900 with an in-house 4-door saloon body; while bespoke <b>coachbuilt</b> body styles included 4-seat cabriolets.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 and 1986, Hess & Eisenhardt/Car Craft of Lima, Ohio {{converted}} 124 finished Buick Century coupes into <b>coachbuilt</b> convertibles. Although these convertibles {{were sold}} as new cars through Buick dealerships, these convertible conversions were not factory authorized. In the Japanese market Buick could {{not use the}} [...] "Century" [...] name, as that was already in use for the Toyota Century, so it was marketed as the [...] "Buick Luxus" [...] instead. Later it was sold in Japan as the Buick Regal at Yanase Co., Ltd. dealerships for a short time. The Venezuelan-built models were sold as the [...] "Chevrolet Century" [...] in South America and the Caribbean. In Mexico, it was sold as the Century Limited (with no brand, although it wears the Buick logos). Introduced in 1984, it was the top model for General Motors Mexico, it survived successfully the import car wave from 1991 (previously new car importations were forbidden in Mexico) and continued in production until the 1996 model year.|$|E
