5|$|Under Piłsudski, Poland {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with neighboring Romania, Hungary and Latvia. Relations were strained with Czechoslovakia, however, and were still worse with Lithuania. Relations with Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure <b>could</b> <b>for</b> the most part be described as neutral.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{its value}} to Albanian Christians, who <b>could</b> <b>for</b> the first time read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work {{advanced}} the study of written Albanian, and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.|$|E

His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict. Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.|$|E

5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he <b>could,</b> <b>for</b> which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{dramatically}} ended Chesham's isolation. Commuting to London became possible for the first time, as did affordable excursions to the seaside resorts on {{the south and east}} coasts. The products of the area's industries and farms <b>could</b> <b>for</b> the first time be shipped cheaply to the markets of London, and London newspapers arrived each morning at 7.28am, in time for delivery.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats as best he <b>could</b> <b>for</b> a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from the water.|$|E

50|$|The ballot elected one mayor, ten Councillors, nine School Board Trustees {{and seven}} Park Board Commissioners. Each elector <b>could</b> vote <b>for</b> as many {{candidates}} {{as there were}} open seats (e.g., an elector <b>could</b> vote <b>for</b> ten or fewer Councillors).|$|R
50|$|Eight Councillors {{were elected}} through {{universal}} suffrage using block voting, five from the Stanley constituency and three from the Camp constituency. Each elector in Stanley <b>could</b> vote <b>for</b> five candidates, and in Camp each elector <b>could</b> vote <b>for</b> three candidates.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it <b>could</b> <b>for</b> the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he <b>could</b> <b>for</b> his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They <b>could</b> <b>for</b> instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E

As {{the area was}} still a US Territory, residents <b>could</b> not vote <b>for</b> candidates for national office. Since Territorial government officials were appointed by the President of the United States, the question of voting for these officials was moot.

5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus <b>could,</b> <b>for</b> instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
