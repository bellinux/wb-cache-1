25|$|On May Day eve, country {{women do}} not {{work in the field}} {{as well as in the}} house to avoid devastating storms and hail <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the village.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E
500|$|The rookie Chamberlain then shocked Warriors' fans {{by saying}} he was {{thinking}} of retiring. He was tired of being double- and triple-teamed, and of teams <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him with hard fouls. Chamberlain feared he might lose his cool one day. Celtics forward Heinsohn said: [...] "Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever". In addition, Chamberlain was seen as a freak of nature, jeered at by the fans and scorned by the media. As Chamberlain often said, quoting coach Alex Hannum's explanation of his situation, [...] "Nobody loves Goliath." [...] Eddie Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA, sweetening his return with a salary raise to $65,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E
25|$|While in Sichuan, {{he gained}} a {{reputation}} for dealing firmly with any signs of dissent – <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> hard <b>on</b> Tibetan groups and Falun Gong.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't mean that," [...] {{explained}} Tom. [...] "I {{meant to}} fly from Ashton to Brill. We could ship the biplane to Ashton in secret, {{put it together}} on the sly, and create a big sensation by <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> right <b>on</b> the college campus." ...|$|R
500|$|West regains his lyrical dexterity on [...] "Barry Bonds", a competitive, though {{friendly}} {{battle with}} Lil Wayne {{in which the}} two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes. The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West's ability to create music hits. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] is a first-person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for. [...] "Everything I Am" [...] is a song of self-examination, in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his outspokeness ruminating over various ways people expect him to conduct himself. In the track, West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona, his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper, his inclination towards social commentary, and his lack of self-restraint. West comes to the conclusion that while he {{will never be able to}} live up to people's expectations and will always be disadvantageously flawed; it's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is. When writing the song, West thought of a young girl in high school dealing with people <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her.|$|E
500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E
2500|$|Hawkins, Keeble's stepson, {{said one}} {{eyewitness}} {{told him the}} enemy directed its entire arsenal at Keeble during his assault. [...] "He said {{there were so many}} grenades <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Woody, that it looked like a flock of blackbirds." [...] Even under heavy enemy fire, Keeble was able to complete his objective. Only after he killed the machine gunners did Keeble order his men to advance and secure the hill.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the massive investigation, when America entered the war the FBI was {{confident}} that there was no major German espionage network hidden in U.S. society. According to the Daily Mail: [...] "The timely arrests served to deprive Adolf Hitler of the help of spies at the time he would need it the most, the convictions <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> December 12, 1941, one day after war had been formally declared against Germany and Italy by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|RusAir Flight 9605 (also RusLine Flight 243) was a {{passenger}} flight which crashed near Petrozavodsk Airport, Petrozavodsk, Russia, on 20 June 2011. 47 of the 52 on board died. The aircraft involved, a Tupolev Tu-134A-3, was operating a RusAir scheduled domestic flight (as a RusLine service) from Domodedovo International Airport, Moscow, to Petrozavodsk. It crashed on approach in bad weather, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> A133 highway about [...] {{short of the}} runway, shortly after 23:40 [...] (19:40 UTC). As {{a result of the}} crash, all Tu-134s were to be withdrawn from commercial service in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury-Redstone's {{automatic}} in-flight abort {{sensing system}} solved {{this problem by}} monitoring the rocket's performance during flight. If it detected an anomaly which might threaten the astronaut, such as loss of flight control, engine thrust, or electrical power, it would automatically abort, shutting down the engine and activating the capsule's escape system. The abort system could not shut off the engine until at least 30 seconds after liftoff {{in order to prevent}} a malfunctioning launch vehicle from <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> or near the pad; during the initial 30 seconds, only the Range Safety Officer could terminate the flight. Review of flight data from the more than 60 Redstone and Jupiter C launches since 1953 was used to analyze the most likely failure modes of this launch vehicle family. In the interest of simplicity, the abort sensing system had to be kept as simple as possible and only monitor parameters that were vital to booster operation. An automatic abort could be triggered by any of the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{about two}} {{o'clock in the}} morning Giant awoke, to find the rain <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> {{steadily}} <b>on</b> the tent. He crawled {{to the front of the}} shelter and looked out. All was pitch dark, and, somehow, the prospect made him shiver. The wind had gone down, and only the fall of the rain broke the stillness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{the bearer}} of bad news, sir. Nothing at all could {{be seen from the}} top; but in the cross-trees, I got a good look through the smoke, and am sorry to say the French rear-admiral is <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> fast <b>on</b> our larboard-quarter, with all his force.

2500|$|If {{we accept}} that the extra-Calvinisticum's motto, Finitum non capax infinitum (the finite is not capable of the infinite), is a sound insight, {{it would appear that}} Künneth is {{adjusting}} or even giving up a strictly Lutheran view on the subject, while simultaneously providing a new and better explanation for the significance and resolution of the Lutheran and Calvinist debates over the presence of the body of Christ. In separating the issue from the Eucharist, and in essentially <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the side of Calvin's principle, Künneth has driven a wedge into dogmatic discussions of God that would prohibit such discussions apart from the doctrine and the historical reality of the Resurrection : in fact, he has conjoined them in the person and work of the Son, the bearer of both the infinite (in latent, pre-existent, and divinely right form) and the finite, through the vehicle of servanthood to both God and man. It {{is important to remember that}} for Künneth, Christ assumes our mortality in more than the fashion of [...] "putting on the clothes of our flesh" [...] (the Gnostic view of appearances), but that he is not half-human, nor is Jesus subordinated to [...] "time-bound humanity" [...] : he is the transcendent Son. For Künneth, steering a path between Gnosticism on the one hand, and empirical Liberalism on the other, does not mean accepting the neo-Orthodoxy of the paradox theologians. If we accept Placher's [...] "post-liberal" [...] reasoning on the subject, the answer as to how he does this is that he returns to the issue of the extra-Calvinisticum : that is, he returns to a wrestling with Christology that accepts the Nicene Creed, but that (unlike Logos Christianity), is unwilling to interpret the difficult Pauline passages about the Recapitulation and the relationship between the Father and the Son solely in light of a simplistic and literal reading of the first chapter of John.|$|E

6000|$|... "Doctors!" [...] said James, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> sharp <b>on</b> his words: [...] "I've had all {{the doctors}} in London for {{one or another of}} us.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is any excuse for you that you were only in fun. Little girls never indulged {{in that kind of}} fun when I was young.
