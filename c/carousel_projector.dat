5000|$|Semjan {{advocated}} {{a critical review}} of the relative priority of educational institutions versus theaters and art museums: [...] "museums and theaters should be provided {{with the opportunity to}} sustain an economic activity.“The Grand Insolvency Show is a polemic exhibition which focuses on a visionary and liberal idea of visual arts - Statistics. It projects 320 slides with confronting statistics, across a range of global themes via four Kodak <b>carousel</b> <b>projectors.</b> The exhibition was edited using publicly available data from global sources, but with the concept of turning serious statistical analysis into engaging art: The curves, columns and pie charts themselves are readymade pictures.|$|R
5000|$|Along with {{standard}} sized slides that fit into standard projectors, 110 slide film {{could also be}} processed into smaller format slides. The latter required special Pocket <b>Carousel</b> <b>projectors.</b> [...] or the Leica 110 projector. The sub-miniature slides were mounted in small mounts, or for Kodachrome mounted in 35mm sized mounts with a 110 frame. There were also mount adapters available that allowed the small mounts to be projected in a common 35mm projector from gepe. These adapters were not entirely satisfactory however, as to project the smaller slide at a size comparable to that from 35mm the projector had to be moved further from the screen, resulting in a dimmer image. Dedicated 110 projectors overcame this by using a brighter lamp.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projector</b> is {{a common}} form of slide projector, used to project slide {{photographs}} and to create slideshows. It was first patented on May 11, 1965, by David E. Hansen of Fairport, NY. Hansen was an engineer at the Eastman Kodak Company. The original <b>Carousel</b> S Slide <b>Projector</b> was invented by Italian-American Louis Misuraca, who brought his design to the Kodak company, selling it for a lump sum. The design was refined by Hans Gugelot and Reinhold Hacker for Kodak AG in Stuttgart in 1963, and {{is part of the}} permanent collection at MOMA, New York.|$|R

50|$|A {{slide show}} {{may be a}} {{presentation}} of images purely for their own visual interest or artistic value, sometimes unaccompanied by description or text, {{or it may be}} used to clarify or reinforce information, ideas, comments, solutions or suggestions which are presented verbally. Slide shows are sometimes still conducted by a presenter using an apparatus such as a <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projector</b> or an overhead projector, but now the use of an electronic video display device and a computer running presentation software is typical.|$|R

She finds Geoff's {{scrapbook}} filled with memorabilia from his life with Katya, including pressed flowers from their last hike. And then she finds a <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projector,</b> loaded with images of Switzerland and Katya, next to a makeshift screen to view them. One slide shows Katya with her {{hand on top of}} her protruding abdomen, indicating Katya was pregnant {{at the time of her}} death.|$|R
40|$|A live work where {{digital and}} {{analogue}} media collide. This work uses the Internet {{as a central}} point of departure in that the script is taken from the Wikipedia entry for the word 'slideshow'. Words are randomly extracted and transferred onto photographic 35 mm slide to be projected with analogue <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projectors</b> taking the audience into a visual wordplay, from Google to PowerPoint presentation. The sound of projectors is manipulated gradually into a clashing, confrontational, digital/analogue crescendo. 'Slideshow' investigates how information is sourced, navigated and considered in a culture of accelerating mediation. It posits {{the notion of a}} post-digital era in which we are increasingly faced with challenging questions of authenticity and authority...|$|R
50|$|When {{they came}} to power in 1997, the new Labour council were {{obviously}} not too keen on the WCE. Their policies for regenerating Dover relied on attracting industry and acting as an 'enabler' rather than a provider of heritage and tourism facilities. They withdrew much of the money previously paid to tourism initiatives. At the same time, the technology used to run the animatronics and shows (laser discs, <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projectors</b> and 35mm film projectors, etc.) had quickly dated and become obsolete and by 1998 needed replacing. Various quotes were received to update the WCE but were beyond what the Council were prepared to pay so they decided to cut their losses and close the Experience.|$|R
50|$|The William M. Staerkel Planetarium uses a {{specialized}} automation computer, the MC-10 Media Controller, to automate shows using programmable disks. The MC-10 Media Controller can operate either independently or {{in conjunction with}} audio tapes. The Staerkel Planetarium's sound system includes a recording studio and a playback system made up of twelve speakers and two sub-bass enclosures located behind the projection dome. The Staerkel Planetarium has the capability of showing 35mm films and can project an image over {{more than one-third of}} the dome surface area. And, in addition to the star projector at the center of the theatre, the planetarium uses 57 <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projectors</b> that can show panoramas to cover the entire dome as well as three CRT projectors which allow for the projection of videos and special effects.|$|R

Sawyer's was the second-largest U.S. manufacturer of slide projectors in the early and mid-1960s, second only to Eastman Kodak, which had introduced the <b>Carousel</b> slide <b>projector</b> in the early 1960s and patented it in 1965. A 1965 Oregonian article stated that Sawyer's was [...] "one of the two largest U.S. manufacturers of slide projectors and related items, running [...] with Kodak, according to industry sources." [...] A portable projection table was introduced in 1964. The company's main plant, in Progress, was employing 800 people.

30|$|Luminescence Imaging Spectroscopy: As {{previously}} described [4, 5], an illumination and multispectral camera system assembled in–house, operating from 650 to 950  nm, {{was used to}} obtain image cubes calibrated to relative radiance. Excitation illumination was done using two Kodak Ektagraphic III AT <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projectors</b> (OSRAM 300  W EXP bulbs) equipped with F/D 2.5, 152  mm Buhl optical lenses set up at 45 degrees from the normal of the painting {{at a distance of}} approximately 3.6  m. The excitation bandpass was 380 – 520  nm defined by 50  mm 2 Kron/Cousins B astronomy filters inserted into the two slide projectors. The multispectral camera system consists of a low-noise, 4 -megapixel Si CCD camera (QImaging Retiga 4000 R), outfitted with an F/D 2, 25  mm effective focal length hyperspectral lens (Coastal Optics). Spectral interference band pass filters (FWHM 40  nm, Andover Corporation) were used to create the image cube of seven spectral bands. An in-scene calibration method was used to convert the image intensities to relative spectral radiance, using a cadmium pigment target whose spectral emission had been previously measured using the ASD spectroradiometer.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project {{focuses on the}} use of educational technology tools (ETt) within the Extension Service and its professional staff in the 12 -state North Central Region of the United States. ETt are those pieces of equipment, software, and hardware used by Extension staff members to support program delivery management;The objectives of this study were to investigate the kinds of ETt available, assess the current and future use of these technologies, and identify barriers that prevent their use in Extension programs;The systems and communication theory and behaviorism and cognitive theory are the environment and the framework that support the use of educational technology. The versatility of these educational devices has provided educators with innovative equipment that facilitates their teaching methods;Over 90 % of Extension professional had access to traditional technology, such as a <b>carousel</b> slide <b>projector,</b> an overhead projector, and their use is not limited by any barriers. Word processing is the most popular software program currently being used by them;Computer technology is widely used and is rapidly becoming a traditional technology in the Extension Service. However, most of the emerging technologies are limited in their use in Extension {{because of the lack of}} funds, lack of experience, lack of training, lack of time, and being unaware of the technology;A same trend on the current and anticipated use of educational technology tools is observed in the 12 -state North Central Region. Likewise, there are significant differences in the barriers which may have prevented Extension personnel, among different states, from utilizing the several educational technologies;A couple of recommendations from the study were that similar inservice training programs could be designed and implemented within the North Central Region and that a similar study should be conducted {{on the use of}} ETt in undergraduate teaching programs at land-grant universities...|$|R
