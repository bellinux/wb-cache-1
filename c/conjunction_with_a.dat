5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often used in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E

5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{like all}} Nepenthes, this plant needs a fairly humid {{environment}} to grow well. Values {{in the region}} of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> humidistat.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was used in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards {{to the line of}} flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

5|$|On January 15, 2003, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle {{signed an}} {{agreement}} in principle {{to develop a plan}} for light rail expansion to the airport. The agreement envisioned a light rail station along International Boulevard near South 175th Street connected to the airport's terminal via the existing parking garage, with enhanced pedestrian connections and connections to a future hotel {{at the north end of}} the garage. The two agencies also agreed to work together on planning and engineering for the project, which would be built in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> realignment of the Airport Expressway. The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Genesis system, {{attaching}} through an expansion slot {{on the side of}} the main console. Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs, karaoke CD+G discs, and can also be used in conjunction with the 32X to play 32-bit games that utilize both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, also includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis, as well as an extension spacer to work with the original model of the Genesis.|$|E

5|$|The city of Sacramento also {{wished to}} modify its section of SR 275, which, while not a freeway, was still {{designed}} for motor vehicle traffic. Capitol Mall east of postmile 0.11 (the {{east end of}} the Tower Bridge) was relinquished to the city effective January 1, 2006. A ramp from the bridge to N Street was closed in July 2007, allowing the block it had cut diagonally through to be sold. The ramp's counterpart, from L Street to the Tower Bridge, remained open, though the lot that includes it was sold to the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency in 2005. The ramp finally closed to traffic in 2016 in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> project to connect 2nd Street in Old Sacramento to Capitol Mall.|$|E
5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit and Washington State Ferries.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E
