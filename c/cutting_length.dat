5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{clippers}} can be utilized {{to achieve a}} regular haircut: taper clippers, rotary clippers and outliner/edger clippers. Taper clippers are powered by a linear or pivot motor. The blades are not readily interchangeable.

30|$|In {{the first}} period of milling until 200  m of <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> edges of all tools undergo {{intensive}} crumbling of edges, therefore cutting power increases in average by 20  W. This period gives the highest increment in cutting edge radius {{and the intensity of}} edge recession. Next period of milling from 200 until 400  m shows stable process, because edges of all tools decrease gradually from crumbling wear to low wear phase. Not linear increment of cutting power is observed in the <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> 400 – 800  m; edges of tools reach uniform wear (no crumbling of edges) phase. Section from 800 to 1600  m highlights slight but linear increment of cutting power.

40|$|Bud {{removal of}} the {{cuttings}} at underground level has been claimed by cassava growers in Thailand as a method to increase cassava yield. This practise should be tested experimentally to explain the reason for yield increase. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of bud removal and <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> on storage root yield and starch content of three cassava varieties. Field experiment was conducted in a split–split plot design with four replications in 2010 and 2011, under rainfed conditions. Three cassava varieties (KU 50, RY 9 and HB 60) were assigned as main plot. Two cutting lengths (15 cm and 30 cm) were assigned as sub plots, and two treatments of buds (buds cut and not cut) were assigned as sub–sub plots. The buds on the cuttings that were inserted into the soil were removed. In 2010, the plants from 15 -cm long cuttings subjected to bud removal had higher fresh storage root yield (88. 4 Mg ha− 1) than did plants from 30 -cm long cuttings subjected to bud removal (75. 8 Mg ha− 1). Cutting of buds also had higher fresh storage root yield (89. 1 Mg ha− 1) than did non bud-cutting (75. 0 Mg ha− 1).

30|$|It is {{seen from}} Fig. 3 that both cutting force and normal force have {{negative}} values when {{the cutting tool}} is right close to the workpiece, due to the adhesion between cutting tool and workpiece. When the cutting tool begins to contact with the workpiece, the material firstly undergoes elastic deformation, accompanied with rapid increases of both cutting force and normal force. Figure 3 shows that both cutting force and normal force drop rapidly at a <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> of 2.3  nm, indicating the initiation of plastic deformation. Upon further cutting, both cutting force and normal force increase with strong fluctuations caused by successive nucleation events. It is seen from the subfigure in zone II that there are considerable 1 / 6 < 112 > Shockley partial dislocation generated {{in the vicinity of}} the cutting zone. Both cutting force and normal force mainly fluctuates around constant values in the <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> ranging from 10 to 35  nm, indicating that the cutting process is stable.

When the <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> reaches 35  nm, the cutting tool starts to separate from the workpiece, accompanied with significant decreases of both cutting force and normal force. The subfigure in zone III shows there are considerable dislocations blocked by the left side of the workpiece. Both cutting force and normal force become steady until formed chip is completely separated from the workpiece. Figure 3 shows that during the cutting process, normal force is lower than cutting force.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the wear of coated carbide insert in {{machining}} of mild steel. Machineability of mild steel is considered good although the cutting temperature is high. The characteristic of mild steel like high strength, high resistance to breakage and high modulus of elasticity has increased the tool wear of the coated carbide when {{it is used to}} machining the mild steel for long period. As a result, tool wear of the coated carbide inserts in machining of mild steel still need to be improved. The main objective of this project is to examine the progress of tool wear and determine the crater wear and flank wear of the tool in machining the mild steel in turning process. In this project, 33 full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was employed in STATISTICA software to plan and perform the experiment systematically so that any possible experimental error would be minimized. Machining variables considered are <b>cutting</b> <b>length,</b> cutting speed and feed rate. The variables for three levels were 90, 120 and 150 m/min for cutting speed, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/rev for feed rate and 60, 120 and 180 mm for <b>cutting</b> <b>length</b> respectively. Machining of mild steel was carried out by using the conventional lathe machine. After each experiment, flank and crater wear of the coated carbide inserts was investigated and measured by using optical microscope integrated with Image Analyzer.

The result indicates that feed rate is the most significant parameter that influencing both the flank and crater wear compared to cutting speed and <b>cutting</b> <b>length.</b> Optical micrograph of tool wear shows the crater wear progressed faster than flank wear.
