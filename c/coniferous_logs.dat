40|$|The {{problem is}} {{concerned}} with the infestation of <b>coniferous</b> <b>logs</b> by barkbeetles and wood-boring insects during the first season following the felling of the tree. The meristem and wood insects concerned in this study were all members of the order Coleoptera, families Cerambycidae (roundheaded borers), Buprestidae (flatheaded borers), Scolytidae(barkbeetles and ambrosia beetles), and Curculionidae (weevils). The <b>coniferous</b> <b>logs</b> under consideration were cut from tree species of pine, spruce, balsam, and hemlock, all found in Eastern Canada. The present study considers the attractiveness of such logs to oviposition by the barkbeetles and woodborers as influenced by a number of factors enumerated below. Furthermore it investigates the effect of some of these factors upon the subsequent development of these insects after establishment. Of necessity, such a field experiment can only indicate a number of trends but since most of the operating factors cannot be considered independently with any accuracy, the writer believes that an extensive rather than an intensive survey is all that is justified at present.

40|$|The {{difference}} {{of the wood}} consuming patterns between Japan and Korea has caused the different trends in wood import. In the case of Japan, the volume of logs imported has been marked reduced after 1980 because of the environmental problems, and then the volume of lumbers has been increasingly imported to replace the import reduction of the logs. Also, high added-value processing products have been rapidly increased with increases of the imported lumbers has been rapidly increased with increases of the imported lumbers as affected by changes in the demand of wooden residence houses built with high quality of earthquake resistant wooden materials. However, in Korea,lower grade lumber and <b>coniferous</b> <b>logs</b> in low-price are needed instead of high quality wooden materials and lumbers because temporary wooden materials that {{does not need to}} be durability and high quality are comparing with that in Japan. <b>Coniferous</b> <b>logs</b> in lower-grade and lower-price were imported from USA in the 1980 s, but then after the 1990 s, the logs have been imported from Radiata pine in New Zealand. Although importing the lumber is in trend to be increased, but it is still low level. The portion of lubbers is still in 50 % of total lumbers including the logs snd the lumber, imported in Japan, while it is only 10 % of the total in Korea. Thus, the logs imported are still in important portions of domestic wood pricessing fields in Korea...|$|E

The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are dugout canoes dating back to the Neolithic Period around 7,000-9,000 years ago. These canoes were often cut from <b>coniferous</b> tree <b>logs,</b> using simple stone tools. A 7000-year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and tar has been found in Kuwait.

40|$|A {{tool for}} {{management}} and conservation of valuable forests in Sweden are WKH:s. In this study WKH:s different in size, connectivity, amount of dead wood {{and quality of}} logs were investigated for species richness of bryophytes and brackets on <b>coniferous</b> <b>logs.</b> The aim was to clarify which scales and features that was important for the diversity of species {{as well as for}} individual species. The results showed that the amount of dead wood was most important on the site scale, and some species were affected at the landscape scale, a positive effect of valuable tracts. On the scale of individual logs, factors such as diameter, sun exposure, succession stage, contact with ground and ground bryophytes cover was most important. Red-listed species preferred logs with large diameter and late successional stages. The conclusion was that the quality of the substrate and the amount of dead wood was most important, but the amount of WKH:s on the landscape scale was also important for some species...|$|E

Kiy Words: Asian gypsy moth, trade, iuvasive species, welfare, spatial eq iilibriurn n odel Because exotic pest invasiorts cart have large negative effects on forests, govern nents have taken steps to limit the risks of introduction. Losses of important timber species to exotic pests have justified phytosanitary policies whose effects on invasion risks may be clear but whose impacts on global markets are not well understood. The risk of exotic pest introductions is typically described as a positive function of trade flows (e. g., Margolis, Shogren. and Fischer 2005). Hence, trade measures focused on potentially infested shipments are cited as cost-effective interventions that can limit introductions and lower expected pest damages nationally (Costell...|$|E
40|$|Forest product trade {{analysis}} {{is complicated by}} the inter-relationships among forest products. This paper deals with the development and application of an integrated log-lumber trade model that divides the globe into 20 regions. These regions play a significant role as producers and/or consumers of <b>coniferous</b> <b>logs</b> and softwood lumber. The model is calibrated using positive mathematical programming (PMP) so that the baseline scenario precisely duplicates observed 2010 bi-lateral trade flows of both logs and lumber. The calibrated model is then used to examine (1) liberalization of Russian log export taxes and (2) removal of the export restrictions on Canadian lumber exports to the United States. By permitting expanded log exports, Russian welfare increases by $ 2. 3 billion, with losses to lumber consumers and producers more than covered by the gain in rents to timber land. However, the impacts on other regions in the model are surprisingly small. Likewise, removal of the export tax on Canadian lumber to the U. S. also leads to very small changes in welfare; Canada gains $ 91. 8 million, but the U. S. loses only $ 16 million as it shifts lumber sales from domestic to export markets. Russia loses $ 485 million because it produces less logs and lumber, while the impact on other regions is imperceptible. Clearly, by modeling logs and lumber together, the overall impacts of forest policies in one region are mitigated at the global scale...|$|E
40|$|Latvia is {{the fourth}} most forested country in Europe. 52 % of the country’s area is covered by forest lands. Approximately 41 % of the forests are {{composed}} of conifers that are the most harvested among the tree species in Latvia. Therefore, {{as a result of}} logging, large amount of coniferous residues are created and abandoned in forests. There are several alternatives for sustainable use of coniferous residues. Still, the exact quantity of the resource is not known. Thus, it is not clear, whether its amount is sufficient for products’ manufacturing. The aim of the study is to assess the potential of the <b>coniferous</b> greenery from <b>logging</b> residues’ extraction in Latvia.

In addition, differences in wood leachates between decaying tree species may influence soil fungal communities. We determined {{the composition of}} fungi in 4 -yr old decaying logs of Larix kaempferi and Quercus rubra {{as well as in}} soil directly underneath and next to logs. Fungal community composition in soil covered by logs was different from that in wood and uncovered soil and was clearly influenced by the tree species. Soil fungal species richness under logs was lower than in uncovered soil but higher than in decaying wood. The amount of exploratory hyphae of log-inhabiting fungi was only high close to decaying logs. In conclusion, there is a small but significant effect of decaying <b>coniferous</b> and broadleaf <b>logs</b> on soil fungal communities directly underneath logs, likely affected by differences in wood chemistry and fungal preference between tree species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Community {{assembly}} processes do {{not only}} influence community structure, {{but can also}} affect ecosystem processes. To understand the effect of initial community development on ecosystem processes, we studied natural fungal community dynamics during initial wood decay. We hypothesize that fungal community assembly dynamics are driven by strong priority effects of early-arriving species, which lead to predictable successional patterns and wood decay rates. Alternatively, equivalent colonization success of randomly arriving spores {{has the potential to}} drive stochastic community composition and wood decay rates over time. To test these competing hypotheses, we explored the changes in fungal community composition in logs of two tree species (one coniferous and one broadleaf) during the early stages of wood decomposition in a common garden approach. Initial communities were characterized by endophytic fungi, which were highly diverse and variable among logs. Over the first year of decomposition, there was little evidence for priority effects, as early colonizers displaced the endophytic species, and diversity fell as logs were dominated by a few fungal species. During this period, the composition of colonizing fungi was related to the decomposition rates of sapwood. During the second year of decomposition, fungal community composition shifted drastically and the successional dynamics varied considerably between tree species. Variation in fungal community composition among <b>coniferous</b> (Larix kaempferi) <b>logs</b> increased, and there remained no evidence for any priority effects as community composition became stochastic. In contrast, early colonizers still dominated many of the deciduous (Quercus rubra) logs, with a temporally consistent impact on community composition. For both tree species, wood decay rates levelled off and the relationship with fungal community composition disappeared. Our results indicate that priority effects are relatively minimal in naturally occurring fungal community assembly processes. Instead, fungal successional dynamics are governed predominantly by combative abilities of colonizing fungi, and factors that shape fungal communities over time can differ considerably between tree species. Our results indicate that an increased focus of competitive strength among species, rather than priority effects, may be key to predict community assembly and the ecosystem process they provide. </p...|$|R
