5|$|Pilecki's show {{trial and}} {{execution}} {{was part of}} a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government-in-Exile in London. In 2003, the prosecutor, Czesław Łapiński, and several others involved in the trial were <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in Pilecki's murder. Józef Cyrankiewicz, the chief prosecution witness, was already dead, and Łapiński died in 2004, before the trial was concluded.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{was elected}} to Mar's office and proved {{in many ways the}} most {{effective}} of James's regents, but he made enemies by his rapacity. He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful favourites. Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in Darnley's murder. On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland. The king, then fifteen years old, remained under the influence of Lennox for about one more year.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution Pius was compelled to see the independent Gallican Church suppressed, the pontifical and ecclesiastical possessions in France confiscated and an effigy of himself burnt by the populace at the Palais Royal. The murder of the republican agent Hugo Basseville in the streets of Rome (January 1793) gave new ground of offence; the papal court was <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> by the French Convention, and Pius threw in his lot with the First Coalition against the French First Republic.|$|E
50|$|Ndimbati {{has been}} <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> genocide, <b>complicity</b> in genocide, direct and public {{incitement}} to commit genocide, {{as well as}} with murder, extermination, rape and persecution as crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda referred his case to Rwandan authorities in June 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Milomir Stakić (born 19 January 1962, Marićka, Prijedor, Bosnia and Herzegovina) is a Bosnian Serb who was <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> genocide, <b>complicity</b> in genocide, {{violations}} of the customs of war and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for his actions in the Prijedor region during the Bosnian War.|$|R
50|$|In early 1794, {{he finally}} broke with Danton, who had angered many {{other members of}} the Committee of Public Safety with his more {{moderate}} views on the Terror, but whom Robespierre had, until this point, persisted in defending. Subsequently, he joined in attacks on the Dantonists and the Hébertists. Robespierre <b>charged</b> his opponents <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> <b>with</b> foreign powers.|$|R
25|$|Catriona is Stevenson's 1893 {{sequel to}} Kidnapped. Both novels {{are set in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite Risings, in the mid-18th century. The first part of Catriona recounts the attempts of the hero – David Balfour – to gain justice for James Stewart – James of the Glens – who has been arrested and <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer, and goes on to meet Lord Prestongrange – the Lord Advocate – to press the case for James' innocence. However his attempts fail as he is once again kidnapped and confined on the Bass Rock, until the trial is over, and James condemned to death.|$|E
500|$|Most of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were {{questioned}} by police. Bauer and Nold {{were arrested and}} <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in Berkman's plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his attentat. The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was Dyer Lum, an anarchist {{who had been a}} comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and Lucy Parsons. Among those who criticized Berkman were Jo Labadie, Benjamin Tucker, and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman's most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled [...] "Reflections on Attentats" [...] in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman's action had proven this; while Berkman may have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a [...] "total failure".|$|E
2500|$|August 25, 2003 - Two Iranian {{intelligence}} agents who had interrogated Kazemi are <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in her death.

50|$|Despite Gheorghiu-Dej's {{claim that}} he had purged the Romanian party of Stalinists, he {{remained}} susceptible to attack for his obvious complicity in the party's activities from 1944 to 1953. At a plenary PMR meeting in March 1956, Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chișinevschi, both Politburo members and deputy premiers, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej. Constantinescu, who advocated a Khrushchev-style liberalization, posed a particular threat to Gheorghiu-Dej because he enjoyed good connections with the Moscow leadership. The PMR purged Constantinescu and Chișinevschi in 1957, denouncing both as Stalinists and <b>charging</b> them <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> <b>with</b> Pauker. Afterwards, Gheorghiu-Dej faced no serious challenge to his leadership. Ceaușescu replaced Constantinescu as head of PMR cadres.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Leunbach {{performed}} some 300 abortions, [...] {{and he was}} <b>charged</b> twice <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison, lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.|$|R
60|$|Iris, {{when she}} {{accepted}} Hugh Mountjoy's offer of his Scotch villa, went there resolved to hide {{herself from the}} world. Too many people, she thought, knew her history, and what she had done. It was not likely that the Directors of the Insurance Company would all hold their tongues about a scandal so very unusual. Even {{if they did not}} <b>charge</b> her <b>with</b> <b>complicity,</b> as they could, they would certainly tell the story--all the more readily since Lord Harry's murder--of the conspiracy and its success. She could never again, she told herself, be seen in the world.|$|R
2500|$|In early December 1922, Earl Weir, then age 26, {{and pilot}} of the Cowlitz, {{was arrested by}} the Portland police, and <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in a murder of a 15-year-old girl by his father, with the killing said to have {{occurred}} on his father’s houseboat in the Willamette river. [...] The specific charge against Weir {{was that he had}} helped his father conceal the body.|$|E
2500|$|By 21 July, {{three men}} with Tunisian origins and an Albanian couple, all {{previously}} {{unknown to the}} French intelligence agencies, had been charged by the ministère public with [...] "criminal conspiracy {{in relation to a}} terrorist enterprise". The three men were also <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in murder in relation to a terrorist enterprise. A sixth male suspect was later charged with conspiracy in relation to a terrorist enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1994–95 {{television}} season, Kunstler starred {{as himself}} in {{an episode of}} Law & Order titled [...] "White Rabbit", defending a woman <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the 1971 murder of a policeman during the robbery of an armored car, who previously had been in hiding ever since; the plot {{was based on the}} real activities of Katherine Ann Power who turned herself in to authorities in 1993.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, CIBC {{paid out}} $80-Million in <b>charges</b> for <b>complicity</b> <b>with</b> its {{involvement}} with Enron. While the involvement {{was not related}} to CIBC Mellon, as CIBC is a majority stakeholder, it was required that it be reported on the TA-1 to the SEC.|$|R
50|$|By 1961, {{however, the}} young and more radical members of the CPP leadership, led by Adamafio, had gained {{ascendancy}} over the original CPP leaders like Gbedemah. After a bomb attempt on Nkrumah's life in August 1962, Adamafio, Ako Adjei (then minister of foreign affairs), and Cofie Crabbe (all members of the CPP) were jailed under the Preventive Detention Act. The first Inspector-General of Police, E. R. T Madjitey, from Asite in Manya-Krobo was also relieved of his post. The CPP newspapers <b>charged</b> them <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the assassination attempt, offering as evidence only {{the fact that they}} had all chosen to ride in cars far behind the president's when the bomb was thrown.|$|R
60|$|Conceiving {{himself on}} the point of death, Darnley wrote piteously to the Queen; but she ignored his letters until she learnt that his {{condition}} was improving, when at last (on January 29th) she went to visit him at Glasgow. It may well be that she nourished some hope that nature would resolve the matter for her, and remove the need for such desperate measures as had been concerted. But seeing him likely to recover, two things became necessary, to bring him to the place that was suitable for the fulfilment of her designs, and to simulate reconciliation with him, and even renewed and tender affection, so that none might hereafter <b>charge</b> her <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in what should follow.|$|R
2500|$|In 1674 Easton {{was elected}} deputy {{governor}} of the colony, serving under William Coddington.

2500|$|Horthy {{gradually}} came {{to believe}} that his arrest had been arranged and choreographed by the Americans in order to protect him from the Russians. Indeed, the former regent reported being told that Josip Broz Tito, the new ruler of Yugoslavia, asked that Horthy be <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> with the [...] 1942 massacre of Serbian and Jewish civilians by Hungarian troops in the Bačka region of Vojvodina. [...] Serbian historian Zvonimir Golubović has claimed that not only was Horthy aware of these genocidal massacres, but had approved of them. [...] However, American trial officials did not indict Horthy for war crimes. The former ambassador John Montgomery, who had some influence in Washington, also contributed to Horthy's release in Nuremberg.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 August 1993, Vikernes murdered Euronymous. On that night, Vikernes and Ruch {{travelled}} from Bergen 518km to Euronymous' {{apartment in}} Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, which ended when Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His {{body was found}} outside the apartment with twenty-three cut wounds — two to the head, five to the neck and sixteen to the back. Vikernes claims that Euronymous had plotted to torture him to death and videotape the event, using a meeting about an unsigned contract as a pretext. On {{the night of the}} murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract and [...] "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous attacked him first. Additionally, Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. Vikernes was arrested within days, and a few months later he was sentenced to 21 years in prison for both the murder and church arsons; he was released from prison in 2009. Blackthorn, who waited for Vikernes downstairs and took no part in Aarseth's murder, was <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in murder and sentenced to serve 8 years in prison. With only Hellhammer remaining, Mayhem effectively ceased to exist.|$|E
50|$|The only bishop to {{have served}} the diocese, Augustin Misago, was {{appointed}} {{in part because}} he had studied and written on the Kibeho apparitions when he served as Rector of the Grand Seminary of Nyakibanda. In 1999, the Rwandan government <b>charged</b> Bishop Misago <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the 1994 genocide, and he spent 14 months in prison while his trial took place. He was ultimately acquitted in June 2000 and allowed to return to his functions as bishop.|$|R
25|$|During 1964 the Communist regime made {{an attempt}} to change the Muslim names of the Pomaks in Kochan with Slavic ones but the attempt failed and only those loyal to the regime had their names changed. On 23 April 1972 {{in the town of}} Sarnitsa an {{appointed}} Bulgarian policeman was killed by five native Pomaks because of a confiscated driving license. One of the ravishers surrendered immediately while the rest made {{an attempt to}} escape to Greece but were arrested in Kochan where they had received temporary shelter. That was a good moment for the regime to make a second attempt for a forced name change since the inhabitants of the village were shocked by the incident and the authorities <b>charged</b> them <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the murder. Thus the name change went relatively smooth.|$|R
50|$|In 1306, King Edward I of England <b>charged</b> Bishop David <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in {{the murder}} of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch. David was excommunicated and fled to the Earldom of Orkney. King Edward sent a request to King Haakon V of Norway for Bishop David to be arrested. David escaped capture. On 17 June 1320, the bishop was again excommunicated, by Pope John XXII, as an abettor of King Robert I of Scotland, enemy of King Edward II of England. On the orders of the Pope, the Bishop of Dunblane and the Bishop of Winchester {{delivered}} a sentence of excommunication on David and other bishops on 23 May 1322.|$|R

50|$|The disgrace rankled in Grey's mind, and in May 1600 he {{abandoned}} Essex in Ireland, and with Sir Robert Drury (1575-1615) {{took a small}} troop of horse to serve the United Provinces in Flanders. Queen Elizabeth was incensed, but in July Cecil sent Henry Brooke, Lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh {{to meet him at}} Ostend, and assure him of the queen's good will. This meeting at Ostend brought together for the first (and perhaps only) time Grey, Cobham, and Raleigh, who were afterwards <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> joint <b>complicity</b> in treason. Fighting under Maurice of Nassau, Grey took part in the battle of Nieuport, 2 July 1600, in which the Dutch gained a decisive victory over the Spanish forces under Albert VII, Archduke of Austria; Grey was wounded in the mouth. He sent home an account of the victory two days later.|$|R
50|$|The Phoenicians took {{possession}} of the islands in very early times; a remarkable trace of their colonisation is preserved {{in the town of}} Mago (Maó in Minorca). After the fall of Carthage, the islands seem to have been virtually independent. Notwithstanding their celebrity in war, the people were generally very quiet and inoffensive. The Romans, however, easily found a pretext for <b>charging</b> them <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> <b>with</b> the Mediterranean pirates, and they were conquered by Q. Caecilius Metellus, thence surnamed Balearicus, in 123 BC. Metellus settled 3,000 Roman and Spanish colonists on the larger island, and founded the cities of Palma and Pollentia. The islands belonged, under the Roman Empire, to the conventus of Carthago Nova (modern Cartagena), in the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, of which province they formed the fourth district, under the government of a praefectus pro legato. An inscription of the time of Nero mentions the PRAEF. PRAE LEGATO INSULAR. BALIARUM. (Orelli, No. 732, who, with Muratori, reads pro for prae.) They were afterwards made a separate province, called Hispania Balearica, probably in the division of the empire under Constantine.|$|R
50|$|The issue {{flared up}} again in March. On the 15th, Fiji Live quoted Leweni as accusing the police of {{purchasing}} F$1.5 million worth of weapons from South Korea. The shipment allegedly included 123 pistols, 30 submachine guns, and assorted warfare equipment. He also <b>charged</b> Commissioner Hughes <b>with</b> <b>complicity</b> in the deal, which he said had been masterminded by the Australian Defence Review Team {{as part of a}} package {{to reduce the size of}} the Military and transfer most of its duties to the police. Hughes was deliberately arming Fijians against Fijians, he said. Commodore Bainimarama went further: the shipment had been intended for the Military, he claimed, and had been diverted to the police by the government.|$|R
