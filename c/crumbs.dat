5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread <b>crumbs</b> (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread <b>crumbs</b> {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread <b>crumbs.</b> Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E
5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat <b>crumbs</b> and other household scraps. Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for <b>crumbs</b> – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No <b>crumbs</b> were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread <b>crumbs.</b> Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and <b>crumbs.</b> It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
25|$|While {{browsing}} the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi {{came across}} a copy of R. <b>Crumb's</b> Fritz the Cat (1969). Impressed by <b>Crumb's</b> sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Bakshi was interested in directing the film because he felt that <b>Crumb's</b> work was the closest to his own. Krantz arranged a meeting with <b>Crumb,</b> during which Bakshi showed <b>Crumb</b> drawings that had been created {{as the result of}} Bakshi attempting to learn <b>Crumb's</b> style to prove that he could translate the look of <b>Crumb's</b> artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, <b>Crumb</b> lent him one of his sketchbooks as a reference.|$|R
40|$|Crispness {{of bread}} is rapidly lost because of water {{migration}} inside the <b>crumb</b> towards the crust. How <b>crumb</b> properties determine this process independent of crust properties {{has not been}} examined before. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyze and explain the influence of <b>crumb</b> morphology on the overall crispness retention. Crispness retention was determined by analyzing the acoustic emission of breads differing in either crust or <b>crumb</b> morphology. When <b>crumb</b> morphology is coarse with a lower number of large connections between the air cells, the effective diffusion coefficient is reduced. This effective diffusion coefficient of <b>crumb,</b> which equals approximately half the value of air, was estimated using X-ray micro-computer tomography images of <b>crumb</b> pieces. If the <b>crumb</b> has a lower effective diffusion coefficient, bread with similar crust properties has significantly longer crispness retention. Despite this, our data show that variations in properties of crust, which has 30 times higher permeability than <b>crumb,</b> have a larger impact on crispness retention than variations in properties of <b>crumb...</b>|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread <b>crumbs</b> or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, <b>crumbs,</b> and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled <b>crumbs</b> in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E

Four sets were prepared by partially or full replacing the sand with <b>crumb</b> rubber tire to fabricate the <b>Crumb</b> Rubber-Mortar mixtures. The first two sets include fine <b>crumb</b> rubber with particles size (0. 3 - 1 mm), The other set include coarse <b>crumb</b> rubber with particles size (1. 18 - 2. 36 mm). The second two sets were prepared {{as the same}} first sets but {{with the addition of}} (7 %) SBR latex by weight of cement. Each set was consist of different percentage of replacing the sand by <b>crumb</b> rubber (10, 30, 50, 100 %) by volume.

40|$|Recycling waste tire rubber by {{incorporating}} it into concrete {{has become the}} preferred solution to dispose of waste tires. In this study, {{the effect of the}} volume content of <b>crumb</b> rubber and pretreatment methods on the performances of concrete was evaluated. Firstly, the fine aggregate and mixture were partly replaced by <b>crumb</b> rubber to produce <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete. Secondly, the mechanical and durability properties of <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete with different replacement forms and volume contents had been investigated. Finally, the <b>crumb</b> rubber after pretreatment by six modifiers was introduced into the concrete mixture. Corresponding tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness of pretreatment methods as compared to the concrete containing untreated <b>crumb</b> rubber. It was observed that the mechanical strength of <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete was reduced, while durability was improved with the increasing of <b>crumb</b> rubber content. 20 % replacement of fine aggregate and 5 % replacement of the total mixture exhibited acceptable properties for practical applications. In addition, the results indicated that the modifiers had a positive impact on the mechanical and durability properties of <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete. It avoided the disadvantage of <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete having lower strength and provides a reference for the production of modified <b>crumb</b> rubber concrete...|$|R
