5|$|The Himalayas {{and other}} {{mountain}} chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions. An estimated 15,000 glaciers {{can be found}} in the greater Himalayas, with double that number in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram and Tien Shan ranges, and comprise the largest glaciated region outside the poles. These glaciers provide <b>critical</b> <b>water</b> supplies to arid countries such as Mongolia, western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9percent reduction in ice mass. Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). If the present trends persist the ice mass will gradually be reduced, and will affect the availability of water resources, though water loss is not expected to cause problems for many decades.|$|E

2500|$|The Atterberg {{limits are}} a basic {{measure of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>water</b> {{contents}} of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and liquid limit. As a dry, clayey soil takes on increasing amounts of water, it undergoes distinct changes in behavior and consistency. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid. In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on {{a change in the}} soil's behavior. The Atterberg limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. These limits were created by Albert Atterberg, a Swedish agriculturist. They were later refined by Arthur Casagrande. These distinctions in soil are used in assessing the soils that are to have structures built on. [...] Soils when wet retain water and some expand in volume. [...] The amount of expansion is related to the ability of the soil to take in water and its structural make-up (the type of atoms present). These tests are mainly used on clayey or silty soils since these are the soils that expand and shrink due to moisture content. [...] Clays and silts react with the water and thus change sizes and have varying shear strengths. Thus these tests are used widely in the preliminary stages of designing any structure to ensure that the soil will have the correct amount of shear strength and not too much change in volume as it expands and shrinks with different moisture contents.|$|E

40|$|Only very recently, it {{has become}} evident that soil {{hydrophobicity}} is wide-spread in the world. Generally, soil hydrophobicity {{is caused by the}} presence of organic compounds, like humic and fulvic acids and fatty waxes, which are able to coat individual soil particles and aggregates. These organic compounds might become water repellent below a certain <b>critical</b> soil <b>water</b> content due to molecular conformational changes. Above the critical soil moisture content a soil behaves wettable and below it hydrophobic. Due to the presence of hydrophobic coatings, soil water retention functions show typical hysteresis loops in the range below the <b>critical</b> soil <b>water</b> content. Generally, it can be stated that wetting branches below the critical soil moisture content are very steeply curved with low water entry values, while wetting branches above the <b>critical</b> soil <b>water</b> contents are generally gently curved with much higher water entry values. Due to these typical water retention branches, perturbations at an infiltrating wetting front might grow into vertically directed preferential flow paths in initially dry soil (i. e. under conditions below the critical soil moisture content), causing an accelerated downward transport of water and solutes in this case. In the opposite situation, with initial soil water contents exceeding the <b>critical</b> soil <b>water</b> value, perturbations at a...|$|R
