50|$|With most debt (including {{corporate}} debt, {{mortgages and}} bank loans) a covenant {{is included in}} the debt contract which states that the total amount owed becomes immediately payable on the first instance of a default of payment. Generally, if the debtor defaults on any debt to the lender, a <b>cross</b> <b>default</b> covenant in the debt contract states that that particular debt is also in default.|$|E
50|$|As the Company’s {{financial}} condition deteriorated, {{it became the}} subject of PRC legal actions commenced by onshore creditors, which threatened its PRC assets. Demand letters were also issued against various Asia Aluminum Group entities by Hong Kong-based lenders. The demand letters triggered the <b>cross</b> <b>default</b> of the Senior Notes and the PIK Notes, causing in excess of US$985,000,000 of debt to become immediately due and payable. Asia Aluminum did not have sufficient funds to repay these debts. Consequently, as at 28 February 2009, Asia Aluminum was deemed insolvent both on a cash flow and a balance sheet basis. At the time, Asia Aluminum’s total onshore and offshore debt was in the order of US$1,544,000,000.|$|E
40|$|I analyze how lack of {{commitment}} affects the maturity structure of sovereign debt. Governments balance benefits of default induced redistribution and costs due to income {{losses in the}} wake of a default. Their choice of short- versus long- term debt affects default and rollover decisions by subsequent policy makers. The equilibrium maturity structure is shaped by revenue losses on inframarginal units of debt that reflect the price impact of these decisions. The model predicts an interior maturity structure with positive gross positions and a shortening of the maturity structure when debt issuance is high, output low, or a <b>cross</b> <b>default</b> more likely. These predictions are consistent with empirical evidence. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{cost efficiency}} under a quantile regression framework. Our {{purpose is to}} investigate whether cost efficiency differs across quantiles of the conditional distribution. Efficiency scores are derived using the distribution-free approach. Results show that for higher conditional distributions, efficiency scores are lower. In a second stage analysis, we {{examine the relationship between}} efficiency and risk, measured as distance to <b>default.</b> <b>Cross</b> section regressions show that the higher the risk, the lower the level of efficiency. The magnitude and the significance of the coefficient of the distance to default increases for conditional distributions associated with lower levels of efficiency.

40|$|About {{three percent}} of the world’s 6. 1 billion people were {{international}} migrants in 2000. Population growth is expected to slow between 2000 and 2050 in comparison to 1950 - 2000, but international migration {{is expected to rise}} as persisting demographic and economic inequalities that motivate migration interact with revolutions in communications and transportation that enable people to <b>cross</b> borders. The <b>default</b> policy option to manage what is sometimes deemed out-of-control migration, adjusting the rights of migrants, is unsatisfactory, prompting this review of longer term factors affecting migration patterns, including aging in industrial countries, rural-urban migration that spills over national borders, and the migration infrastructure of agents and networks that moves people. The paper concludes with an assessment of the likely effects of the 2008 - 09 recession on international migration. ...|$|R
40|$|The MiniBooNE large axial mass anomaly has {{prompted}} {{a great deal}} of theoretical work on sophisticated Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) neutrino interaction models in recent years. As the dominant interaction mode at T 2 K energies, and the signal process in oscillation analyses, {{it is important for the}} T 2 K experiment to include realistic CCQE cross section uncertainties in T 2 K analyses. To this end, T 2 K's Neutrino Interaction Working Group has implemented a number of recent models in NEUT, T 2 K's primary neutrino interaction event generator. In this paper, we give an overview of the models implemented, and present fits to published muon neutrino and muon antineutrino CCQE cross section measurements from the MiniBooNE and MINERvA experiments. The results of the fits are used to select a <b>default</b> <b>cross</b> section model for future T 2 K analyses, and to constrain the cross section uncertainties of the model. We find a model consisting of a modified relativistic Fermi gas model and multinucleon interactions most consistently describes the available data...|$|R
40|$|The formulating of {{covenant}} in {{bank credit}} agreement {{is under the}} authority of the bank as creditor. Covenants, which are formulating, from the financial and legal aspects are created in order to minimalize the risks in distributing credits. Two of the most important covenanrs are known as default and <b>cross</b> <b>default</b> covenants. Under these covenants, banks have the authority to terminate credit agreements and withdraw the rests of the loans from debitors. These covenants are created because as financial institutions funded by publics. banks need to keep their prudential banking policy in distributing their credits. However. in banking practice, the approprateness of these covenants are questioned since the freedom ofcontracts tends to be more beneficial for the banks than the debitors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{sovereign risk}} paired with {{social costs of}} default shape the government debt maturity structure. Governments balance benefits of default induced redistribution and costs due to income losses {{in the wake of}} a default. Their choice of short- versus long-term debt issuance affects default and rollover decisions by subsequent policy makers whose price impact gives rise to revenue losses on inframarginal units of debt. When considering whether to issue additional debt of a certain maturity, the government weighs the benefit of smoothing disposable income and the cost due to these revenue losses. Consistent with the evidence, the model predicts an interior maturity structure with positive gross positions; the maturity structure shortens when debt issuance is high, output low, output volatility low, or a <b>cross</b> <b>default</b> more likely...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{theoretical}} work on sophisticated charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) neutrino interaction models in recent years, prompted by a number of experimental results that measured unexpectedly large CCQE cross sections on nuclear targets. As the dominant interaction mode at T 2 K energies, and the signal process in oscillation analyses, it is important for the T 2 K experiment to include realistic CCQE cross section uncertainties in T 2 K analyses. To this end, T 2 K’s Neutrino Interaction Working Group has implemented a number of recent models in NEUT, T 2 K’s primary neutrino interaction event generator. In this paper, we give an overview of the models implemented and present fits to published νμ and ν¯μ CCQE cross section measurements from the MiniBooNE and MINERνA experiments. The results of the fits are used to select a <b>default</b> <b>cross</b> section model for future T 2 K analyses and to constrain the cross section uncertainties of the model. We find strong tension between datasets for all models investigated. Among the evaluated models, the combination of a modified relativistic Fermi gas with multinucleon CCQE-like interactions gives the most consistent description of the available data...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate flight crew performance of the "Precision Descent," a new cockpit procedure designed to support the Descent Advisor (DA), one of the components in a new air traffic control advisory system called the "Center-TRACON Automation System" (CTAS). The DA predicts when aircraft will reach a specific waypoint on the arrival route, and presents controllers with clearance advisories designed to improve the sequencing of arriving aircraft. The effectiveness of the DA depends on the aircraft's descent trajectory: where it begins descent, what speed it maintains, how fast and at what altitude it crosses the bottom-of-descent waypoint. The Precision Descent allows controllers to assign these descent parameters to the flight crew. A Field Evaluation of the DA was conducted in Denver in 1995. Three separate clearances using standard ATC phraseology were used to support the cockpit descent procedure during this evaluation. The number and length of these clearances caused problems for both controllers and flight crews, causing readback errors, repeat requests and procedure misunderstandings. These observations led to a focus group meeting in which controller and pilot participants in the 1995 FE assisted in the redesign of the procedure. The Precision Descent eliminates one clearance used in the earlier study, and greatly reduces {{the length of the}} remaining clearances. This was accomplished by using non-standard clearance phraseology that relies on a published procedure chart for correct interpretation. Eight type-rated flight crews flew eight Precision Descents in a Boeing 747 - 400 simulator. No training was provided: crews received either a procedure chart or a procedure chart with a flight manual bulletin describing procedure techniques. Video and digital data were recorded for each descent. Preliminary results indicate that moving information from the verbal clearance to the chart was successful: the shorter clearances and the procedure's <b>default</b> <b>crossing</b> restriction were understood, and procedure compliance of 81 % was observed across all descents on six independent compliance measures. Some readback errors and procedure misunderstandings were still observed, however; particularly when descent clearances deviated from the normative procedure...|$|R
