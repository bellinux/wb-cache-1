Bricks incorporating SBA exhibit compressive strength lesser than traditional clay bricks; however, burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> incorporating 5 % SBA by clay weight fulfilled the minimum requirement for compressive strength according to the Building code of Pakistan. Moreover, efflorescence was improved after adding the SBA in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks.</b> Therefore, lighter and sustainable bricks can be produced after utilization of small amount of SBA (i. e., 5 %) in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

In recent times, burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> have been regarded as old fashioned and replaced by other perceived modern walling units within Kumasi, the metropolitan capital of Ashanti Region, despite its availability, unique advantages (aesthetics, low maintenance cost, etc.), and structural and nonstructural properties.

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of bricks}} {{is an important}} parameter as it directly influences the heat losses from buildings and thus increases the energy consumption. The main focus {{of this study was}} to develop thermally efficient burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> incorporating agricultural wastes on industrial scale. For this purpose, agricultural wastes (sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) and rice husk ash (RHA)) were acquired from a sugar industry and a <b>brick</b> kiln. Burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> were manufactured in an industrial kiln by incorporating SBA and RHA in various dosages (i. e. 5 %, 10 % and 15 %) by clay weight. Physico-mechanical and thermal properties of brick specimens incorporating agricultural wastes were studied. It was observed that lighter weight bricks can be produced using agricultural wastes, which are helpful in reducing both the cost and overall weight of the structure. Addition of agricultural wastes in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> resulted into reduced compressive strength. However, brick specimens incorporating SBA and RHA up to 15 % satisfied the minimum requirement for compressive strength according to different standards for masonry construction. Increase in apparent porosity with decrease in thermal conductivity was also observed with increasing content of SBA and RHA in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks.</b> Substitution of <b>clay</b> by 15 % SBA and RHA in the production of burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> reduced the thermal conductivity by 31 % and 29 %, respectively. Microscopic images also showed the presence of interconnected and irregular shaped open pores after addition of agricultural wastes in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks.</b> Based on this study, it can be concluded that the utilization of SBA and RHA (up to 15 % by clay weight) in manufacturing of burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> is not only helpful in landfill reduction but also leads towards the development of sustainable and thermally efficient construction material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{a million}} tonnes of {{cigarette}} butts (CBs) are produced worldwide annually. These CBs accumulate {{in the environment}} due to the poor biodegradability of the cellulose acetate filters and pose a serious environmental risk. This paper presents some of the results from a continuing study on recycling CBs into fired <b>clay</b> <b>bricks.</b> Properties including compressive strength, flexural strength, density, water absorption and thermal conductivity of fired <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> are reported and discussed. Furthermore, leaching of heavy metals from the manufactured <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> was tested. The {{results show that the}} density of fired bricks was reduced by about 8 – 30 %, depending on the percentage of CBs incorporated into the raw materials. The compressive strength of bricks tested was 12. 57, 5. 22 and 3. 00 MPa for 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10 % CB content respectively. Water absorption and initial rate of absorption values increased as density, and hence porosity, of bricks decreased with increasing CB volume. The leaching test results revealed trace amounts of heavy metals. Keywords—Cigarette butts, Fired <b>clay</b> <b>bricks,</b> Light bricks, Recycling waste, Thermal conductivity...|$|R

The brick samples were collected from six different archeological sites at the banks of old route of River Indus in district Sanghar, Sindh, Pakistan.

ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standard for baked <b>clay</b> <b>bricks,</b> based on compressive strength, suggests that the bricks of four sites can withstand severe weathering while the bricks of two sites are resistant to moderate weathering. These results were compared to the values of the corresponding data of bricks, of same period, obtained from the historical monuments of the world as reported in the literature. The comparison showed that the values of physical properties of old baked <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> of Indus valley civilization of tenth century are in agreement with that of old baked <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> of contemporary era.
