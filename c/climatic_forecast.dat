40|$|The vast {{majority}} of current predictions about climate change effects on species geographic ranges {{are based on the}} climate envelope approach. Current species distributions are used to define a species niche, and this niche space is then projected into the future by tracking the <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast.</b> In opposition to climate envelope methods to describe shifts in species ’ geographic ranges, predictions based on mechanistic approaches tend to be more robust. These models rely on examining key physiological events in a species life and their relationship to climate. This review explores how tightly key life history events are connected to climatic conditions. Specifically, the following addresses migration triggers, reproduction, phenology, and sex determination. Clearly the importance of these events and their demonstrated relationship to climate reinforce the need to approach climate change predictions from a mechanistic approach...|$|E
40|$|Fasciolosis {{caused by}} Fasciola hepatica in various South American {{countries}} {{located on the}} slopes of the Andes has been recognized as an important public health problem. However, the importance of this zoonotic hepatic parasite was neglected until the last decade. Countries such as Peru and Bolivia are considered to be hyperendemic areas for human and animal fasciolosis, and other countries such as Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela are also affected. At the beginning of the 1990 s a multidisciplinary project was launched with the aim to shed light on the problems related to this parasitic disease in the Northern Bolivian Altiplano. A few years later, a geographic information system (GIS) was incorporated into this multidisciplinary project analysing the epidemiology of human and animal fasciolosis in this South American Andean region. Various GIS projects were developed in some Andean regions using climatic data, <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast</b> indices and remote sensing data. Step by step, all these GIS projects concerning the forecast of the fasciolosis transmission risk in the Andean mountain range were revised and in some cases updated taking into account new data. The first of these projects was developed on a regional scale for the central Chilean regions and the proposed model was validated on a local scale in the Northern Bolivian Altiplano. This validated mixed model, based on both fasciolosis <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast</b> indices and normalized difference vegetation index values from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite sensor, was extrapolated to other human and/or animal endemic areas of Peru and Ecuador. The resulting fasciolosis risk maps make it possible to show the known human endemic areas of, mainly, the Peruvian Altiplano, Cajamarca and Mantaro Peruvian valleys, and some valleys of the Ecuadorian Cotopaxi province. Nevertheless, more climate and remote sensing data, as well as more accurate epidemiological reports, have to be incorporated into these GIS projects, which should be considered the key in understanding fasciolosis transmission in the Andes...|$|E
40|$|Consumers, {{including}} {{the poor in}} many countries, are increasingly dependent on food imports 1 and are thus exposed to variations in yields, production and export prices in the major food-producing regions of the world. National governments and commercial entities are therefore paying increased attention to the cropping forecasts of important food-exporting countries {{as well as to}} their own domestic food production. Given the increased volatility of food markets and the rising incidence of climatic extremes affecting food production, food price spikes may increase in prevalence in future years 2, 3, 4. Here we present a global assessment of the reliability of crop failure hindcasts for major crops at two lead times derived by linking ensemble seasonal <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> with statistical crop models. We found that moderate-to-marked yield loss over a substantial percentage (26 – 33 %) of the harvested area of these crops is reliably predictable if <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> are near perfect. However, only rice and wheat production are reliably predictable at three months before the harvest using within-season hindcasts. The reliabilities of estimates varied substantially by crop—rice and wheat yields were the most predictable, followed by soybean and maize. The reasons for variation in the reliability of the estimates included the differences in crop sensitivity to the climate and the technology used by the crop-producing regions. Our findings reveal that the use of seasonal <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> to predict crop failures will be useful for monitoring global food production and will encourage the adaptation of food systems to climatic extremes...|$|R
40|$|Awareness of climatic {{information}} {{relevant for}} future decisions through <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{is not enough}} to support farmer’s decision-making. It is necessary to look for agricultural management alternatives that allow farmers to adapt to climatic conditions and implement efficient and sustainable management systems, within a framework of effective communication with farmers (Jones, 2003; Pulwarty et al., 2003).

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, {{extensive}} field, laboratory, and modeling investigations {{have been performed}} at Yucca Mountain, which {{have led to the}} development of a number of conceptual models of infiltration and climate for the Yucca Mountain region around the repository site (Flint, A. L. et al. 2001; Wang and Bodvarsson 2003). Evaluating the amount of infiltrating water entering the subsurface is important, because this water may affect the percolation flux, which, in turn, controls seepage into the waste emplacement drifts and radionuclide transport from the repository to the water table. <b>Forecasting</b> of <b>climatic</b> data indicates that during the next 10, 000 years at Yucca Mountain, the present-day climate should persist for 400 to 600 years, followed by a warmer and much wetter monsoon climate for 900 to 1, 400 years, and by a cooler and wetter glacial-transition climate for the remaining 8, 000 to 8, 700 years. The analysis of <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasting</b> indicates that long-term climate conditions are generally predictable from a past climate sequence, while short-term climate conditions and weather predictions may be more variable and uncertain. The use of past climate sequences to bound future climate sequences involves several types of uncertainties, such as (1) uncertainty in the timing of future climate, (2) uncertainty in the methodology of <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasting,</b> and (3) uncertainty in the earth's future physical processes. Some of the uncertainties of the <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasting</b> are epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible). Because of the size of the model domain, INFIL treats many flow processes in a simplified manner. For example, uptake of water by roots occurs according to the ''distributed model'', in which available water in each soil layer is withdrawn in proportion to the root density in that layer, multiplied by the total evapotranspirative demand. Runoff is calculated simply as the excess of precipitation over a sum of infiltration and water storage in the root zone. More significantly, water movement throughout the soil profile is treated according to the bucket model, in which the amount of water that moves down from one layer to the next is equal to the mass of water in excess of field capacity in the upper layer. The development of a numerical model of infiltration involves a number of abstractions and simplifications to represent the complexity of environmental conditions at Yucca Mountain, such as the arid climate, mountain-type topography, heterogeneous soils and fractured rock, and irregular soil-rock interface...|$|R
40|$|A {{climate system}} is a complex {{nonlinear}} system. Estimation of the complexity is of great interest in <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast</b> and prediction. In this paper, we propose the use of sample entropy (SampEn), an entropy-based algorithm, to measure the complexity of daily temperature series. Estimations of SampEn were calculated for 50 meteorological stations {{in the mountains of}} Southwest China, particularly in Yunnan Province. On the basis of these data, stations were grouped in climatically homogenous regions (climate provinces), and the spatial pattern of SampEn for each climate province was investigated. The SampEn value of spatial distribution of climate provinces reflects the varying degree of influence of the monsoonal air masses. High SampEn values occur in interactive regions of different air masses, owing to large regional differences in weather processes, while the southwest region is {{under the influence of the}} Southwest Monsoon leading to a homogenous climatic environment, low SampEn values and small spatial variations of SampEn. The results suggest that SampEn is an alternative nonlinear approach for analyzing and predicting complexity of climatic time series. Copyright © 2006 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies on the rain regimen of the South Brazilian Region and, consequently, in the local hydrographic basins. An analytical function based on a combination of two Gaussian distribution in space and one distribution in time was applied to the climatology of SST of the Community Atmosphere Model version 2. 02 (CAM 2. 02) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in order to simulate an SAO SST anomaly. The Gaussian analytical function was adjusted to the February and March of 2005 observed anomaly in the SAO, on the region near 58 W and 40 S where those anomalies reached 20 C. In this period a rain anomaly in the South Brazilian Region took place, with pluviometric deficits of about 100 mm in the Uruguai (SC) and Iguaçu (PR) rivers basins. In the subsequent months the SAO SST anomaly intensity was diminished but it was increased up in area reaching 20 S in September, persisting until October. In these last two months the rain levels in the south region of Brazil basins exceeded the historical values in more than 100 mm. Data mining techniques applied to some computed indexes obtained from the model results revealed some South Brazilian Region circulation anomalies patterns in response to the SAO/SST anomaly forcing. The vertical structure of the model atmosphere was strongly affected by the forcing, the humidity and latent heat flux was augmented and the planetary bondary layer height was shortened in the anomaly forced region. These preliminary results emphasize the importance of the prognostics of SST in seasonal <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast,</b> demonstrating the need of a coupled ocean-atmophere modeling system for this kind of forecast.

40|$|Fasciolosis {{also known}} as {{fascioliasis}} is a highly pathogenic liver infection caused by F. hepatica and F. gigantica. The study was aimed to use morphological markers for identification of fasciolids, generation of risk maps and use of rapid and cost effective diagnostic tool to reduce the impact of fasciolosis on animal health. The phenotypic features of adults and eggs of fasciolid species infecting buffaloes from central Punjab area, Pakistan, have been studied to characterize the fasciolid populations involved. Morphometric analyses were made by applying standardized measurements with a computer image analysis system (CIAS). The current investigation is first time conducted in Pakistan to confirm the taxonomic status of fasciolids by comparing with other pure standard populations viz., F. hepatica of European Mediterranean origins and F. gigantica representing Burkina Faso (Africa). In these geographical areas there is no overlapping of both fasciolids species. Only parasites obtained from bovines were employed. The climatic factors influencing fascioliasis presence and potential spread were analyzed from five meteorological stations during 1990 - 2010. The fascioliasis forecast risk Mt and Wb-bs (Water-Budget-Based System) indices and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), known to be useful for fascioliasis assessment, were obtained and correlated with geographical distribution, seasonality patterns and two-decade evolution of fascioliasis in livestock throughout the province. These two <b>climatic</b> <b>forecast</b> indices and a remote sensing marker are used to characterize the climatic factors and the earth surface in order to ascertain the epidemiological complexity and time-lag dynamics of fascioliasis. The seroprevalence of fascioliasis was also determined in sub-tropical Punjab with {{the application of a}} very sensitive and specific ELISA test by using monoclonal antibodies which are able to detect even very low intensity infection. The MM 3 Sero-ELISA was applied to check the status of fascioliasis. The increase of disease transmission risk in the lowlands should be highlighted, given that the largest part of the Punjab province includes low altitude, highly irrigated plains. The importance of livestock in this province makes this phenomenon to be given forecast priority assessment henceforth in order to establish the adequate control measures. The use of cost effective diagnostic tools would be helpful to reduce the impact of fascioliasis on animal health by selecting the appropriate anthelmintic treatment.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, the Arctic and North Atlantic have {{undergone}} substantial changes. Enhanced transport of warmer air from lower latitudes led to increased arctic surface air temperature associated with decreased arctic sea-level pressure and increased polar atmospheric cyclonicity which led to reductions in arctic ice extent and a decrease of ice thickness. Changes in the Arctic Ocean are also significant. Positive temperature anomalies in the intermediate Atlantic Water (AW) layer of the Arctic Ocean {{were found in the}} 1990 s and 2000 s. Freshwater content in the upper layer of the Arctic Ocean was also reduced dramatically over the recent decades. Concurrent with these high-latitude changes are North Atlantic warming and salinification in the upper 300 m layer (except the subpolar North Atlantic) and widespread cooling and freshening in the 1000 - 3000 m layer. We suggest that both long-term climate trend and low-frequency variability play a substantial role in shaping these recent changes in the Arctic/North Atlantic climate system.

Uncertainties in predictions of future bird species richness were geographically structured, mainly owing to uncertainties in projected precipitation changes. We conclude that assessments of future species responses to climate change {{are very sensitive to}} current uncertainties in regional climate-change projections, and to the inclusion or not of time-lagged interacting taxa.

A three-dimensional surface-water–groundwater model was developed to assess the effects of mid-Holocene climate change on water resources within the Crow Wing Watershed, Upper Mississippi Basin in north central Minnesota. The model was first calibrated to a 50 yr historical record of average annual surface-water discharge, monthly ground-water levels, and lake-level fluctuations. The model was able to reproduce reasonably well long-term historical records (1949 – 1999) of water-table and lake-level fluctuations across the watershed as well as stream discharge near the watershed outlet. The calibrated model was then used to reproduce paleo-groundwater and lake levels using climate reconstructions based on pollen-transfer functions from Williams Lake just outside the watershed. Computed declines in mid-Holocene lake levels for two lakes at opposite ends of the watershed were between 6 and 18 m. Simulated streamflow near the outlet of the watershed decreased to 70 % of modern average annual discharge after ∼ 200 yr. The area covered by wetlands for the entire watershed was reduced by ∼ 16 %.

40|$|Background: Changes {{in climate}} systems are {{increasing}} heat wave frequency and air stagnation, both conditions associated with exacerbating poor air quality and of considerable public health concern. Objectives: Heat {{and air pollution}} advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Whereas the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, {{little is known about}} the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior. Methods: Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions. Results: Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; in Portland, respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only ∼ 10 - 15 % claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM 2. 5 or ozone measurements.

Atmospheric dust loading {{is also one of the}} large uncertainties in global climate modeling, due to its significant impact on the radiation budget and atmospheric stability. Observations of dust storms in humid tropical south China (e. g. Hong Kong), are challenging due to high industrial pollution from the nearby Pearl River Delta region. This study develops a method for dust storm detection by combining ground station observations (PM 10 concentration, AERONET data), geostationary satellite images (MTSAT), and numerical weather and <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasting</b> products (WRF/Chem). The method is based on a hybrid neural network (NN) retrieval model for two scales: (i) a NN model for near real-time detection of dust storms at broader regional scale; (ii) a NN model for detailed dust storm mapping for Hong Kong and Taiwan. A feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) NN, trained using back propagation (BP) algorithm, was developed and validated by the k-fold cross validation approach. The accuracy of the near real-time detection MLP-BP network is 96. 6 %, and the accuracies for the detailed MLP-BP neural network for Hong Kong and Taiwan is 74. 8 %.

40|$|The {{wetlands}} in the Prairie Pothole Region {{and in the}} Great Plains {{are notorious}} for their sensitivity to weather variability. These wetlands have {{been the focus of}} considerable attention because of their ecological importance and because of the expected impact of climate change. Few models in the literature, however, take into account spatial variation in the importance of wetland drivers. This is surprising given the importance spatial heterogeneity in geomorphology and climatic conditions have in the region. In this paper, I use spatially-varying coefficients to assess the variation in ecological drivers in a number of ponds observed over a 50 -year period (1961 - 2012). I included the number of ponds observed the year before on a log scale, the log of total precipitation, and mean maximum temperature during the four previous seasons as explanatory variables. I also included a temporal component to capture change in the number of ponds due to anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, fall and spring precipitation were most important in pond abundance in the west, whereas winter and summer precipitation were the most important drivers in the east. The ponds in the east of the survey area were also more dependent on pond abundance during the previous year than those in the west. Spring temperature during the previous season influenced pond abundance; while the temperature during the other seasons had a limited effect. The ponds in the southwestern part of the survey area have been increasing independently of climatic conditions, whereas the ponds in the northeast have been steadily declining. My results underline the importance of accounting the spatial heterogeneity in environmental drivers, when working at large spatial scales. In light of my results, I also argue that assessing the impacts of climate change on wetland abundance in the spring, without more accurate <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasting,</b> will be difficult...|$|R

In our first approach, we compared each of these single-factor models using the Akaike Information Criterion, and produced a combined model weighting each factor (spatial, topographic, human, and climatic) according to Akaike weights. This procedure overestimated the best model, and the other factors were neglected in the combined model output. In our second approach, we produced a combined model using stepwise selection of the variables previously selected within each factor. In this way every factor was effectively represented in the combined explanatory model of the distributional response of the species to environmental conditions. This enabled the construction of models that combined climate with the other explanatory factors, to be later extrapolated to the future by replacing current climatic and human values with those expected from each emission and socio-economic scenario, while preserving spatial and topographic variables in the model.

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe {{problems}} faced by the world even today. Understanding the causative factors such as age, sex, social factors, environmental variability etc. as well as underlying transmission dynamics of the disease is important for epidemiological research on malaria and its eradication. Thus, development of suitable modeling approach and methodology, based on the available data on the incidence of the disease and other related factors is of utmost importance. In this study, we developed a simple non-linear regression methodology in modeling and forecasting malaria incidence in Chennai city, India, and predicted future disease incidence with high confidence level. We considered three types of data to develop the regression methodology: a longer time series data of Slide Positivity Rates (SPR) of malaria; a smaller time series data (deaths due to Plasmodium vivax) of one year; and spatial data (zonal distribution of P. vivax deaths) for the city along with the climatic factors, population and previous incidence of the disease. We performed variable selection by simple correlation study, identification of the initial relationship between variables through non-linear curve fitting and used multi-step methods for induction of variables in the non-linear regression analysis along with applied Gauss-Markov models, and ANOVA for testing the prediction, validity and constructing the confidence intervals. The results execute the applicability of our method for different types of data, the autoregressive nature of forecasting, and show high prediction power for both SPR and P. vivax deaths, where the one-lag SPR values plays an influential role and proves useful for better prediction. Different climatic factors are identified as playing crucial role on shaping the disease curve. Further, disease incidence at zonal level and the effect of causative factors on different zonal clusters indicate the pattern of malaria prevalence in the city. The study also demonstrates that with excellent models of <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> readily available, using this method one can predict the disease incidence at long forecasting horizons, with high degree of efficiency and based on such technique a useful early warning system can be developed region wise or nation wise for disease prevention and control activities...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{important}} role of climatic parameters such as radiation, temperature, precipitation and evaporation rate in water resources management, this study employed time series modeling to <b>forecast</b> <b>climatic</b> parameters. After normality test of the parameters, nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used in order to do trend analysis of data at P-value< 0. 05. Relative humidity and evaporation (with significant trend, - 0. 348 and - 0. 42 cm, respectively), as well as air temperature, wind speed, and sunshine were selected for time series modeling. Considering the Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF) and trend of data, appropriate models were fitted. The significance of the parameters of the selected models was examined by SE and t statistics, and both stationarity and invertibility conditions of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving average (MA) were also tested. Then, model calibration was carried out using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson- Darling and Rayan-Joiner. The selected ARIMA models are ARIMA(0, 0, 11) *(0, 0, 1), ARIMA(2, 0, 4) *(1, 1, 0), ARIMA(4, 0, 0) *(0, 1, 1), ARIMA (1, 0, 1) *(0, 1, 1), ARIMA (1, 0, 0) *(0, 1, 1) for relative humidity, evaporation, air temperature, wind speed and sunshine, respectively. The fitted models were then used to forecast the parameters. Finally, trend analysis of forecasted data was done in order to investigate the climate change.

40|$|The {{projected}} {{increase for}} Europe {{between the end}} of the 20 th and 21 st centuries varies from 2. 3 °C to 6 °C, depending on the scenario considered. Climate projections also indicate an increase in incidence of heat waves and extreme events. It is important to understand and quantify the consequences of all these factors in terms of health in the next decades as they are considered some of the key impacts of future climate change. They include both direct impacts, such as temperature-related illness and death, and the impacts of extreme weather events and indirect impacts, as those that cause water- and food-borne diseases. The PESETA II project of the European Commission – Joint Research Centre, started in 2011 aims at assessing these effects for EU 27 both in physical and economic terms, using quantitative modelling and literature review, in several fields (including health) following a bottom-up approach. Long term <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts</b> (up to 2100) from four different climate models referred to two alternative scenarios (A 1 B, with high emissions and E 1, with low emissions) are used as input in the health model. Age-specific population projections are elaborated from EUROSTAT data. Data and projections are available at NUTS 2 level for EU 27. The model assesses the impacts of both heat and heat waves on mortality and morbidity (respiratory diseases, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis). The model calculates the effects of temperature and temperature-related indicators using exposure-response functions calibrated on the basis of epidemiologic literature. At European level, on average, the climate change-attributable deaths will increase significantly over the next 90 years around 40, 000 additional annual deaths in the period between 2010 and 2040 to more than 140, 000 in the latest 30 years of the century. Comparing the baseline with climate change scenarios, first model results show that by 2100 the impact in terms of years of life lost for the whole Europe, will be around 12000 M Euros per year but there are sensitive differences among regions. Much lower impacts are found under the E 1 scenario and when some level of adaptation is assumed. The effects on food- and water-borne diseases are limited. Climate change is estimated to cause additional 7550 cases of salmonellosis per year if incidence remains at current levels. Alternative health economic evaluations have been proposed to quantify mortality and morbidity impacts. JRC. J. 1 -Economics of Climate Change, Energy and Transpor...|$|R

As a practical response to climate change, through the Pacific Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation planning Program (PACCSAP), enhanced web-based information tools to provide seasonal <b>forecasts</b> for <b>climatic</b> extremes in the Western Pacific have been developed. Using the dynamical seasonal prediction model POAMA (Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia), we aim to improve accuracy of seasonal forecasts of tropical cyclone activity and extreme sea surface temperatures for the Western Pacific. Since the PACCSAP has commenced, encouraging scientific and technological results have been obtained, particularly in the development of web-based information tools to provide <b>climatic</b> extremes <b>forecasts</b> in the Pacific and the Australian regions. Improvements to a statistical model for seasonal tropical cyclone prediction in the Australian region have been made. Additional functionality was added to the Pacific Tropical Cyclone Data Portal, such as enhanced flexibility of spatial and temporal selection. New web-based information tool for sea surface temperature seasonal prediction is also currently under development. Improved knowledge of extreme climatic events, together with the assistance of tailored forecast tools, will help enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of Australia and Pacific Island Countries under climate change...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to understand the daily cycle of the energy coupling between {{the land and the}} atmosphere in response to a forcing of incoming radiation at their common boundary, the land surface. This is of fundamental importance as that the initial/ boundary conditions of the land-surface state variables (e. g. soil moisture, soil temperature) exert strong control at various temporal scales on hydrologic, climatic and weather related processes. Hence diagnosing these state variables is crucial for extreme hydrological forecasting (flood/ drought), agronomic crop management as well as weather and <b>climatic</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Consequently in this thesis, the daily behavior of a simple land-atmosphere model is examined. A conceptual and linearized land-atmosphere model is first introduced and its response to a daily input of incoming radiation at the land surface is investigated. The solution of the different state and fluxes in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and in the soil are expressed as temporal Fourier series with vertically dependent coefficients. These coefficients highlight the impact of both the surface parameters and the frequency of the radiation on the heat propagation in the ABL and in the soil. The simplified model is shown to compare well with field measurements thus accounting for the main emergent behaviors of the system. The first chapter of the thesis describes the theoretical background of the equations governing the evolution of temperature and humidity in the ABL and in the soil. In the second chapter, the pioneering work of Lettau (1951), which inspired our approach is summarized. In his work Lettau studied the response of a simplified linearized land-atmosphere model to a sinusoidal net radiation forcing at the land surface. The third chapter of the thesis describes the SUDMED project, which took place in Morocco in 2003. During this project a wheat field was fully instrumented with continuous measurements of soil moisture, radiative fluxes, turbulent heat fluxes and soil heat flux. This site will be taken as a reference for model comparison. The fourth chapter of the thesis presents the three studies with distinctive goals. In these studies our linearized land-atmosphere model is first introduced. Then the propagation of the land-surface diurnal heating is presented and the model is compared to observations from the SUDMED project. Finally the repercussion of a land-surface energy budget error noise is investigated. Finally in the last chapter of the thesis we discuss possible evolution and improvements of the analytical coupled model presented in this thesis. In particular, it is emphasized that the non-linearity of the the boundary-layer height is of great importance for the predictability of the ABL state. by Pierre Gentine. Thesis (Ph. D.)
