40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is experiencing challenges as {{exploration and production}} are forced towards remote and deep reservoirs, combined with high cost-efficiency demands. Topside facilities struggle with limited space, and use of subsea processing equipment is increasing. Here, separation systems {{play an important role}} and has potential for improvement. Cyclonic separators are often referred to in association with compact separation systems. However, other types of separators have the potential of achieving compact designs. In order to meet rising challenges in the industry, this project involves an analytical and experimental study, seeking alternative or improved compact separation solutions. To define the state of existing technology, the analysis involved studies of fluid dynamic theory, gravitational and centrifugal separation principles, and "state-of-the-art" separators and concepts. The objective with the experimental study was to investigate separation capabilities for the less common centrifugal principle, namely the helically <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe.</b> The results of the analytical study implied that most compact systems utilise the centrifugal principle. Factors promoting the helical coil principle were defined. This included a simple pipe structure, excellent pressure-containment abilities, and previous helical coil experiments showed promising phase distributions. However, achieving stable phase distributions to allow separation seemed sensitive to variations in flow rate and <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe</b> geometry. The experimental study featured an air-water flow in a helically <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe.</b> The flow in the <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe</b> was photographed for a range of air and water flow rates, different numbers of loops, and different curvature radii. Images indicated that above certain air flow rates, the <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe</b> caused transition from stable to unstable phase distribution. Unstable phase distributions were typically recognised as plug or slug flow. The effect of having more than one loop in the coil reduced the air flow rate at which unstable flow developed. The effect of shortening the curvature radii increased the air flow rate that caused unstable flow. In other words, the helical coil achieved best results for short curvature length, either by minimising the number of loops or reducing the curvature radius. These measures indirectly caused a higher flow rate, because shorter curvature length reduces the frictional pressure loss. In addition, shorter curvature radius and higher flow rate increase the centrifugal effects. A different observation was that despite maintaining a favourable phase distribution throughout the <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe,</b> an instant transition to unstable flow could occur at coil outlet. This indicated that the stable distribution may not sustain downstream of the coil. The level of similitude between the experimental flow and a hypothetical full-scale gas-liquid flow was analysed. The analysis indicated that the experiment could suffer from scale-effects, because viscous- and surface tension forces become significant at small scales. The experimental study gave indications on separation capabilities, as achievement of stable phase distribution was possible for certain coil configurations and flow rates. However, the narrow operating range, and possible errors in the experiment, brought uncertainties to whether a full-scale helical coil could achieve phase separation. Hence the results in this thesis could neither prove nor disprove the helical coil as a phase separator. More comprehensive research is required to determine the separation capabilities. Recommendations for further work include larger experimental dimensions to reduce scale-effects, and using fluids that improve similarities to hydrocarbon flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} {{application of}} ground coupled {{heat pump system}} (GCHP) is restricted by the installation cost of conventional borehole ground heat exchangers (GHE), which is not only expensive but also requires additional ground area. The idea of combining the GHE with building foundation piles, i. e., the "energy pile," has arisen in recent years. The novel pile GHEs consisting of vertical spiral coils buried in the piles of a building, are proposed for their flexibility and convenience for applications. Evolved from existing models, a new spiral source model and its analytical solutions are established in this article for thermal analysis and design of the pile GHEs. The temperature field of the pile and its surrounding soil is simulated; in addition, the temperature responses of the <b>coil</b> <b>pipe</b> wall and the circulating water entering/effusing the pile GHE to the short time-step heat transfer loads are deduced based on the new spiral source model.

Flow patterns calculated by the model were used to evaluate the performance of various combinations of operating pumps and their orientation under steady-state indexed and transient oscillation modes. A model used for previous analyses has been updated to add the valve housing distribution piping and pipe clusters of the cooling coil supply system near pump no. 8 to the previous tank Type-I model. In addition, the updated model included twelve concrete support columns. This model would provide a more accurate assessment of sludge removal capabilities. The model focused on removal of the sludge heel located near the wall of Tank 5 using the two new slurry pumps. The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Tank Closure Project Engineering. Computational {{fluid dynamics}} models of Tank 5 with different operating conditions were developed using the FLUENT (trademark) code. The modeling results were used to assess the efficiency of sludge suspension and removal operations in the 75 -ft tank. The models employed a three-dimensional approach, a two-equation turbulence model, and an approximate representation of flow obstructions. The calculated local velocity was used as a measure of sludge removal and mixing capability. For the simulations, modeling calculations were performed with indexed pump orientations until an optimum flow pattern near the potential location of the sludge heel was established for sludge removal. The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 3801 gpm flowrate per nozzle could remove the sludge from the tank with a 101 in liquid level, based on a historical minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft/sec. The only exception is the region within maximum 4. 5 ft distance from the tank wall boundary at the we st corner of the tank. Further results showed that the capabilities of sludge removal were affected by the presence of twelve concrete support columns, the indexed pump orientation, the number of operating pumps, and the pump flowrate. The major impact of the results for the presence of the 2 -ft support columns is that the sludge cleaning distance is reduced by about 1. 5 ft, compared to the model with no support columns. However, the impact of the cleaning distance for the presence of 2 -in cooling <b>coil</b> <b>pipe</b> clusters near the pump nozzle is found to be negligible. Sensitivity results showed that for a given tank level and pump location, a higher pump flowrate would result in better performance in suspending and removing the sludge. The results also showed that the presence of flow obstructions such as concrete support columns were advantageous for certain pump orientations in terms of guidance of the flow direction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Helically <b>coiled</b> water <b>pipe</b> {{is widely}} used in industry, {{agriculture}} and other areas.

SUBPRO is an applied research center consisting of relevant contributors from the industry and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. One of their stated goals is to «develop new knowledge and technology to meet future challenges in subsea production and processing». This thesis is a continuation of the work previously done in the specialization project «Compact Separation; Concept Study of Helically <b>Coiled</b> <b>Pipe</b> and Preparation for Experimental Setup» and will later be continued as a PhD study. The objective of this thesis is to develop an experimental setup and conduct experiments to qualitatively determine the potential of using a helically <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe</b> as a compact separator or flow conditioner and its potential for further industrial development. In the end, recommendations based on the results is to be made. In addition, CFD simulations will be performed to support the data from the experiments. Main work done in this project consists of: 	Development of experimental setup. This includes completion of design, ordering of parts, construction, instrumentation and system testing and calibration. 	Generation of CAD drawings and CFD meshing for simulations. 	Simulations in Computational Fluid Dynamics. 	Execution of experiments with oil-water multiphase flow with varying oil ratio and flow rates. Simulations in Ansys CFX were performed so that numerical results that was difficult to obtain visually could be extracted. This includes separation performance, secondary flow and turbulence. The geometry used in the simulations was limited to the loop and one meter of straight section before and after the loop. Simulations were primarily done with mixture model but results from particle model simulations are also evaluated. The simulations indicated relatively low separation performance but showed a significant reduction in turbulence caused by the loop compared to a straight pipe section with the same length. The experiments conducted featured an oil-water phase in a helically <b>coiled</b> <b>pipe.</b> Photographs were taken of the flow at the inlet and outlet of the loop for a range of oil ratios and flow rates and were used to visually identify if any phase segregation occurred. None of the photos showed any indication of phase segregation in the experimental range. The flow regime at both the inlet and outlet was identified as various degrees of emulsion were a low oil ratio gave a pink emulsion with low degree of translucency and a high oil ratio gave a reddish emulsion with some translucency. The experiments were affected by problems with emulsion buildup in the separator, especially at low oil ratios, and turbidity in the water which gave the water a white color, hence reduced contrast to the oil. Due to limited time, only one coil geometry was tested. Less comprehensive tests with air-oil flow showed segregation of these two phases as stratified flow. The experimental study and results from the simulations gave no indications that the helical coil could be applicable as a compact separator for oil-water flows. However, due to the limited experimental range and sources of error this experimental study can t completely disprove the concept studied concept for oil-water flow. Improvements of the experimental setup including the ones mentioned in Recommendations for further work could yield other results.

For the helically coiled tube a constant wall temperature is considered. It appeared that heat transfer is highly influenced by secondary flow induced by centrifugal and buoyancy forces.
