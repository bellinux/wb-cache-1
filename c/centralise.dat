5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and <b>centralise.</b> The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E

In particular, this enables us to transfer existing lower bound results from distributed algorithms to <b>centralised</b> local algorithms...|$|R

For instance, a <b>centralised</b> frequency controller presented in [49] sends a signal to turn ON/OFF domestic air conditioning units and water heaters after a pre-set value of frequency rise/dip. The <b>centralised</b> controller reduces the uncertainty in the response of controllable units. However, the establishment of communications in the <b>centralised</b> method presents challenges, such as cost and latency.|$|R
5|$|In 1916, the {{executive}} board of the state railways wanted to <b>centralise</b> the operation of restaurant carriages {{and the most important}} station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the Sørland Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.|$|E

Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, at Kongens gate 29 until 1932, and at Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to <b>centralise</b> both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at Jernbanetorget, but the project was cancelled. The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms {{across the street from}} Oslo Ø. However, the plans were blocked by Parliament (which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels). Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10, in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} Wars of the Roses, a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty.

5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime.

The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to <b>centralise</b> and Europeanise the {{government}} of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} new ministry, {{which set}} up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to <b>centralise</b> Nazi control of all aspects of German {{cultural}} and intellectual life.

An unstated goal was to present to other nations {{the impression that the}} NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorizing the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to <b>centralise</b> control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to <b>centralise</b> power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—When {{orchestrating}} data-centric workflows as {{are commonly}} found in the sciences, <b>centralised</b> servers can become a bottleneck {{to the performance of}} a workflow; output from service invocations are always transferred via a <b>centralised</b> orchestration engine, when they should be passed directly to where they are needed at the next service in the workflow.

Our architecture maintains the robustness and simplicity of <b>centralised</b> orchestration, but facilitates choreography by allowing services to exchange data directly with one another, reducing data that needs to be transferred through a <b>centralised</b> server.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose is}} to analyse the {{prerequisites}} and effects of <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning at IKEA, and to explore how the planning process, planning system, and planning organization make up a <b>centralised</b> planning approach. Design/methodology/approach - The paper {{is based on a}} longitudinal case study of IKEA's implementation of global supply chain planning. The literature review generated a framework which identifies prerequisites for, approaches to, and the effects of and obstacles to <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning. This framework was used to analyse IKEA’s supply chain planning before and after the implementation. Finally, we reflected upon the learning from IKEA and refined the framework. Findings - A number of prerequisites for <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning were identified: functional products, vertical integration, a dominating organization possessing the power and competence to enforce the implementation, and the use of one planning domain possessing all critical planning information. The direct effects of <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning were related to supply chain integration, standardisation, specialisation, and learning effects. Implementing <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning in an appropriate planning context led to several operational performance improvements. Obstacles were mainly related to human and organizational, as well as to software and data issues. Research limitations/implications - This is a first approach towards development of a framework of how to design, use and benefit from <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning. The developed conceptual model, which is refined through the case study, offers some generalizability in researching <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning. Practical implications - The findings show that <b>centralised</b> supply chain planning is a necessity for a large and growing, global supply chain striving for low-cost production and efficiency.

30|$|Consumer {{oriented}} algorithms typically {{focus on}} maximising {{the amount of}} charge that can be allocated to a customer in a given time period. It is usually desired to achieve this in a fair manner, providing a satisfactory quality of service (QoS), without violating system constraints, and minimising {{the cost to the}} customer. Many algorithms have been proposed using a <b>centralised</b> framework, the aim of which is to maximise the amount of charge allocated to customers [13, 17]. Here <b>centralised</b> implies that all the information in the network is available to a <b>centralised</b> controller, which in turn processes the information and decides the charge each EV will receive. These algorithms are typically based on linear programming techniques. While <b>centralised</b> coordination gives the best performance possible [18], <b>centralised</b> algorithms require access to global system information, which might not always be accessible, and <b>centralised</b> algorithms typically do not scale well [18, 19, 20]. For these reasons, several decentralised strategies have been proposed recently for EV charging [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In decentralised charging strategies individual EVs are given a certain level of decision making autonomy. Often individual EV chargers send a limited amount of information to a <b>centralised</b> unit which in turn provides some global coordination of their decisions, to a degree determined by the algorithm in use.|$|R
