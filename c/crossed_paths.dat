These accounts show that he had vowed in previous existences {{to be the first}} to comprehend the dharma when it was to be proclaimed by an enlightened Buddha.

To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{two seasons}} of Carnivàle {{take place in}} the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first {{involves}} a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{southern}} landowner, Thơ {{was born in the}} province of Long Xuyên in the Mekong Delta. He began his bureaucratic career in 1930, serving the French colonial authorities as a low-profile provincial chief. During World War II, Thơ rose to become the first secretary of the Resident Superior of Annam, the French governor of the central region of Vietnam. During this time, he <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> with Ngô Đình Diệm, a former Interior Minister under the French regime in the 1930s. The French thought that Diệm was working with Imperial Japan and tried to have him arrested, but Thơ tipped off Diệm and the Kempeitai, resulting in their escape.|$|E

5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} seaworthy, so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a caravan of travelling merchants whom they <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> with. Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used {{the cover of a}} sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but many members of the caravan were killed or enslaved. Three and a half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275. On reaching the Yuan court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.|$|E
5|$|No.5 SFTS began flight {{training}} in February 1942 using 28 Wirraways. The unit grew {{over the next}} two years, and by early 1944 was operating 128 Wirraways, two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, two de Havilland Moth Minors and a CAC Wackett. It typically graduated one course of pilots each month, although the wastage rate sometimes exceeded 40 per cent. Among its graduates was Len Waters, the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator, and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the RAAF during World WarII. As a training facility, No.5 SFTS regularly suffered flying accidents. Forty-two of its students died during the war, an average of around one per month. A near miss involving more experienced pilots occurred at the school in December 1943, when aces Clive Caldwell and John Waddy, then instructors at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, almost collided when they <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> during an aerobatics display over the base.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{previous}} rebirths {{in which}} Koṇḍañña and Gautama Buddha <b>crossed</b> <b>paths</b> are also noted in Pali literature. The Mahavastu cites a previous birth in which Koṇḍañña was a seafaring merchant {{who had lost}} all his wealth after a mid-ocean shipwreck. Koṇḍañña then {{went in search of}} the king of Kosala, who had a widely known reputation for philanthropy. However, the Kosalan monarch had left his kingdom and surrendered his kingdom to the neighbouring Kasi king. The king of Kosala had done so to avert bloodshed, since the Kasi king had threatened to invade. Nevertheless, the Kasi king wanted to capture the Kosalan king and decreed a large reward for it. The Kosalan king (Gautama Buddha in a previous rebirth) tied himself and asked the merchant to deliver him to Kasi so that the merchant would no longer be in poverty. However, when the Kasi king heard this, he withdrew his army and restored the Kosalan monarchy. The Kosalan king subsequently bestowed wealth on the merchant. Gautama Buddha cited this occurrence to illustrate how the ties between living beings extended into their previous existences. In another rebirth described in the Mahavastu, Koṇḍañña and his four colleagues who were to become the first bhikkhus were seafaring merchants under the command of the future Gautama Buddha. The future Buddha sacrificed himself to save them from an ocean death. The Divyavadana describes two further rebirths of Koṇḍañña. In one he was a bird named Uccangama. In another, he was a tigress and Gautama Buddha another tiger. The future Buddha sacrificed his own life by offering himself as meat to the hungry tigress so that it would not eat its own cubs.|$|E
