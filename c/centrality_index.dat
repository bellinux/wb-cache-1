However, it is still unclear which of the scoring systems has a better outcome in predicting functional outcomes after partial nephrectomy. In the present study, we assess the use of R. E. N. A. L. (Radius, Exophytic/endophytic properties of the tumor, Nearness of tumor deepest portion to the collecting system or sinus, Anterior/posterior descriptor and Location relative to the polar line.), PADUA (preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical score), and <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> scores to predict the renal function for patients who underwent partial nephrectomy. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 cases with renal tumors managed with open partial nephrectomy at our institution from January 2008 to October 2013. R. E. N. A. L., PADUA, and <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> scores were assigned according to the described protocols for those systems. We evaluated the association between scoring systems and both early and late postoperative functional outcomes. Results: The {{mean age of the}} study population was 56 years. Of the patients, 18 (69 %) were men. The mean tumor size was 4. 04  cm. Each scoring system performed significant correlation with both early and late functional outcomes (p <  0. 05), whereas R. E. N. A. L nephrometry and PADUA classification showed high correlation (− 0. 715 and − 0. 721) and <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> showed moderate correlation (0. 451). Diameter of tumors, as a single anatomical parameter, does not correlate with functional outcome significantly (p =  0. 974 1 day after surgery and p =  0. 865 1 year after surgery). Conclusion: R.

40|$|Abstract. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{are prone}} to failures. To be robust to failures, the network {{topology}} should provide alternative routes to the sinks so when failures occur the routing protocol can still offer reliable delivery. We define l-CRC, a new <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> which measures a node’s importance to connectivity and efficient delivery in the network. We then use this <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> {{to concentrate on the}} most important nodes, providing alternative paths around the nodes with high centrality. Varying l-CRC allows us to trade off cost for robustness. We introduce GRASP-ABP, a local search algorithm for initial robust topology design. We evaluate the algorithm empirically {{in terms of the number}} of additional nodes it suggests and its runtime. We then evaluate the robustness of the designs against node failures in simulation, and we demonstrate that the centrality-based GRASP-ABP’s designs are able to offer reliable delivery, comparable to competitor algorithms, but with fewer additional relays and faster runtime. Key words: wireless sensor networks, network deployment planning, relay placement, centrality. ...|$|E

The coordination performance of these project participants is important for effective management {{and needs to be}} assessed periodically. However, there is no uncomplicated quantitative way to measure coordination. Measuring coordination is cumbersome and time-consuming particularly during the project execution phase. This study proposes an easy procedure for monitoring the coordinative performance of project participants. The degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality measures of the project participants in a wayfinding signage project at a major airport construction project are calculated using social network analysis on the e-mail communication network between the participants. A <b>centrality</b> <b>index</b> is defined for each firm based on the average of these three centrality measures.

Recent literature includes studies addressing the relationship between coordinative activity and the configuration of communication networks. In these works, the role of network centrality is investigated through the basic standard centrality measures of degree, betweenness, and closeness. Current social network analysis research emphasizes new formulations of centrality measures for robust structural analysis of project networks.
