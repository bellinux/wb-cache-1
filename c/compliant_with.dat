40|$|A gravity {{balancer}} is {{a mechanism}} that compensates {{the weight of}} a mass over a range of motion. When no friction is present, this gives an energy efficient mechanism and little effort is required to move an object. Conventional mechanisms have drawbacks due to the use of conventional rigid joints. Compliant joints do not have these disadvantages, can be made from fewer parts and can increase performance compared to rigid body joints. The goal {{of this paper is to}} develop a single degree of freedom gravity balancer where all the rigid joints are replaced <b>with</b> <b>compliant</b> joints. To reach this goal a new method has been developed. The method is based on connecting rigid links <b>with</b> <b>compliant</b> joints. <b>With</b> a constant potential energy as objective, the method allows new gravity balancers to be designed. It can be concluded that for the first time a gravity balancers has been constructed where all the rigid joints are replaced <b>with</b> <b>compliant</b> joints. The gravity balancer had a peak moment reduction of 93 %. The presented method is extensible and allows others to understand and to further develop gravity balancers <b>with</b> <b>compliant</b> joints for other applications.

5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names.

At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E

The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations.

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans.

5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> the DVI Specification.|$|E

This paper presents the new solution of adaptive <b>compliant</b> gripper finger <b>with</b> embedded actuators. Embedded actuators (within gripper finger structure) are able to morph shape of the grasping surface to accommodate different objects. Novel approach to the synthesis of <b>compliant</b> mechanisms <b>with</b> embedded actuators is also presented. The main contribution {{of this approach is}} that optimization of the actuator placement is included in the design process.

5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new analysis approach for optimal design of proportional <b>compliant</b> mechanisms <b>with</b> corner-filleted flexure hinges. It {{is the first}} time to use pseudo rigid body model (PRBM) for cantilever beams to analyze the connecting flexure hinges. The rotation center and rotational angle of each flexure hinge are corrected by means of charac-teristics radius factor (γ) and parametric angle coefficient (Cθ). The displacement proportion equation for such mechanisms is derived according to the new approach. Combining the new proposed design equation with the existed stiffness equation, a new proportion <b>compliant</b> mechanism <b>with</b> corner-filleted flexure hinges is designed by means of the least squares optimization. The designed models are verified by finite element analysis. I...|$|R
