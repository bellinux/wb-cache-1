Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) {{to steer the}} Enterprise into the Neutral Zone, where Romulan warbirds lie in wait. When the real Kirk {{eventually}} regains consciousness, he orders the Enterprise {{to get out of}} the Neutral Zone at Warp 8. The Vendorian who has been shapeshifting himself into other members of the Enterprises crew eventually reveals itself to Lieutenant Anne Nored (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), Carter Winston's fiancee who serves as a security officer aboard the Enterprise; the alien further states that the real Winston is dead but, because it has absorbed Carter's feelings for her, it <b>can</b> <b>love</b> her.|$|E
5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she <b>can</b> <b>love</b> him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E

25|$|The Parable of the Prodigal Son {{is also a}} {{recurring}} theme {{in the works of}} Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted the parable in a different way to the conventional reading. His version of the parable was not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son <b>can</b> <b>love</b> God more, even if this love is not returned.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} {{he goes to}} the play himself and sees his lover at a play called First Love; for him this is a sign, like a four leaf clover, that she must be the one. But {{confusion}} sets in for the poor girl because of mistaken identity. She is unable to make up her mind about love and says, [...] "The first love is the true love, and one loves only once." [...] But Kierkegaard says this is sophistry [...] "because the category first, {{is at the same time}} a qualitative and a numerical category." [...] Her first impression of love, when she was eight, has become decisive for her whole life. [...] Now she <b>can</b> <b>love</b> only to a certain degree because she's comparing each new experience with the past experience. Kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{has stated}} that [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] {{represents}} [...] "where I'm at in my life now".

It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including [...] "dancing with molly", using a slang term for ecstasy, and [...] "trying to get a line [...] in the bathroom". After initial confusion whether the former lyric was [...] "dancing with molly" [...] or [...] "dancing with Miley", Cyrus clarified that she was referring to ecstasy, commenting that [...] "if you’re aged ten it’s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know.

500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because {{he has nothing to}} give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests in the end that she <b>can</b> <b>love</b> {{the fact that he has}} nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People <b>can</b> <b>love</b> us or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, from {{a purely}} {{linguistic}} point of view, {{there is the}} dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet {{is a type of}} planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: [...] "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)." [...] As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, [...] "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one <b>can</b> <b>love,</b> dwarf planet." [...] Mike Brown noted {{in an interview with the}} Smithsonian that, [...] "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word [...] "dwarf planet," [...] but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets." ...|$|E

Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you <b>can</b> <b>love</b> your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.
