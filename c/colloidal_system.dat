40|$|This review {{focuses on}} recent {{developments}} in the theoretical, numerical and experimental study of slow dynamics in <b>colloidal</b> <b>systems,</b> with a particular emphasis on the glass transition phenomenon. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>systems</b> appear to be particularly suited for tackling the general problem of dynamic arrest, since they show a larger flexibility compared to atomic and molecular glasses because of their size {{and the possibility of}} manipulating the physical and chemical properties of the samples. Indeed, a wealth of new effects, not easily observable in molecular liquids, have been predicted and measured in <b>colloidal</b> <b>systems.</b> The slow dynamic behavior of three classes of colloidal suspension is reviewed - hard colloids, short-range attractive colloids and soft <b>colloidal</b> <b>systems</b> - selecting the model systems among the most prominent candidates for grasping the essential features of dynamic arrest. Emphasis is on the possibility of performing a detailed comparison between experimental data and theoretical predictions based on the mode coupling theory of the glass transition. Finally, the importance of understanding the system's kinetic arrest phase diagram, i. e. the regions in phase space where disordered arrested states can be expected, is stressed. When and how these states are kinetically stabilized with respect to the ordered lowest free energy phases is then examined in order to provide a framework for interpreting and developing new ideas in the study of new materials...|$|R
50|$|Interface and colloid {{science is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} intersection of branches of chemistry, physics, nanoscience and other fields dealing with colloids, heterogeneous systems {{consisting of a}} mechanical mixture of particles between 1 nm and 1000 nm dispersed in a continuous medium.

50|$|Colloidal {{particles}} are {{the components of}} a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.

Soluble particles smaller than this will form a solution {{as opposed to a}} colloid. Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of interface and colloid science. Suspended solids may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an aerosol. Particles may also be suspended in the form of atmospheric particulate matter, which may constitute air pollution. Larger particles can similarly form marine debris or space debris. A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a granular material.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for estimating the particle-particle interaction energy in a <b>colloidal</b> <b>system</b> through incipient aggregation in an isotropic turbulent field is proposed. With this technique, we first determine experimentally the critical (i. e., minimum) energy dissipation rate that induces aggregation {{in a given}} stable <b>colloidal</b> <b>system.</b> Then, assuming DLVO interparticle potentials, we can estimate the surface charge and potential by determining the critical relative trajectory of two particles leading to aggregation. It {{is worth noting that}} the interparticle interaction potential estimated by this technique accounts in an effective manner also for all the other non-DLVO interparticle interactions that may be present in the system. In other words, using the surface charge value estimated by this technique in the frame of a DLVO model allows us to reproduce correctly the conditions under which the <b>colloidal</b> <b>system</b> was found experimentally to undergo aggregation in a turbulent field. An experimental verification of the proposed technique is shown using a fluorinated polymer latex. It was found that the obtained value of the surface charge is very close to that measured by conductometric titration and is practically constant in the investigated range of particle volume fraction and ionic strength values.
