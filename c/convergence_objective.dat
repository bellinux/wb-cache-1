40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global problem and across the world there are major {{difficulties}} being experienced in reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO 2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies {{carried out by the}} authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO 2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change and some possible synergies.,, Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and <b>convergence</b> <b>objectives.</b> CO 2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO 2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO 2 emissions.,, The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a ‘strategic conversation’ at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{official}} {{debut of}} the convergence process between the IFRS and the US GAAP standards {{took place in}} 2002, after IASB and FASB signed the Norwalk Agreement, a memorandum of understanding in which both parties stated their engagement to develop high-quality and compatible standards, with {{the ultimate goal of}} a single set of high-quality global accounting standards. The 2002 Norwalk Agreement was reinforced after the publication, in 2006, of a new memorandum document, The Roadmap for Convergence, in which the two regulatory bodies stated their short-term and long-term <b>objectives</b> for the <b>convergence</b> process. One of the long-term <b>convergence</b> <b>objectives</b> regarding the consolidated financial statements, materialized in joint projects – Business Combinations and Consolidations – can be considered completed after the issuance of the new versions of IFRS 3 in 2008 and of IAS 27, IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 in 2011. But are we there yet? Given that the accounting convergence process had become, for some time now, one of the most debated and challenging issues for practitioners, regulators and researchers, we show the same special interest in the research undertaken. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to establish the level of convergence between the two most representative sets of accounting standards applicable to entities in the private sector. Unlike previous studies carried out on this topic, which measure the general accounting harmonization for private sector, our study focuses on a specific issue, namely the formal accounting harmonization between IFRS and US GAAP regulations regarding consolidated financial statements. The research methodology used for achieving our objective was based on some statistical tools, such as correlation and/or association coefficients. The result reveals that IFRS have substantially converged with US GAAP, at least in the area of consolidated financial reporting, but there still exist some differences between the two referentials...|$|R
