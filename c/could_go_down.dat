25|$|The staff's {{indifference}} {{to many of}} the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> together.|$|E
25|$|In {{southern}} Greenpoint, the Franklin Street routing {{would use}} either Kent Avenue or Berry Street (using Banker Street). The other two options <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> Wythe Avenue, Berry Street, or Bedford Avenue, via Nassau Avenue or Norman Street. The four options would merge into two (Kent Avenue and Wythe Avenue) south of Division Avenue in Williamsburg. South of there, {{all of the}} options would then cut through the Brooklyn Navy Yard using Assembly Street. At Clinton Avenue, the BQX would have three options to the west to access Downtown Brooklyn, Dumbo, or Brooklyn Heights. The BQX could use Market Street and Eighth Street; Flushing Avenue; or Park Avenue. The Eighth Street option would merge onto Flushing Avenue at Cumberland Street in Fort Greene. At Navy Street, the two routings had three options: go to Dumbo using Gold Street, Front/York Streets, and Cadman Plaza East; go to Downtown Brooklyn using Navy Street, Ashland Place, Willoughby Place, and Joralemon Street; or use Tillary Street to access Brooklyn Heights. At Joralemon and Court Streets, all of the options would turn south down Court Street and then west along Atlantic Avenue.|$|E
500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had {{to go down to}} the lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below.

500|$|During the 2005–06 season, Laich {{played in}} 104 {{regular season and}} playoff games between the Capitals and their new AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears; this tied him for the most games played in the {{organization}} with Boyd Gordon. After training camp, he started the season in the AHL, but was optimistic about his chances {{to play in the}} NHL, saying, [...] "You've just got to work hard. There's spots up there, guys <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> with an injury, {{you want to be the}} first guy called up." [...] He spent most of the season at the NHL level, playing in 73 games and recording 21 points. After the Capitals' season was over, Laich rejoined the Bears for their playoff run and scored eight goals in 21 games while helping the team capture the Calder Cup. Laich played the entire 2006–07 season with the Capitals, scoring eight goals and adding ten assists. After the season, Laich and the Capitals went to salary arbitration, where he was awarded a one-year contract worth $725,000.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Forestier-Walker went to {{the bridge}} and asked Captain Holland for orders. The {{possibility}} of landing the troops and crew on the rocks was considered, and at 03:25, the captain sent two officers, Lieutenants Dobbin and Windham, over the bow on ropes to inspect {{the safety of the}} rocks, equipped with blue lights. The lieutenants determined that the rocks were safe, and Captain Holland ordered the evacuation of the ship to begin at 04:00; the men began climbing down the rope ladders. Originally, the captain wanted to keep the women and children on board until daylight, when it would be safer to evacuate them, but the ship started to list severely at 04:20, and it was decided that the evacuation should continue without delay. The electrical systems on the ship failed at 04:35, after which the evacuation was forced to continue in complete darkness. Around 05:00, the better swimmers were permitted to jump overboard and swim to shore on their own; the shore was around [...] away. A member of the Rifle Corps, Private N. McNamara, strung a line between the ship and the shore, and heavier ropes were subsequently set up. The remaining men <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the rope, making the evacuation safer. The ship was completely evacuated by 05:30. Two people died during the evacuation.|$|E
2500|$|In Cobble Hill, {{the route}} {{could go in}} one of three directions. It could {{continue}} to the west end of Atlantic Avenue and then southward down Columbia Street, serving the Columbia Street Waterfront District; serve the residential section of Cobble Hill via Henry, Congress, and Columbia Streets; or turn down Hicks Street. The two Columbia Street options would need to go around the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel toll plaza, while the Hicks Street option would use Sackett and Union Streets to use Van Brunt and Richards Streets, thus bypassing this detour. South of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel toll plaza, the Van Brunt/Richards Streets option would travel down to the streets' south end to Beard Street and turn eastward there, while the Columbia Street option <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to either Mill or Bay Streets, then travel eastward at one of these two streets. The Mill Street option would go across the Gowanus Canal using 10th Street, while the Bay Street option further south could either use the existing 10th Street bridge or a new 19th Street bridge to cross the canal.|$|E

The eastern shore is state-owned, but parts of {{the western side of}} the lake are privately owned. Salinity of the lake water is now reported as 15‰ (parts per thousand). Lake water fluctuations are minimal, at about , except during the drought period, when the water level <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> by [...] Conversely, the water level rises about [...] above the average during heavy rainfall years.

The present assessment is that the level of the lake has been rising in recent years, forcing Haitians who live in plantation residential areas ("bateyes") {{around the edge of the}} lake to seek higher ground.|$|E
2500|$|Goodrem {{states that}} [...] "This time around I {{had time to}} think 'What kind of song do I want to create here?'", [...] "I really felt the sky was the limit with this record, you could do {{anything}} in a song. I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been keeping an eye on Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts".|$|E
