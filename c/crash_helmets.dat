25|$|In para-Alpine skiing, {{the skier}} uses a mono-ski, which are {{required}} to have breaks {{on both sides of}} the ski. The chair can detach from a ski. Helmets are required for this class in para-Alpine competition, with slalom helmets required for slalom and <b>crash</b> <b>helmets</b> required for the giant slalom. The para-Nordic sit-ski configuration has two skis. Skiers in this classification can use a sit-ski and outriggers, which are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no ski poles in para-Alpine and para-Nordic. While skiers are {{prohibited}} from using traditional ski poles, they may use mini poles {{so long as they}} are unable to hold a traditional ski pole without the use of a prostheses. Skiers are also allowed to use prostheses or orthoses in competition. FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are followed for this class.

25|$|The raid {{started a}} few minutes before midnight, when policemen massed outside the school. A police officer {{attacked}} British journalist Mark Covell, who tried to tell them he was a journalist. Within seconds, more policemen joined in the attack, beating him with nightsticks to the ground. According to Covell, one policeman kicked him in the chest, breaking half-a-dozen ribs whose splintered ends then shredded the membrane of his left lung, and laughed. Other policemen kicked him around, breaking his hand and damaging his spine. The police then used an armoured police van to break through the school gates and 150 policemen, wearing <b>crash</b> <b>helmets</b> and carrying truncheons and shields, entered the school compound.|$|E
40|$|The "snorfiets" is a moped with {{a limited}} speed of 20 km and on which the wearing of a <b>crash</b> <b>helmet</b> is not compulsory. It was first {{introduced}} in the netherlands {{at the beginning of}} 1976. The danger for drivers on the "snorfiets" is expected to be greater than for cyclists, smaller than for moped riders without a <b>crash</b> <b>helmet</b> but equal to that for moped riders wearing a <b>crash</b> <b>helmet.</b> The influence of the introduction of the "snorfiets" on traffic safety in general is expected to be only small. In spite of the low speed limit of the "snorfiets" the wearing of a <b>crash</b> <b>helmet</b> would decrease the fatality and injury rate...|$|R

25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, rising race speeds {{began to make}} the track {{increasingly}} dangerous, and in the period 1931–1935 there were 15 fatalities. This forced another repavement, with tarmac replacing the bricks {{in parts of the}} track. In addition, during the 1935–36 seasons the inside wall was removed in the corners, the outside wall was realigned (to change the angle compared to the track, reducing the potential for cars to vault over it), hard <b>crash</b> <b>helmets</b> became mandatory, and the first yellow light system was installed around the track. The continuing track dangers during this period, however, did not stop Louis Meyer or Wilbur Shaw from becoming the first two three-time winners, with Shaw also being the first back-to-back winner in 1939 and 1940.|$|E
500|$|There were rioters at {{the bottom}} of the stairs too, wearing masks or <b>crash</b> <b>helmets,</b> and {{carrying}} knives, baseball bats, bricks and petrol bombs. As the firefighters and police ran out of the stairwell toward a car park and a patch of grass, one of the firemen, Trevor Stratford, saw that Blakelock had tripped: [...] "He just stumbled and went down and they were upon him. It was just mob hysteria.... There were about 50 people on him." ...|$|E

LW10 para-Nordic sit-skiers can use a sit-ski with outrigger skis, which are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. They sometimes use a quadriplegic ski, called a [...] "Swing-Bo", which was designed to give the skier better steering, and rely less on outriggers. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E

40|$|Wearing a <b>crash</b> <b>helmet</b> is an {{important}} contribution to road safety. If a helmet is worn, the risk of being killed in a motorcycle crash decreases by about 42 %. In the Netherlands, compulsory <b>crash</b> <b>helmet</b> wearing for motorcyclists was introduced in 1972, and the obligation for moped riders followed in 1975. Compulsory helmet wearing became generally accepted after its introduction. In spite of this, about 25 % of moped riders and 13 % of motorcyclists admitted to hospital after a crash still have severe head/skull injuries. This may partly be caused by the helmet not being fastened properly. Especially the percentage of moped riders properly wearing the helmet has not increased, despite intensified police enforcement. SWOV recommends a more targeted enforcement and more public information...|$|R
