50|$|A basic {{stepping}} switch is an electrically operated rotary switch {{with a single}} (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical rotary switches, the single terminal connects {{to one of the}} multiple terminals by rotating a <b>contact</b> <b>arm,</b> sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch.|$|E
5000|$|Another special was the NCB Gyro or Electrogyro Locomotive. Based on a [...] 4-wheeled 0-4-0 frame {{fitted with}} two [...] "gyro units" [...] (see Flywheel energy storage) made by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon of Switzerland. The gyros were principally a 3ton {{horizontal}} flywheel enclosed in a vessel filled with low pressure hydrogen. A vertically mounted three-phase squirrel-cage electric motor/generator was directly coupled to each flywheel shaft. The motor took its power from a side-mounted supply at static posts via a four-contact swinging arm extended or retracted pneumatically by the driver. Power {{could only be}} taken whilst the loco was stationary alongside one of these posts. When the gyros had reached the required speed, the driver would retract the <b>contact</b> <b>arm,</b> switch the motor to generation and controlled the locomotive {{in a similar way}} to a diesel-electric loco. Charging posts had to be strategically placed around the site. A <b>contact</b> <b>arm</b> was provided {{on each side of the}} locomotive, although it is not clear if posts were installed on one or both sides of the track. Each gyro operated between 3,000rpm when fully 'charged;' and 1,800rpm before recharging. Recharging took 2minutes and the locomotive could work for around 30 minutes before recharging. It weighed 34tons and had a maximum speed of 15 mph.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} for {{the case of a}} many valley host {{semiconductor}} an edge channel (EC) related non-local behaviour can persist also in the 3 D-regime where the quantum Hall effect (QHE) is already quenched. We demonstrate that the QHE is replaced by conductance fluctuations due to EC backscattering in the <b>contact</b> <b>arms,</b> which leads to a fluctuating current redistribution between a dissipative bulk electron system and a less-dissipative EC-system. Both electron systems are located in different valleys of the band structure.

5000|$|A {{rotary switch}} {{consists}} of a spindle or [...] "" [...] that has a <b>contact</b> <b>arm</b> or [...] "spoke" [...] which projects from its surface like a cam. It has an array of terminals, arranged {{in a circle around}} the rotor, each of which serves as a contact for the [...] "spoke" [...] through which any {{one of a number of}} different electrical circuits can be connected to the rotor. The switch is layered to allow the use of multiple poles, each layer is equivalent to one pole. Usually such a switch has a detent mechanism so it [...] "clicks" [...] from one active position to another rather than stalls in an intermediate position. Thus a rotary switch provides greater pole and throw capabilities than simpler switches do.|$|E
50|$|The {{town council}} of Torquay {{did not want}} their seaside resort {{disfigured}} by the poles and overhead wires of a conventional electric tramway and so invited the Dolter Electric Traction Company to construct a tramway using their stud-contact system. A horse was killed after it stepped on a live stud during construction of the Torquay Tramways. Each tram car was then fitted with a bell connected to a special <b>contact</b> <b>arm</b> to warn the driver if a stud remained live after it had passed. The conductor of the tram then had to reset the crank using an insulated mallet. During the Board of Trade inspection of the tramway four such studs were detected during about 8 mi of tests. There were also frequent problems with trams being stopped when a stud failed to be made live when needed. The network covered 6.79 mi and opened in stages during 1907 and 1908. On 27 January 1910 a snow storm stopped all the trams as they couldn't {{make contact with the}} studs. It was converted to overhead collection in 1911 shortly before it was extended to Paignton where the town council had refused to allow the Dolter system to be used.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor‘s {{thesis is}} {{focuses on the}} issue of {{designing}} electrical switching devices, especially dimensioning of the current-carrying paths according to the effects of electrodynamic forces. There are dimensioning requirements for current carrying paths of switching devices in the introductory chapter. Fundamental requirements are: sufficient dielectric strength between parts at different potential, resistance to thermal effects of electric current and current path arrangement considering electrodynamic forces. Typical current path arrangements of electrical apparatuses are justified in second chapter. Furthermore, the actual problems to solve are formulated, corresponding with the development of technical solutions. Emphasis is laid upon proper description of modifications of the proposal so to limit their negative impact of secondary phenomena such as electrodynamic forces or thermal effects. The best solutions then directly positively use these phenomena. The present progressive technical solutions retrieved in a patented state of the art using Goldfire Innovator software are described in the third chapter. The work is then focused on rotary contact arrangement patents from the very first, through the pioneering patent to the present. Hereinafter are described the features of the evolution of technology development – micro and macrosegmentation. In the last chapter, there are analytically calculated electrodynamic forces acting on the <b>contact</b> <b>arm</b> of low voltage circuit breaker in both open and closed state and medium voltage disconnector.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Using the Internet to {{replicate}} client/counselor interactions provides a tremendous opportunity to disseminate interventions at relatively low cost per participant. However, there are substantial challenges with this approach. The Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (WLM) compared two long-term weight-maintenance interventions: (1) a personal <b>contact</b> <b>arm</b> and (2) an Internet arm, {{to a third}} self-directed control arm. The Internet arm focused on use of an interactive website for support of long-term weight maintenance. This paper describes a highly interactive self-assessment tool developed {{for use in the}} WLM trial Internet intervention arm. Methods: The Tailored Self-Assessment (TSA) website tool was an interactive resource for those WLM participants assigned to the Internet arm to review their personal weight-management progress and make choices about future weightmanagement actions. The TSA was highly tailored and ended with a suggested list of personalized action plans. While the participant could complete the TSA at any time, criteria-based reminder messages prompted participation. Results: The TSA was one of 27 interactive tools on the WLM website. Over the course of the 28 months, the TSA was completed 800 times by the 348 randomized participants. Fifty-three percent of the participants (185 / 348) used the TSA at least once (range: 0, 110) and 72 % of the 185 participants who did complete the TSA at least once, completed it more than once. Conclusion: The Internet has great potential to impact health behavior by attempting {{to replicate}} personal counseling. We learned that while development is complex and appears costly, tailored strategies based on client feedback are likel...|$|E
40|$|Interactions between viral coat {{proteins}} {{determine the}} size and shape of the virus capsid. Therefore, the plain closed shell of a spherical virus provides an excellent resource for studying and testing protein-protein interactions so as to reveal the properties that lead to symmetrical capsids or other shapes. Icosahedral architecture similar to that found in viruses has also been adopted by some giant enzymes. In both, cases the biological activity and the shape of the particle are parameters that help to identify the accuracy of the small units forming the assembled giant molecule. Vice versa, the small units and their linkers may be engineered to guide the assembly into useful particles. In this thesis, I focus on the protein framework in icosahedral virus-like particles of the human polyomavirus BK and the enzyme lumazine synthase from Aquifex aeolicus. My aim was to explore how a single type of building unit, in this case a pentamer, can assemble into particles with different size and surface morphology. This work includes the structure determination and comparison of two different virus-like particles (26. 4 and 50. 0 nm in diameter) of the human polyomavirus BK protein VP 1. They both have icosahedral symmetry and their pentamic capsomers establish a T= 1 and T= 7 d surface lattice, respectively. Likewise, the structure of a Lumazine synthase particle from Aquifex aeolicus was solved and compared to a previously solved structure of the native enzyme. The enzyme particle has a sequence insertion of four amino acids. This influences the shape of the assembly and the particles formed are approximately 14 nm larger in diameter than the native structure. The two systems, the viruslike particles and the enzyme particles, differ in their strategy for assembly: the BKV VP 1 protein forms pentamers which are linked together by long (approximately 60 amino acids) flexible arms, while the enzyme protein is globular without protruding domains and uses relatively flat contact surfaces within pentamers and surrounding subunits. The BK virus-like particles primarily use the two loops, before and after the Cterminal helix, to adjust the position of the flexible arm so that the intercapsomer interactions can be kept as similar as possible even at different symmetrical environments and particle curvatures. In the case of the enzyme, the flexibility is not the result of different folding of a <b>contact</b> <b>arm.</b> Instead, alternative areas of the protein surface are used to form the interaction. In all the particles studied, the hydrophobic effect seems to be a main stabilizing force. However, assembly of pentamers (or connecting subunits) also utilizes more specific interactions provided by patterns of complementary charges. Assembly of the "correct" quaternary structure in both systems may be driven by prosthetic groups. In the enzyme case flexibility is required for catalytic reasons - the active site is located at the subunit interface within the pentamer. Here the prosthetic group would control the needed motion for binding substrates and releasing products. In the case of the BK virus-like particles, the main flexibility is found within the C-terminal arm, forming the main interpentameric contacts. Here we find the assembly-controlling calcium ion. The electrostatic interactions and the prosthetic groups are placed in the structure for two functional purposes: to guide the assembly pathway and to maintain the local flexibility needed for assigned functions...|$|E

25|$|As sketched above, the ARM {{domain of}} beta-catenin {{acts as a}} {{platform}} to which specific linear motifs may bind. Located in structurally diverse partners, the β-catenin binding motifs are typically disordered on their own, and typically adopt a rigid structure upon ARM domain engagement – as seen for short linear motifs. However, β-catenin interacting motifs also {{have a number of}} peculiar characteristics. First, they might reach or even surpass the length of 30 amino acids in length, and <b>contact</b> the <b>ARM</b> domain on an excessively large surface area. Another unusual feature of these motifs is their frequently high degree of phosphorylation. Such Ser/Thr phosphorylation events greatly enhance the binding of many β-catenin associating motifs to the ARM domain.|$|R

2500|$|Similarly, we {{find the}} {{familiar}} E-cadherin, whose cytoplasmatic tail <b>contacts</b> the <b>ARM</b> domain in the same canonical fashion. The scaffold protein axin (two closely related paralogs, axin 1 and axin 2) contains a similar interaction motif on its long, disordered middle segment. Although one molecule of axin only contains a single β-catenin recruitment motif, its partner the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein contains 11 such motifs in tandem arrangement per protomer, thus capable to interact with several β-catenin molecules at once. [...] Since {{the surface of the}} ARM domain can typically accommodate only one peptide motif at any given time, all these proteins compete for the same cellular pool of β-catenin molecules. This competition is the key to understand how the Wnt signaling pathway works.|$|R
