5000|$|Pioneer {{introduced}} the CLD-D703 {{to provide a}} [...] "stop gap" [...] model to fit in between the CLD-D503, a lower mid-range player, and the more expensive, prior models in their Elite lineup. Although lacking an AC-3 RF output for transmission of Dolby Digital sound, it did include many high-end features including a 51db video signal-to-noise ratio, 116db audio signal-to-noise ratio, quick Gamma-Turn side flip, Digital Field Memory (allowing for freeze frame and slow motion options on CLV discs), One Shot Memory (for displaying a frame as a background), coaxial and TOSLINK audio outputs, adjustable digital noise reduction, digital time base correction, twin 1-bit DLC digital-to-analog converters, and a backlit remote control with jog dial (CU-CLD098). This model is also a <b>combi</b> <b>player,</b> meaning it could also play Compact Disc and CD video via an independent standard CD-sized tray. For 1995, Pioneer upgraded the player, adding the AC-3 RF output and rebadging it as the CLD-D704. Other than an AC-3 RF output, the player largely remained the same. However, the 703 can be modified with an aftermarket AC-3 RF circuit for Dolby Digital capability. The optical TOSLINK output provides the 703 with full DTS audio capability with LDs carrying such tracks to any DTS-equipped AV receiver or processor. The unit also possesses excellent, [...] "sync-to-play" [...] capability with older LDs bearing the LaserVision and DiscoVision label.|$|E
50|$|After the {{discontinuation}} of this model, the CLD-D704, CLD-79 and 99; Pioneer began abandoning LaserDisc in 1996 {{with the}} release of the DVD format set to debut the following year with the brand introducing several less-performance, more-ease of use geared DVD/LD <b>combi</b> <b>players</b> and a few prior, very basic LD models that were all that remained available for the North American consumer base.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{the first}} model DVD/LD combi-player (and first Pioneer DVD player, for that matter) was the Pioneer DVL-9 {{released}} in Japan. The Pioneer Elite DVL-90, an updated version, followed by a similar, though supposedly lower-end model, the DVL-700, were released in 1997. Successors to this model include the Pioneer DVL-909, Pioneer DVL-919, and the Pioneer Elite DVL-91. Although the DVD/LD <b>combi</b> <b>players</b> offered competent LD performance, they paled in comparison to high-end LD players such as the Pioneer Elite CLD-99 and the Pioneer Hi-Vision/MUSE HLD-X9.|$|R
