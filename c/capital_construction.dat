5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other <b>capital</b> <b>construction</b> projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to <b>capital</b> <b>construction</b> projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State Lottery Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which is a permanent part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery profits for educational purposes. The Lottery does not control how its profits are spent.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 Sir Edward Watkin {{took over}} {{directorship}} of the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway (MS). He had grand ambitions for the company: he {{had plans to}} transform it from a provincial middle-of-the-road railway company into a major national player. He grew tired of handing over potentially lucrative London-bound traffic to rivals, and, after several unsuccessful attempts in the 1870s to co-build a line to London with other companies, decided that the MS needed to create its own route to the <b>capital.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the GCML was commissioned to enable Watkin's railway company to operate its own direct express route to London independently of — and in competition with — rival railway companies.|$|E
25|$|Due to this debt, {{after the}} IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed, only 28 new {{stations}} were built. Five stations {{were on the}} abandoned NYW-operated IRT Dyre Avenue Line, fourteen stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), six were on the Archer Avenue Lines and 63rd Street Lines (built {{as part of a}} 1968 plan), two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and the Harlem–148th Street terminal. Four MTA Capital Construction-funded stations (the 34th Street station on the 7 Subway Extension and the three stations on the Second Avenue Subway) have been constructed with up to 14 more planned.

25|$|On December 11, 2008, news sources {{reported}} that the new station was essentially finished. In January 2009, however, the opening was delayed because the tracks were {{too far from the}} edge of the platform, and the gap between the platform and the train did not meet ADA standards. Other delays were attributed to leaks in the station, which were caused by the station's high water table. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009, a year behind when it was originally set to open. At $530 million, the new South Ferry station ended up being $130 million over budget. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened. On April 16, 2009, MTA <b>Capital</b> <b>Construction</b> awarded a $19.2 million contract to Tully Construction Company to reconstruct Peter Minuit Plaza, which is above the station.|$|E
25|$|New York City is {{supplied}} with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As {{a result of}} the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, {{an integral part of the}} New York City water supply system, is the largest <b>capital</b> <b>construction</b> project in the city's history, with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.|$|E
25|$|As secretary, Cunningham {{oversaw the}} design and {{construction}} of the non-highway <b>capital</b> <b>construction</b> projects in Pennsylvania, {{as well as the}} state's minority and women-owned business contracting program and the Bureau of Commonwealth Media Services. Additionally, he served as the state’s real estate agent and insurance broker, and doubled the state's property insurance coverage while reducing premiums nearly by half, saving more than $4 million annually. He also ran the Governor's management and productivity initiative, which saved the state $500 million in operating costs. Cunningham also led initiatives to sell surplus state property, with the intention of saving taxpayer money, putting the properties back onto tax rolls, and creating community and economic development opportunities. He urged local governments and school districts in Pennsylvania to buy equipment from state contracts, thus realizing financial savings, and also consolidated warehouse facilities in Harrisburg from 17 buildings to four, for an annual saving of $4 million. In addition to his secretary position, Cunningham served on the State Public School Building Authority, the Pennsylvania Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the Governor’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, the PENNVEST board, the Capitol Preservation Committee, and the Agricultural Land Preservation Interagency Committee during his time in Rendell's administration.|$|E
