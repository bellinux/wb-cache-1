5|$|Among the {{progressive}} reforms advocated by McCreary and {{passed in the}} 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections, mandating direct primary elections, and allowing the state's <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> hold local option elections {{to decide whether or}} not to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> be constituted.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the greed}} of toll road {{operators}} resulted in diminishing upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> assume {{ownership of the}} roads. It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 ($ when adjusted for inflation from 1916).|$|E

5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety.

In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|Andrew married Fenenna, the {{daughter}} of Ziemomysł of Kuyavia, {{before the end of}} 1290.

The assembly outlawed Stephen Balogsemjén, a staunch supporter of the late LadislausIV, for major trespass. From the assembly, Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania). Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians, in February or March.

5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> sign.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{immigration}} {{is also a}} factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> lose population as of the 2010 Census.|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas <b>counties</b> <b>to</b> it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E

5|$|The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act, {{which created}} the National Register of Historic Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create review boards to function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer.
