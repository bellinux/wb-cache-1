5|$|<b>Cuprous</b> halides (with chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are known, as are cupric halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts {{to prepare}} copper(II) iodide yield only <b>cuprous</b> iodide and iodine.|$|E
5|$|Copper forms a rich {{variety of}} compounds, usually with {{oxidation}} states +1 and +2, {{which are often}} called <b>cuprous</b> and cupric, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} elements, the {{simplest}} compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both <b>cuprous</b> and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide and copper(II) sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called <b>cuprous</b> chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due {{to the presence of}} copper(II) chloride.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the varistor, in form of {{a new type of}} rectifier based on a <b>cuprous</b> oxide layer on copper, originated in the work by L.O. Grondahl and P.H. Geiger in 1927. Another form made from silicon carbide by R. O. Grisdale in the early 1930s was used to guard telephone lines from lightning.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, copper oxide-based paints {{could keep}} a ship out of drydock {{for as much}} as 18 months, or as little as 12 in {{tropical}} waters. The shorter service life was due to rapid leeching of the toxicant, and chemical conversion into less toxic salts which accumulated as a crust which would inhibit further leaching of active <b>cuprous</b> oxide from the layer under the crust.|$|E
25|$|The {{viability}} of the Friedel–Crafts acylation depends on {{the stability of the}} acyl chloride reagent. Formyl chloride, for example, is too unstable to be isolated. Thus, synthesis of benzaldehyde via the Friedel–Crafts pathway requires that formyl chloride be synthesized in situ. This is accomplished via the Gattermann-Koch reaction, accomplished by treating benzene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride under high pressure, catalyzed by a mixture of aluminium chloride and <b>cuprous</b> chloride.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s {{patination}} {{process is}} complex. It starts immediately on {{exposure to the}} environment with the initial formation of copper oxide conversion films that are noticeable within six months. Weathering may be uneven at first but the film becomes even after about nine months. Within the first few years, <b>cuprous</b> and cupric sulfide conversion films darken the surface to browns and then dull slate gray or dull black. Continued weathering transforms the sulfide films to sulfates, which are the notable blue-green or gray-green patinas.|$|E
25|$|Antifouling {{coatings}} {{are often}} used on nylon nets because the process is more economical than manual cleaning. When nylon nets are coated with antifouling compounds, the coatings repel biofouling {{for a period of}} time, usually between several weeks to several months. However, the nets eventually succumb to biofouling. Antifouling coatings containing <b>cuprous</b> oxide algaecide/biocide are the coatings technology used almost exclusively in the fish farming industry today. The treatments usually flake off within a few weeks to six to eight months.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of copper fungicide {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and <b>cuprous</b> oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the {{application of}} fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), <b>cuprous</b> chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E

2500|$|Normal (p–n) diodes, which {{operate as}} {{described}} above, are usually made of doped silicon or, more rarely, germanium. Before {{the development of}} silicon power rectifier diodes, <b>cuprous</b> oxide and later selenium was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7V per [...] "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often {{an extension of the}} diode's metal substrate), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p–n diodes found in CMOS integrated circuits, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{chemical}} formula for delafossite is CuFeO2 and was determined through chemical {{analysis of the}} pure mineral by G. S. Bohart. The ratio given {{was very close to}} Cu:Fe:O=1:1:2 with a slightly more iron than copper. Rogers. attributed this fact to a small amount of hematite in the sample. In order to determine the composition of delafossite Rogers used the Ziervogel process. The Ziervogel process is used to test for the presence of <b>cuprous</b> oxides by looking for the [...] "spangle reaction" [...] which produces thin flakes of metallic silver when <b>cuprous</b> oxide is mixed with silver sulfate. When Rogers heated powdered delafossite with silver sulfate solution, the spangle reaction occurred. The only oxides possibilities to consider for delafossite are <b>cuprous</b> copper and ferrous iron. Rogers concluded that the iron was combining with the oxygen as a radical and that it only acted as a radical. This indicated that the copper in delafossite was in the <b>cuprous</b> rather than the cupric form. Hence he concluded that the composition of delafossite was probably <b>cuprous</b> metaferrite, CuFe3+O2. This composition was later confirmed by Pabst by the determination of interionic distances in the crystal lattice.|$|E
