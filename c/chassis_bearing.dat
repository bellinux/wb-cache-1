50|$|Since 2004, CRG {{has made}} and sold {{a range of}} kart <b>chassis</b> <b>bearing</b> Zanardi's name. Zanardi chassis have been raced in the European KF1 Championship and World Championship {{as well as in}} many other racing events worldwide. Dutch driver Nyck de Vries won the CIK-FIA Karting World Championship in 2010 and 2011 with Zanardi karts.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2003 season, Dallara {{rolled out}} the new IR-03 chassis. This chassis would later become the de facto [...] "spec car" [...] in the series. An {{aerodynamic}} update kit was released for 2007, which changed its designation to IR-05. In addition, paddle shifters began seeing use in 2008, further developing and evolving this generation of Dallaras. <b>Chassis</b> <b>bearing</b> both the IR-03 and the IR-05 designations saw use {{through the end of}} the 2011 season.|$|E
50|$|Debuting at Hockenheim, on 13 April (first {{round of}} the 1997 FIA GT Championship season), the three factory Elise GT1s and the {{privateer}} GBF car took to the grid. Their debut was short lived, as all four cars failed to finish, all due to alternator problems in the engine. For race two (Silverstone, 11 May), privateer GBF UK received their second car (an untested <b>chassis</b> <b>bearing</b> Nr 06 driven by Andrea Boldrini and Mauro Martini). Again the three factory cars suffered, failing to finish because of gearbox difficulty. GBF's Elise GT1s fared slightly better, with one of their entries actually finishing, although classified last and 25 laps down from the winner.The third race {{of the season in}} Helsinki was a shorter race, featuring a smaller field (23 cars). Only three Elise GT1s were entered, but GBF was able to succeed in taking 5th place, earning them points in the championship. The other two Elise GT1s also finished the race as well, an improvement for the company.|$|E

50|$|Royal Purple is an American {{manufacturer}} {{which produces}} lubricants for automotive, industrial, marine, motorcycle, and racing use. It is known primarily for its line of synthetic Royal Purple Motor Oil products used in gasoline and diesel engines. They also produce other fluids including gear oil, transmission fluid, {{power steering fluid}} and industrial gear, bearing, engine, and hydraulic oil. Other products include <b>chassis</b> and <b>bearing</b> grease, lubricant aerosol, aerosol chain lubricant, and firearm lubricant.|$|R
5000|$|Atkinson {{merged with}} Seddons of Oldham in 1970. The last [...] "true" [...] Atkinson, a Defender 8-wheel rigid <b>bearing</b> <b>chassis</b> number FC29941, was built at Atkinson's Walton-le-Dale works in 1975. It went to G & B McCready of Newcastle-under-Lyme {{and carried the}} {{registration}} KVT 604 P. Today it rots in their yard.|$|R
50|$|The bogie was {{connected}} with the <b>chassis</b> by pivot <b>bearings,</b> creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie. The carrying axle was {{in the form of}} an Adams axle, and therefore had greater articulation than the bogie.|$|R
50|$|The G 2/2+2/3 {{class had}} an {{external}} frame. The {{part of the}} chassis supporting {{the rear of the}} locomotive was pulled forward, and in the centre supported the rear bogie. The boiler was mounted forward of this point, and thus its rear was supported at fulcrum level. The locomotive had no pivot point, as a ball joint provided for steam injection. The bogie was connected with the <b>chassis</b> by pivot <b>bearings,</b> creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile crosshead guides, counteracted any rolling of the bogie.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: One {{of the two}} 'Wren' class {{narrow gauge}} steam {{locomotives}} of Camber Railway on the Falkland Islands, 1915. The open cab was not appropriate for a Falklands winter. This photo was probably taken immediately after the unloading of the locomotive in 1915, with the ship in the background being the SS Ismailia which brought the railway and wireless station equipment out from Britain. The picture illustrates the two original types of wagon, a tipper on an inside <b>bearing</b> oval <b>chassis</b> seen on the left, and a flat wagon on a rectangular outside <b>bearing</b> <b>chassis</b> seen to the right. Both types of wagon ran on coil springs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Hybrid Electric Vehicle is {{directly}} designed and manufactured for base study of HEV’s system and Green Car. Foundation design consists of power train {{design and the}} frame design. The power train concept includes motor, engine, generator and battery. And {{the concept of the}} frame is the single-seat of this self-made HEV. A frame installed in hybrid system contains suspension, steering wheel, seat, accelerating pedal, brake pedal, clutch handle and various <b>chassis</b> parts with <b>bearings.</b> Electromagnetic clutch is equipped to transmit engine power to drive axle. The control algorism make using LabVIEW to control of an engine and a motor depending on drive condition. A parallel type hybrid system is manufactured to control operation of a motor and an engine depending on vehicle speed...|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{developed}} by Ferdinand Porsche, who had transferred to Daimler from the firm’s Austrian affiliate in 1923. Porsche was the board member with responsibility for new product development. The company’s objective with the new eight cylinder Mercedes-Benz was {{to come up with}} a serious competitor to the Horch 8, and Porsche’s work on the new car appears to have been very rushed. [...] The result was a car with a traditional “overslung” (“Hochbett”) chassis with the longitudinal chassis members directly above the axles, at a time when newer designs increasingly favored “underslung” (“Tiefbett”) chassis layouts on which the axles sat directly above the load <b>bearing</b> <b>chassis</b> beams. The 1928 Mercedes-Benz W08 therefore looked unfashionably tall even at the time of its launch.|$|R
50|$|The first Mark 1 Quantum, <b>bearing</b> <b>chassis</b> number 001, was a {{development}} mule and {{was subject to}} so much adjustment that the Wooldridge brothers eventually decided the car would be too dangerous to keep on the road. This car was therefore disposed of in landfill. Chassis 002 was later {{believed to have been}} damaged beyond repair in a head-on collision, so chassis 003 is now the oldest surviving example of a Quantum model and the first to be sold, after a short period being used for magazine tests and promotional materials. To ensure this historic car survives, the Quantum Owners Club has acquired this car and {{are in the process of}} restoring it.The club also owns the last Mark 1 Coupé produced, chassis number 017. In 2015 a club member claims to own chassis 002, which is believed to have been exported to the Isle of Man, and hence removed from the DVLA records. While the chassis number hasn't been validated by the Quantum Owners Club, it's export to the Isle of Man could explain why it was believed to have been written off and destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|A 250 GTO (4757GT) {{belonging}} to the deceased Robert C. [...] "Chris" [...] Murray, a drug dealer who fled the United States in 1984, was seized by the FBI and sold in a sealed auction in 1987 for approximately $1.6 million. Murray bought the car in 1982 from a Beverly Hills dealer with $250,000 in cash from a backpack full of $20 and $50 notes. In 1989, {{at the peak of}} the boom, a 250 GTO was sold to a Japanese buyer for $14.6 million plus commission. By 1994 that example changed hands for about $3.5 million. In 2008, a British buyer bought a 250 GTO that formerly belonged to Lee Kun-hee of Samsung Electronics at an auction for a record £15.7 million. In May 2010, BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans bought chassis number 4675 GT for £12 million. [...] According to Octane Magazine, the Ferrari 250 GTO <b>bearing</b> <b>chassis</b> number 5095GT was sold by British real estate agent Jon Hunt to an unknown buyer. It has been disclosed that the buyer was Carlos Hank Rhon of Mexico, a member of one of the most influential families within the PRI ruling party. In February 2012, in what is believed to be the largest single car transaction in the United Kingdom, a Ferrari 250 GTO sold for over £20 million (approx. US$31.7 million).|$|R
