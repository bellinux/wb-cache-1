40|$|ABSTRACT – <b>Clinical</b> <b>responsibility</b> is an {{area that}} {{requires}} extensive consideration and develop-ment to align with other changes in healthcare in the NHS. Increasing levels of litigation and inves-tigation into the practice of medical practitioners have highlighted the need for clearer guidance for doctors. Using hypothetical case studies, this project explored the understandings and experi-ences of physicians and potential solutions in areas where there was ambiguity in <b>clinical</b> <b>responsibility.</b> In addition, existing policy and practice within trusts throughout the UK was analysed. The output from the focus group dis-cussion and policy analysis led to the recommen-dations and guidance for doctors outlined in this paper, with the aim of illustrating the central themes that both doctors and trusts need to address in the future.

40|$|I This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} mental health nurses ‟ perceptions of <b>clinical</b> <b>responsibility.</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>responsibility</b> refers to the tasks and skills that professional bodies, employers and the court of law can legitimately demand from a health professional and accountability refers to the mechanism in which if a practitioner fails to exercise their responsibilities that disciplinary action can occur. Current standards and guidelines only provide limited information to nurses about the topic. Further to this public inquiries have identified issues in regards to health professionals ‟ understanding of their clinical responsibilities. A descriptive qualitative design was used to explore the mental health nursing perspective of <b>clinical</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Participants were sampled from the local mental health nursing population and semi-structured interviews were used as the means of data collection. Transcriptions were thematically analysed which produced three major themes; patient responsibility, medical responsibility, and conflicting nursing responsibility. The consumer discourse, the medical discourse and risk management discourse were all considered as competing factors relevant to mental health nursing responsibility which set up a conflicting position in which the nurses perceived their own responsibility. These findings highlighted the challenge for nurses of balancing competing discourses related to <b>clinical</b> <b>responsibility</b> in practice. It is critical that mental health nurses have an awareness of societal and organisational factors that influence practice and decision making. This knowledge will better inform decisions in practice {{so that they are}} less likely to be based on misconceptions of accountability. I...|$|E

There were no statistically significant differences in managerial and informational continuity between immigrants and natives.
