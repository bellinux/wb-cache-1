2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also [...] "created internal strains and structural irregularities," [...] and these problems were even more prevalent in large bore castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior." [...] Doing this forced the thickest material {{toward the center of the}} barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention.|$|E

50|$|Guns {{had been}} {{traditionally}} <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> and the bore was bored {{out of the}} solid metal. With this traditional method, the gun cooled from the outside inward. Castings shrink as they cool. As each succeeding layer cooled it contracted, pulling away from the still molten metal in the center, creating voids and tension cracks. Drilling out the bore removed the voids, but the tensions in the metal were still toward the outside. Rodman devised a method of hollow casting where the gun cooled from the inside out, so that as cooling occurred, it created compression rather than tension. This resulted in a much stronger gun.|$|E
5000|$|York's {{appreciation}} for precision, {{coupled with the}} subtle irregularities inherent in her forms, are clearly associated {{with the principles of}} Minimalism, but unlike the machined industrial sculpture being produced by her predecessors in the 60's, her work bears the traces of a disciplined and meditative hands-on process of making. Harmony Hammond, in a review of York's work, stated that [...] "Susan York represents a new generation of minimalist sculptors. While her formal vocabulary of columns, beams and slabs is heavily indebted to such artists as Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, John McCracken, Ronald Bladen and Richard Serra, her choice of graphite as a material (<b>cast</b> <b>solid,</b> kiln-fired, shaped into irregular geometric forms with saws and files, then hand-polished) contributes a sense of warmth, mutability and body missing from the industrially fabricated work of the mid-'60s".|$|E

50|$|The navy's {{demand for}} 15-inch guns {{to defeat the}} new Confederate ironclads placed Dahlgren in a dilemma. All of his earlier shell guns had been <b>cast</b> <b>solid,</b> then had the bore drilled out—the {{traditional}} way to make artillery. Dahlgren’s efforts with the XIII-inch shell gun were unsatisfactory {{and it was not}} clear that he could solid cast a 15-inch gun. However 15-inch guns had been successfully cast using the techniques developed by Thomas Jackson Rodman. Rodman developed a hollow casting method, where the gun was cast around a hollow pipe. As the casting cooled, a smaller pipe was inserted into the first and water was pumped through the small pipe. At the same time hot coals were placed against the outside of the casting. This caused the casting to cool slowly from the inside out. As the outer parts of the casting cooled, they compressed the already cooled inner parts, making a stronger gun. The Bureau of Ordnance ordered that the Dahlgren XV-inch and XX-inch shell guns be cast using the Rodman hollow casting method. This use of Rodman hollow casting with a Dahlgren designed gun led to friction between Dahlgren and the Bureau of Ordnance, as well as some confusion in nomenclature.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Variety, Andrew Barker's review {{noted the}} film's {{reliance}} on cliches, stating [...] "Relying heavily {{on this particular}} crutch, as well as plenty of jump scares and a solid cast, Scott Derrickson’s supernatural horror-policier Deliver Us From Evil is a professionally assembled genre mashup that’s too silly to be scary, and a bit too dull to be a midnight-movie guilty pleasure. It should nonetheless cull decent business." [...] Critic Peter Keough echoed that sentiment in The Boston Globe, writing [...] "Though Derrickson offers some new twists on old tricks, and evokes a mood of menace with rainy streets, gloomy interiors, and the transformation of comforting everyday objects into something horrible, the story soon devolves into variations of many movies we have seen before. [...] Bilge Ebiri of New York Magazine called it [...] "a thoroughly generic exorcism film," [...] and concluded, [...] "There are some half-decent scares...But the film’s {{real problem is that}} it’s somehow both one-note and convoluted." [...] Ben Sachs wrote in The Chicago Reader, [...] "Director Scott Derrickson demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo), though just as many feel uninspired, and the longer dialogue scenes stop the movie dead in its tracks." [...] Moira Macdonald denounced the film in The Seattle Times and particularly complained about its length, stating [...] "this is a pretty routine and occasionally silly demonic-possession flick, which distinguishes itself by making us wait so long for the exorcism that heads may be spinning in the audience as well" [...] and added, [...] "Some of it’s shivery, but {{a lot of it is}} familiar from similar movies." [...] Rafer Guzman gave the film a mostly positive review in Newsday, writing [...] "Thanks to a fine <b>cast,</b> <b>solid</b> direction by Scott Derrickson and an idiosyncratic soundtrack by The Doors, the movie's mandatory cliches -- Latin invocations, gurgling demons -- are far more tolerable than usual. [...] Bill Stamets in The Chicago Sun Times stated, [...] "Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, Paul Harris Boardman, deliver a routine procedural with unremarkable frights".|$|E

40|$|Some {{important}} aspects of design modeling for shape optimization are discussed for both stamped sheet metal components and <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> components. For stamped components {{the basis for the}} modeling approach is a boundary design function. Design parameters control the shape of 2 -D regions. For more complex, folded plate components, the 2 -D regions can be assembled using translation and rotation operations. The analysis model is automatically created using a mesh generation procedure requiring only boundary data. For less complex solid components, it was found that this approach is not suitable. For these structures, the finite element models are typically created using very sophisticated graphical modeling systems. A new approach which overlays a parameterized surface design model on an existing analysis model is described. To summarize, the future needs for solid shape design is described in terms of an extension of the previously described 2 -D capability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{design of}} porous metal {{structures}} is of high interest for novel lightweight industrial applications. Synchrotron tomography {{in combination with}} 3 D image analysis is the suitable method to investigate these structures.

Introduction: Basic concepts for creating metallic foams have been developed during the 1950 s [1] but could not be appropriately realized until ten years ago due to lack of technical abilities. Now, a broad spectrum of direct and indirect methods are used to create foams from different metals and metal alloys – e. g. the powder compact foaming process [2], by using <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> precursors [3] or by gas injection into the molten metal (air bubbling) [1].

40|$|Abstract: A direct-chill (DC) cast {{process of}} an {{aluminum}} ingot of size 3200 × 1292 × 320 mm 3 is analyzed numerically by {{the analysis of}} a fixed controlled system. The study investigates the DC processes in which liquid aluminum is cooling continuously in mold and then with water spray at the exit of mold. An inverse method is applied to measure heat transfer coefficient on water cooling surface experimentally. A correlation of heat transfer coefficient with surface temperature is used in numerical simulation. It has been approved that the defected curl and tears are caused by the higher rates of initial cooling and solidifying in mold and the sweat and liquation are caused by the isolation of heat transfer by air gap formed between <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> surface and the mold wall by volume shrinkage with solidification. The present research analyzes the variations of temperature profiles in the cast ingot by the changes of cast speed and cast temperature and assesses the improvements of mold and cast process for the better cast quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} in construction methods between {{different forms of}} slabs construction tend to result into variation {{in the cost of}} the slabs for any building project. Thus, this study aims at assessing the variation in construction cost among various construction methods available for hollow and solid floors in construction projects within Lagos State. The research design for this study was a survey design approach and the population of the study are active professionals (Architects, Civil Engineers, Builders, Quantity Surveyors, Consultant) and contractors because they are the major participants in the construction activities of the construction industry in Lagos State, Nigeria. The research is based on 46 returned questionnaires out of the 60 that was administered. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive tools such as frequencies, percentage and mean values. The hypotheses were tested with paired sample t-test and {{it was found that the}} system or method of slab construction well known to the respondents is cast in situ, precast and semi-precast. The study also shows that the cost of in-situ solid slabs are higher than that of hollow slab which is an indication that solid slab construction is more expensive than hollow slab construction provided the hollow slab is a one-way hollow floor and not waffle floor. In pre <b>cast</b> <b>solid</b> slab construction the cost of transportation of units to sites, cost of expertise required in the construction process and the cost of fabrication off site are the three highest and most expensive aspects of precast solid slab while cost of erection and placement and the cost of grouting and topping if required are less expensive. Therefore there is difference in the cost of construction between the solid and hollow slabs but the difference is not appreciable. The study's major recommendation is that, adequate and careful analysis must be done in the choice of floor system being adopted for any project...|$|E
