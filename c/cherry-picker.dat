500|$|Jackson {{performed}} [...] "Thriller" [...] {{for all of}} his 82 shows {{during his}} third, and final, world tour, the HIStory World Tour. Once again, a masked dancer posing as Jackson was used as a stage illusion, this time to the transition between [...] "Thriller" [...] and [...] "Beat It". As with the Dangerous tour, Jackson switches with the background dancer {{in the middle of the}} song. At the end of Thriller, the masked dancer is taken by the zombie dancers into a coffin where it appears he is impaled with spikes and burned. Jackson would appear at the side of the stage in a <b>cherry-picker,</b> starting off [...] "Beat It".|$|E
500|$|During {{the dance}} sequence, puppets are {{suspended}} in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the <b>cherry-picker</b> is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing [...] "Beat It". Footage of Jackson and the band rehearsing [...] "Black or White" [...] is shown next, in which he instructs his band to skip the second verse and later allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar riff. The video sequence for [...] "Earth Song" [...] is shown next, featuring {{a little girl who}} wanders through a forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of global warming and the lack of reversible time left. He then performs a quick version of his song [...] "Billie Jean". Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Michael performs [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] with strong backing vocals. The credits are shown next, with a montage of rehearsal clips and [...] "This Is It" [...] being played in the background. After the show, a live recording of [...] "Heal The World" [...] was played. Then, the audio of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was played, with a clip of Michael rehearsing it in early June (the 3D screen was not set up yet). Then, a clip of {{what could have been a}} Dome Project video of [...] "Heal the World" [...] was shown, in which the girl that appeared in the [...] "Earth Song" [...] video was shown holding the world and a signed message, by Michael, saying [...] "I Love You." ...|$|E
50|$|There were {{subsequent}} {{changes in the}} composition of the GRCP which included Frank Quinn as supply driver, Shorty Williams as grader driver, Eric Graefling as <b>Cherry-picker.</b> Two other cooks were briefly employed, Cyril Koch and Tom Roberts, but Paul Christensen was the longest serving cook.|$|E
50|$|Condor - Named {{after the}} company that {{originally}} made extendable boom arms, it now refers {{to a variety of}} lift devices, including <b>cherry-pickers.</b> Generally used on set to position light between 30 and 120 feet in the air.|$|R
50|$|On 24 September 2012 {{just before}} 14:00, an Ausgrid failure {{in a local}} {{underground}} cable led to a complete shutdown of the system resulting in the need for <b>cherry-pickers</b> to come to rescue approximately 100 stranded passengers, a process which took several hours. It {{was the first time}} since 2000 that Fire and Rescue NSW had to be called to help people from the line.|$|R
50|$|In May 2002, Brokaw {{announced}} his retirement as anchor of Nightly News, to take effect shortly after the Presidential election in 2004. During this last time helming the network's Presidential election coverage, NBC graphic designers created images of a giant electoral map on the ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza, and <b>cherry-pickers</b> tallied the electoral vote count on the facade of 30 Rockefeller Plaza (this tradition has continued with each election since then). Brokaw's final broadcast took place on December 1, 2004, ending 22 years on the Nightly News desk and a 21-year run as the network's chief newsman - a record tenure in NBC's history.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817, who originally {{placed it in}} the genus Melithreptus. Its specific epithet {{is derived from the}} Latin words flavus [...] "yellow", and collis [...] "neck". Other vernacular names are the green <b>cherry-picker,</b> green dick or green linnet.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-throated honeyeater (Nesoptilotis flavicollis), {{also known}} as the green <b>cherry-picker,</b> green dick or green linnet is a species of bird in the family Meliphagidae. It is similar in {{behaviour}} and appearance to the white-eared honeyeater and is endemic to Australia's island state of Tasmania. It was formerly considered a pest of orchards.|$|E
50|$|Mole Network: The {{six players}} {{were faced with}} a high crane and a <b>cherry-picker</b> {{attached}} to it, the latter of which was located 30 metres off the ground. Each player was to enter the <b>cherry-picker</b> on the crane and jump off it, trying to cling onto a large net in the process. Upon jumping onto the net, {{they would have to}} aim for pockets of cash that were located on it; the higher the cash was placed on the net, the higher the value. Hillal earned the team $10,000 in his attempt, Shaun earned the team $5,000 despite having his leg caught in the net, Erin failed to win the team any money even though she did jump, and Nick, Sam and Aisha all refused to even attempt the challenge. Altogether, the team managed to win only $15,000 out of the $50,000 that was offered.|$|E
5000|$|The club {{started its}} {{existence}} in the early 1870s as Glenbuck Athletic, founded by Edward and William Bone, with a strip of white jersey and black shorts. The name [...] "Cherrypickers" [...] is of obscure origin, beginning as a nickname {{in the first years}} of the 20th century, but may have derived from local men from Glenbuck or Muirkirk serving in the 11th Hussars (The [...] "Cherry Pickers") in the Boer War. Another possible source was the fact that almost all of the men associated with the club, players and officials, worked in the local pits where one of the jobs was sorting the good coal from stones and other material as it passed on a conveyor belt. The lumps of good coal had to be picked out and the workers who performed that task were known as <b>cherry-pickers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Those of us of ‘long standing’ in {{the field}} of special and {{inclusive}} education might be forgiven for feeling that it might be time to throw in a collective towel, as the likely impact of Government policy in England becomes more apparent. Others, who are just becoming professionally established {{in the field}}, may also feel justified in questioning the direction currently being taken in aspects of our work, which is bound to have negative impact on the most vulnerable children we seek to support. Money, it is said, is the root of all evil. In the case of special and inclusive education it certainly appears to be the case. Over time we are seeing {{a significant increase in the}} commodification of care and the marketisation of models of intervention. As local authority grip has been loosened on schools, at least one valuable mediator between the ideological excesses of central Government has been sidelined. Schools and other services have become accountable for the money they spend, but not really for pupils who experience learning difficulties or disabilities. These children and young people are now, even more than at any time during my 40 years of professional involvement in education, facing a monumental threat in the face of an army of chancers, <b>cherry-pickers</b> and snake-oil merchants...|$|R
5000|$|Raymond's 300th win {{came during}} the last home {{game of the season}} on November 10 with a 10-6 victory against the Richmond Spiders. As the clock wound down in the game, the crowd began {{chanting}} [...] "Tubby, Tubby". Raymond made a short, humble speech and was carried off the field by his team as a construction worker climbed onto a <b>cherry-picker</b> to cross off the final number on the poster.|$|E
50|$|Seeing Barts prank consequences, Homer {{decides that}} Bart {{has gone too}} far and makes him promise to never prank again.

As a result, Barts having a closer bond with his younger sister Lisa as now he understands her point of view for not having any recognition at all for her achievements.|$|E

5000|$|... "We see Jackson as a perfectionist, {{a generous}} boss, a tough taskmaster and a playful child. Off guard and {{probably}} unaware {{that it would}} ever {{be seen by the}} public, we find Jackson pushing his band and production team to the limit with demands to [...] "let it sizzle" [...] and [...] "make the music simmer." [...] Obsessive Jacko fans may be shocked by his Diva-ish behaviour as he complains about ear-pieces, but it's heartening to finally view the late singer as a rounded human with regular failings and imperfections. Similarly a scene featuring Jackson screaming [...] "weeeee!" [...] with childish glee as he moves around the stage on a giant <b>cherry-picker,</b> will surely bring a smile to even the most cynical viewer" [...] -Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] (Martin Luther King) mural, {{painted over}} two nights in August 1991, is the largest, most prominent, and the longest-surviving {{of the many}} large format murals created around Newtown by the team known as Unmitigated Audacity Productions, the core members of which were New Zealand-born Canadian artist Andrew Aiken and his {{colleague}} Juilee Pryor. They were assisted in this mural by Tony Spanos, who provided a <b>cherry-picker</b> to allow {{the upper part of}} the mural to be painted. It commemorates American civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr.. One of the last surviving large-format murals in the area, it displays a large portrait of Dr King, next to a large painted depiction of the Apollo 8 photograph of the Earth from space, and Dr King's quote [...] "I have a dream" [...] in large Gothic lettering, near which is the quotation from Genesis 37:19: [...] "Behold the dreamer cometh; Come now therefore and let us slay him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams".|$|E

40|$|In {{relation}} to the European integration process, Switzerland is sometimes called a <b>cherry-picker,</b> and sometimes a quasi-member of the European Union (EU). There are good reasons for both qualifications. Switzerland is the only Western European country {{that is not a}} member of the EU, and not even part of the European Economic Area (EEA). While all its neighbours shifted the control over national policy-making to some extent to the new centre in Brussels, Switzerland has resisted any delegation of authority to the EU. Does this mean that Switzerland is the last Gallic village in Europe? The subordination of EU member states to Brussels is neither total nor uniform across policies and countries. The same holds for Switzerland’s autonomy. The outsider concluded a large number of sectoral agreements with the EU and it has continuously transposed EU rules into domestic legislation. Theoretical and empirical studies of the European integration process research the different levels of European integration across policies and member states under the label differentiated integration. This paper proposes to study Switzerland as a case of differentiated integration and presents empirical data that measures the quality of Switzerland’s integration for the period 1990 – 2010. The empirical data shows that substantially, a broad range of EU rules have been extended to Switzerland either via sectoral agreements or via transposition into domestic legislation. This substantive rule extension became, however, only in recent years also legally linked to the EU...|$|E
