25|$|Coralee Lever and Vera Jary {{hid behind}} a hessian screen with others. Lever's husband Dennis was fatally {{shot in the}} head. Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had {{attempted}} to escape through a locked door but could not. Peter Nash lay {{down on top of}} his wife to hide her from Bryant. Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> in the corners. Gwen Neander, trying to escape through the door, {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E
25|$|His second {{marriage}} {{was to the}} Dutch actress, model and style icon Talitha Pol (stepdaughter of Augustus John's daughter Poppet) on 10 December 1966. The two posed for an iconic photograph on a roof-top in Marrakesh, Morocco in January 1969. The photo, taken by Patrick Lichfield, shows Talitha Getty <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> leaning on a wall and {{her husband in the}} background in hood and sunglasses. The photo appeared in American Vogue and again in the September 1999 issue of American Vogue and is part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Two and a half years after the photo was taken, Talitha died of a heroin overdose on 14 July 1971.|$|E
2500|$|At {{one time}} Wren was {{credited}} with {{the design of the}} King's House at Newmarket, Suffolk. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which Charles II, who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that [...] "They were high enough!", at which the king <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, [...] "Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rosie, a {{black and}} white {{portrait}} of a very young girl <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed child pornography by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and it is surprising that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art in 1988. There was one other photograph of a naked child, [...] "Jessie McBride" [...] which also contributed to the controversy created by [...] "Rosie".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the walk}} began, Wallenda {{realized}} the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. [...] He spat {{on his hands}} and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> on the wire due to wind gusts. [...] He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. [...] Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying [...] "Thank you, Jesus." [...] Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. [...] Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jones {{was almost}} back on schedule, running at about [...] toward Vaughan, and {{traveling}} through a [...] left-hand curve that blocked his view. Webb's {{view from the}} left side of the train was better, and he was first to see the red lights of the caboose on the main line. [...] "Oh my Lord, there's something on the main line!" [...] he yelled to Jones. Jones quickly yelled back [...] "Jump Sim, jump!" [...] to Webb, who <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> and jumped from the train, about [...] before impact, and was knocked unconscious by his fall. The last thing Webb heard as he jumped was the long, piercing scream of the whistle as Jones warned anyone still in the freight train looming ahead. He was only two minutes behind schedule.|$|E

2500|$|Utamaro {{achieves}} a strong compositional balance despite the painting's complexity. [...] He distributes 27 figures throughout it amongst several buildings, {{such as a}} teahouse duplexes and a second-storey restaurant-teahouse at the left. [...] The main building {{appears to be a}} two-story restaurant-teahouse; the picture focuses on an atrium with a garden court in the middle surrounded by railings, revealing the snowy outdoors. [...] With the exception of the young boy who reaches out at a cat in the lower left, all the figures are women, though in real life the guests of a pleasure house would be men. [...] Several of the figures pose {{in a manner similar to}} those in the book Seirō Ehon Nenjū Gyōji (1804) that Utamaro illustrated around the time he completed this painting, such as the woman looking behind her in the hallway in the centre, the woman with her arm wrapped around a pillar in the centre, and the woman <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> near her with her hand on the railing, looking to the right behind her.|$|E
2500|$|Back at the Militia Headquarters, whilst Alpha Company were <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> {{behind their}} {{vehicles}} dodging the rocks being thrown at them by an angry crowd, {{they were able}} to distinguish between the sound of rounds being fired from an AK-47 and an SA-80 rifle by their relative pitches. They realized that Bravo were under fire and returning fire themselves. Without communications, Alpha mounted up and drove into the town having to guess where Bravo would be by the sound of the gunfire. Alpha came under sustained and heavy fire at a crossroads [...] from the police station. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under these conditions is to de-bus. The troops from Alpha spread out with some taking cover under their DAF truck. Despite the short distance and the availability of line of sight, no members of Alpha had seen or recognized the Land Rovers of the RMPs at the police station, though at that point, the Land Rovers may have been moved inside the police station compound. Alpha suppressed the enemy fire, but the DAF truck needed to be jump-started due to mechanical problems. With some troops providing cover, the rest of Alpha pushed the truck until it started. They then mounted up and sped north whilst being targeted by gunmen but managed to reach a point of safety north of the town. They de-bussed and took up defensive positions whilst the sitrep was phoned in to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had <b>crouched</b> <b>down</b> during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go pack! Go pack!" [...] shrieked Hans Mueller. He was <b>crouching</b> <b>down,</b> looking with staring eyes {{through the}} lowered wind shield of the touring car.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am coming, mother,' replied he; {{but first}} {{he took out his}} bones, and, <b>crouching</b> <b>down</b> on the ground behind the hut, asked them how he should escape the ogre.|$|R

60|$|At this, Maiden's Heart bobbed {{his head}} {{two or three}} times, and, motioning to us to <b>crouch</b> <b>down,</b> he crept quietly over to the inner wall of the ramparts and looked down.|$|R
