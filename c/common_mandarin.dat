40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{develop a}} set of monosyllable {{audiometry}} test material {{that can be used}} in speech recognition testing in Mandarin Chinese. Materials and MethodsIn an effort to improve reliability and efficiency in clinical practice, {{a set of}} 30 test lists of 25 monosyllable test items each was designed with consideration of the following: length of the list, phonemical balance (PB), word utility frequency, coverage of common words, and equivalency among lists. The 30 lists contained 750 monosyllabic words and were constructed on the basis of Chinese phoneme distribution probability summarized in the Manual of Acoustic. The occurrence incidence of the 22 consonants, 36 vowels, and 4 tones of the Chinese Mandarin characters in the 30 test lists were calculated. To achieve PB, 489 monosyllables were selected from the 2500 most commonly used Chinese characters and the 4000 most commonly used Chinese phrases to compile the 30 monosyllable test lists using a computer algorithm with manual adjustment. ResultsThirty phonemical balanced word lists of <b>common</b> <b>Mandarin</b> Chinese monosyllabic words were compiled. Each list consisted of 25 monosyllables. A total of 489 phonemes (consonants, vowels and tones) were included in the set. ConclusionsThis set of lists can potentially be used as the basic lists for future development of Mandarin PB monosyllable speech test materials...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a serious disease of citrus (the orange cv. Washington navel, lemon and the <b>common</b> <b>mandarin</b> grafted on sour orange rootstocks) has been {{observed}} in southern Greek orchards. Affected trees decline, their leaves become yellow and fall early, and shoots and twigs die as the damage expands towards the trunk. Crosssections of the trunks and large branches reveal a light-colored rot in the center, which is surrounded by brown hard necrotic wood. Symptoms start from pruned areas and spread to the rootstock wood, and then resemble esca of grapevine. From the white rotted areas, a fungus was isolated on PDA that formed cream-yellow to light-brown colonies with dense aerial mycelium. Fungal fruit-bodies formed abundantly on the trunks of diseased trees. The fungus was identified as Fomitiporia mediterranea by both traditional and molecular methods. Pathogenicity tests were performed by artificially inoculating orange, mandarin, lemon and sour orange trees with the fungus. Control holes were filled with two PDA plugs. Branches inoculated with the isolates from infected citrus showed wood discoloration that extended up to 20 cm above and 20 cm below the infection hole. The fungus was re-isolated from the discolored parts of the wood. Inoculations with isolates from grapevine and kiwi produced wood discoloration only 3 – 4 mm around the holes...|$|E

40|$|Carrizo citrange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. × Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] and Cleopatra {{mandarin}} (C. reshni Hort. ex Tan.) are {{the most}} important rootstocks used in Spain, but they are problematic and it is necessary to search for new rootstocks with better all-round performance. The performance of 'Lane Late' navel orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb] on ten rootstocks was determined in the South of the province of Alicante (Spain). They are Carrizo citrange, Cleopatra mandarin and eight new hybrids obtained at the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias in Valencia (Spain) : 020324 [Troyer citrange (C. sinensis × P. trifoliata) × Cleopatra mandarin], Forner-Alcaide 418 (F&A 418) [Troyer citrange × <b>common</b> <b>mandarin</b> (C. deliciosa Ten.) ], Forner-Alcaide 13 (F&A 13), 030118, 030127 and 030131 (Cleopatra mandarin × P. trifoliata) and 030212 and 030230 (Cleopatra mandarin × Troyer citrange). Soil is clay loam, with pH 8. 5 and electric conductivity in the saturation extract at 25 ºC of 5. 79 mS cm- 1. Yield was weighed during the first nine harvests, fruit quality was determined in the last three. Pre-harvest fruit-drop was controlled for the 4 th until 9 th harvests. The trees of 'Lane Late' navel budded on Cleopatra mandarin were the tallest (2. 5 m) and F&A 418 (1. 6 m) the shortest of all rootstocks tested. Trees on 030131 hybrid and Carrizo citrange rootstocks had the highest mean yield (81. 2 and 80. 3 kg per tree per year respectively), while trees on F&A 418 produced the lowest mean yield (22. 3 kg per tree per year). Trees on 030131, 020324 and 030212 had the highest yield efficiency as total cumulative yield per cubic meter of canopy volume (62. 1, 58. 7 and 55. 9 kg m- 3 respectively) whereas trees on 030127, F&A 418 and Cleopatra mandarin had lower yield efficiencies (45. 0, 44. 4 and 38. 6 kg m- 3, respectively). Pre-harvest fruit-drop was lower in trees grafted on Cleopatra mandarin (24. 62 %) and on 030212 (26. 61 %), and was also low on F&A 418 (27. 76 %), 020324 (28. 14 %) and 030230 (29. 18 %) rootstocks. Trees on Carrizo citrange and 030127 experienced important fruit-drop (40. 24 % and 38. 27 % respectively). Trees on F&A 418 had the highest fruit weight and fruit size whereas trees on 030118 induced the lowest ones. The ripeness index was the highest on F&A 13 (18. 3) and lowest on F&A 418 (15. 3), 030212 (15. 3) ...|$|E
