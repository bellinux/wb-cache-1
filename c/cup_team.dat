5|$|After the {{retirement}} of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the Davis <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches, though Henman had told him how wearing and time consuming that can be. While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert, Murray was obligated to play for his country, but in November, Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} week as the relegation 1st round {{play-off}} against Israel, Murray was officially entered for the ATP tournament in Indianapolis, sparking fears about his commitment.

5|$|The Team of the Year Award {{was first}} {{presented}} in 1960, {{six years after}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and the Ryder <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award {{on one of those}} occasions. Liverpool F.C. have won the award three times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4x400m relay team and the British Ryder <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4x400m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Cochet {{then set}} to compete across Europe. As the reigning champions the French Davis <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> {{had only one}} {{scheduled}} challenge match during the season and could skip the preliminary rounds. Lacoste and Cochet entered the British Hard Court Championships. Pat Spence eliminated Cochet in the semifinal stage but lost to Lacoste in the final. Cochet and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles challenge with Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, Cochet won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and Cochet – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad light conditions at 6–2, 7–9, one set each. The next stop was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon {{despite the efforts of}} Cochet and René de Buzelet. Cochet and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women's world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over Cochet and deprived him of the title. Cochet and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. Cochet and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph. At the end of July in the Challenge round of the Davis Cup at Roland Garros the Musketeers, with the absence of Brugnon, defeated the United States to keep the trophy in French possession. Cochet won all three of his rubbers.|$|E

In February, Prevc was {{a member}} of the team that won the first ever World <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> victory for Slovenia at the ski flying team event in Oberstdorf, together with Robert Kranjec, Jurij Tepeš, and Jure Šinkovec. Prevc jumped 225.5 meters (which would equal the hill record) in the one-series event but fell hard after the landing and injured his shoulder. He required an operation which meant that he had to finish the season early and also missed out the Ski Flying World Championships in Vikersund. Although he missed the last five events of the season, Prevc finished 15th in the overall standings.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012/13 season, Prevc {{won three}} World <b>Cup</b> <b>team</b> events in Zakopane, Willingen, and Planica.

Cochet and Tilden were on the same half of the draw and it set up a {{semifinal}} clash which Cochet was forced out of the tournament in five sets. He and Ramillon had a shot at the doubles title but they came short against pro newcomer Don Budge and veteran Ellsworth Vines.|$|E
