40|$|Products {{that are}} {{currently}} available to manage plant-parasitic nematodes on corn in Iowa include the soil-applied insecticide/nematicide Counter® and two relatively new protectant seed treatments, Avicta® and Votivo®. Counter® is a contact and systematic nematicide with the active ingredient terbufos. Avicta® is a <b>contact</b> <b>nematicide</b> (active ingredient abamectin) that moves {{on the surface of}} the root, and Votivo® is a special strain of the natural soil bacterium Bacillus firmus that grows on the root. Counter® is available from AMVAC, Avicta® from Syngenta Seedcare, and Votivo® from Bayer CropScience...|$|E
40|$|Oryzalin (3, 5 -dinitro-N 4,N 4 -dipropyl-sulfanilamide) and BAS 083 (l,l-dimethylpiperdinium chloride) reduced root-knot {{infection}} in tomato roots when respectively applied as a soil drench at 20 ppm and 10, 000 ppm. Oryzalin reduced knot counts with various intervals between treatment and inoculation. BAS 083 reduced knot counts only when applied before inoculation. Oryzalin was shown {{not to be}} a <b>contact</b> <b>nematicide,</b> and BAS 083 was only a weak one. Neither compound reduced penetration by infective larvae. Postinfection reduction in knot counts by Oryzalin and BAS 083 resulted, in part, from activation of natural defense mechanisms of the host. Giant-cell development in cotton roots inoculated with nematodes was inhibited by Oryzalin. Lateral root development was inhibited by BAS 083...|$|E
40|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are microscopic worms {{that feed}} on plants. Almost every nematode that feeds on corn {{is capable of}} feeding on many other plants. These nematode parasites {{are thought to be}} native to most Iowa soils and to have fed upon native plants before corn was grown as a cultivated crop. Population densities (numbers) of most species of plant-parasitic nematodes that feed on corn have to increase to damaging levels (called damage thresholds) before yield loss occurs. Products that are currently available to manage plant-parasitic nematodes on corn in the state include the soil-applied insecticide/nematicide Counter® and two relatively new protectant seed treatments, Avicta® and Votivo®. Avicta® is a <b>contact</b> <b>nematicide</b> (active ingredient abamectin) that moves {{on the surface of the}} root, and Votivo® is a special strain of the natural soil bacterium Bacillus firmus that grows on the root. Avicta® is available from Syngenta Seedcare and Votivo® from Bayer CropScience. The objective of this experiment was to assess and compare the nematode population densities and yields of corn growing in plots with and without the nematode-protectant seed treatments...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in the {{laboratory}} of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the Department of Agriculture, University of Reading, UK, to investigate the toxicity of some plant materials against S. bradys. Laboratory investigations confirmed extracts of neem, cocoyam, ginger and maize to be effective against the yam nematode and as <b>contact</b> <b>nematicides</b> since their extracts killed the nematodes within two weeks. However, the percentage mortality was directly correlated with concentrations of the extracts and exposure time. Phytochemical screening of dried neem fruit, maize root, ginger root, and cocoyam corm powder for their chemical composition revealed the presence of oils, alkaloids, saponins, and flavonoids which may be responsible for the non-host status.

40|$|Ten {{populations of}} the cereal cyst {{nematode}} (Heterodera avenge Will.) from the Victorian Mallee and Wimmera districts, were tested for their variation in pathogenicity, using a selected range of cereal species and cultivars as. indicators. The tests were made in a glasshouse between 1967 and 1969. Of the oats used, Avena sterilis and A. strigosa were resistant, but all other cultivars and species were susceptible {{to each of the}} populations. Two barley cultivars, Morocco, and Marocaine 079 were resistant to all populations, but all other barleys used were susceptible. None of the cultivars of wheat was resistant; the spring wheat cv. Loris was very susceptible. Rye cv. South Australian was resistant to all populations. The results indicate that a single biotype of H. avenge is present in Victoria. It appears to be more "aggressive" than any of the biotypes known in Europe. Two hundred and forty cereal species and cultivars (wheat, barley, oats, rye and Triticales) were field. tested for resistance to H. avenge at Sea Lake in the Victorian Mallee between 1966 and 1969. All wheats tested were susceptible to very susceptible, and all Triticales were susceptible. Two barley cultivars Morocco, and Marocaine 079 were resistant and two others moderately resistant. Avena sterilis and A. strigosa were resistant and fifteen cultivars of A. sativa were moderately resistant. Rye cv. South. Australian, posseses a high degree of resistance in contrast to European ryes. The systemic nematicides "Temik" and "Lannate", and the fumigant nematicides ethylene dibromide and dibromochloropropane, were tested for control of H. avenge in a field experiment with Wheat at Sea Lake in the 1968 - 69 season. All chemical treatments reduced white cyst production, and four of the treatments increased grain yield, and reduced nematode carryover. "Temik" (11 kg/ha broadcast), gave the best nematode control and more than trebled grain yield. "Lannate" (13 'kg/ha broadcast) was almost as effective. Dibromochloropropane was an effective nematicide, but was phytotoxic at 56 1 /ha. The systemic nematicides "Temik", "Lannate", "Nemafos", "Vydate", "Nemac ur P", and the <b>contact</b> <b>nematicide</b> "Mocap" were tested for control of H. avenge in field experiments with wheat; at Greenland Dam in the Wimmera (1969 - 70), and at Sea Lake in the Mallee (1969 - 70 to 1971 - 72). In one series of experiments all the nematicides were compared on a broadcast basis. All chemical treatments reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. Plants from plots treated with "Temik" (9 kg/ha) were always cyst-free. "Mocap" when used at the same rate was severely phytotoxic. Grain from plots treated with "Temik" and "Lannate" at the higher rate (9 kg/ha) were analysed for the presence of chemical residues. No "Lannate" residues were detected, and "Temik" residues were less than 0. 1 ppm. In a second series of experiments, a comparison was made of methods and rates of application of "Temik" and "Lannate". All broadcast nematicide applications, except those at Sea Lake in 1969 - 70, reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. All nematicide applications with superphosphate in the drill row, except for "Lannate" 0. 3 kg/ha at Sea Lake in 1971 - 72, also reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. Significant grain yield increases were obtained in each experiment. "Temik" (9 kg/ha broadcast, and 2. 2 kg/ha in the drill row) consistently gave the best control of H. avenge. Plants from plots receiving these treatments were always cyst-free. In all experiments "Lannate" dusted wheat seed provided little, if any, control of H. avenge. When used at comparable rates of application, "Temik" was a more effective nematicide than "Lannate". Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
