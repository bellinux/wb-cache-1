40|$|Lingual orthodontics, {{among both}} young and adult patients, {{increased}} in popularity during last years. The {{purposes of the}} present investigation were to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) values and Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores of different lingual brackets compared with a vestibular <b>control</b> <b>bracket.</b> One hundred bovine teeth were extracted and embedded in resin blocks. Four different lingual brackets (Idea, Leone; STB, Ormco; TTR, RMO; 2 D, Forestadent) and a vestibular <b>control</b> <b>bracket</b> (Victory, 3 M) were bonded to the bovine enamel surfaces and subsequently shear tested to failure utilizing a Universal Testing Machine. SBS values were measured. A microscopic evaluation was performed to obtain ARI scores. Statistical analysis was performed at a statistically significant level of p < 0. 05 to determine significant differences in SBS values and ARI Scores. No statistically significant variations in SBS were reported among the different groups. Conversely, significant differences were shown in ARI scores among the various groups. Clinical relevance {{of the present study}} is that orthodontists can expect similar resistance to debonding forces from lingual appliances as with vestibular brackets...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of Lingual Orthodontics over Labial Orthodontics are many. While better esthetics during treatment {{is the most}} obvious, some advantages are purely mechanical, like more efficient distal movement, much easier intrusion, increased expansion, and the built-in capability in the bracket design (7 th generation ORMCO brackets) to reposition the mandible and tempoeromandibular jaw when needed. One of the primary hurdles which needs to be overcome is the irregularity and variability of lingual tooth morphology, {{and the difficulty of}} access, making accuracy of Direct Bonding dubious. The scientific practice of Lingual Orthodontics necessitates an Indirect Bonding Technique which allows us to <b>control</b> <b>bracket</b> placement in the laboratory, followed by a reliable and precise transfer procedure of the brackets in order to clinically bond them in the exact position which has been set at the laboratory stage. This article covers an Indirect Bonding Technique using the Torque Angulation Device (TAD) and the Bracket Positioning Device (BPD) which ensure great accuracy while minimizing the poten- tial for error as compared to most methods available to the orthodontist today. This technique has been developed by taking into account the advantages and pitfalls of indirect bonding...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} in vitro the shear bond strength of recycled orthodontic brackets. S 2 C- 03 Z brackets (Dental Morelli, Brazil) were bonded to the buccal surfaces of 50 extracted human premolars using Concise Orthodontic chemically cured composite resin (3 M, USA). The teeth were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n= 10), as follows. In group I (<b>control),</b> the bonded <b>brackets</b> remained attached until shear testing (i. e., no debonding/rebonding). In groups II, III and IV, the bonded brackets were detached and rebonded after recycling by 90 -mum particle aluminum oxide blasting, silicon carbide stone grinding or an industrial process at a specialized contractor company (Abzil-Lancer, Brazil), respectively. In group V, the bonded brackets were removed and new brackets were bonded to the enamel surface. Shear bond strength was tested in an Instron machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. There was no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the <b>control</b> <b>brackets</b> (0. 52 kgf/mm²), brackets recycled by aluminum oxide blasting (0. 34 kgf/mm²) and new brackets attached to previously bonded teeth (0. 43 kgf/mm²). Brackets recycled by the specialized company (0. 28 kgf/mm²) and those recycled by silicon carbide stone grinding (0. 14 kgf/mm²) showed the lowest shear strength means and differed statistically from <b>control</b> <b>brackets</b> (0. 52 kgf/mm²) (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the outcomes of this study showed that bracket recycling using 90 -µm aluminum oxide particle air-abrasion was efficient and technically simple, and might provide cost reduction for orthodontists and patients alike...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of white spot lesions in patients treated with fixed appliances {{is very common}} and {{can be seen as}} early as four weeks after band or bracket placement. Many methods can decrease or prevent white spot lesions: improving oral hygiene, modifying diet (low carbohydrate) and treating with topical fluoride. Most of these methods, however, rely on patient compliance, which is unreliable and therefore not compliable. The method thus selected is the application of fluoride varnish. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the short-term effect of a single-dose application of fluoride varnish on enamel demineralization adjacent to bonded brackets. Fifteen patients who needed at least two premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were selected. In each patient, one premolar was considered the test tooth and the other the <b>control.</b> <b>Brackets</b> were bonded on both the premolars, but only the test teeth received fluoride varnish.

40|$|Amplicon melting is a closed-tube {{method for}} {{genotyping}} {{that does not}} require probes, real-time analysis, or allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. However, correct differentiation of homozygous mutant and wild-type samples by melting temperature (Tm) requires high-resolution melting and closely controlled reaction conditions. When three different DNA extraction methods were used to isolate DNA from whole blood, amplicon Tm differences of 0. 03 to 0. 39 °C attributable to the extractions were observed. To correct for solution chemistry differences between samples, complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides were included as internal temperature controls to shift and scale the temperature axis of derivative melting plots. This adjustment was applied to a duplex amplicon melting assay for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase variants 1298 A>C and 677 C>T. High- and low-temperature <b>controls</b> <b>bracketing</b> the amplicon melting region decreased the Tm SD within homozygous genotypes by 47 to 82 %. The amplicon melting assay was 100 % concordant to an adjacent hybridization probe (HybProbe) melting assay when temperature controls were included, whereas a 3 % error rate was observed without temperature correction. In conclusion, internal temperature controls increase the accuracy of genotyping by high-resolution amplicon melting and should also improve results on lower resolution instruments...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{determine}} the shear bond strength (SBS) and adhesive remnant index (ARI) score of two self-etching no-mix adhesives (iBond™ and Scotchbond™) on different prosthetic surfaces and enamel, in comparison with the commonly used total etch system Transbond XT™. Materials and Methods. A total of 270 surfaces (1 enamel and 8 restorative surfaces, n= 30) were randomly divided into three adhesive groups. In group 1 (<b>control)</b> <b>brackets</b> were bonded with Transbond XT primer. In the experimental groups iBond adhesive (group 2) and Scotchbond Universal adhesive (group 3) were used. The SBS was measured using a Zwicki 1120 ™ testing machine. The ARI and SBS were compared statistically using the Kruskal–Wallis test (P≤ 0. 05). Results. Significant differences in SBS and ARI were found between the control group and experimental groups. Conclusions. Transbond XT showed the highest SBS on human enamel. Scotchbond Universal on average provides the best bonding on all other types of surface (metal, composite, and porcelain), with no need for additional primers. It might therefore be helpful for simplifying bonding in orthodontic procedures on restorative materials in patients.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{time dimension}} into income taxation. Economic theory derives optimal income taxation by explaining individual behaviors through utility and social welfaremaximization. We argue that observing collective behaviors through {{the distribution of}} number of returns and the revenue themselves offers a viable alternative. Our study is confined toUS joint returns individual income tax from 1996 to 2008. We introduce a combination of cubic spline fit to data and Pareto distribution to estimate the revenue and number of returns distributions. Normalization admits comparative study of year to year changes in those distributions. We discover that the tax burden of low income taxpayers has decreased consistently, while the conventional rule of inflation indexation of tax bracket only is applied. This is an instability {{in the sense that}} the distribution of revenue transforms into a qualitatively different distribution over time. We derive the control of the instability. <b>Control</b> using <b>brackets</b> only implies optimal brackets arewidened over the peak of the revenue and shifted to the right for higher <b>brackets.</b> <b>Control</b> using rates only implies an overall reduction of marginal tax rates. <b>Control</b> using both <b>brackets</b> andmarginal rates combines these two features. Some brackets are removed and consequently marginal rates for some taxpayers are reduced. Dependency of the distribution of number of returns to tax liability and tax parameters proves to have insignificant effect on the optimal tax parameters. Fairness is defined in the literature as tax liability per unit income. Control of the instability togetherwith a uniformchange in fairness is addressed. There is a trade-off between controlling instability and ensuring constant change in the fairness of the tax system. We derive the optimal brackets and marginal rates that minimize this trade-off. As expected, the general rule for optimality is that marginal tax rates are barely changed to provide constant change in fairness. Yet, small adjustment of the <b>brackets</b> provides <b>control</b> of the instability...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: White spot lesions are a {{major problem}} in {{orthodontic}} patients as they compromise esthetics. They are the result of decalcification of enamel that occurs around brackets. This in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three different forms of topical fluoride on enamel demineralization adjacent to bonded brackets. Materials and methods: A total of 24 patients who needed extraction of at least two premolars for orthodontic reasons were selected. In each patient, one premolar was the test tooth and the other was the <b>control.</b> <b>Brackets</b> were bonded but only the test teeth received topical fluoride, that is, Transbond PLUS Color Change Adhesive, bifluoride 12, GC Tooth Mousse Plus. The premolars were extracted after 80 to 90 days, and buccolingual sections 50 to 70 μm in thickness were evaluated with polarized light microscopy. The mean depth of demineralization in each lesion was measured using the software Image Pro Plus. Results: The difference between the values of the depth of demineralization in the experimental and control samples of all groups was found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 05). There was a 43. 3 % reduction in the lesion depth in the transbond plus group. There was a 67. 4 % reduction in the lesion depth in the GC tooth mousse group. There was a 70 % reduction in the lesion depth in the bifluoride varnish group. Conclusion: Enamel demineralization around brackets is significantly reduced by all the three materials used in this study. The highest amount of lesion depth reduction was seen in the Bifluoride varnish group. Transbond plus, was the least effective among the three materials used...|$|R

However, metallic or ceramic bracket bonding to femtosecond laser-treated zirconia surfaces has not been tested. This study compared the effects of four conditioning techniques, including femtosecond laser irradiation, on shear bond strength (SBS) of metallic and ceramic brackets to zirconia. Three hundred zirconia plates were divided into five groups: 1) control (C); 2) sandblasting (APA); 3) silica coating and silane (SC); 4) femtosecond laser (FS); 5) sandblasting followed by femtosecond laser (APA+SC). A thermal imaging camera measured temperature changes in the zirconia during irradiation. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups (metallic vs ceramic brackets). SBS was evaluated using a universal testing machine. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) was registered and surfaces were observed under SEM. Surface treatment and bracket type significantly affected the bracket-zirconia bond strength. SBS was significantly higher (p APA > FS > SC > <b>control)</b> than metallic <b>brackets</b> (APA+FS > FS > SC > APA > <b>control).</b> For metallic <b>brackets,</b> groups SC (5. 99 ± 1. 86 MPa), FS (6. 72 ± 2. 30 MPa) and APA+FS (7. 22 ± 2. 73 MPa) reported significantly higher bond strengths than other groups (p < 0. 05).

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of CPP-ACP paste and CO 2 laser irradiation on demineralized enamel microhardness and shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. Methods: Eighty caries-free human premolars were subjected to a demineralization challenge using Streptococcus mutans. After demineralization, the samples were randomly divided into five equal experimental groups: Group 1 (<b>control),</b> the <b>brackets</b> were bonded without any surface treatment; Group 2, the enamel surfaces were treated with CPP-ACP paste for 4 minutes before bonding; Group 3, the teeth were irradiated with CO 2 laser beams at a wavelength of 10. 6 µm for 20 seconds. The samples in Groups 4 and 5 were treated with CO 2 laser either before or through CPP-ACP application. SEM photomicrographs of a tooth from each group were taken to observe the enamel surface. The brackets were bonded to the buccal enamel using a conventional method. Shear bond strength of brackets and ARI scores were measured.

In orthodontics, several repetitions of the bonding procedure are necessary, therefore, adhesive systems requiring less time for application are of particular interest. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of incorporating single step adhesives to a traditional bonding system, on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. Sixty recently extracted human teeth were divided into three equal groups. Group I (<b>control)</b> : <b>brackets</b> were bonded with the Transbond XT adhesive system (3 M/Unitek) following the manufacturer's instructions; Group II: Single Bond (3 M) adhesive was applied to the tooth surface and Transbond XT adhesive paste was used to bond the brackets; Group III: Optibond Solo (Kerr Co.) adhesive was applied to the enamel surface and Transbond XT adhesive was used to bond the brackets. Teeth were stored in deionized water at 37 oC for 24 hours. A Zwick Universal Testing Machine was used to measure shear bond strength. The shear bond strengths for the three groups tested were; Group Ι: 11. 8 + 4. 6 Mpa; Group ΙΙ: 12. 5 + 3. 9 Mpa; and Group ΙΙΙ: 9. 7 + 4. 3 Mpa. Analysis of Variance (F= 2. 37) indicated that there were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) in the bond strengths among the three groups.

The failed bracket are usually rebonded on the tooth surface and several techniques have been used such as sand-pining and re-etching to enhance the effectiveness of bracket bonding to teeth surface. However, there are few investigations examined. The bond strength of bracket {{and the effectiveness of}} enhancement techniques have never been studied. Materials and methods: In this investigation, the shear bond strength of two different rebonding techniques of sandblasting and re-etching which are common in dentistry were evaluated and compared with primary bonding strength. Results: The mean shear stress for primary bonding interface (<b>control</b> samples) of <b>brackets</b> was 172. 11 kg force/cm 2. These values for rebonded brackets using two techniques of sandblasting and re-etching were 165. 89 kg force/cm 2 and 144. 23 kg force/cm 2, respectively. Conclusion: However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the shear strength responses of three groups. The results of the study showed that both techniques of rebonding of failed brackets can provide effective bonding strengths similar to the primary strength...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and compare three alternative methods for controlling classical friction: Self-ligating brackets (SLB), special brackets (SB) and special elastomeric ligatures (SEB). METHODS: The study compared Damon MX, Smart Clip, In-Ovation and Easy Clip self-ligating bracket systems, the special Synergy brackets and Morelli's twin bracket with special 8 -shaped elastomeric ligatures. New and used Morelli brackets with new and used elastomeric ligatures {{were used as}} <b>control.</b> All <b>brackets</b> had 0. 022 x 0. 028 -in slots. 0. 014 -in nickel-titanium and stainless steel 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in wires were tied to first premolar steel brackets using each archwire ligation method and pulled by an Instron machine at a speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. Prior to the mechanical tests the absence of binding in the device was ruled out. Statistical analysis consisted of the Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple non-parametric analyses at a 1 % significance level. RESULTS: When a 0. 014 -in archwire was employed, all ligation methods exhibited classical friction forces close to zero, except Morelli brackets with new and old elastomeric ligatures, which displayed 64 and 44 centiNewtons, respectively. When a 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in archwire was employed, all ligation methods exhibited values close to zero, except the In-Ovation brackets, which yielded 45 cN, and the Morelli brackets with new and old elastomeric ligatures, which displayed 82 and 49 centiNewtons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Damon MX, Easy Clip, Smart Clip, Synergy bracket systems and 8 -shaped ligatures proved to be equally effective alternatives for controlling classical friction using 0. 014 -in nickel-titanium archwires and 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in steel archwires, while the In-Ovation was efficient with 0. 014 -in archwires but with 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in archwires it exhibited friction that was similar to conventional brackets with used elastomeric ligatures...|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-adhesive resin cements do {{not require}} the surface {{treatment}} of teeth and are said to release fluoride, which makes them suitable candidates for bonding of orthodontic brackets. The objectives {{of this study was}} to investigate the shear bond strength (SBS) of self-adhesive resin cements on etched on non-etched surfaces in vitro and to assess their fluoride release features. Materials and Methods: Four fluoride-releasing dual-cure self-adhesive resin cements were investigated. For SBS experiment, 135 freshly extracted human maxillary premolars were used and divided into nine groups of 15 teeth. In the <b>control</b> group, <b>brackets</b> were cemented by Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, USA), in four groups self-adhesive resin cements were used without acid-etching and in four groups self-adhesive cements were applied on acid-etched surfaces and the brackets were then deboned in shear with a testing machine. Adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were also calculated. For fluoride release investigation, 6 discs were prepared for each self-adhesive cement. Transbond XT and Fuji Ortho LC (GC, Japan) served as negative and positive control groups, respectively. The fluoride release of each disc into 5 ml of de-ionized water was measured at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 using a fluoride ion-selective electrode connected to an ion analyzer. To prevent cumulative measurements, the storage solutions were changed daily. Results: The SBS of brackets cemented with Transbond XT were significantly higher compared to self-adhesives applied on non-etched surfaces (P< 0. 001). However, when the self-adhesive resin cements were used with enamel etching, no significant differences was found in the SBS compared to Transbond XT, except for Breeze. The comparisons of the ARI scores indicated that bracket failure modes were significantly different between the etched and non-etched groups. All self-adhesive cements released clinically sufficient amounts of fluoride for an extended period of time. Conclusion: For the tested cements, the strongest bonds were obtained by enamel acid-etching prior to bracket bonding. All the self-adhesive resin cements had significant long-term fluoride release and could be recommended as suitable fluoride-releasing orthodontic bonding materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the corrosion behavior of conventional and self-ligating stainless steel brackets and the surface structural changes in response to salad dressing. Damon, In-Ovation,Smart clip, Discovery, OMNI and Masel brackets were all included in the study. For the <b>control</b> group, the <b>brackets</b> were placed in Petri dishes with Potassium Ferrocyanide (Fe [CN] 6 K 4) and distilled water. Whereasas for the experimental group, the brackets were incorporated into the same reagent mixed with Oil-based - Kraft Classic French Oil and Water-based-Salad Magic, Herb and Garlic Dressing. The released ferrous ion concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer after 24 and 48 hours. Scanning electron microscope was used to analyze surface changes of the brackets. All types of brackets demonstrated signs of corrosion. Generally, self-ligating brackets were more susceptible to corrosion than the conventional ones the most extensive corrosion was seen in In-Ovation R™. Meanwhile, Masel was the most corroded brackets for conventional brackets. The oil-based salad dressing illustrated the most extensive corrosion in all brackets. Self-ligating brackets, Inovation R™ showed pitting corrosion on the wings. Smart clip showed surfaces corrosion only. The commonly ingested fluids aggravate the corrosive process, and this is related to sodium chloride content...|$|R
30|$|S. mutans (ATCC 25175) and TPY agar (ADSA, Barcelona, Spain) were {{selected}} for the antibacterial assay. The colony counting method {{was used in the}} present experiment. A suspension of S. mutans was prepared at a concentration of 1.5 [*]×[*] 106 colony forming units (CFU)/mL. Then, 100  μL of the suspension was added to 3  mL of liquid medium in tubes. The experimental group (TiO 2 coated <b>brackets)</b> and the <b>control</b> group (uncoated <b>brackets)</b> were transferred in the tubes. The tubes were incubated at 37  °C for 60  min under visible light with the intensity of 100  W* 2. After illumination, 10  μL of the suspension was diluted in 10  mL of sterile saline, and then 10  μL of this dilution was plated onto TPY agar plates and cultured at 37  °C for 24  h. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by colony counting on each plate (T 0). This procedure was repeated at 30  days (T 1), 60  days (T 2), and 90  days (T 3) intervals. After each process, the brackets were cleaned in phosphate-buffered saline and immersed in artificial saliva at 37  °C in an incubator; the artificial saliva was replenished every 48  h. The brackets were also subjected to sessions of 1000 thermocycles (1 -min duration) from 5  °C to 55  °C to simulate oral conditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} uniform {{framework}} generalising and extending the classical theories of projective differential geometry, c-projective geometry, and almost quaternionic geometry. Such geometries, {{which we call}} projective parabolic geometries, are abelian parabolic geometries whose flat model is an R-space G·p in the infinitesimal isotropy representation W of a larger self-dual symmetric R-space H·q. We also give a classification of projective parabolic geometries with H·q irreducible which, {{in addition to the}} aforementioned classical geometries, includes a geometry modelled on the Cayley plane OP^ 2 and conformal geometries of various signatures. The larger R-space H·q severely restricts the Lie-algebraic structure of a projective parabolic geometry. In particular, by exploiting a Jordan algebra structure on W, we obtain a Z^ 2 -grading on the Lie algebra of H in which we have tight <b>control</b> over Lie <b>brackets</b> between various summands. This allows us to generalise known results from the classical theories. For example, which riemannian metrics are compatible with the underlying geometry is controlled by the first BGG operator associated to W. In the final chapter, we describe projective parabolic geometries admitting a 2 -dimensional family of compatible metrics. This is the usual setting for the classical projective structures; we find that many results which hold in these settings carry over with little to no changes in the general case.
