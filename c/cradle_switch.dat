50|$|The phone {{consisted}} of a rotary dial, a handset <b>cradle,</b> <b>switch</b> hook, and a handset (sometimes called the receiver) wired to the base, and was constructed of a molded plastic housing covering a steel chassis. The user interface {{consisted of}} only the dial and switch hook buttons. No other components, switches, or controls were necessary, {{with the exception of}} a loudness control for the ringer, which was accessible on the bottom of the phone. The handset cradle was a molded part of the housing, formed of two U-shaped chairs which cradled the handle of the handset between the receiver and the transmitter cups. Each side of the cradle had a round plastic plunger positioned above a pair of levers connected in a spring-loaded yoke that operated the hook switch; pressing the plungers down ended the call and placed the phone on-hook. The plastic face of the dial under and surrounding the finger wheel was an integral part of the dial assembly and was exposed through a large circular opening in the housing. On the bottom, the flat steel plate of the chassis was exposed. The handset cord exited from the left side of the housing at the base, and the line cord emerged from the rear at the base.|$|E
