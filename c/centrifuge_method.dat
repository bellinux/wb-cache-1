A simple kinetic model is given to obtain the ion production rate {{as a function of}} the laser energy density, ultraviolet light energy density, atomic density and depth and height of the reaction region. The unit cost of enriched uranium is chosen as a value function instead of the unit cost of the separative work.

Effective usage of gas centrifuges were discovered by Pakistan which greatly enhances its capability to produce HEU fuels for both its commercial nuclear power plants and weapons. Pioneering research in physical performance of the centrifuges were studied by the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan in the 1970s-80s, using the meaningful vacuum methods for advancing the role of the centrifuges for the development of nuclear fuel. According to one theoretical physicist involved in the program maintained that the centrifuge program was quite difficult, the most enduring, and challenging project that scientists were tackling and studying. Many of the theorists working with A.Q. Khan were unsure that either gaseous and enriched uranium would be feasible on time. The scientist recalled his memories: [...] "No one in the world has used the gas <b>centrifuge</b> <b>method</b> to produce military-grade uranium.... This was not going to work. He Khan was simply wasting time." [...] Nonetheless and in spite of skepticism, the program was made feasible by Pakistan in the shortest time possible and enrichment by centrifuge has been used in physics experiments and effective physical use, particularly by Abdul Qadeer Khan in Pakistan, and the method was smuggled to at least three different countries {{by the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The uranium program {{proved to}} be a difficult, {{challenging}} and most enduring approach to scale up to industrial levels to military-grade. Producing HEU as a fissile material is even more difficult and challenging than extracting plutonium and Pakistan experimented with HEU as an implosion design as contrary to other nuclear states. Little and rudimentary knowledge was available of gas centrifuges at that time, and HEU fissile material was only known to the world for nuclear power usage; its military applications for HEU were non-existent. Commenting on the difficulty, mathematician Tasneem Shah; who worked with A.Q. Khan, was quoted in the book Eating Grass that [...] "hydrodynamical problem in centrifuge was simply stated, but extremely difficult to evaluate, not only in order of magnitude but in detailing also." [...] Many of Khan's fellow theorists were unsure about the feasibility of the enriched uranium on time despite Khan's strong advocacy.

Khan having difficulty getting his peers to listen to him, he aggressively continued his research and the program was made feasible in the shortest time possible. His efforts won him praise from Pakistan's politicians and military science circles, and he was now debuted as the [...] "father of the uranium" [...] bomb. On 28 May 1998, it was the KRL's HEU that ultimately created the nuclear chain reaction which led the successful detonation of boosted fission devices in a scientific experiment codenamed Chagai-I.|$|E

A systematic study is presented which showed that nano zero-valent iron material has little effect on bisphenol A degradation. When hydrogen peroxide was added to initiate the reaction, some percentage of bisphenol A removal (∼ 20 %) was achieved; however, {{with the aid of}} air bubbles, the percentage removal can be significantly increased to ∼ 99 %.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{studying}} the precipitin reactions between sera from patients with connective tissue diseases and the saline soluble extracts of young rabbit thymus acetone powder, a new precipitin system was observed, tentatively called the Tu system after the original serum. The Tu antigen activity was unaltered by heating up to 60 ℃ for 30 minutes, and was stable at pH values of 4 to 10. The precipitin activity was resistant to digestion by DNase and RNase, but partially sensitive to trypsin digestion, suggesting that a glycoprotein was associated with antigenicity. The average molecular weight of the Tu antigen {{was estimated to be}} 70, 000 as determined by Sephadex G- 200 chromatography analysis. The Tu antigen was localized in the cell cytoplasma, but not in cell nuclei nor nucleoli, as observed by indirect immunofluorescence and the peroxidase enzyme antibody technique. Cell fraction analysis by <b>centrifuge</b> <b>methods</b> clarified that the Tu antigen activity was in the microsomal fraction, mostly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction.

50|$|Receiving his {{doctorate}} engineering in 1972, Khan joined the senior {{staff of the}} Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory in Amsterdam from a recommendation by his mentor, Martin J. Brabers. His initial studies were on the high-strength metals used {{in the development of}} centrifuges. Gas centrifuges were first conceived by American physicist Jesse Beams as part of the Manhattan Project but the studies were discontinued in 1944. The Physics Laboratory was a subcontractor for Urenco Group which was operating a uranium-enrichment plant in Almelo, Netherlands. Established in 1970, Urenco employed the <b>centrifuge</b> <b>method</b> to assure a supply of enriched uranium for nuclear power plants in the Netherlands. When Urenco offered him to join the senior scientific staff there, Khan left the Physics Laboratory where he performed physics experiments on uranium metallurgy, to produce reactor-grade uranium usable for light water reactors. Urenco used the Zippe-type gas centrifuges— a method invented by German mechanical engineer Gernot Zippe in the Soviet Union's program. Enrichment of uranium is an extremely difficult physical process, as U235 exists in natural uranium at a concentration of only 0.7%; Urenco used the Zippe method to separate the fissile isotopes U235 from non-fissile U238 by spinning UF6 gas at up to ~100,000RPM. His pioneering research led to the improvement of the Zippe method, which at that time, was an emerging technology whose publications were classified by the Soviet Union. Khan's leading-edge research in metallurgy brought laurels to Urenco, which had him {{as one of the most}} senior scientists at the facility where he researched and studied. His pioneering research greatly improved the technological efficiency of the Zippe method; eventually, Urenco gave Khan access to the blueprints for the Zippe centrifuge to find mathematical solutions for the physics problems in the gas centrifuges.|$|E

The effects of soil type and inoculum density were studied. The Hendrickx <b>centrifuge</b> <b>method,</b> developed originally for extraction of free living nematodes from soil, performed better than the method used by the Dutch Plant Protection Service.

30|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{based on}} highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals {{have been developed}} to degrade organic pollutants into harmless water and carbon dioxide [1 – 3]. Various organic pollutants such as organic dyes [4], microcystins [5], phenol and its derivatives [6], biological-resistant pharmaceuticals [7], and landfill leachate [8] can be decomposed through AOPs. Fenton process, which uses dissolved ferrous salt as a homogeneous catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide, is one of the pioneering works in AOPs. However, homogeneous Fenton catalysts exhibit good performance only when pH[*]<[*] 3.0 because high acidic environment is necessary to prevent the precipitation of ferrous and ferric ions [8 – 10]. Furthermore, homogeneous Fenton catalysts can hardly be recycled [11, 12], and a large amount of iron sludge is generated in the process. To overcome these drawbacks, recyclable heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts have been developed, including Fe 3 O 4 [13, 14], BiFeO 3 [15], FeOCl [16], LiFe(WO 4) 2 [17], iron-loaded zeolite [4, 18], iron-containing clay [19], and carbon-based materials [20, 21]. Comparing to homogeneous Fenton catalyst, these heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts can degrade the organic pollutants in a wider pH range [11, 12, 15]. Moreover, the heterogeneous catalysts based on particles can be recycled by filtration, precipitation, centrifuge, and magnetic field [4, 10, 11]. However, the catalytic activities of the heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts were comparatively low for the practical applications [12, 15, 16]. Nanometer-sized catalysts have been tried to improve the activities, but nano-catalysts require complicated processes for synthesis, prevention of nanoparticle agglomeration, and size/shape control. In addition, recycle of nano-catalysts by filtration, precipitation, and <b>centrifuge</b> <b>methods</b> is difficult. Magnetite nanoparticles can be easily recycled by using a magnetic field and thus these are widely studied as a Fenton-like catalyst, but the catalytic activities are still not satisfactory for practical applications [12, 13, 22, 23]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel efficient heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a numerical and experimental investigation of resistivity index (RI) at low water saturations. A novel analysis of micro-CT images of small rock samples {{is combined with}} laboratory measurements to examine the predictive value of imagebased computations of RI. Experimentally measured porosity, formation factor, capillary pressure (Pc) and RI are compared with image-based computations using the same rock sample for both imaging and laboratory measurements. The fluid systems used are 2 wt% NaCl brine and air. The porous plate and <b>centrifuge</b> <b>methods</b> are used to measure Pc and RI at ambient conditions. Two carbonate samples from the Middle East and two outcrop sandstone samples (Fontainebleau and Bentheimer) are investigated. Three of the samples are homogeneous {{and one of the}} carbonate samples is heterogeneous. The effects of injection boundaries on image based computations of single and multiphase flow properties of the rock samples are investigated numerically. The RI of Fontainebleau and Bentheimer sandstone is studied at water saturations as low as 10 %. The laboratory measurements show {{that it is possible to}} conduct reasonable tests on the small rock samples which are used for image analysis. For homogeneous rocks these measurements compare well with measurements made using conventional size cores and the measurements are in reasonable agreement with image-based computations. Simulations are in good agreement with experimental measurements of capillary drainage RI using the porous plate method at water saturations as low as 10 %. However, this agreement is a result of careful treatment of discretisation effects. Fontainebleau sandstone exhibits a percolating network of grain contacts, while the high-porosity Bentheimer sandstone does not. It is shown that this difference in the topological connection of conductive films at low water saturations is responsible for the non- Archie behaviour of Fontainebleau sandstone. It is shown that grain contact conductivity needs to be attributed to the grain contacts in Fontainebleau sandstone in order to reconcile experiments and computations. Conductive films organised as pendular rings around grain contacts are shown to be insufficient to explain this result...|$|R

30|$|The {{laboratory}} {{methods used}} to calculate relative permeability functions are grouped into centrifuge, steady- and unsteady-state techniques. The <b>centrifuge</b> <b>method</b> has limitations including loss of information on low saturation region that cannot be gained from the production data as low mobility ratio (Hirasaki et al. 1995). A simplified analysis of <b>centrifuge</b> <b>method</b> could miss some significant information of actual relative permeability. Steady-state methods have some disadvantages, especially in low permeability rocks where it is laborious to reach multiple steady states, and capillary forces and capillary end effects are significant (Kamath et al. 1993; Schembre and Kovscek 2003). Steady-state techniques have been improved by correcting capillary effects, but they still require successive measurements for different total flow rates and steady-state condition confirmations (Virnovsky et al. 1995). Capillary pressure has {{a significant effect on}} saturation distribution and recovery, and capillary forces dominate multiphase flow in low permeability rocks and fractured reservoirs. Unsteady-state method still remained widely utilized to estimate relative permeabilities. In developing unsteady-state methods for low-permeability systems, it is necessary to account for capillary pressure when obtaining the relative permeability curve. Akin and Kovscek (1999) showed that the use of the (unsteady) JBN technique leads to inaccurate assessment of relative permeability in some cases.|$|E
