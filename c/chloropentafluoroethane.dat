50|$|<b>Chloropentafluoroethane</b> is a {{chlorofluorocarbon}} {{once used}} as a refrigerant. Its production and consumption has been banned since 1 January 1996 under the Montreal Protocol because of its ozone-depleting potential.|$|E
40|$|Gaseous {{fluorination}} with {{hydrogen fluoride}} at atmospheric {{pressure of the}} two isomers CClF 2 CClF 2 and CCl 2 FCF 3 was carried out continuously on a chromic oxide based catalyst. The fluorinated derivative, obtained in a yield greater than 90 %, was <b>chloropentafluoroethane.</b> Hexafluoroethane and an isomeric mixture of trichlorotrifluoroethane were obtained as by-products. The latter was recycled with unconverted C 2 Cl 2 F 4 for further fluorination. Both conversion of C 2 Cl 2 F 4 and selectivity {{to the formation of}} C 2 ClF 5 were affected by temperature, contact time and molar ratio of the reagents. The catalytic activity of chromic oxide was adversely affected by small amounts of water in the hydrogen fluoride. A difference was also observed in the reactivity of the two isomersCCl 2 FCF 3 and CClF 2 OClF 2 The formation of C 2 Cl 3 F 3 as a by-product was due to the disproportionating activity of chromic oxide upon C 2 Cl 2 F 4...|$|E
