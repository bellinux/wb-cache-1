40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a cultural history of Australian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> related artistic controversies. It examines {{a number of}} disputes over authorship, collaboration, and appropriation {{across a variety of}} cultural fields. It considers legal controversies over the plagiarism of texts, the defacing of paintings, the sampling of musical works, the ownership of plays, the co-operation between film-makers, the sharing of MP 3 files on the Internet, and the appropriation of Indigenous culture. Such narratives and stories relate to a broad range of works and subject matter that are protected by <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This study offers an archive of oral histories and narratives of artistic creators about <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> It is founded upon interviews with creative artists and activists who have been involved in copyright litigation and policy disputes. This dialogical research {{provides a}}n insight into the material and social effects of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This thesis concludes that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> is not just a ‘creature of statute’, {{but it is also a}} social and imaginative construct. In the lived experience of the law, questions of aesthetics and ethics are extremely important. Industry agreements are quite influential. Contracts play an important part in the operation of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> The media profile of personalities involved in litigation and policy debates is pertinent. This thesis claims that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> can be explained by a mix of social factors such as ethical standards, legal regulations, market forces, and computer code. It can also be understood in terms of the personal stories and narratives that people tell about litigation <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> reform.

40|$|The main {{thesis of}} this article {{is that one of the}} Copyright Act’s {{principal}} aims is to promote the distribution of knowledge and information, and that any reform of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> must maintain this goal and must in a negative sense, not restrict ‘freedom of communication’ more than is necessary to achieve that aim. Now more than ever, at a time of unprecendented developments in the market for information, <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> presents both potential threats and potential benefits which must be carefully weighed up from the point of view of general welfare, and benefits for the individual author, user, and the user as author in her turn. First, I will examine the interrelationship between <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> freedom of communication, both within the closed doctrinal system of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> from the external viewpoint of a right or freedom of communication. Then I will consider digitisation and the future of <b>copyright</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> will end with an attempt to draw some conclusions...|$|R

40|$|In this book, Benjamin Farrand employs an {{interdisciplinary}} approach that combines legal analysis with political theory {{to explore the}} development of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> in the EU. Farrand utilises Foucault's concept of Networks of Power and Culpepper's Quiet Politics to assess the adoption <b>and</b> enforcement of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> in the EU, including the role of industry representative, cross-border licensing, and judicial approaches to territorial restrictions. Focusing in particular on legislative initiatives concerning copyright, digital music and the internet, Networks of Power in Digital <b>Copyright</b> <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> Policy: Political Salience, Expertise and the Legislative Process demonstrates the connection between <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> complex network relationships. This book presents an original socio-political theoretical framework for assessing developments in <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> that will interest researchers and post-graduate students of <b>law</b> <b>and</b> politics, {{as well as those}} more particularly concerned with political theory, EU <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
