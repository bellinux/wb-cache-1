5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

25|$|The first {{well-documented}} {{description of}} a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets. Alberti's system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing {{the letter of the}} corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, in 1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the Vigenère cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, only provided a progressive, rigid, and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> {{restoring}} native riparian communities, restoration practitioners {{often have}} to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration {{is to be done}} on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts. Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.|$|E

40|$|In current bridge {{management}} systems (BMSs), load and speed restrictions are applied on unhealthy bridges {{to keep the}} structure safe and serviceable {{for as long as}} possible. But the question is, whether applying these restrictions will always decrease the internal forces in <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the bridge and enhance the safety of the unhealthy bridges. To find the answer, this paper {{for the first time in}} literature, looks into the design aspects through studying the changes in demand by capacity ratios <b>of</b> the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> a bridge under the train loads. For this purpose, a structural model of a simply supported bridge, whose dynamic behaviour is similar to a group of real railway bridges, is developed. Demand by capacity ratios <b>of</b> the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the bridge are calculated, to identify their sensitivity to increase of speed and magnitude of live load. The outcomes of this study are very significant as they show that, on the contrary to what is expected, by applying restriction on speed, the demand by capacity ratio <b>of</b> <b>components</b> may increase and make the bridge unsafe for carrying live load. Suggestions are made to solve the problem...|$|R
25|$|Discovery of the M–σ {{relation}} {{was taken}} by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies. Prior to about 2000, the main concern had been the simple detection of black holes, while afterward the interest changed to understanding the role of supermassive black holes as a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> galaxies. This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected.

It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of security engineering.|$|E
