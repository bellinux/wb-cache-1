2500|$|Gasification [...] of coal or lignite or {{pet coke}} {{produces}} syngas or coal gas or <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>gas</b> {{which is a}} mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. Coal gas can be converted into synthetic natural gas (SNG) by using Fischer–Tropsch process at low pressure and high temperature. Coal gas can also be produced by underground coal gasification where the coal deposits are located deep in the ground or uneconomical to mine the coal. [...] CNG and LNG are emerging as economical alternatives to diesel oil with the escalation in international crude oil prices. Synthetic natural gas production technologies have tremendous scope to meet the transport sector requirements fully using the locally available coal in India. Dankuni coal complex is producing syngas which is piped to the industrial users in Calcutta. Many coal based fertiliser plants which are shut down can also be retrofitted economically to produce SNG as LNG and CNG fetch good price by substituting imports. Recently, Indian government fixed the natural gas price at producer end as 5.61 US$ per mmbtu on net calorific value (NCV) basis which is at par with the estimated SNG price from coal.|$|E

The primary aim of this work was to study the influence of the high amount of hydrogen present in the COG on the process of dry reforming, as well as the influence of other operation conditions, such us temperature and volumetric hourly space velocity (VHSV). It was found that the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction takes place due to the hydrogen present in the COG, and that its influence on the process increases as the temperature decreases. This situation may give rise to the consumption of the hydrogen present in the COG, and the consequent formation of a syngas which is inappropriate for the synthesis of methanol. This reaction can be avoided by working at high temperatures (about 1000 °C) in order to produce a syngas that is suitable for methanol synthesis. It was also found that the RWGS reaction is favoured by an increase in the VHSV. In addition, the active carbon FY 5 was proven to be an adequate catalyst for the production of syngas from COG.

40|$|Major {{industrial}} accidents continue {{to occur in}} process industries in spite of advances in risk management and abnormal condition management made over the last 40 years. A change in hazard identification (HAZID) theory and practice is required to better support process diagnosis and improve abnormal condition management, thus leading {{to a reduction in}} the number and severity of accidents. To improve HAZID for better supporting diagnosis the scope of HAZID analysis should be widened and knowledge generation and reuse associated with HAZID should be improved. To address these two major issues, a conceptual framework for systematically describing process system operation has been developed to guide the formation of a novel hazard identification methodology able to delivers outcomes with a high coverage of hazards and rich causal knowledge {{that can be used for}} supporting diagnosis. The conceptual framework was called the Functional Systems Framework. It allows qualitative knowledge associated with structure-function-goal relationships in process systems to be expressed in a clear and consistent manner. This knowledge describes how components, streams and connections form the structure of the system and how their capabilities describe system function. The capabilities explicitly describe how the actions of components and streams affect system properties to meet the goals of the system. The capability concept is crucial for describing the structure-function-goal relationships of process systems. The Functional Systems Framework was used to guide the formation of a novel HAZID method called the Blended Hazard Identification (BLHAZID) methodology. The primary purpose of the BLHAZID methodology is to generate knowledge to be used for supporting fault diagnosis. Therefore the outcomes of the method must contain a high coverage of hazards, richly describe failure causality and be able to be captured using computer-aided tools. This facilitates effective reuse of knowledge. The BLHAZID methodology takes advantage of the blending of two fundamental approaches to hazard identification: function-driven, such as Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), and component-driven, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The BLHAZID methodology utilises the strengths of both approaches and minimizes their weaknesses by blending them together, forming a single approach with increased utility. Explicitly examining both functional and structural failures delivers outcomes with high coverage. The BLHAZID approach can be used to describe failure causality between process system equipment and streams in great detail and hence generate rich causal knowledge. The knowledge associated with the BLHAZID is captured and expressed in a structured language using computer based tools. This knowledge can then be reused for many applications, the most pertinent being diagnosis. Industrial case studies of increasing complexity show how the BLHAZID methodology is applied in practice. A BTX storage system and <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>gas</b> bleeder, located at BlueScope Steel Ltd., are analysed to show the basic characteristics of the methodology. The BTX storage and transfer system is a combination of a batch and a continuous system, transferring BTX material periodically to a tanker. The bleeder is a safety relief system that flares <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>gas</b> under high pressure conditions and therefore has two major operational modes: under normal pressure conditions and high pressure conditions when flaring occurs. A benzene saturation unit, at BP Refinery (Bulwer Island), is studied to show how the BLHAZID methodology can be applied to more intricate process systems. The benzene saturation unit contains a benzene hydrogenation reactor circuit combined with a control system and a large recycle of material and energy. These industrial case studies showed that the BLHAZID methodology generated outcomes that contained increased coverage and richer causality compared with other HAZID methods, with the extensibility and expressive power of the structured language allowing the effective capture of the BLHAZID outcomes. While the final quality of the outcomes is affected by the strengths of the analysis team, the BLHAZID methodology is indeed more effective at supporting fault diagnosis than other HAZID techniques because of the formal approach of relating capabilities to function and failure, the systematic nature of the workflow, the logical linking between subsystems that allows causality to be traced throughout a process system and the power of the structured language that supports effective reuse of BLHAZID knowledge. This work is a contribution towards a change in the field of HAZID, where detailed theory associated with hazard identification and failure propagation in process systems meets with an increased use of knowledge management tools and practices...|$|R
