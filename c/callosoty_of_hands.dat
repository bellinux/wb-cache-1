The palm side <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> is generally used because, it is very easy to capture using a simple scanning device and we can extract the shape based features as well as the palm print from the same image. Dorsum <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> (backside <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> or topside <b>of</b> <b>hand)</b> is the apposite side of the palm side <b>of</b> the <b>hand.</b> In this work, we highlight some of the advantages of using dorsum <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> for modeling a biometrics based human recognition system.

In this study, we investigated the effect of loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG), atopic dermatitis and wet work exposure on the development <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in apprentice nurses. Dutch apprentice nurses were genotyped for the four most common FLG mutations; atopic dermatitis and hand eczema history were assessed by questionnaire. Exposure and hand eczema during traineeships were assessed with diary cards. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema during traineeships was higher among subjects with a history <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema reported at inclusion.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in hairdressers in Sweden. Methods: The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was estimated in a Swedish longitudinal retrospective cohort study including all female graduates from vocational schools for hairdressers from 1970 to 1995. A stratified sample {{from the general}} population acted as controls. A self-administered questionnaire including questions on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema, skin atopy, working periods and number of hair treatments performed per week was sent to the participants. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema were estimated. Results: The incidence rate <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema in hairdressers was 23. 8 cases/ 1000 person-years, whereas in hairdressers who were aged, 25 years it was 37. 1 / 1000 person-years. The corresponding IRR for hairdressers compared with controls was 2. 5 (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 2. 2 to 2. 8), and that for younger hairdressers was 3. 1 (95 % Cl 2. 6 to 3. 5). The mean age at onset <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was 21. 6 years for hairdressers and 21. 2 years for controls. The 1 -year prevalence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was 18. 0 % for hairdressers and 12. 1 % for controls. A large number of hair treatments involving exposure to skin irritants and sensitisers were reported. The incidence rate <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was higher among individuals with a history of childhood eczema, both for hairdressers and for controls, giving an (age-adjusted) IRR of 1. 9 and 2. 2, respectively. The attributable fraction <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema from skin atopy was 9. 6 %. A synergistic effect of skin atopy and hairdressing was found on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema. The relative excess risk due to interaction was 1. 21 (95 % Cl 0. 21 to 2. 21; p = 0. 01). Conclusion: Hairdressers are highly exposed to skin-damaging substances. The self-reported incidence <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema was substantially higher in female hairdressers than in controls {{from the general population}} and than that found previously in register-based studies. For many individuals, onset <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> eczema occurs early in life.
