The aim {{is to provide a}} comprehensive overview about <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> in accordance with valid legal regulations of the Czech Republic. First of all, particular kinds of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and financial instruments into which insurance companies can invest the resources of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> are described. The following section contains an analysis of the development of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and their dependence on written premium.

40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important item of liabilities in accounting of an insurance company. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> reperesent liabilities for clients of the insurance companies. The exact amount of these provisions is not known in advance. The main reason for generating <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> by insurance companies is to fulfill the liabilites arising from insurance and reinsurance contracts in the future. The first chapter of this thesis deals with the principle of the provisions in accounting in general. The next chapters deals with the provisions generated according to IFRS and the czech law. The most extensive chapter describes the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> from the perspective of the czech law for insurance companies.

40|$|The Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of current approaches to the creation and a financial placement of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions.</b> The first part defines the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and their creation {{with regard to the}} application of Solvency II. The thesis also {{deals with the}} principles and structure of financial placement. Due to a past financial crisis that affected not only banks, but also insurance companies, the thesis will also focus on the relationship of the financial crisis on investment of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions.</b> In the second part the thesis describes the approach and creation of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and financial placements of specific commercial insurance companies and its comparison with other insurance companies. The result of the thesis is the evaluation and recommendations for optimization of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and financial investment for the insurance companies...|$|R
40|$|Providing risk-sharing {{benefits}} to risk-averse policy holders {{is a primary}} function of insurance companies. We model that policy holders are paying a fee over {{the present value of}} indemnifications (i. e., <b>technical</b> <b>provisions)</b> to enjoy these risksharing benefits. This fee implies that a capital structure largely consisting of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> is optimal for insurance firms, making the traditional Modigliani-Miller logic inappropriate for them. To support the issuance of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> with socially desirable properties, insurance firms hold a surplus to absorb losses. We show that the Modigliani-Miller logic applies to the composition of this loss-absorption capacity. This explains why insurance companies may use, next to equity and <b>technical</b> <b>provisions,</b> financial debt in supporting their activities. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The pillar 1 {{framework}} set out {{qualitative and}} quantitative requirements for calculation of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) using either a standard formula given by the regulators or an internal model developed by the (re)insurance company. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> comprise two components: the best estimate of the liabilities (i.e. the central actuarial estimate) plus a risk margin. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> are intended to represent the current amount the (re)insurance company {{would have to pay}} for an immediate transfer of its obligations to a third party.|$|R
40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> representthe most {{important}} item of the liabilities of insurance companies. First chapter of this thesis {{deals with the}} characteristics {{and the sense of}} provisions in any accounting entity. The next chapters are concerned with the regulation of provisions according to the current czech account and tax law and to the IAS/IFRS. The next chapter is the most extensive. This chapter describes <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and rules for their creation, accountig, measurement according to the current valid law in the Czech republic. The subchapters describe the particular <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and their differenties and calculation.

40|$|Entities such as {{commercial}} {{insurance companies are}} obliged to create <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> {{in order to fulfill}} their activities. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> are used to cover liabilities of commercial insurance companies arising from insurance and reinsurance activities. The principal aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the impact of the creation and use of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> for some important items of the financial statements, which are liabilities, a balance sheet, profit and an income tax base. A prerequisite to fulfill the objective of the paper is to analyze the accounting legislation for <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> in an insurance company. The intention of the presented paper can be divided according to its conception into two parts. The first part of the paper is devoted to methodological aspects in relation to the general definition of the accounting principles and their importance in the accounting of commercial insurance companies. The second part deals with the methodological procedure of the accounting of the creation and use of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and the specifics of how they are reported in the financial statements of commercial insurers.

In contrast to other liabilities the exact volume of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> is not predetermined. This thesis is focused on <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> in non-life insurance, mainly on claims provisions, that are the most significant type of provisions in non-life classes of business. The aim is to analyse methods leading to the estimate {{of the value of}} ultimate claims arising from insurance events, that happened during the given time period. Claims provision is the part of ultimate claims, that has not already been paid. The speciality of some insurance classes as well as several factors, that may influence the correct estimate of claims provisions, are also analysed. The goal of this thesis is to present various possible ways, how to deal with these factors in order to prevent distortions of the estimate of ultimate claims.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the accounting information management through the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> constituted by insurance companies {{as a response to the}} economic and tax regulations of the Brazilian insurance market. The accounts of the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> enable discretionary accounting choices, and the uncertainty around its estimative provide significant opportunities for the accounting information management, aiming at achieving two purposes: i) the improvement of the solvency parameters and ii) the reduction of tax payments. The specific accruals approach was applied on a sample of 360 observations from 60 insurance companies and a time series of 6 years (2001 - 2006). Regarding the evidences from the empiric research, the hypotheses established were confirmed, that is, the directors of the insurance companies influence the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> downwards if the parameters for solvency and taxes are lower, but on the other hand, they influence the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> upwards if the values of the parameters for solvency and taxes are higher. However, in order to achieve more robust results from the empiric research, the use of estimate error of the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> is suggested as the dependent variable for the econometric models adopted. This is still not possible in Brazil because the ruling entity of this sector does not make the necessary information for this analysis available, differently from the procedures adopted by the North American insurance market. O objetivo principal desta pesquisa é investigar o gerenciamento da informação contábil através das provisões técnicas constituídas por sociedades seguradoras como resposta à regulação econômica e tributária. As contas de provisões técnicas possibilitam escolhas contábeis discricionárias e a incerteza que cerca sua estimação fornece significativas oportunidades para o gerenciamento da informação contábil, visando atingir dois propósitos: i) melhorar parâmetros de solvência e ii) reduzir pagamentos dos impostos. Foi empregada a abordagem de accruals específicos sobre uma amostra composta por 360 observações, oriundas de 60 companhias seguradoras e uma série temporal de 6 anos (2001 - 2006). No que diz respeito às evidências da pesquisa empírica, confirmaram-se as hipóteses estabelecidas, isto é, os diretores das sociedades seguradoras influenciam para baixo as provisões técnicas se os valores dos parâmetros de solvência e dos impostos são menores, mas, por outro lado, influenciam para cima as provisões técnicas se os valores dos parâmetros de solvência e dos impostos são maiores. Entretanto, para dar maior robustez aos resultados da pesquisa empírica, sugere-se o uso do erro de estimação das provisões técnicas como variável dependente dos modelos econométricos empregados. Isso ainda não é possível no Brasil, pois o órgão regulador do setor não disponibiliza as informações necessárias para calcular essa variável, diferentemente do procedimento adotado no mercado norte-americano de seguros...|$|R
