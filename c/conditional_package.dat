40|$|This article aims to {{show the}} {{conditions}} under which a revealing metaphor becomes valid and hermeneutically significant, based on the two terms that are placed in comparative balance. If the interpretation that deserves to be attached to a revealing metaphor highlights its meaning and instruments it, then the double process of adapting the common attribute of the two terms to the object of insertion can be revealed starting from this interpretation as well. We identify hence three conditions for a genuine creation of the metaphor: 1) the suitability of the host-object structure to the features of the common attribute; 2) the pre-existence of an attributive equivalent in the host-object; 3) the existence of an insertion perspective (as a possibility of equivalence). Discovering semantic bridges among contrasting linguistic entities passes through the filter of this threefold <b>conditional</b> <b>package</b> and lays the grounds for a possible methodology of terminological selection and then of metaphorical construction...|$|E
50|$|Before {{moving to}} Kansas City {{it had its}} {{corporate}} headquarters in Berkeley, California with a production facility in Pocatello, Idaho. Engineering design {{was carried out in}} Bristol, United Kingdom. In December 2010 Nordic announced its plans to move to Missouri to be closer to its target market and was offered $5.6 million in <b>conditional</b> incentive <b>packages</b> to relocate to Kansas City International Airport. Nordic temporarily occupied 50000 sq ft of the 1700000 sq ft former American Airlines Overhaul facility at the airport which the airline had abandoned. It was scheduled to be the first tenant at the KCI Intermodal Business Centre being developed by Trammell Crow Company at the airport.|$|R
40|$|The {{packages}} geoR and geoRglm are contributed {{packages to}} the statistical software system R, implementing methods for geostatistical data analysis. In this paper {{we focus on}} the capabilities of the packages, the computational implementation and related issues, and indicate directions for future developments. geoR implements methods for Gaussian and transformed Gaussian models. The package includes functions and methods for reading and preparing the data, exploratory analysis, inference on model parameters including variogram based and likelihood based methods, and spatial interpolation. The generic term kriging is used in the geostatistical literature in connection with several methods of spatial interpolation/prediction. geoR implements some of the classical “kriging flavours ” such as simple, ordinary, universal and external trend kriging and includes algorithms for <b>conditional</b> simulation. The <b>package</b> also implements Bayesian methods which take the parameter uncertainty into account when predicting at specified locations. The package geoRglm is an extension of geoR for inference in generalised linear spatial models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. geoRglm implements conditional simulation and Bayesian inference for the Poisson and Binomial generalised linear models...|$|R
