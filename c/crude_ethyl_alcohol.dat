The present study aimed to determine total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity, and anti proliferative activity of black tea (Camellia sinensis Kuntze) extract in vitro. <b>Crude</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> extract of black tea was prepared. To determine antioxidant activity, total phenol, and flavonoids {{content of the}} extract, the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, Folin-Ciocalteu method and aluminum chloride colorimetric method were used, respectively. The anti proliferative activity in cancerous (AGS) and normal (HDFs) cell lines was tested by MTT 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 ol) 2, 5 di phenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay. The IC 50 of DPPH radical assay was 8 +/- 1. 41 mu g/ml, compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) with IC 50 25. 41 +/- 1. 89 mu g/ml. The total phenol and flavonoid contents were 341. 8 +/- 4. 41 mg GAE/g and 21. 1 +/- 2. 11 mg RUT /g, respectively. The extract showed higher anti proliferative activity against the cancer cell line than normal cell line. 48 hours after treatment, <b>crude</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> extract inhibited the proliferation of AGS and HDFs cells with IC 50 values of 264. 3 mu g/ml and 689. 5 mu g/ml, respectively. This study revealed that the <b>crude</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> extract of black tea suppresses the proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. It is a rich resource of natural antioxidants and can prevent a lot of diseases such as cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fifty two Wistar albino rats of {{both sexes}} were used for {{determination}} of the LD 50 and some toxicological studies of the active principles of Euphorbia heliscopia (sun spourge). The oral LD 50 was 1211. 7 mg/kg. b. wt. of <b>crude</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> extracts under our environmental conditions. The symptoms appear on the intoxicated animals were included increase activity and irritability, salivation, itching the nose and mouth on the cage floor, and diarrhea. The animals were tried to make tunnels under the bed and they were reluctant {{to stand at the}} cage corners. Finally the animals closed its eyes and become calm. The animals administered high dose were died after a latent period (3 hours) and some of the animals in other groups were died within 24 hours. Concerning the haematological changes, there were no significant changes of PCV, Hb concentration, RBCs count, while there were significant increase of WBCs, and monocytes. Also there were highly significant increase and decrease of neutrophilis and lymphocytes respectively. The biochemical changes were reveled significant increase in creatinine, urea, uric acid, AST, ALP, cholesterol, T. protein and globulin. PM examination showed alveolar hemorrhages, proliferation of Kuppfer cells, necrosis infiltrated by lymphocytes in lung, liver and spleen. Hyaline deposits and pinkish staining proteineous deposits were seen in Bowman's space of some glomeruli. It is concluded that E. heliscopia was a moderate toxic materials and must be avoided to introduce in the animal feed...|$|E
40|$|For {{sea urchin}} {{aquaculture}} {{to be successful}} large numbers of juveniles need to be efficiently and cheaply produced. To do this, cues to induce settlement and metamorphosis need to be known. Potential settlement cues were tested in laboratory assays against larvae of the fast growing tropical/subtropical sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla. Preliminary experiments showed that T. gratilla larvae settle in response to marine biofilms, Dictyota dichotoma, Ulva lactuca, a non-geniculate coralline alga and adult conspecifics. In follow up experiments T. gratilla larvae settled in response {{to all of the}} 11 macroalgae tested including six brown macroalgae, two non-coralline red macroalgae, two geniculate coralline red macroalgae, a green alga and a marine biofilm. T. gratilla larvae settled in response to water conditioned with eight of the 11 macroalgae tested but only the <b>crude</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> extract of Zonaria angustata, induced settlement. When Sargassum linearifolium, Homeostrichus olsenii and Z. angustata were cleaned to reduce abundances of surface bacteria settlement in response to these algae was significantly reduced or inhibited totally indicating that T. gratilla larvae settle in response to bacterial biofilms on the surfaces of these macroalgae. T. gratilla larvae also settled at a significantly higher rate in the presence of live juvenile and their faeces compared to water and surfaces conditioned with juveniles and controls. This is the first report of a sea urchin settling in response to a conspecific. In all controls using filtered UV treated seawater there was no settlement of larvae, indicating that the need for a cue was obligatory. These results indicate that marine biofilms should provide an adequate cue to settle T. gratilla in culture however, the use of other cues may be possible...|$|E

40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the use of}} terrestrial plant extracts as substitutes for toxic chemicals to control the major fouling organisms of mangroves, the barnacles. In terms of the solvents used to obtain the plant <b>crude</b> extracts, <b>ethyl</b> acetate was best, <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> next and pure water worst, except {{in the case of}} Allium cepa (AC), where pure water was better than <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> For different plants, different solvents resulted in different poisonous effects, and plants belonging to different classes showed different levels of activities. In particular, using <b>ethyl</b> acetate <b>crude</b> extracts, Allium sativum (AS), AC and Capsicum annuum (CA) caused massive death of barnacle larvae at a low concentration in the shortest time. The less poisonous organic solvents were able to extract more active materials, and this was advantageous in enhancing the effect. For pure water crude extracts, AC and Zingiber officinale were best, but for 95 % <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>crude</b> extracts, AS and AC were best. For <b>ethyl</b> acetate <b>crude</b> extracts, the effects of AS, AC and CA were better. Different solvent extracts of AC with 12 h of exposure all had LC 50 values < 100 mg/L.

40|$|Blueberry {{contains}} many substances {{that are important}} to the human body and can prevent cardiovascular diseases, protect the retina, and soften blood vessels. Anthocyanin, which is extracted from blueberry, can activate the retina, strengthen vision, reduce serum cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein, and protect cell nucleus tissues from radical oxidation; hence, blueberry is of importance to scientists from different countries. In this study, anthocyanin was extracted and separated from blueberry using <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to investigate the effects of factors, such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> volume ratio on anthocyanin extraction and separation technologies.
