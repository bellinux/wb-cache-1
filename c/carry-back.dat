50|$|The chief {{sponsor of}} the bill (H.R. 5238) was Henry Waxman (sometimes {{referred}} to as the author of the Act), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. It passed the House of Representatives on 14 December 1982, and was similarly approved by voice vote in the Senate on 17 December. On 4 January 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the ODA into law. Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting less than 200,000 American citizens. In order to encourage the development of drugs for orphan diseases, the ODA included a number of incentives including seven-year market exclusivity for companies that developed orphan drug, tax credits equal to half of the development costs, later changed to a fifteen-year carry-forward provision and a three-year <b>carry-back</b> that can be applied in profitable year, grants for drug development, fast-track approvals of drugs indicated for rare diseases, and expanded access to the Investigational New Drug Program. The law was also later amended to waive user fees charged under PDUFA.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} inter-temporal loss usage of tax units in Germany. Tax units that {{experience}} {{a loss in}} a year can offset that loss with positive income from adjacent year to receive a tax refund. Similar to companies, tax units can employ losses as <b>carry-back</b> {{in the year before}} the loss or as carry-forward in the year following the loss. The tax code does not force a particular loss usage but provides tax units with freedom to allocate the losses between <b>carry-back</b> and carry-forward. Choosing an individual appropriate allocation of <b>carry-back</b> and carry-forward creates a maximal tax refund. Intertemporal loss usage is a special case of tax avoidance: tax units receive a tax refund from loss usage as carry-forward (<b>carry-back)</b> but forfeit the alternative refund from <b>carry-back</b> (carry-forward). Estimations show that the probability of maximizing the tax refund highly depends on the difference of the tax rates from the loss adjacent years. An increase of 10 percentage points of the tax rate difference increases the probability of tax refund maximization by 24. 5 %. This confirms that tax avoidance is strong in case of significant tax incentives...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of asymmetric corporate taxes for firms' debt policy. The {{focus is on the}} effects of two dynamic tax provisions, loss carry-forward and loss <b>carry-back,</b> on net debt issues. An effective tax variable is first estimated using a Tobit framework, accounting for the fact that firms' losses for tax purposes are censored. This effective tax variable and other explanatory factors are employed to explain net debt issues. Heteroskedasticity caused by the 'firm size effect' is also corrected. Using a panel of 128 firms between 1979 and 1989, this paper finds that corporate taxes have significant effects on firms' debt policy. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a discrete-time framework for analyzing a firm's investment and financial choices under uncertainty. The investment decision is incremental {{and subject to}} a parameterized degree of irreversibility. Corporate taxes are asymmetric, but we allow imperfect carry-forward or <b>carry-back</b> of losses. Personal taxes are also levied. The paper focusses {{on the impact of}} various tax rules and corporate borrowing constraints on the firm's choices particularly the desired capital stock. The paper also highlights the effects of depreciation, interest rates, and personal taxes. Numerical simulations complement the analytical results to illustrate when taxes and borrowing constraints matter the most. Irreversible investment, corporate finance, assymetric taxation...|$|E
40|$|Wet sticky {{iron ore}} poses {{particular}} difficulties {{in every aspect}} of the material handling process. Material hang-ups in bins, pipes and chutes; <b>carry-back</b> and spillage due to insufficient belt cleaning; clogging of screens; malfunctioning of crushers as well as rat holing of gravity reclaimed stockpiles are all predominantly due to the inherent cohesion and adhesion characteristics of the wet, sticky ore (Roberts, 1993). Limited understanding and quantitative measures on the stickiness of such a material significantly lower the mining operation efficiency. This research aims to investigate the cohesion and adhesion characteristics of the wet, sticky ore on physical modelling, experimental techniques and numerical implementation. Initially, the suitable bridging mechanism that contributes to the cohesive and adhesive forces within the iron ore material was identified (Hering, Martin and Stohrer, 1989; Rumpf, 1958). A cohesion/adhesion energy density factor based contact model was then introduced to describe the stickiness of the material. Secondly, an experimental system was proposed to directly test the stickiness of the material. Such a system is able to obtain both the cohesive/adhesive shear force and tensile force of the material at a specific moisture content. Lastly, the implementation of the proposed cohesion/adhesion model into the discrete element modelling (DEM) software was also discussed. A cohesion/adhesion calibration for modelling wet sticky iron ore in DEM was then conducted to ensure the material modelled in the simulation is reflective of the reality. From the study, understanding of the cohesion/adhesion characteristics of the wet iron ore material is significantly enhanced. Experimental and numerical outcomes can be directly applied for better designing or optimising the material handling processes that involve wet sticky iron ore. Consequently, the mining operating costs can be greatly reduced...|$|E
40|$|In July of 1978 the Secretary of Commerce, Juanita Kreps, {{speaking}} for the Carter Administration, proposed a 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive program to attack the problem of escalating product liability premiums and costs. 2 ̆ 2 The administration felt compelled to become involved because: Serious product liability problems have affected thousands of small businesses that have had great difficulty in obtaining affordable product liability insurance. The problem has also affected consumers because insurance costs have been passed on to {{them in terms of}} higher prices. Consumer groups have also been concerned about restrictive new state laws that have attacked the problem by limiting the rights of persons to recover damages for injuries caused by defective products. Finally, insurers have expressed concern about court rulings imposing substantial damages in product liability cases. Despite the inconsistencies which abound in the government 2 ̆ 7 s statement of why it is troubled, {{there is no question that}} the administration 2 ̆ 7 s intervention reflected a serious concern, among many quite disparate groups, that the increase in size and frequency of product liability judgments somehow was undermining the capacity of American business to function as it should in a free enterprise system. Typically, the government 2 ̆ 7 s proposed approach involved tax changes as a short-range measure (a quite sensible ten year loss <b>carry-back),</b> and a 2 ̆ 2 balanced program that will relieve the product liability problem for American businesses while fully respecting the rights and interests of consumers 2 ̆ 2 as a longer run solution.

40|$|Corporate capital {{structure}} {{is one of}} the most studied areas of business decisions. Nevertheless, it continues to be one of the least understood and more difficult to quantify. In this line of research, there is a large body of work modelling the interaction between taxation and corporate financing decisions, but little support has been found in empirical analysis. In the Anglo-Saxon literature few research papers have found clear evidence of the effects of tax benefits on debt financing (Graham, 2003, for a review). Several problems arise in analysing the role of taxation on debt financing. First of all, it is difficult to translate the technical details of the tax code into a proper measure able to capture the relative tax benefits of debt versus equity finance. Various empirical approaches have been used to account for the interaction between tax rates, interest deductions, non-debt tax shields and the loss <b>carry-back</b> and -forward provisions. None of them, however, is completely satisfactory, also due to the lack of confidential firm-level tax return data. Second, fiscal variables are endogenous: for example, the greater the firm’s borrowing, the lower could be the effective tax benefit of interest deductions, since the tax advantage of debt declines as companies become tax-exhausted, and this could in fact be the case with growing interest payments. Third, fiscal and non fiscal variables are intra- and inter-correlated. Correlation among fiscal factors worsens the endogeneity problem: current operating losses, non debt tax deductions (loss carry forwards and depreciation allowances) and interest deductions from already existing debt may contribute, along with interest deductions on new debt, to increase the tax-exhaustion status of firms. Moreover, borrowing also depends on other factors correlated with tax status. If these factors are omitted from the model, this would impart biases to the fiscal parameter estimates. This paper has two objectives. The first is to provide a systematic quantitative analysis of the relationship between fiscal variables and borrowing in Italy, trying to tackle the problems outlined above. The empirical evidence on this issue is still relatively scarce in Italy 1 We are grateful to Vieri Ceriani and Jacques Mairesse for the comments on a first draft of this paper. The authors would also like to thank Capitalia Research Department for kindly providing the microdata and all the members of the Capitalia Scientific Board of the “Osservatorio per le piccole e medie imprese” for helpful and, as for other countries, cannot be considered conclusive (see e. g. Bonato-Faini-Ratti, 1993, Staderini, 2001, and Alworth-Arachi, 2001). The second aim is to use our framework to shed some light on the effects of tax policy changes on corporate financial policy. This is of particular relevance in the Italian case. Here, a tax reform was implement at the end of the 1990 s with the main purpose of reducing the tax advantage to debt and stimulate firms’ capitalisation. Unfortunately, the reform was shortly reversed (in 2001), thus preventing the possibility to undertake a “natural experiment” test. Nevertheless, the analysis put forward in this paper can provide some useful indication of the effects on debt of these alternative reforms...|$|E
