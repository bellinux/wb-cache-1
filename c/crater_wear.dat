40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} carbide coated cutting insert in turning FCD 700 ductile cast iron in various dry machining conditions (without air, using air and chilled air). The turning parameters studied were, cutting speed of 120 m/min., feed rate of 0. 15 mm/rev- 0. 4 mm/rev, and depth of cut of 0. 6 mm- 1. 0 mm. The {{results show that the}} tool life was significantly controlled by the type of air coolant used, whereas the cutting force and surface roughness were not influenced by these coolants. Chilled air was found to be significantly improved the tool life by about 30 % and 40 % respectively when compared with normal air and without air conditions. The wear mechanism was predominantly controlled by the flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wears</b> on the flank and rake faces respectively. Due to the low cutting speed used in the experiment, both flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wears</b> were uniformly formed along the cutting edge and no catastrophic failure was observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM).

This paper shows that numerical problems in the estimation of the states of tool wear precludes {{the use of this}} method in multi-wear cases where both flank wear and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> are present. The method can be applied, however, when one type of wear (either flank wear or <b>crater</b> <b>wear)</b> dominates. The method is applied in turning experiments to a case where flank wear is dominant, and to a second case where <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> dominates.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the productivity of turning processes, several {{attempts have been made}} in the recent past for tool wear estimation and classification in turning operations. The tool flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> can be predicted by a number of models including statistical, pattern recognition, quantitative and neural network models. In this paper, a computer algorithm of new quantitative models for flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> estimation is presented. First, a quantitative model based on a correlation between increases in feed and radial forces and the average width of flank wear is developed. Then another model which relates acoustic emission (AErms) in the turning operation with the flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> developed on the tool is presented. The flank wear estimated by the first model is then employed in the second model to predict the <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> on the tool insert. The influence of flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> on AErms generated during the turning operation has also been investigated. Additionally, chip-flow direction and tool–chip rake face interfacing area are also examined.

40|$|In {{unmanned}} CNC turning operations, {{the accuracy}} of tool wear predictions {{is very important for}} accurate tool replacement policies and avoiding unnecessary tool insert changes. This paper introduces two new parameters, namely the total energy and the total entropy of force signals, for tool condition monitoring. The correlation between the new parameters, tool wear and a wide range of cutting conditions is examined. The experimental results show that the energy of force signal can be reliably used to monitor tool flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> over a wide range of cutting conditions. However, the total entropy of forces {{does not appear to be}} sensitive to feed rate, rake angle and tool wear. The experimental results also indicate that <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> causes an increase in the effective rake angle resulting in lower total energy of forces. For some particular shapes of worn tool, however, the <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> results in a decreased rake angle which increases the total energy of forces. The influence of <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> on forces and the root mean square of acoustic emission (AErms) signals is also observed in this research...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the wear of coated carbide insert in {{machining}} of mild steel. Machineability of mild steel is considered good although the cutting temperature is high. The characteristic of mild steel like high strength, high resistance to breakage and high modulus of elasticity has increased the tool wear of the coated carbide when {{it is used to}} machining the mild steel for long period. As a result, tool wear of the coated carbide inserts in machining of mild steel still need to be improved. The main objective of this project is to examine the progress of tool wear and determine the <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> and flank wear of the tool in machining the mild steel in turning process. In this project, 33 full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was employed in STATISTICA software to plan and perform the experiment systematically so that any possible experimental error would be minimized. Machining variables considered are cutting length, cutting speed and feed rate. The variables for three levels were 90, 120 and 150 m/min for cutting speed, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/rev for feed rate and 60, 120 and 180 mm for cutting length respectively. Machining of mild steel was carried out by using the conventional lathe machine. After each experiment, flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> of the coated carbide inserts was investigated and measured by using optical microscope integrated with Image Analyzer. Experimental data was analyzed in STATISTICA. Flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> curves were then plotted using Minitab software. The result indicates that feed rate is the most significant parameter that influencing both the flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> compared to cutting speed and cutting length. Optical micrograph of tool wear shows the <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> progressed faster than flank wear. Tool wear curves shows that when the number of experiments increases, the flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> increase monotonically...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this {{research}} was to analyze the surface roughness, cutting tool forces and tool wear in machining casted gray iron. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted was turning process from other machining process. The turning is the widely employed manufacturing process.

In turning casted gray iron, flank wear, <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> and built up edge are the common phenomenon. Findings: from the tests were the formation of flank wear, <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> while machining the casted gray iron. Further research is possible in the direction measuring the residual stresses and the vibration of the cutting tool.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are major}} {{materials}} used in the airplane industry, and prospects show that airplane production will double in the next 20 years. Consequently, the demand for cutting tools for machining of titanium alloys will increase. The primary problem when machining titanium alloys is their low thermal conductivity. <b>Crater</b> <b>wear</b> is the main factor limiting tool life, and is generally caused by thermal diffusion due to high temperatures in the tool-chip interface. This master’s thesis was performed in collaboration with Sandvik Coromant, with the prospect to increase knowledge of how diffusion and chip formation influences <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> progression. The aim was to study tool wear of cutting tools when turning Ti– 6 Al– 4 V. This was done by testing two different rake face geometries, both coated and uncoated, at cutting speeds of 30 – 115 m/min. Diffusion was investigated {{to learn about the}} impact it has on <b>crater</b> <b>wear.</b> Chips were examined to investigate chip formation and shear strain. The coated modified rake face insert showed less <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> only for the initial few seconds of machining. Uncoated inserts with a modified rake face showed higher diffusion rate and faster <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> progression than did standard inserts. The standard inserts showed twice as long tool life as did the modified inserts. No significant differences in the chip formation mechanism were found between modified and standard inserts. Cracks were found within shear bands that were thinner than usual, which suggest that the generation of cracks allows less shear deformation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{experiments}} with different operating parameters using CBN and PCBN tools on hard AISI 440 C material were investigated in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: In this research AISI 440 C stainless was used under hard condition. The cutting tools are having three cutting edges and each edge repeated for 5 times. The test conducted by each cutting edge was termed as trail 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5. The length of cutting was 150 mm and each trail. The surface roughness and flank wear, <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> and BUE were measured by SEM. Findings: The surface roughness was low by CBN at high turning cutting speed and the flank wear was high. The surface roughness was high by PCBN tool than CBN tool and flank wear recorded was low for PCBN tool than CBN tool. The chips produced were saw tooth in all operating parameters. The CBN tool {{was unable to}} withstand heat at cutting zone and hence more flank wear occurred. The PCBN tool sustained the temperature and less tool wear occurred. More <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> formed on PCBN tools where as CBN tool produced less <b>crater</b> <b>wear.</b> The formation of <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> on the rake face was due to rough surface of the saw tooth chips. Practical implications: The investigation results will provide useful information to applying CBN and PCBN cutting tools in hard turning stainless steels. Originality/value: Hard turning is a latest technology and possible to turn all hard materials. The hard turning produce net shaped products and reduces machining time, low cost per products, etc. The difficult to cut materials like stainless steels was turned by super hard cutting tools like CBN and PCBN to achieve good surface roughness, dimensional control and reduced tool wear...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCompacted {{graphite}} iron (CGI) {{is considered to}} be one of the most promising materials for many automotive applications and has adopted by some automotive companies. Comparing to widely used flake {{graphite iron}} (FGI), CGI has superior physical and mechanical properties. The main drawback of this material is known to be its poor machinability. A preliminary study on flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> was conducted by dry turning experiments with both FGI and CGI using uncoated WC tools and multilayer coated tools. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate worn areas of the cutting tools. Despite of the reported poor machinability of CGI, our turning experiments showed that both flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> were higher for FGI compared to CGI when using uncoated WC tools at the cutting speed of 150, 250 and 350 m/min. An unexpected adhesion layer on the flank side of carbide inserts was observed when turning CGI, which believe to protect the flank surface and reduce flank wear. The adhesion on rake face concentrated on the cutting edge when turning CGI while the sporadic attachments of work materials are observed throughout the rake interface with FGI. In contrast, no adhesion layer was presented when both FGI and CGI were turned using multilayer coated tools, which yielded more flank and <b>crater</b> <b>wear</b> when turning CGI...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} tool wear and geometry response when machinability tests were applied under milling operations on the Super Austenitic Stainless Steel alloy AL- 6 XN. Eight milling trials were executed under two cutting speeds, two feed rates, and two depths of cuts. Cutting edge profile measurements were performed to reveal response of cutting edge geometry to the cutting parameters and wear. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to inspect the cutting edges. Results showed the presence of various types of wear such as adhesion wear and abrasion wear on the tool rake and flank faces. Adhesion wear represents {{the formation of the}} built-up edge, <b>crater</b> <b>wear,</b> and chipping, whereas abrasion wear represents flank wear. The commonly formed wear was <b>crater</b> <b>wear.</b> Therefore, the optimum tool life among the executed cutting trails was identified according to minimum length and depth of the <b>crater</b> <b>wear.</b> The profile measurements showed the formation of new geometries for the worn cutting edges due to adhesion and abrasion wear and the cutting parameters. The formation of the built-up edge was observed on the rake face of the cutting tool. The microstructure of the built-up edge was investigated using SEM. The built-up edge was found to have the austenite shear lamellar structure which is identical to the formed shear lamellae of the produced chip...|$|E
