5|$|<b>Collard</b> relates {{how he was}} {{recruited}} into the IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom <b>Collard</b> had worked. The book goes on {{to look at the}} activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. <b>Collard</b> explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Courage Compétition {{began running}} their updated C60 Hybrid, whilst Pescarolo also updated their C60; {{the two teams}} were the fastest and second fastest {{respectively}} at the Paul Ricard test session. At the LMES season opener, which was the 1000km of Spa, the Courage-entered car, driven by Cochet, Christian Vann and Alexander Frei was eliminated in a pit-lane accident, whilst the Pescarolo entry, driven by Bouillon, <b>Collard</b> and Comas finished second. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both teams entered two cars; Courage entered Frei, Vann and Dominik Schwager in one car, and Cochet, Shinji Nakano and Bruce Jouanny in the other, whilst Pescarolo ran <b>Collard,</b> Boullion and Comas {{in one of their}} C60s, with Ayari, Hélary and Sébastien Loeb in the other. One car from each team finished; <b>Collard,</b> Boullion and Comas took second for Pescarolo, whilst Schwager, Frei and Vann finished eighth for Courage. Both teams reverted to single-car entries for the 1000km of Monza, which <b>Collard</b> and Boullion won for Pescarolo; the Gounon/Vann/Frei combination in the Courage finished sixth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. For the 1000 km of Silverstone, it was Frei, Vann and Cochet, driving for Courage, who were the fastest C60; they took 14th, and 13th in class, whilst <b>Collard</b> and Boullion had problems and finished 34th, and 17th in class. The 1000km of Nürburgring saw Boullion and <b>Collard</b> take fourth for Pescarolo, whilst Frei and Cochet took eighth for Courage. At the final round of the season, which was the 1000 km of Istanbul, <b>Collard</b> and Boullion took another victory for Pescarolo, whilst the Courage of Gounon and Frei took 21st overall, and eighth in class. This result meant that Pescarolo had won their first ever team's championship, whilst Courage finished seventh.|$|E

5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). <b>Collard</b> and Boullion started the season {{in exactly the same}} way they had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw <b>Collard</b> and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by <b>Collard,</b> Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, <b>Collard</b> and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary in the final two rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming.

During World War II, <b>Collard</b> had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end.

40|$|Ovipositional {{preference}} and larval {{survival of the}} diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), were compared among cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. variety capitata; glossy <b>collards,</b> Brassica oleracea L. variety acephala; and yellow rocket, Barbarea vulgaris (R. Br.) variety arcuata in different treatments of planting density, host plant age, intercropping, and water stress in 2003 and 2004. P. xylostella laid nearly twice as many eggs per plant in the high planting densities of glossy <b>collards</b> and yellow rocket than in the standard planting densities. Ovipositional preference {{was positively correlated with}} plant age in cabbage, glossy <b>collards,</b> and yellow rocket. Larval survival on cabbage was 1. 9 times higher on 6 -wk than on 12 -wk-old plants, whereas larval survival on <b>collards</b> was 12. 1 times higher on the younger plants. No larvae survived on either 6 - or 12 -wk-old yellow rocket plants. Intercropping cabbage with either tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., or fava bean, Vicia fava L., did not reduce the number of eggs laid on cabbage. No significant differences in oviposition were found between water-stressed and well-irrigated host plants treatments. Yet, P. xylostella larval survival on water-stressed cabbage was 2. 1 times lower than on well-irrigated cabbage plants. Based on our findings, the effectiveness of trap crops of glossy <b>collards</b> and yellow rocket could be enhanced by integrating the use of higher planting densities in the trap crop than in the main crop and seeding of the trap crop earlier than the main cro...|$|R
