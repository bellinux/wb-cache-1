Women wore gold ornaments on different parts of their bodies (e.g. Ghonṭ, Pāṭlī, Todo, Bājunband, Galesarī, Valesar, Kudī), and wore silver ornaments to decorate their feet (e.g.;Paijaṇ, Salle, Māsolī, Vāle). Gold ornaments were not worn below the waist. Gold is considered a symbol of Agni and is said to keep the evil spirits away. Married women wore Kuṅkuma on their forehead in the shape of a <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed,</b> which is not in vogue any more, and wore Maṅgalsutra, nose rings (a diamond stud,Nath), and toe rings, as a symbol of marriage.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the temporal release of fatty acids and sugars from corn and cucumber seeds during the early stages of seed germination in order to establish whether sugars found in exudate can prevent exudate fatty acid degradation by Enterobacter cloacae. Both saturated (long-chain satu-rated fatty acids [LCSFA]) and unsaturated (long-chain unsaturated fatty acids [LCUFA]) fatty acids were detected in corn and <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed</b> exudates within 15 min after seed sowing. LCSFA and LCUFA were released at a rate of 26. 1 and 6. 44 ng/min/seed by corn and cucumber seeds, respectively. The unsaturated portion of the total fatty acid pool from both plant species contained primarily oleic and linoleic acids, and these fatty acids were released at a combined rate of 6. 6 and 0. 67 ng/min/seed from corn and cucumber, respectively. In the absence of seed exudate sugars, E. cloacae degraded linoleic acid at rates of 29 to 39 ng/min, exceeding the rate of total fatty acid release from seeds. Sugars constituted a significant percentage of corn seed exudate, accounting for 41 % of the total dry seed weight. Only 5 % of <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed</b> exudate was comprised of sugars. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were the most abundant sugars present in seed exudate from both plant species.

40|$|Differential {{protection}} of plants by Enterobacter cloacae was studied by investigating early sensing and response behavior of Pythium ultimum sporangia toward {{seeds in the}} presence or absence of E. cloacae. Ten percent of P. ultimum sporangia were activated within the first 30 min of exposure to <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds.</b> In contrast, 44 % of the sporangia were activated as early as 15 min after exposure to corn seeds with over 80 % sporangial activation by 30 min. Germ tubes emerged from sporangia after 2. 5 and 1. 0 h in the cucumber and corn spermospheres, respectively. Seed application of the wild-type strain of E. cloacae (EcCT- 501 R 3) reduced sporangial activation by 45 % in the cucumber spermosphere, whereas no reduction was observed in the corn spermosphere. Fatty acid transport and degradation mutants of E. cloacae (strains EcL 1 and Ec 31, respectively) did not reduce sporangial activation in either of the spermospheres. Although wild-type or mutant strains of E. cloacae failed to reduce seed colonization incidence, pathogen biomass on <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> was reduced in the presence of E. cloacae strains EcCT- 501 R 3 and Ec 31 by 4 and 8 h after sowing, respectively. By 12 h, levels of P. ultimum on <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> treated with E. cloacae EcCT- 501 R 3 did not differ from levels on noninoculated seeds. On corn seeds, P. ultimum biomass was not affected by the presence of any E. cloacae strain. When introduced after sporangial activation had occurred, E. cloacae failed to reduce P. ultimum biomass on <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> compared with that on nontreated seeds. Also, increasing numbers of sporangia used to inoculate seeds yielded increased pathogen biomass at each sampling time. This indicates a direct link between the level of seed-colonizing biomass of P. ultimum and the number of activated and germinated sporangia in the spermosphere, suggesting that E. cloacae suppresses P. ultimum seed infections by reducing sporangial activation and germination within the first 30 to 90 min after sowing...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between exogenous melatonin applied into <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> during osmopriming and modifications of their antioxidant defense was studied. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione pool were investigated in embryonic axes {{isolated from the}} control, osmoprimed, and osmoprimed with melatonin <b>seeds.</b> Germinating <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> {{are very sensitive to}} chilling. Temperature 10 ºC causes oxidative stress in young seedlings. Seed pre-treatment with melatonin seemed to limit H 2 O 2 accumulation during germination under optimal condition as well as during chilling stress and recovery period. Melatonin affected SOD activity and its isoforms during stress and recovery period but did not influence CAT and POX activities. Thus it is possible that in cucumber this indoleamine could act mostly as a direct H 2 O 2 scavenger, but superoxide anion combat via SOD stimulation. The GSH/GSSG ratio is considered as an indirect determinant of oxidative stress. When the cells are exposed to oxidative stress GSSG is accumulated and the ratio of GSH to GSSG decreases. In our research pre-sowing melatonin application into the <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> caused high beneficial value of GSH/GSSG ratio that could be helpful for stress countering. Glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) activity in the axes isolated from these seeds was two fold higher than in those isolated from the control and from the osmoprimed without melatonin ones. Additional isoforms of GSSG-R in melatonin treated seeds was also observed. It explains high and effective GSH pool restoration in the seeds pre-treated with melatonin. We confirmed that melatonin could protect <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> and young seedlings against oxidative stress directly and indirectly detoxifying ROS, thereby plants grown better even in harmful environmental conditions. This work is the first that investigated on plant in vivo model and documented melatonin influence on redox state during seed germination.

Above 20 C there is no inhibition and it appears {{as if there is}} an escape from phytochrome control. However, radiation from a monochromatic, narrow band 730 nanometer source (Pfr/P < 0. 02) inhibits germination at temperatures above 20 C. This result supports the idea that, even at high temperatures, Pfr is responsible for the activation of germination. After 4 days of exposure to far red, a short red irradiation is quite effective in promoting germination if temperatures during the dark incubation periods are maintained below 20 C; red becomes effective at temperatures above 20 C. Promotion of germination will take place at a temperature of 25 C or higher without red irradiation. Again, we have an apparent escape from phytochrome control at high temperatures. However, if higher temperatures are used for only short periods, 2 to 6 hours, in combination with short red irradiation, one can demonstrate that activation of germination at high temperatures is still dependent on phytochrome. Phytochrome is probably destroyed during prolonged exposure to far red. Thus, the subsequent short red irradiation establishes levels of Pfr which may not be sufficient to promote germination at low temperatures but are probably adequate at high temperatures...|$|E

However, axis removal prevented the natural shedding of the testa by germinating <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> resulting in clear differences between intact and detached cotyledons in terms of fresh and dry weight, respiratory and lipid metabolism. Moreover, weakening of the testa on detached cotyledons, by cutting longitudinally, only partially alleviated the inhibitory effect that axis removal had on these metabolic events while total removal alleviated this effect completely.

We monitored in situ interactions between gfp-tagged biocontrol strains of T. atroviride and soilborne plant pathogens that were grown in cocultures and on cucumber seeds by confocal scanning laser microscopy and fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Spores of T. atroviride adhered to Pythium ultimum mycelia in coculture experiments. In mycoparasitic interactions of T. atroviride with P. ultimum or Rhizoctonia solani, the mycoparasitic hyphae grew alongside the pathogen mycelia, and this was followed by coiling and formation of specialized structures similar to hooks, appressoria, and papillae. The morphological changes observed depended on the pathogen tested. Branching of T. atroviride mycelium appeared to be an active response to the presence of the pathogenic host. Mycoparasitism of P. ultimum by T. atroviride occurred on <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed</b> surfaces while the seeds were germinating. The interaction of these fungi on the cucumber seeds was similar to the interaction observed in coculture experiments.

40|$|In this study, {{a method}} based on digital image {{processing}} was employed to investigate effect of the moisture content on gravimetrical and frictional properties of the <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> and kernels. This research indicated that the application of visual machines and the image processing could be a rapid method that enables accurate measurement of the dimensional parameters of two varieties of this product meticulously. The length, width, and thickness of the seeds of Rashid variety ranged from 6. 40 to 9. 07, 2. 91 to 4. 21 and 0. 65 to 1. 50  mm, respectively; the corresponding value of Negin variety ranged from 6. 89 to 9. 07, 2. 49 to 4. 21, and 0. 69 to 1. 68  mm, respectively. Kernel and shell ratios of the Rashid variety {{were found to be}} 69. 811 and 30. 189 %, respectively; the corresponding values of the Negin variety were found to be 72. 727 and 27. 273 %, respectively. Despite the bulk densities of the two varieties of <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> and kernels that decreased with the moisture content, true density and porosity of the two varieties of <b>cucumber</b> <b>seeds</b> and kernels increased. As the moisture content increased from 5. 04 to 21. 12 % (d. b), the angle of the static friction of the seeds of Negin variety increased from 30. 39 ° to 37. 18 °, 28. 83 ° to 34. 99 °, 24. 37 ° to 30. 04 °, and 15. 77 ° to 19. 57 ° for wood, rubber, iron, and galvanized, respectively,; the corresponding value of the Negin variety increased from 21. 12 ° to 27. 16 °, 24. 43 ° to 31. 41 °, 19. 90 ° to 25. 59 ° and 14. 09 ° to 18. 12 ° as the moisture content increased from 5. 02 to 21. 02 % (d. b).

40|$|Pythium ultimum is {{a devastating}} {{pathogen}} of seeds and seedlings. Germination of pathogen sporangia can be elicited by unsaturated long chain fatty acids that are released by germinating seeds. Sporangial activation and germination {{are critical for}} initiating Pythium disease development. Pythium infection can be prevented by applying the bacterium Enterobacter cloacae onto seeds and expression of bacterial fatty acid transport and degradation {{have been found to}} be important traits for this control. However, the bacterium is capable of protecting only certain seeds such as cotton and cucumber whereas other seeds, such as corn and pea succumb to Pythium infection. It has been postulated that differences in sugar released by seeds may explain this differential protection since sugars are able to repress fatty acid metabolism in E. cloacae. Corn and pea seeds are documented as seeds that release high amounts of simple sugars that can repress fatty acid uptake and catabolism. Experiments focused on the temporal release of corn and <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed</b> exudates and their induction of sporangial activation, germination, host colonization and the impact E. cloacae had on these pathogen responses while concomitant release of exudate sugars and fatty acids was also analyzed. E. cloacae is able to interrupt sporangial activation induced by cucumber seeds, but not in the corn spermosphere. This explains the differential control by the bacterium, since activation interference directly resulted in suppressed seed colonization. Both corn and cucumber seeds released unsaturated fatty acids as early as 15 min after sowing although quantities from corn exceeded that of cucumber. More importantly, corn seeds released much higher concentrations of simple sugars than cucumber already within 15 min. Quantities detected in corn seed exudate are large enough to completely shut down fatty acid degradation of E. cloacae. This provided the first evidence that interference with sporangial activation is the cause for plant protection by E. cloacae and seeds not protected by E. cloacae are incapable of interfering with sporangial activation. The bacterium does not interfere with sporangial activation because non protected seeds release sugars at such quantities that bacterial fatty acid degradation is repressed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Marah oreganus, a perennial, {{belongs to}} the Cucurbitaceae family and it is {{commonly}} known as wild cucumber. In the past, this plant grew along fence rows, but now wild cucumber has become a weed problem in perennial grass seed fields of western Oregon. Several research studies were conducted to examine the biology of the weed and to observe the response to herbicide applications. Two experiments were conducted to determine if the dormancy of wild <b>cucumber</b> <b>seed</b> was due primarily to the effect of the seed coat and/or a chilling requirement. Results of this study indicated that dormancy can be broken by chilling and was not the result of seed coat impermeability. There is a minimum time that wild cucumber seeds must be exposed to cold temperatures before dormancy is broken. In this research, 22 days at constant 5 C was insufficient to break dormancy. Complete germination was obtained when seeds were kept at constant 5 C, and were covered with moistened, but not saturated, peat moss for 58 days. Other experiments in the greenhouse were conducted to examine the response of seedling wild cucumber to herbicides and to develop a technique for growing seedling wild cucumber under controlled conditions. Preliminary trials using garden cucumber (Cucumis sativus) as an indicator plant were used to determine herbicide rates for subsequent experiments. This study indicated that picloram and phenoxy herbicides did not cause necrosis on seedling wild cucumber but were most effective as growth inhibitors. Treatment with 2, 4, 5 -T at 0. 14 kg/ha caused more severe reduction in dry weight than with 2, 4 -D at 4. 48 kg/ha. Glyphosate at 0. 28 kg/ha was the only herbicide tested that caused necrosis to the leaves and inhibited growth of wild cucumber. DPX- 4189, fosamine, and Dowco 290 did not induce any visual symptoms, although reductions in growth from the check 12 days after treatment were observed. Two field trials were conducted to evaluate the control of established wild cucumber plants. Evaluations were made over a 2 -year period in the same plots. During the treatment year (1980), only two herbicides controlled wild cucumber at a level that would be commercially acceptable. The herbicides most effective for this purpose were glyphosate (2. 24 or 3. 36 kg/ha) and 2, 4, 5 -T (0. 84, 1. 68, or 3. 36 kg/ha). At one location, wild cucumber plants treated in 1980 with glyphosate and 2, 4, 5 -T did not show regrowth in spring or summer, 1981. The other location was accidentally destroyed and no valid regrowth data were collected...|$|E
