40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations</b> of the {{superficial}} middle cere-bral vein (SMCV) remains ambiguous. We propose a new classification {{system based on}} em-bryologic development for preoperative examination. METHODS: Three-dimensional CT angiography {{was used to evaluate}} 500 SMCVs (in 250 patients). The outflow vessels from the SMCV were classified into seven types on the basis of embryologic development. The 3 D CT angiograms in axial stereoscopic and oblique views and multiple intensity projection images were evaluated by the same neurosurgeon on two occa-sions. Inconsistent interpretations were regarded as equivocal. RESULTS: Three-dimensional CT angiography clearly depicted the SMCV running along the lesser wing or the middle cranial fossa. However, the outflow vessel could not be confirmed as the sphenoparietal, cavernous, or emissary type in 39 (8 %) of the sides. SMCVs running in the middle cranial fossa to join the transverse sinus or superior petrosal sinus were accurately identified. SMCVs were present in 456 sides: 62 % entered the sphenoparietal sinus or the cavernous sinus and 12 % joined the emissary vein. Nine vessels were the superior petrosal type, 10 the basal type, 12 the squamosal type, and 44 the undeveloped type...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variations}} {{that lead}} to changes in amino acid sequences {{have the ability to}} cause structural and functional changes of proteins. All such variations do not show phenotypic effects, so {{it is important to have}} classifiers that can classify the disease causing variations from neutral to prioritize the experimental study of variants. Large number of features associated with variations can be extracted but many of them do not contribute to classification instead increase the computational time and sometimes they may even deteriorate the classification ability. Feature selection filters out the non-relevant and redundant features from an input feature set so to obtain a feature subset that can induce a model with higher performance. 615 features that define the physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids were collected from the AAindex database. Four different feature selection techniques: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), random forest, Random Forest Artificial Contrast with Ensembles (RF-ACE) and Area Under the ROC Curve of Random Forest (AUCRF) were applied to select the most relevant features for <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>variations.</b> The classification abilities of the feature subsets, selected by different approaches, were compared. 7 features that can represent 615 input features were selected. The selected feature subset takes less computational time and has slightly better classification ability compared to the whole feature set. Feature selection is an effective tool in machine learning to reduce the number of features and thus reduce the computational time. Application of feature selection can also increase the performance of the model. Asiasanat:Feature selection, variation classification, amino acid feature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Studies using reaction-diffusion {{models for}} the {{evolution}} of dispersal have classified their behavior in terms of the categories of conditional vs. unconditional dispersal, and the operators of diffusion, nonlocal diffusion, advection, and spatial heterogeneity of growth rates. Recent results on resolvent positive operators reveal a different basis to classify their behavior: it focuses on the form <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in the operators rather than the form of the operators themselves. When the <b>variation</b> consists <b>of</b> equal scaling of all dispersal and advection operators, selection favors reduced dispersal. But other forms <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in the operators may select for increased dispersal. When variation has only partial control over the operators it may act effectively as though it were directed toward fitter habitats. The principle of partial control provides a heuristic for variation that favors increased dispersal. While some results for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> that produces departure from reduction have been obtained for finite matrices, the general classification problem remains open for both finite and infinite dimensional spaces. 1.

40|$|Product line {{engineering}} aims at developing {{a family of}} products and facilitating the derivation of product variants from it. Context can be a main factor in determining what products to derive. Yet, there is gap in incorporating context with variability models. We advocate that, in the first place, variability originates from human intentions and choices even before software systems are constructed, and context influences variability at this intentional level before the functional one. Thus, we propose to analyze variability at an early phase of analysis adopting the intentional ontology of goal models, and studying how context can influence such variability. Below we present a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> points on goal models, analyze their relation with context, and show the process of constructing and maintaining the models.

In a retrospective cohort study, the joint geometry of the proximal femur was evaluated on radiographs and corresponding CT scans of 345 consecutive patients with end-stage hip OA. Active shape modeling (ASM) was performed to assess the variation in endosteal shape of the proximal femur. To identify natural groupings of patients, hierarchical cluster analysis of the shape modes was used. ASM identified 10 independent shape modes accounting for > 96 % <b>of</b> the <b>variation</b> in proximal femoral canal shape within the dataset. Cluster analysis revealed 10 specific shape clusters. Significant differences in geometric and demographic parameters between the clusters were observed. ASM and subsequent cluster analysis {{have the potential to}} identify specific morphological patterns of the proximal femur despite the variability in proximal femoral anatomy.

40|$|Reliability of {{products}} is here regarded {{with respect to}} failure avoidance rather than probability of failure. To avoid failures, we emphasize variation and suggest some powerful tools for handling failures due to <b>variation.</b> Thus, instead <b>of</b> technical calculation of probabilities from data that usually are too weak for correct results, we emphasize the statistical thinking that puts the designers focus on the critical product functions. Making the design insensitive to unavoidable variation is called robust design and is handled by (i) identification and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>variation,</b> (ii) design <b>of</b> experiments to find robust solutions, and (iii) statistically based estimations of proper safety margins. Extensions of the classical failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) are presented. The first extension consists of identifying failure modes caused by variation in the traditional bottom–up FMEA analysis. The second variation mode and effect analysis (VMEA) is a top–down analysis, taking the product characteristics {{as a starting point}} and analyzing how sensitive these characteristics are to variation. In cases when there is sufficient detailed information of potential failure causes, the VMEA can be applied in its most advanced mode, the probabilistic VMEA. Variation is then measured as statistical standard deviations, and sensitivities are measured as partial derivatives. This method gives the opportunity to dimension tolerances and safety margins to avoid failures caused by both unavoidable <b>variation</b> and lack <b>of</b> knowledge regarding failure processe...|$|R

This paper utilises this information to demonstrate how producers of digital terrain data sets may ascertain the best approach to employ and the nature and configuration of data that would be required to fulfil a particular user's requirements in terms of information and accuracy. The approach presented is applicable whether data are sampled on the ground or by remote sensing. The research centres around an examination of Ordnance Survey(R) Land-Form PROFILE (TM) contour data and the particular focus is the potential of the application of geostatistics to the improvement of the National Height Dataset (NHD). The research illustrates that to apply geostatistics it was necessary to ensure homogeneity <b>of</b> spatial <b>variation</b> across the region in concern. That is, it was necessary to classify spatial <b>variation.</b> Once <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>variation</b> was achieved it was possible to quantify the variation (using the variogram) and identify dominant forms <b>of</b> spatial <b>variation</b> for particular regions to aid the design of optimal sampling strategies.
