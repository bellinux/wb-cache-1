5|$|Sigismund {{began his}} {{studies at the}} University of Vienna in or shortly before 1470. He was made provost of the Budafelhévíz Chapter around the same time. He studied at the University of Ferrara between 1471 and 1473. One of his professors, Ludovico Carbone, {{published}} their <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> Matthias Corvinus as a literary dialogue.

5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E

25|$|Over the Summer of 1911, Gleizes, {{living and}} working in Courbevoie, is in close contact with Metzinger, who has {{recently}} moved to Meudon. Gleizes paints Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon.

25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class. However, some students feel that the class has shortcomings; they {{say that it is}} pretty similar to a typical US history course, and that critical <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E
25|$|The attack, videos, {{and written}} {{manifesto}} of Rodger sparked <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> broader issues {{of violence against}} women and misogyny in society. Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not. Rodger frequented online forums such as PUAHate and /r/ForeverAlone where he and other men posted misogynistic statements about women. He subscribed to several pick-up artist YouTube channels. For these reasons, as well as Rodger's apparent sense of entitlement to sex with women, he {{has been described as}} misogynistic.|$|E
25|$|The term 'Cubism' is {{employed}} in June 1911 by Apollinaire, {{speaking in the}} context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, and Le Fauconnier. During the summer, Gleizes is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Both are discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They have long <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> the nature of form and perception. They agree that traditional painting gives a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.|$|E
