50|$|The latest {{iteration}} of {{the engine}} is called AnvilNext, which was developed for Assassin's Creed III and beyond featuring a number of enhancements. Firstly, AnvilNext adds support for a new weather system, which allows for specific weather settings {{as well as an}} automatically <b>cycling</b> <b>mode</b> as seen in Assassin's Creed IV. Secondly, the renderer was rewritten for higher efficiency and support for additional post-processing techniques, enabling up to 3,000 non-playable characters to be rendered in real time (compared to the few 100s in the previous Anvil engine). Finally, AnvilNext adds technology from Far Cry 4 to support a more dynamic sandbox environment and new water technology, where the game world could change over time depending on player actions and progression. This means enemy settlements on both land and sea may appear/disappear relating to the events in the game, and water effects could be adjusted as accordingly. More importantly, AnvilNext starting with Assassin's Creed Unity is capable of generating structures in a flexible and automatic manner while following specific design rules and templates, which reduces the amount of time and manual effort required for artists and designers to create an intricate urban environment. Specific landmarks, such as the Notre Dame de Paris, are still designed by hand but now could be rendered at an almost 1:1 ratio to its real-life counterpart. AnvilNext also features improved AI for non-playable characters.|$|E

MethodsTwo VNS treated patients underwent digital video-polysomnography for three nights (night 1 : rapid cycling mode; night 2 : standard mode; night 3 : off mode). ResultsIn patient 1, on off mode, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 11. 1 /h, respiratory effort-related arousal index (RERAI) 0. 9 /h, flow limitation index (FLI) 0. 9 /h and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) 10. 2 /h. On standard mode, AHI was 5. 5 /h, RERAI 1. 7 /h, FLI 4. 1 /h and ODI 5. 5 /h. On rapid <b>cycling</b> <b>mode,</b> AHI was 10. 4 /h, RERAI 7. 9 /h, FLI 17. 3 /h and ODI 10. 3 /h. In patient 2, on off mode, AHI was 1. 6 /h, RERAI 0. 8 /h, FLI 2. 2 /h and ODI 0 /h. On standard mode, AHI was 2. 9 /h, RERAI 2. 4 /h, FLI 2. 6 /h and ODI 2. 9 /h.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate membrane electrode assembly (MEA) failure modes under accelerated test conditions via reactant relative humidity (RH) cycling. In this study, the anode and cathode underwent RH cycling in an unsymmetrical manner and the cell was run at a minimal 2 ̆ 01 cidle 2 ̆ 01 d current during endurance testing. The cell performance was monitored periodically and the degradation curve showed a difference in the anode and cathode induced RH <b>cycling</b> <b>modes.</b> Anode RH <b>cycling</b> had a more pronounced effect on MEA degradation than cathode RH cycling. Electrochemical diagnostic testing methods such as AC impedance and H 2 crossover measurements revealed the degradation phenomena in more detail. The fluoride release data of the anode RH cycling cell showed a sudden increase in fluoride rate within a short period of endurance testing. The infrared imaging results revealed thinning and hotspot pinholes in the membrane, and ionomer delamination from the PTFE reinforcement layer was identified by scanning electron microscopy. The anode RH cycling cell had a shorter lifespan than the cell with cathode RH cycling, highlighting the significance of anode humidification for MEA durability.

40|$|The {{development}} of practical {{solutions for the}} energy-efficient capture of carbon dioxide is of prime importance and continues to attract intensive research interest. Conceivably, the implementation of adsorption-based processes using different <b>cycling</b> <b>modes,</b> e. g., pressure-swing adsorption or temperature-swing adsorption, offers great prospects to address this challenge. Practically, the successful deployment of practical adsorption-based technologies depends on the {{development of}} made-to-order adsorbents expressing mutually two compulsory requisites: i) high selectivity/affinity for CO 2 and ii) excellent chemical stability in the presence of impurities. This study presents a new comprehensive experimental protocol apposite for assessing the prospects of a given physical adsorbent for carbon capture under flue gas stream conditions. The protocol permits: i) the baseline performance of commercial adsorbents such as zeolite 13 X, activated carbon versus liquid amine scrubbing to be ascertained, and ii) a standardized evaluation of the best reported metal-organic framework (MOF) materials for carbon dioxide capture from flue gas to be undertaken. This extensive study corroborates the exceptional CO 2 capture performance of the recently isolated second-generation fluorinated MOF material, NbOFFIVE- 1 -Ni, concomitant with an impressive chemical stability and a low energy for regeneration. Essentially, the NbOFFIVE- 1 -Ni adsorbent presents the best compromise by satisfying all the required metrics for efficient CO 2 scrubbing...|$|R

40|$|The fabrication, {{characterization}} {{and application}} of the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes for selective detection are demonstrated. The electrodes, fabricated by lithographic microfabrication technology, are composed of a planar film electrode and a 32 x 32 recessed microdisk array electrode. Different from commonly used redox <b>cycling</b> operating <b>mode</b> for array configurations such as interdigitated array electrodes, a novel strategy based {{on a combination of}} interferent depleting and redox cycling is proposed for the electrodes with an appropriate configuration. The planar film electrode (the plane electrode) is used to deplete the interferent in the diffusion layer. The recessed microdisk array electrode (the microdisk array), locating within the diffusion layer of the plane electrode, works for detecting the target analyte in the interferent-depleted diffusion layer. In addition, the microdisk array overcomes the disadvantage of low current signal for a single microelectrode. Moreover, the current signal of the target analyte that undergoes reversible electron transfer can be enhanced due to the redox cycling between the plane electrode and the microdisk array. Based on the above working principle, the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes break up the restriction of selectively detecting a species that exhibits reversible reaction in a mixture with one that exhibits an irreversible reaction, which is a limitation of single redox <b>cycling</b> operating <b>mode.</b> The advantages of the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes are verified by detecting dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid and detecting pyrocatechol in the presence of hydroquinone, i. e., the electrodes can work regardless of the reversibility of interfering species.
