50|$|Ajuga genevensis (also {{variously}} {{known as}} the upright bugle, blue bugle, Geneva bugleweed, blue bugleweed) is a herbaceous flowering plant native to Europe. It is less common than its relative, Ajuga reptans (<b>common</b> <b>bugle).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ajuga genevensis is a {{less common}} {{relative}} of Ajuga reptans, the <b>Common</b> <b>bugle,</b> though {{it is common for}} the two plants to interbreed, as well as with Ajuga pyramidalis, the pyramidal bugle, producing hybrid offspring that are very similar.|$|E
50|$|Stachys ajugoides is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mint family known by the <b>common</b> name <b>bugle</b> hedgenettle. It is native to western North America, {{where it can be}} found in many types of habitat in Oregon, California, and Baja California, especially moist areas. It is an aromatic herb with serrate leaves. The inflorescence is a spike of interrupted clusters of flowers, often in shades of pink.|$|R
50|$|Sunset, {{also known}} as the Retreat Call, is a bugle call played in United Kingdom and British Commonwealth {{countries}} to signal the end of the official military day. It uses a slightly different melody to the US Retreat <b>bugle</b> call. In <b>common</b> with all <b>bugle</b> calls, it consists only of notes from a single overtone series. This allows it to be playable on a bugle or equivalently on a trumpet without moving the valves.|$|R
40|$|Paul Robert Fauchet's Symphonie pour Musique d'Harmonie, {{known in}} the United States as Symphony in B-flat, is a four-movement {{composition}} spanning nearly thirty minutes in length and written {{in the style of}} the late romantic composers. Despite its place as one of the first symphonies for wind band, a performance of the piece that represents the composer's 1926 orchestration is difficult due to the inclusion of instruments that are no longer in <b>common</b> practice, including <b>bugles,</b> alto horns, and saxhorns. Later American editions of the work by James Robert Gillette (1933) and Frank Campbell-Watson (1948 / 1949) replaced these instruments, but also took several other liberties with orchestration and voicing. The primary purpose of this study was the creation of a performance edition of the Symphony for modern wind band that is accessible to a larger audience of performers and listeners. The method involved in creating the modern edition eliminates errors of extant editions and clarifies a number of the discrepancies surrounding the symphony's multiple publications. This edition attempts to retain the composer's voicing and orchestration choices. To accomplish this, the present project considered where modern instrumentation differed from the original sources and attempted to balance timbral similarities between those instruments, while also considering ease of comprehension for a modern ensemble to perform the work. Sources used to create this edition included all published editions of scores and parts, as well as a newly created full score of the 1926 printed parts. The study concludes with the inclusion of the full score of the new performance edition...|$|R
5000|$|Ajuga reptans is {{commonly}} known as bugle, blue bugle, bugleherb, bugleweed, carpetweed, carpet bugleweed, and <b>common</b> <b>bugle,</b> and traditionally but less commonly as [...] "St. Lawrence plant". It is an herbaceous flowering plant native to Europe. It is invasive in parts of North America. Grown as a garden plant it provides useful groundcover. Numerous cultivars have been selected, of which [...] "Caitlin's Giant" [...] has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Ajuga reptans is also a component of purple moor grass and rush pastures, a Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|The central ritual at cenotaphs {{throughout}} the Commonwealth is a stylised night vigil. The Last Post was the <b>common</b> <b>bugle</b> {{call at the}} close of the military day, and The Rouse was the first call of the morning. For military purposes, the traditional night vigil over the slain was not just to ensure they were indeed dead and not unconscious or in a coma, but also to guard them from being mutilated or despoiled by the enemy, or dragged off by scavengers. This makes the ritual more than just an act of remembrance but also a pledge to guard the honour of war dead. The act is enhanced by the use of dedicated cenotaphs (literally Greek for [...] "empty tomb") and the laying of wreaths—the traditional means of signalling high honours in ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
5000|$|In Nordhorn, artist Jenny Holzer was {{commissioned}} to redesign {{a memorial to}} the fallen of Germany’s three previous wars, including World War II. Next to the existing monolith, she designed a circular garden consisting of concentric rings of plantings and pathways. She employed {{a high level of}} symbolism, including benches with etchings such as [...] "The ocean washes the dead" [...] that render them undesirable to sit upon, creating discomfort for the visitor. Called [...] "The Black Garden", Holzer’s design also features plants with dark foliage and blossoms, including an Arkansas Black apple tree, black Mondo grass, dark-leafed geranium and <b>common</b> <b>bugle</b> with dark purple leaves, adding to the melancholy nature of the garden. The apple tree itself adds to the symbolism of the garden, Holzer states it is meant to evoke Biblical notions of man’s curiosity about doing wrong. [...] In the spring, a single spot of white tulips, planted in front of the plaque for victims of National Socialism, contrast with hundreds of black tulips.|$|E
40|$|Galactan:galactan galactosyltransferase (GGT) is {{a unique}} enzyme of the {{raffinose}} family oligosaccharide (RFO) biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the chain elongation of RFOs without using galactinol (α-galactosyl-myoinositol) by simply transferring a terminal α-galactosyl residue from one RFO molecule to another one. Here, we report the cloning and functional expression of a cDNA encoding GGT from leaves of the <b>common</b> <b>bugle</b> (Ajuga reptans), a winter-hardy long-chain RFO-storing Lamiaceae. The cDNA comprises an open reading frame of 1215 bp. Expression in tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) protoplasts resulted in a functional recombinant protein, which showed GGT activity like the previously described purified, native GGT enzyme. At the amino acid level, GGT shows high homologies (> 60 %) to acid plant α-galactosidases of the family 27 of glycosylhydrolases. It is clearly distinct from the family 36 of glycosylhydrolases, which harbor galactinol-dependent raffinose and stachyose synthases as well as alkaline α-galactosidases. Physiological studies {{on the role of}} GGT confirmed that GGT {{plays a key role in}} RFO chain elongation and carbon storage. When excised leaves were exposed to chilling temperatures, levels of GGT transcripts, enzyme activities, and long-chain RFO concentrations increased concomitantly. On a whole-plant level, chilling temperatures induced GGT expression mainly in the roots and fully developed leaves, both known RFO storage organs of the <b>common</b> <b>bugle,</b> indicating an adaptation of the metabolism from active growth to transient storage in the cold...|$|E
40|$|In chloroplasts, several {{water-soluble}} carbohydrates {{have been}} suggested to act as stress protectants. The trisaccharide raffinose (alpha- 1, 6 -galactosyl sucrose) is such a carbohydrate but has received little attention. We here demonstrate by compartmentation analysis of leaf mesophyll protoplasts that raffinose is clearly (to about 20 %) present in chloroplasts of cold-treated <b>common</b> <b>bugle</b> (Ajuga reptans L.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ] plants. The two dedicated enzymes needed for raffinose synthesis, galactinol synthase and raffinose synthase, {{were found to be}} extra-chloroplastic (probably cytosolic) in location, suggesting that the chloroplast envelope contains a raffinose transporter. Uptake experiments with isolated Ajuga and Arabidopsis chloroplasts clearly demonstrated that raffinose is indeed transported across the chloroplast envelope by a raffinose transporter, probably actively. Raffinose uptake into Ajuga chloroplasts was a saturable process with apparent K(m) and v(max) values of 27. 8 mM and 3. 3 micromol mg(- 1) Chl min(- 1), respectively...|$|E
