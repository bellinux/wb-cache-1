40|$|One of the {{widespread}} issues in concrete structures is cracks occurring at early age. Cracks {{that appear in}} the young concrete may cause early start of corrosion of rebars or early penetration of harmful liquids or gases into the concrete body. These situations could result in reduced service life and in significantly increased maintenance cost of structures. Therefore {{it is important for}} construction companies to avoid these cracks. Restraint represents one of the main sources of thermal and shrinkage stresses at early age concrete. Paper I, deals with both the compensation plane method, CPM, and local restraint method, LRM, as alternative methods studying crack risks for early age concrete. It is shown that CPM can be used both for cooling and heating, but basic LRM cannot be applied to heating. This paper presents an improved equivalent restraint method, ERM, which easily can be applied both for usage of heating and cooling for general structures. Restraint curves are given for two different infrastructures, one founded on frictional materials and another on rock. Such curves might be directly applied in design using LRM and ERM. In Paper II, existing restraint curves have been applied to the method of artificial neural networks (ANN) to model restraint in the wall for the typical structure wall-on-slab. It has been proven that ANN is capable of modeling the restraint with good accuracy. The usage of the neural network has been demonstrated to give a clear picture of the relative importance of the input parameters. Further, it is shown that the results from the neural network can be represented by a series of basic weight and response functions. Thus, the results can easily be made available to any engineer without use of complicated software. Paper III, discusses the influence of five <b>casting</b> <b>sequences</b> for the typical structure slab-on-ground. The aim is to map restraints from adjacent structures for a number of possible <b>casting</b> <b>sequences,</b> and to identify the sequence with the lowest restraint. The paper covers both continuous and jumped <b>casting</b> <b>sequences,</b> which include one, two and three contact edges. The result shows that the best <b>casting</b> <b>sequence</b> is the continuous technique with one contact edge.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the thermo-mechanical {{analysis}} of a copper mould, which is a component that controls initial solidification in continuous steel casting. Large temperature gradients, caused by a huge thermal flux imposed by steel, are responsible for high stresses and plastic strains. Plant switch-off also induces residual stresses which may increase with repeated thermal cycling over a <b>casting</b> <b>sequence.</b> Furthermore, oscillations of the melt metal level determine a fluctuation of the temperature peak {{on the surface of}} the mould. As a result, thermal fatigue cracks tend to develop on the mould inner surface, especially for increased productivity rates characterized by higher casting speed and thermal flux. This work aims to study the mechanical behaviour of the mould and to propose a simplified approach to relate stress-strain cycles to the component fatigue life. A thermo-mechanical analysis is performed by a finite element elasto-plastic model, supported by simplified analytical models useful to interpret results. Experimental static strength data are used to calibrate the elasto-plastic material model in FE simulations, as well as to estimate the strain based fatigue curve with the so-called Universal Slopes Equation. The component service life is finally estimated as the number of either fatigue cycles or <b>casting</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

40|$|For the {{production}} of steels with high quality standards is essential to know accurately the different sources that generate inclusions, in order to optimize the steelmaking practices and to minimize their frequency. The use of tracer elements in the slag has shown an effective tool to determine the origin of inclusions in continuous casting slabs. In the present study different experiences were performed using BaCO 3 like a tracer in the tundish slag. Using this methodology slab samples were taken {{at different times of}} the castings. The samples were exhaustively analyzed by optical microscopy and SEM/EDS. The density, size distribution and composition of the inclusions observed were evaluated. The results of this analysis revealed the presence of inclusions with Ba in the slab during the transitory state (ladle change). For another hand, samples from the stationary state did not detect this type of inclusions. Ba inclusions occur most frequently in advanced <b>casting</b> <b>sequence</b> and in those cases where the tundish level has a weight reduction during the ladle change. These results suggest that the emulsification produced by the impact of the flow of liquid steel can generate inclusions. The effect is more pronounced when there is a greater accumulation of slag in the tundish. Finally, various tests are also performed using flow modifiers within the tundish, analyzing their impact on the generation and elimination of non-metallic inclusion...|$|R

30|$|Although {{cracking}} {{can occur}} in hardened mature concrete, transverse deck cracking {{are more likely to}} occur in bridge decks in early ages. The cracking has been observed in reinforced concrete bridge decks in the State of Florida and in other bridges around the nation. Numerous factors can lead to transverse deck cracking in highway bridges including time dependent material properties, restraints, <b>casting</b> <b>sequence,</b> formwork, and environmental factors. Several studies investigated the issue of deck cracking (ACI 2001; Altoubat and Lange 2000; Cady et al. 1971; Eppers et al. 1998; Frosch et al. 2003; Krauss and Rogalla 1996; PCA 1970; Purvis et al. 1995; Saadeghvaziri and Hadidi 2002; Schmitt and Darwin 1995; Xi et al. 2003). Also, the development of cracking increases the effect of freeze and thaw cycles, which may lead to spalling of concrete and thus resulting in corrosion of steel reinforcement. Transverse deck cracking also increases carbonation and chloride penetration leading to accelerated corrosion. Also, a possible damage to underlying components may take place and the bridge may experience premature deterioration; therefore the bridge may experience loss of stiffness and eventually a loss of function. Transverse cracks can reduce the service life of structures and increase maintenance costs. Moreover, cracking will lead to undesirable aesthetic condition of the bridge. The developed cracks are full-depth cracks and are typically spaced at 92 – 305  cm apart. They are the most frequently observed cracks in concrete bridge decks.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} affecting bridges is the transverse cracking and deterioration of concrete bridge decks. The causes of early age cracking are primarily attributed to plastic shrinkage, temperature effects, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage. The cracks can be influenced by material characteristics, <b>casting</b> <b>sequence,</b> formwork, climate conditions, geometry, and time dependent factors. The cracking of bridge decks not only creates unsightly aesthetic condition but also greatly reduces durability. It leads to a loss of functionality, loss of stiffness, and ultimately loss of structural safety. This investigation consists of field, laboratory, and analytical phases. The experimental and field testing investigate the early age transverse cracking of bridge decks and evaluate the use of sealant materials. The research identifies suitable materials, for crack sealing, with an ability to span cracks of various widths and to achieve performance criteria such as penetration depth, bond strength, and elongation. This paper also analytically examines the effect {{of a wide range of}} parameters on the development of cracking such as the number of spans, the span length, girder spacing, deck thickness, concrete compressive strength, dead load, hydration, temperature, shrinkage, and creep. The importance of each parameter is identified and then evaluated. Also, the AASHTO Standard Specification limits live-load deflections to L/ 800 for ordinary bridges and L/ 1000 for bridges in urban areas that are subject to pedestrian use. The deflection is found to be an important parameter to affect cracking. A set of recommendations to limit the transverse deck cracks in bridge decks is also presented.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the cracking of concrete bridge decks and the sealants used in repairing transverse cracks. Cracking could occur in both hardened mature concrete and early age concrete. Several factors affect concrete cracking, such as age-dependent material properties, thermal- and moisture-related stresses and strains, material viscoelastic behavior, restraints, concrete expansion and contraction, <b>casting</b> <b>sequence,</b> formwork, material characteristics, and environmental exposure. The causes of early age cracking are primarily attributed to effects such as plastic shrinkage, temperature effects, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage. This deck cracking could greatly reduce durability, lead to a loss of functionality, loss of stiffness, and ultimately the loss of structural safety. The study investigates the deck cracking in general and also the transverse cracks developed in hardened concrete at early ages before service loads application. Both experimental and analytical investigations were performed. The experimental study included testing of 9 reinforced concrete slab specimens (18 ”x 48 ”x 5. 5 ”). Cracks were induced in the slabs with different crack widths and lengths, sealed with 4 different materials of sealants, and tested under static loading. The study also included tensile testing of dry hardened samples of sealants. In addition, field application was performed on a bridge, where transverse deck cracks were sealed using 4 different sealant materials; cores were taken and tested according to ASTM-C 496. The results of the testing showed that the 3 -part HMWM was the best performing sealer for cracks between 0. 01 and 0. 019 inches of width with the epoxy sealer performing the best for cracks wider than 0. 02 inches...|$|R

The subsequent study of the ram added significantly to the knowledge concerning Classical and Hellenistic large-scale bronzes. The Athlit ram far exceeds other existing rams in size {{and is one of the}} largest bronzes to have survived intact from the ancient Mediterranean world. Initial metallographic and metallurgical analyses of the ram, made shortly after its recovery, led to the conclusion that it was cast horizontally as a single piece in a two-part sandbox. However, the use of this casting method, commonly referred to as sand-casting, has not been documented prior to the late Medieval period. Such a conclusion is therefore inconsistent with existing knowledge of Classical and Hellenistic bronze casting technology. Through the use of advanced analytical techniques and careful visual examination, the current study re-evaluates the technology employed in casting the Athlit ram. Newly gathered data, complemented with archaeological evidence from foundry remains and other surviving bronzes, indicate a close technical correlation between the methods used to produce the ram and the techniques used to create contemporary bronze sculptures. With reference to ancient literary sources and modern technical studies, the current work attempts to reconstruct the <b>casting</b> <b>sequence</b> used. The conclusions place the Athlit ram comfortably within the known parameters of Classical and Hellenistic foundry practices.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} is to study the results of {{investigations}} of chromium addition influence on a microstructure and tensile properties of intermetallics from the Fe-Al system based on Fe 3 Al phase. Design/methodology/approach: The alloys for investigations were prepared by induction melting and gravity casting. The microstructure was analyzed after homogenizing which was performed at 1000 °C for 24 and 48 h. Mechanical properties have been analyzed by the tensile tests witch were carried out at ambient temperature. After that the fracture has been analyzed (sample after 48 h). Findings: As a result of microstructure observations of test alloys containing Cr and without Cr addition, the presence of phases and precipitates has been found. In both alloys Fe- 28 Al and Fe- 28 Al- 5 Cr the phases rich in Zr can be observed. Moreover in Fe- 28 Al- 5 Cr, phases rich in Cr are present mainly on grains boundaries, whereas Zr is present both on the borders and inside the grains. Carried out tensile tests and the results obtained indicate very low plasticity of both alloy without Cr addition and the alloy {{with the addition of}} 5 % of Cr. Research limitations/implications: The investigations showed that {{the most important part of}} production of iron aluminides is casting process.
