5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> another defeat to the Labor Party, {{now under}} Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days of a party which, after almost {{a quarter of a century}} in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and a swing of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E

5000|$|Parties can run in <b>coalitions.</b> <b>To</b> be {{entitled}} to a share of seats, parties or <b>coalitions</b> need <b>to</b> pass an elaborate system of election threshold, based on regional votes: <b>coalitions</b> need <b>to</b> have at least 20% of the votes and a list with at least 3% of the votes; parties or lists need at least 8% of the votes (lowered to 3% if the party or list {{is part of a}} coalition that meets the threshold).|$|R
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{visit was}} a highmark in {{relations}} between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, {{who began to}} criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By {{the time of his}} assassination, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam and opposition to the Vietnam War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|The European {{powers were}} locked in {{internal}} conflicts: e.g. the war in Lombardy. Skanderbeg believed {{that the threat of}} Mehmed launching his withheld European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice to prepare for a new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice withheld an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti-Ottoman <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> halt any future Turkish expansions.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolution of 1789, {{in which}} the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France {{declared}} war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of habeas corpus. The First <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed {{banks and}} cities, and favored France. They built their own {{national}} <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> oppose the Federalists. Both sides gained {{the support of}} local political factions; each side developed its own partisan newspapers. Noah Webster, John Fenno, and William Cobbett were energetic editors for the Federalists; Benjamin Franklin Bache and Philip Freneau were fiery Republican editors. All the newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper, the New York Evening Post and brought in William Coleman as editor. It is still publishing (as the New York Post).|$|E

50|$|When {{conflicts}} erupt, {{group members}} use <b>coalitions</b> <b>to</b> shift {{the balance of}} power in their favor, and it is typical for multiparty conflicts to reduce to two-party blocks over time. <b>Coalitions</b> contribute <b>to</b> the conflict because they draw more members of the group into a fray.  Individuals in coalitions work not only to ensure their own outcomes but also to worsen outcomes of non-coalition members. Those who are excluded from the coalition react with hostility and try to regain power by forming their own coalition. Thus, <b>coalitions</b> need <b>to</b> be constantly maintained through strategic bargaining and negotiation.|$|R

5|$|The {{victory at}} Ulm {{did not end}} the war, since a large Russian army under Kutuzov was still near Vienna. The Russians withdrew to the {{northeast}} to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on 12 November. On 2 December the decisive French victory at Austerlitz removed Austria from the war. The resulting Treaty of Pressburg in late December brought the Third <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> an end and left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the War of the Fourth Coalition with Prussia and Russia the following year.|$|E

At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and explores {{a theoretical framework}} of common features across labor-community coalitions. While researchers in both the U. S. and Australia have written about labor-community coalitions, most of this work has focused on profiling “best practices ” rather than building a framework for understanding coalition such work in general. This paper argues that all coalitions are defined by four common elements: the nature of common concern, the structure of organizational relationships, organizational capacity and commitment, and the scale of coalition activity. It then uses these elements to identify four different ideal types of coalitions, varying from ad hoc <b>coalitions,</b> <b>to</b> simple <b>coalitions,</b> <b>to</b> mutual interest <b>coalitions</b> <b>to</b> deep <b>coalitions.</b> The paper illustrates the usefulness of this framework by using it <b>to</b> examine sample <b>coalition</b> experiences in the U. S. and Australia. The Australian case displays variation in coalition type within a single ongoing campaign around public education. By contrast, eight sample U. S. living wage efforts demonstrate variation in coalition type among different campaigns. A key issue for contemporary political activism is how labor unions and communit...|$|R
5|$|During the First Congo War, the Angolan {{government}} {{joined the}} <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> overthrow Mobutu's government {{due to his}} support for UNITA. Mobutu's government fell to the opposition coalition on 16 May 1997. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through Katangese gendarmes called the Tigres, which were proxy groups formed from the descendents of police units who had been exiled from Zaire and thus were fighting {{for a return to}} their homeland. Luanda did also deploy regular troops. In early October 1997, Angola invaded the Republic of the Congo during its civil war, and helped Sassou Nguesso's rebels overthrow the government of Pascal Lissouba. Lissouba's government had allowed UNITA the use of cities in the Republic of Congo in order to circumvent sanctions. Between 11–12 October 1997, Angolan air force fighter jets conducted a number of air strikes on government positions within Brazzaville. On 16 October 1997 rebel militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 Angolan troops cemented their control of Brazzaville forcing Lisouba to flee. Angolan troops remained in the country fighting militia forces loyal to Lissouba engaged in a guerrilla war against the new government.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> Preserve Copia was formed to explore a plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds. Part of the group's plan included forming a Mello-Roos district with participation of local hotel properties to finance bonds to purchase the property, but their effort failed. In May 2009 local developer George Altamura spoke about his interest in purchasing the property. Other developers including the Culinary Institute of America also {{expressed an interest in}} acquiring the property. Copia's bond holder, ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the center's fixtures, furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|E

Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E

5|$|In early November 1975, the South African {{government}} warned Savimbi and Roberto {{that the}} South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations in Angola despite {{the failure of}} the <b>coalition</b> <b>to</b> capture Luanda and therefore secure international recognition for their government. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of South Africa, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with Prime Minister of South Africa John Vorster, who had been Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of 10 November, the day before the formal declaration of independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria to meet Vorster. In a reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep his troops in Angola through November, but also promised to withdraw the SADF only after the OAU meeting on 9 December. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on 12 November. The Soviet leadership expressly forbade the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} {{the launch of the}} book, Blair {{appeared}} on the series premiere of ITV1's breakfast television programme Daybreak, where he criticised the Dublin protestors as a small minority given undue media attention. Since the book was selling well, and given fears that protesters would also be present at a forthcoming book signing in London on 8 September, he expressed doubts over whether that event was justifiable or worth the inevitable disruption. Later in the day it was confirmed the signing at Waterstones in Piccadilly would not go ahead. A spokesman for Blair announced that a planned launch party for the book scheduled for the Tate Modern would take place despite plans by the Stop the War <b>Coalition</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate. However, the following day this event was also cancelled as a result of threats of disruption by campaigners. In subsequent weeks, a number of media organisations reported that copies of A Journey were being moved from autobiographical sections in bookshops to sections on crime and horror. More than 10,000 people had joined a Facebook page calling for that action.|$|E
