5|$|A $70 million {{renovation}} of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding {{what is known}} today as <b>Concourse</b> B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south <b>concourse</b> (now <b>Concourse</b> A) was dedicated. The <b>concourse</b> was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north <b>concourse</b> was completed in 1996, which is now <b>Concourse</b> C, and was expanded in 2002.|$|E
5|$|<b>Concourse</b> D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of <b>Concourse</b> D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} <b>Concourse</b> C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, <b>Concourse</b> D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the <b>concourse</b> was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand <b>Concourse</b> D with additional gates to increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{in early}} 2009, a {{construction}} project {{added a new}} walkway and food court to <b>Concourse</b> A. The project also connected gates A4A and A4B to the main A <b>concourse.</b> Expansions were completed {{in the spring of}} 2010.|$|E

50|$|The midfield <b>concourses</b> allow {{passengers}} to be screened {{in a central}} location efficiently and then transported via the underground people mover to three different passenger <b>concourses.</b> Unlike Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport upon which the midfield design was based, <b>Concourses</b> B and C are not connected by any kind of walkway; they are only accessible via train.|$|R
5|$|In 1982, {{a bronze}} state of Brunel was erected {{on the station}} <b>concourse.</b> It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the Bristol and West Building Society. Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and {{separated}} from the <b>concourse</b> by a glass screen wall. It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels.|$|E
5|$|Nashville International Airport hosts two airline lounges — a Delta Air Lines Sky Club and an American Airlines Admirals Club. The Sky Club {{is located}} {{adjacent}} to gate B3, {{in the same}} <b>concourse</b> as all of Delta's gates. The Admirals Club is located above gate C12, in the same <b>concourse</b> as all of American's gates.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail has {{constructed}} a balcony along almost the whole {{width of the}} <b>concourse</b> at the first-floor level. The project's aims were to provide 18 new retail spaces and a champagne bar, reduce congestion on the <b>concourse,</b> and improve access to Waterloo East station by providing additional escalators leading to the high-level walkway between Waterloo and Waterloo East. Retail and catering outlets {{have been removed from}} the <b>concourse</b> to make more circulation space. First-floor offices have been converted into replacement and additional retail and catering spaces. Work was completed in July 2012, at a cost of £25million.|$|E
50|$|Despite signs {{indicating}} more gates in <b>concourses</b> C and D, {{the airport}} has 75 gates (originally 97 gates) on four <b>concourses,</b> however only 69 gates {{are available for}} use.|$|R
25|$|All {{airlines}} {{aside from}} Air Canada Express and Frontier Airlines operate {{out of two}} linear satellite terminals. One contains <b>Concourses</b> A and B, and the second contains <b>Concourses</b> C and D.|$|R
25|$|Design {{capacity}} is 10 million passengers per year, with 28 gates on 3 <b>concourses</b> (current B,C and D). The terminal buildings can be expanded incrementally to 65 gates on 5 <b>concourses</b> (A-E).|$|R
5|$|The IND <b>Concourse</b> Line got {{funding to}} be {{extended}} eastward past 205th Street, but Bronx residents wanted to rehabilitate the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway right-of way. This funding was reallocated, and the old NYW line became the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in December 1941, and the IND <b>Concourse</b> Line extension was not brought up again until 1968.|$|E
5|$|The IND <b>Concourse</b> Line {{would have}} been {{extended}} eastward to Gun Hill Road from 205th Steet.|$|E

50|$|<b>Concourses</b> are {{provided}} at Bourke and Collins Streets. Platform 1 is north of Bourke Street, while Platform 8 South is south of Collins Street. The remainder of platforms are located between Bourke and Collins Streets, with access from both <b>concourses.</b> Both <b>concourses</b> are further divided {{into an open}} access regional section for platforms 1 though 8, and a closed access suburban section for platforms 9 though 14.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 the {{terminal}} underwent a major renovation and expansion: two new <b>concourses,</b> a larger baggage claim area, new restaurants and gift shops. The project doubled {{the size of}} the passenger terminal. The Philadelphia architectural firm DPK&A designed the new <b>concourses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>concourses</b> {{and main}} {{terminal}} {{are laid out}} similarly to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The main difference is that DIA has no satellite unit of T gates directly attached to the terminal, and {{the space between the}} <b>concourses</b> at DIA is much wider than the space between the <b>concourses</b> in Atlanta. This allows for maximum operating efficiency as aircraft can push back from their gate while other taxiing aircraft can still taxi through the alley behind them without delay.|$|R
5|$|An {{extension}} of the IND Sixth Avenue Line from the terminal at 57th Street under the center of Central Park and then running via Fifth Avenue once {{out of the park}} at 110th Street, and would continue under the East River with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which would have been modified in order to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch continuing up the Grand <b>Concourse</b> and then connecting to the IND <b>Concourse</b> Line.|$|E
5|$|BNA has one terminal, and 4 concourses. Concourses A, B, C, and D. <b>Concourse</b> D {{has been}} {{inactive}} since 2002, but plans {{are in the}} works to reactivate and expand it with new gates.|$|E

50|$|The present H-shape of the PDX terminal, {{designed}} by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership, was completed on September 10, 2001 {{when the new}} A, B and C <b>concourses,</b> {{as well as the}} light rail line, were finished. Probably the most stunning portion of PDX's interior, the new <b>concourses</b> reflect a Northwest theme, focusing heavily on the nearby Columbia River. A huge celebration was to be held the following weekend, but the events of September 11, 2001 interceded. The new <b>concourses,</b> designed to be public spaces, were closed to non-passengers.|$|R
5|$|In September 2008, the {{northwest}} {{wing of the}} D Gates was completed. This marked {{the completion of the}} <b>concourse,</b> which has a total of 44 gates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line {{platforms}} {{were replaced by}} escalators, with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower <b>concourse</b> between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower <b>concourse</b> connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform {{are located in the}} disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of escalators, the GNP station building was taken out of use.|$|E
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire <b>concourse</b> and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the <b>concourse</b> entrance.|$|E
