25|$|In the 1940s, Germany {{invented the}} liquid <b>chlorobromomethane</b> (CBM) {{for use in}} aircraft. It was more {{effective}} and slightly less toxic than carbon tetrachloride and was used until 1969. Methyl bromide was discovered as an extinguishing agent in the 1920s and was used extensively in Europe. It is a low-pressure gas that works by inhibiting the chain reaction of the fire and is the most toxic of the vaporizing liquids, used until the 1960s. The vapor and combustion by-products of all vaporizing liquids were highly toxic, and could cause death in confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|TMB {{was used}} {{experimentally}} by the US Air Force, specifically {{with regard to}} B-52 engine assemblies, and was tested in modified 10-gallon wheeled CBM extinguishers. Other agents were added to suppress the methanol flare up, such as <b>chlorobromomethane</b> (CBM), Halon 2402, and Halon 1211, with varied success. Halon 1211 was the most successful, and the combined TMB pressurized with halon 1211 and nitrogen was called Boralon was used experimentally by the Los Alamos National Laboratory for use on atomic metals, using sealed cylinder extinguishers made by Metalcraft and Graviner which eliminated the moisture contamination problem. TMB/Boralon was abandoned {{in favor of more}} versatile agents, though it is still mentioned in most US firefighting literature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a {{thermodynamic}} template is demonstrated in scheme 1. A thermodynamic template is a reagent that can stabilize the form of one product over others by lowering it's Gibb's free energy (ΔG°) {{in relation to other}} products. cyclophane C2 can be prepared by the irreversible highly diluted reaction of a diol with <b>chlorobromomethane</b> in the presence of sodium hydride. The dimer however is part of series of equilibria between polyacetal macrocycles of different size brought about by acid catalyzed (triflic acid) transacetalization. Regardless of the starting material, C2, C4 or a high molar mass product, the equilibrium will eventually produce a product distribution across many macrocycles and oligomers. In this system it is possible to amplify the presence of C2 in the mixture when the transacetalisation catalyst is silver triflate because the silver ion fits ideally and irreversibly in the C2 cavity.|$|E
40|$|The {{photodissociation}} {{dynamics of}} <b>chlorobromomethane</b> (CBM) were investigated between 193 and 242 nm by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) with time-of-Ñight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Translational energy distributions, anisotropy parameters, and Br: Br * branching ratios were determined at 193 and 235 nm {{to explore the}} non-adiabatic dynamics near the avoided crossing. Additional measurements were made at intermediate wavelengths to characterize the wavelength dependence of the Br and Br* anisotropy parameters. The non-adiabatic crossing probabilities calculated by applying a one-dimensional LandauÈZener model were relatively insensitive to the excitation wavelength, indicating that the avoided crossing between 3 A @ and 4 A @ potentials lies in the exit channel. Additionally, we have determined the partial absorption cross sections for the excited states {{that contribute to the}} ultraviolet absorption spectrum of CBM...|$|E
