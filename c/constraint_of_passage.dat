The piers may be masonry or of assembled sections of wrought iron. Aside from this stabilizing feature, the overthrow was largely freed <b>of</b> <b>constraints</b> <b>of</b> barring <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> animals or people. Consequently, the iron master was free to express his fancy. Overthrows often feature monograms or cyphers, armorial crests or supporters, and even fully realized coats of arms.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} design is to construct a set of different filter banks that would include the <b>constraint</b> <b>of</b> signal <b>passage</b> at one position (and closing in other positions corresponding to known disturbing sources). By performing the directional opening towards the desired location in the fixed filter bank structure, the beamformer is left {{with the task of}} tracking and suppressing the continuously emerging noise sources. This algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB and tested on real speech recordings conducted in a car hands-free communication situation. Results show that a reduction of the total complexity can be achieved while maintaining the noise suppression performance and reducing the speech distortion...|$|R

All children made a high proportion of detection errors on the prose passage, but only the skilled group showed any difference in errors for the and non the words, making relatively more errors on the in the prose and scrambled prose passages. These results support the hypothesis that the facility with which familiar words are processed is related to reading com-prehension skill in children. If we are to help children who have problems with reading comprehension, {{it is important to know}} how they differ from skilled readers. One major suggestion is that less-skilled comprehenders do not process words so efficiently as their skilled counterparts.

When we generalize the transition ritual pattern to the analysis of all behaviors, we announce the end of ritual analysis.

40|$|The {{majority}} of philosophers of time hold that the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is objective change in A-series properties. On this “traditional” view <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> {{there is an}} objective, non-relative present moment (or set of simultaneous events) and the moment or set of simultaneous events that is present continuously changes. That the traditional view construes passage in these A-theoretic terms makes the existence <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> depend on the truth {{of one of the}} A-theoretic views of the ontology of time. The {{majority of}} B-theorists deny that time passes because they reject the A-theoretic views. I defend a “revisionist” B-theoretic view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time, wherein <b>passage</b> is the temporally successive occurrence of events. Time passes in that one moment occurs after another in a B-series of equally existing events. I begin by defending the viability of the revisionist view as a view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Then I argue that since both the revisionist and traditional views <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are viable views <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> whether passage is really objective change in A-series properties or the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events depends on which view of the ontology of time is correct. I argue that the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology of time, first by showing that there are several arguments that sink the A-theoretic views, then by showing that the B-theory escapes its main objection: that it is incompatible with temporal experience, particularly with the experiences of the present and <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Since the revisionist B-theoretic view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is a viable view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> and since the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology <b>of</b> time, the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events. Finally, I argue that events only occur in temporal succession if they are time-like related to each other and there are multiple series of time-like related events.
