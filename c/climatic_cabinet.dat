40|$|Stabilised {{electrical}} {{performance data}} {{are necessary to}} compare different types of modules in the emerging thin-film PV market and as basic information for energy yield calculations. The problems with accurate power measurements of thin-film modules are well known. The module test-standard IEC 61646 ed. 2 tries to take these into account by demanding light-soaking and repeated STC-measurements which leads to time consuming procedures. The stabilisation behaviour over time of Isc, Voc, efficiency and filling-factor is compared {{under the influence of}} different illuminations. Therefore, IV-curves are measured with a high frequency during outdoor exposition and indoor exposition to 1000 W/m² irradiation from a class B solar simulator in a <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinet</b> under temperature-controlled conditions. The results are compared with STC-measurements after different pre-conditioning procedures. It turned out that the different module types behave differently with respect to the changes of their properties as a function of light-soaking exposure time...|$|E
40|$|Stabilized {{performance}} parameters of PV-modules {{are necessary for}} energy yield prediction {{as well as for}} the investigation of module degradation effects. The electrical parameters of thin-film modules show stabilization behaviors which are typical for the applied technology. However, this behavior is not satisfyingly understood yet. Different types of thin-film modules have been exposed to artificial irradiation and controlled temperatures in a <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinet</b> with a class B solar simulator for up to 330 h. The modules have been connected to electronic loads to perform IV-curve measurements every 15 minutes and MPP-tracking between the measurements. The stabilization of the different parameters (Uoc, Isc, FF, Pmpp) has been analyzed using this data. Temperature correction was done with temperature coefficients which have been measured after a certain irradiation dose had been applied. Flasher-measurements have been used for confirmation of the DC-measurements after the relaxation of the modules after the continuous irradiation exposure was finished...|$|E
40|$|Stabilized {{electrical}} {{performance data}} {{are necessary to}} compare different types of modules in the emerging thin-film-PV market and as basic information for energy yield calculations. The problems with accurate power measurements of thin film modules are well known. The module test-standard IEC 61646 ed. 2 tries to take this into account by demanding light-soaking and repeated STC-measurements which leads to time analysed procedures. The stabilisation behaviour over time of short circuit current, open-circuit voltage, efficiency and filling-factor is compared {{under the influence of}} different illumination conditions for various types of CdTe, CI(G) S and a-Si modules. Therefore, I-V-curves are measured with high frequency during outdoor exposition and indoor exposition to 1000 W/m(sup 2) irradiation from a class B solar simulator in a <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinet</b> under temperature-controlled conditions. The different modules are held in MPP conditions between the measurements. The results are compared with STC measurements according to IEC 61646 procedures. To describe the development of the performance of the different types of thin film modules, suitable mathematical approaches are taken to describe the different developments during the process of light soaking. It turns out that the different module types behave very differently and some types need very long times until a stabilised state is reached. ...|$|E

Typical deterioration phenomena like crusting, leaching and microcracking could be simulated using accelerated weathering in <b>climatic</b> test <b>cabinets.</b> The sensibilization of such samples caused by cleaning was assessed by infrared spectroscopy and light microscopy after re-weathering...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers of PV-modules usually give a {{warranty}} for {{at least}} 20 years. There is still only little knowledge about the lifetime of newly developed modules, however. How do they cope with snow, desert-climate or tropical humidity? In order {{to answer this question}} the Fraunhofer-Institute for Solar Energy Systems and TUV Rheinland have installed different outdoor exposure sites where modules have to stand extreme climates: high temperatures with high differences between day and night in the Negev desert at Israel, snow, wind and changing irradiation in the German Alps, and high humidity at warm temperatures at Indonesia. Commercial modules from industrial partners as well as innovative modules with different combinations of encapsulants and back-sheets were exposed. UV-irradiation, solar-irradiation, ambient- and module temperatures, ambient humidity and wind speed is measured and collected at a central server in Germany. These data are the basis for the calculation of integral loads for the comparison of different climatic regions and for an estimation of the service life, an exciting field of work since decades(1, 2, 3). Results from the evaluation of the monitoring during the fist 12 months of exposure are compared. Fluorescent lamps are chosen for accelerated UV-testing, since they simulate the UV-irradiation of the sun well while emitting less thermal radiation than Xenon-lamps. The UV-source is designed for use in <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinets</b> for damp-heat testing with UV...|$|R
40|$|Testing {{equipment}} for the combined testing of materials or technical products under defined climatic stresses and increased levels of gaseous pollutants are applied in industrial quality control as well as research to study the interaction of surfaces or component parts with relevant atmospheres. For these purposes a homogenous distribution of the "total stress potential" (governed by thesynergetic influence of temperature, moisture and pollutants) within the test chamber is of major importance. Effects at the test speciem should clearly be correlated to the individual properties of thesample and must not be due to local variations of the test atmosphere. Therefore a pilot {{study was designed to}} clearify the performance of a typical laboratory <b>climatic</b> test <b>cabinet</b> in respact to local inhomogeneities of the corrosive stress. Corrosive sensitive material was used to detect the local stress distribution (dosimeter principle) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{effects of a}} humid environment on the mechanical properties of adhesive have been investigated for many years. However, from early studies to recent contributions most of the interest {{has been focused on}} the reduction of strength related to plasticity associated with moisture uptake, interfacial weakening, etc. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} variations of elastic constants, which influence both the stiffness of the joint and the distribution of stresses. The goal of this study was to measure the effects of a humid and warm environment on tensile strength, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a two-component epoxy adhesive, Henkel Hysol 3425. The measurements have been carried out on bulk specimens of dogbone shape, instrumented with two-grid (axial/transverse) strain gauge rosettes and tested in tension. The conditions of exposure, generated in a <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinet,</b> were 100 % relative humidity and 50 °C. To relate the exposure time to the moisture uptake, the weight of the specimens was monitored. It has been noticed that most of the water uptake occurs in the first week of exposure; however, at progressively slower rate, the phenomenon is noticeable almost until the fourth week and then saturation is achieved. Over the same period, the mechanical properties decay as moisture uptake continues; at the end, the loss in strength is about 75 % whilst for the elastic moduli the loss is approximately 20 %. No clear evidence is found about the Poisson's ratio, which exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour: stable in the early weeks, then increasing and decreasing of a few per cent. In accord with previous works, the behaviour of the mechanical properties seems to be governed by the amount of moisture uptak...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} upon {{the pattern of}} meiotic development was studied in PMC in Picea abies. The twigs were collected from grafts and exposed to different temperature conditions in a <b>climatic</b> <b>cabinet.</b> (The thermoperiods used were + 20 °Cl + 15 °C and + 15 °C/+ 10 °C respectively.) The rate {{as well as the}} temperature sum requirement of the development within given limits were compared. The data obtained are compiled in Figure 31. Significant differences obtained in some instances indicate that at least some phases of development are accelerated by a rise in the temperature. However, the results were somewhat contradictory with respect to different phases of the meiotic development. For example a shorter time and a smaller temperature sum were needed for the development from diplotene to interkinesis (compared at the 50 per cent level) in the experiment carried out at the higher temperature. On the other hand, the reaching of tetrads proceeded faster and had a lower ternperature sum requirement in the lower temperature conditions. The exposure of the material to - 5 O°C caused a delay in the meiotic development. Furthermore, the induction of irregularities in PMC following the treatment at - 5 °C was studied. Data on the frequency of different types of irregularity, the frequency of irregularities at different meiotic stages as well as the relationship between the occurrence of sensitive stages during the treatment at - 5 °C and the frequency of irregularities were presented. The relationships between the origin of the material {{on the one hand and}} the pattern of meiotic development or the frequency of irregularities induced on the other hand were discussed...|$|E
40|$|At the Odessa Phytotron we have {{installed}} over 50 <b>climatic</b> chambers and <b>cabinets</b> made by various companies of the United States, Canada, Germany and U. S. S. R. They employ different light sources including Sylvania fluorescent lamps of various types, fluorescent lamps {{produced in the}} former Soviet Union with a special luminophore, ordinary tungsten lamps, xenon, mercury, mercury-iodide, sodium, etc. Our objective in lighting is that the intensity distribution over the wave lengths should be maximal in the photosynthetically active part of the spectrum and minimal in the IR part to avoid plant sterilization. Phytotrons are extremely energy consuming entities, and the large part of their energy consumption falls into the lighting category in our electric bills. Therefore, {{we are in a}} constant search of the processes to reduce energy. However, the main way to increase effectiveness would be the development of new types of light sources, which would come close to the threshold of 150 to 200 lumens per watt...|$|R
