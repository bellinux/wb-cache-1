Survey method and questionnaire tool were used to collect data from 74 visually challenged students, who are studying in various schools of Thiruvananthapuram. Analyses revealed that 59. 46 % students are <b>computer</b> <b>literates</b> and are aware of online resources. However, internet usage is very less among the <b>computer</b> <b>literates</b> {{due to the lack of}} proper training. Among the respondents, a good number of students are aware of assistive technologies, even though many of them are not using them. The mostly used assistive technology is screen reader. It is found that students are depending on internet resources mainly for their academic purpose. Responses shows that lack of proper training creates a big barrier in using internet and only 25. 67 % are using it very confidently. The results of the study would be helpful in getting a fairly good idea of the student’s awareness level of internet resources and assistive technologies. The outcome of the study helps the school authorities, librarians and the government to provide adequate services and training to visually challenged students to access information without any barriers...|$|R

The GIPSE {{system has been}} designed to allow end-users to specialise their application by creating new functions. As it allows this task by Programming by Demonstration techniques, without any use of textual programming language, GIPSE can be used by non <b>computer</b> <b>literates.</b> Starting from GIPSE, we propose to rely two approaches which, at a first glance,seem very different: model-based interface development and user-adaptable applications. We argue that these two approaches may converge, bringing user enpowerment to formal approaches, and conversely, bringing formal insurance to end-user developments...|$|R

50|$|Pressing the {{backspace}} key {{on a computer}} terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which {{did not have the}} backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the {{backspace key}} was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by <b>computer</b> <b>literates,</b> denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' key followed by typing a regular 'H' key.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of Information and communication technology (ICT) by the visually impaired students in Calicut University, Kerala. Semi-structured interviews were employed to collect data from a representative sample of 100 visually impaired students from the departments and affiliated colleges of the University. The study found that a large majority of the students are <b>computer</b> <b>literates</b> and use mobile phones frequently. A good number of them use screen readers in their mobile phones. However, the foreign accent of screen reading programs is a challenge for the students. The support of friends and family members is very helpful for the students to acquire the skills of ICT. Microsoft Office and Jaws screen reader supported by Windows operating system are the most popular software among the students. Use of internet by the students is very less and most widely used internet service is www followed by e-mail. It is found that a majority of the students need training in word processing and Internet. This study provides useful information about the use of ICT by visually impaired students in India...|$|R
40|$|Web Augmentation {{is to the}} Web what Augmented Reality is to the {{physical}} world: layering relevant con-tent/layout/navigation over the existing Web to customize the user experience. This is achieved through JavaScript (JS) using browser weavers (e. g. Greasemonkey). To date, over 43 million of downloads of Grease-monkey scripts ground the vitality of this movement. However, Web Augmentation is hindered by being pro-gramming intensive and prone to malware. This prevents end users from participating as both producers and consumers of scripts: producers need to know JS, consumers need to trust JS. This paper aims at pro-moting end user participation in both roles. The vision is for end users to prosume scripts as easily as they constructs. Promoting consumption calls for augmentation scripts to be easier to understand, share and trust upon. To this end, we explore the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) by introducing Sticklet. Sticklet is an internal DSL on JS, where JS generality is reduced {{for the sake of}} learnability and reliability. Specifically, Web Augmentation is conceived as fixing in existing websites (i. e. the wall) HTML fragments extracted from either other sites or Web services (i. e. the stickers). Sticklet targets hobby programmers as producers, and <b>computer</b> <b>literates</b> as consumers. From a producer perspective, benefits are three-fold. As a restricted grammar on top of JS, Sticklet expressions are domain-oriented and more declarative than thei...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, the {{computer}} has extended its functionalities from a business tool used by <b>computer</b> <b>literates</b> to a multimedia display that provides information, entertainment and communication to all people. This evolution calls for new interaction technologies. Indeed, the stationary interaction of the keyboard and the mouse limits the usability of the computer. Both the mouse and the keyboard were introduced to write documents or to execute commands, but what tools were created to permit a dynamic navigational system through a movie or real-time editing of a song ? Such an enhanced manipulation of media content requires another human-computer interactive approach. Few of the current methodologies of interaction have considered the possibilities of real time editing of moving image content or musical scores. Our contribution to more user-centric interactive systems is the Cinematic Presence System (CPS). The CPS is a non-tangible user interface that stresses the notion of Free Body Hypermedia Interaction (FBHI [...] Mohamed Hachem and Jean-Claude Bustros), which frees the user from following certain steps, wearing certain tools, or enduring any control over his/her senses while interacting with a multimedia display. CPS consists of a multimedia display that reacts to the user's movements. A user's interaction with the display allows the media content to be navigated and extracted in a non-linear fashion. Furthermore, this user-system interaction will promote a renewed, expanded cinema experience, where the user can interact dynamically with the image, the environment, and the screen...|$|R

40|$|The Problem: We use {{sketches}} as {{a medium}} for expressing ideas and saving thoughts. Sketching is especially common in early design {{as a means of}} communication, documentation and as a tool for stimulating thought. Despite the increasing availability of pen based PDAs and PCs, we still can’t interact with our devices via sketching as we do with people. As a group, we are building a generic multi-domain sketch recognition architecture to make <b>computers</b> sketch <b>literate.</b> This sketch recognition system will differ from existing architectures in many aspects, including a language for describing shapes, mechanisms for learning new shapes, and a blackboard based recognition architecture with top-down and bottom-up recognizers. Here we describe a part of this system that generates efficient bottom-up recognizers by compiling object descriptions. Motivation: As described in [2], current sketch recognition systems require users to hand-code individual recognizers as well as data structures for each object to be recognized. Hand-coding individual recognizers has a number of drawbacks: (i) writing recognizers and data structures is labor intensive and error prone, (ii) extending or modifying existing recognizers requires knowing how they work, (iii) because recognizers may be written by different programmers and may have different recognition algorithms, they lack a unified approach to recognition, (iv) users usually sketch parts of objects in a certain order and style, but current systems don’t have a systemic way of exploiting this information to improve recognition accuracy and speed...|$|R

40|$|The much-hyped {{marketing}} {{revolution of}} the twenty-first millennium is Internet shopping, also called online shopping, web-shopping or e-shopping, which {{is characterized by the}} absence of a physical store and a presence of a website as a virtual store. Through Internet, a customer may shop any time in any corner of the world not only for purchase information, but also an actual purchase. Both marketers and customers see it as a market revolution, because such shopping is facilitated through information technology. However, this technology-based shopping essentially requires technology acceptance by the customers by believing in it. Such a belief is encoded in attitude. The present empirical study investigates the attitude towards online shopping based on the perceptions of 647 respondents selected from Bangalore City through snow balling technique. The study finds that customers (i) are very highly <b>computer</b> and Internet <b>literates</b> and they have high technology acceptance; (ii) have higher levels of motives for online shopping with hedonic motives influencing more than cognitive motives; and (iii) moderate post-purchase behavior in terms of behavioral intentions and confirming the expectations. The major hurdle in perceiving a positive attitude towards online shopping has been the problem of trust. However, the study finds that there exists a moderate level of positive attitude towards online shopping. ...|$|R
