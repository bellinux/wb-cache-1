5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced <b>crew</b> <b>costs,</b> United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of Holt's package of boiler pressure, compound engine and hull design gave {{a ship that}} could steam at 10 knots on 20 long tons of coal a day. This fuel consumption was a saving from between 23 and 14 long tons a day, compared to other contemporary steamers. Not only did less coal need to be carried to travel a given distance, but fewer firemen were needed to fuel the boilers, so <b>crew</b> <b>costs</b> and their accommodation space were reduced. Agamemnon was able to sail from London to China with a coaling stop at Mauritius on the outward and return journey, with a time on passage substantially less than the competing sailing vessels.

40|$|The airline {{industry}} encounters many optimization {{problems such as}} scheduling flights, assigning the fleet, scheduling the crew. Among them, the crew scheduling problem is the most studied one. The main {{reason is that the}} <b>crew</b> <b>cost</b> {{is one of the largest}} components of the operational cost for an airline company. Therefore, there are many models proposed in the literature to find a <b>cost</b> efficient <b>crew</b> schedule. Most of those models divide the crew scheduling problem into two separate problems, namely the crew pairing and the crew assignment problems. The crew pairing problem that we study here aims at finding the least costly subset of pairings, which cover the scheduled flights. Although there are many approaches to solve the crew pairing problem, most of them assume no disruptions during the operation. However disruptions due to weather conditions, maintenance problems, and so on are common problems leading to higher operational <b>crew</b> <b>cost</b> in practice. These kinds of disruptions result in delaying or canceling some scheduled flights. Another disruption that local airline companies face is adding an extra flight to predetermined (regular) flight schedule. In this study, we propose a model that provides robust crew pairing schedule in the case of adding an extra flight to the regular flight schedule. Two solution approaches are along with the mathematical model are proposed. The objective of the proposed model is to maximize the total number of solutions, while maintaining the increase in the <b>crew</b> <b>cost</b> at an acceptable level. A crew pairing problem is then solved by both the proposed model and the conventional model. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model...|$|R

We the following scenarios are studied: i) Increasing number of passengers in the Baltic Sea. ii) Growth in the demand for shipping of goods. ii) The EU-sanctioned system of subsidies for <b>crewing</b> <b>costs</b> is abolished iv) Increased bunker costs (IMO-decision on low sulphur fuel) v) The Ãƒâ€¦land tax exemption within EU and, therefore, tax-free sales onboard are abolished It is shown that the manning subsidies mainly benefit the seafarers, but seen from the point of the macro economy, shipping companies or all households, abolition of manning subsidies could have positive impacts as well, depending on the manner of adjustment of shipping to new conditions. We show that from the point of view of the Ãƒâ€¦land economy and society, the first two scenarios are positive for almost everybody. The negative consequences of iv) are widespread, but the abolition of the Ãƒâ€¦land tax exemption would have disastrous consequences for the passenger ferry industry and for the economy as whole. ...|$|R
40|$|A new crew {{scheduling}} optimization {{system has}} been developed for United Airlines. The system was developed to permit quick response to schedule changes and to reduce <b>crew</b> scheduling <b>costs.</b> It was designed to work efficiently for both the medium sized problems (300 flights daily) and the very large problems (1, 700 flights daily) that United must solve. The system has two main components, a generator and an optimizer. The generator creates pairings (candidate crew trips) which are fed as variables to the optimizer as an elastic embedded set partitioning integer programming problem. The optimizer then seeks to find a set of pairings that covers all of the flight segments exactly once with minimal cost. Once a disjoint solution has been found, the system cycles between the generator and the optimizer to improve it.

40|$|Abstract: Commonly, {{public transit}} agencies, {{with a view}} toward efficiency, aim at {{minimizing}} the number of vehicles in use to meet passenger demand, and therefore at reducing <b>crew</b> <b>cost.</b> This work contributes to achieving these two objectives by proposing the use of two predom-inant characteristics of public-transit operations planning: (a) different resource requirements between peak and off-peak periods, and (b) working during irregular hours. These character-istics result in split duties (shifts) with unpaid in-between periods. The outcome of this work is an optimal solution for maximizing the unpaid shift periods with the assurance of complying with the minimum number of vehicles attained. The optimization problem utilizes a highly informative graphical technique (deficit function) for finding the least number of vehicles; this enables the construction of vehicle chains (blocks) that take into account maximum unpaid shift periods. The latter consideration is intended to help construct crew schedules at mini-mum cost. The methodology developed was implemented by two large bus companies and resulted in a significant cost reduction...|$|R
