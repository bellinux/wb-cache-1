25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
500|$|On 4 February, Scott {{landed on}} the Barrier and {{unpacked}} an observation balloon which he had acquired for aerial surveys. Scott climbed aboard and rapidly ascended to above 600feet (180m) in the firmly tethered balloon. Shackleton followed with a second flight. All either <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> unending Barrier surface. Wilson privately thought the flights [...] "perfect madness".|$|E
500|$|Before 1909, Barcelona {{played in}} various stadiums, {{none of which}} were owned by the club. On 14 March 1909, the club moved to the Camp de la Indústria which had a {{capacity}} of 6,000 people, {{and it was the}} first ground owned by the club. Barcelona moved to Les Corts in 1922, which had an initial capacity of 20,000, which was later enlarged 3-fold to 60,000. The top-row of Les Corts was the origin of the nickname culer, derived from the Catalan cul (...) , as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand. The English author, Phil Ball, notes that [...] "all you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> row upon row of bums".|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 4:00a.m. {{local police}} {{were called to}} the scene but {{reported}} that the only lights they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> those from the Orford Ness lighthouse, some miles away on the coast.|$|R
60|$|Without ado {{the lady}} of the ranch marched into the kitchen, {{followed}} by Mrs. Rover. All the ladies <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> the freshly-caught fish resting on the cabinet shelf and the floor.|$|R

500|$|Flight93 {{fragmented}} violently upon impact. Most of {{the aircraft}} wreckage was found near the impact crater. Investigators found some very light debris including paper and nylon scattered up to eight miles (13km) from the impact point in New Baltimore. Other tiny aircraft fragments were found [...] away at Indian Lake. All human remains were found within a 70-acre (28 ha) area surrounding the impact point. Somerset County Coroner Wally Miller {{was involved in the}} investigation and identification of the remains. In examining the wreckage, the only human body part he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> part of a backbone. Miller later found and identified 1,500 pieces of human remains totaling about , or eight percent of the total. The rest of the remains were consumed by the impact. Investigators identified four victims by September 22 and eleven by September 24. They identified another by September 29. Thirty-four passengers were identified by October 27. All the people on board the flight were identified by December 21. Human remains were so fragmented that investigators could not determine whether any victims were dead before the plane crashed. Death certificates for the 40 victims listed the cause of death as homicide and listed the cause of death for the four hijackers as suicide. The remains and personal effects of the victims were returned to the families. The remains of the hijackers, identified by the process of elimination, were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as evidence.|$|E
500|$|At 20:00, Saumarez led his ships {{into the}} Gut after the {{combined}} squadron, {{but in the}} gathering dusk Moreno's squadron was already {{out of sight and}} the British admiral realised that his ships were too slow to catch the French and Spanish ships in their current formation before they reached the comparative safety of the open ocean. At 20:40, with the wind picking up, he therefore instructed the squadron to break formation and attack the rear of the combined squadron, directing his orders at Keats in Superb, whose ship was the fastest. Keats immediately set all sail and by 22:00 had regained sight of the combined squadron's rearguard, which consisted of the 112-gun ships and the Saint Antoine. Behind, all Keats <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> Caesar and Venerable in the distance, and by 23:00 only Caesar was still in sight, more than [...] behind Superb. Although he was now facing considerable odds, Keats steered Superb to within [...] of the Real Carlos at 23:20, coming under fire from all three vessels of the Franco-Spanish rearguard, although evading much of it by the simple tactic of not illuminating his ship so that the ships of the combined squadron fired on one another more than on their British opponent. Linois had also ordered his ships to extinguish their lights, but this only added to the confusion of the Spanish ships in the squadron. The moon had set and the night was quite dark, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Spanish gunnery. [...] Real Carlos fired randomly at the British ship but failed to strike it once during the brief engagement. Keats' ship was much more accurate however, firing three broadsides before Superb was carried beyond Real Carlos and towards Saint Antoine. The British broadsides caused severe damage, knocking away the foretopmast and causing a fire to break out on the Spanish ship's deck following the third broadside. The fire grew rapidly and soon was so fierce that it could be plainly seen by observers at Gibraltar.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the porthole and all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
50|$|Carvings like Gajasinghe Katayama, Hansa Puttuwa, flower {{designs and}} sculptures of dancers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> Other than that, carvings about day-to-day life {{can also be}} found. Many wood carvings that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in Embekka Devalaya <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> here.|$|R
60|$|Leopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but {{all they}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> stripy shadows and blotched {{shadows in the}} forest, but never a sign of Zebra and Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden {{themselves}} in the shadowy forest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{now stood}} behind her, holding a half-crown in my hand, {{and asked her}} if she could tell me what I had in my hand, to which she replied, [...] "It is a shilling." [...] It seemed as though she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what <b>was</b> {{happening}} miles away easier than she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what <b>was</b> going on in the room.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few minutes}} before 3:00p.m. at about [...] in {{altitude}} and near Mineral, Washington, he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a mirror. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, but all he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a DC-4 to his left and behind him, about [...] away.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Governor Janet Napolitano {{visited the}} {{area at the}} time of the fire. [...] "This is a big, major fire, and it {{concerns}} us all," [...] she said. Regarding her aerial tour, the governor said, [...] "The fire looks a lot better today than it did a week ago. I flew over Mount Graham on July 4 and all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> smoke. Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E
2500|$|Avey {{also says}} that he twice {{exchanged}} uniforms with a Jewish inmate to smuggle himself into the inmate's camp in order to witness for himself the actual treatment of Jews, which he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> completely different from the treatment of British POWs. While [...] British POWs were forced to work six days a week, they could use their free time to play football and basketball. And while their conditions were dreadful, according one British inmate, [...] "they were as {{nothing compared to what}} the Jews next door went through." [...] Avey agreed, and describes the plight of the Jews: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fleet: [...] "Gunnery Sergeant Russell R. Thurman. the 31st MAU {{public affairs}} specialist, recalled. [...] "The most {{incredible}} thing that morning {{was the number}} of ships.

6000|$|... 'If {{the cousins}} {{come in from}} Ormersfield, I shall tell Louis {{to take you to}} look at his farm. It would be very good for you--My dear, what is it?' for Mary's ears and neck, all that she <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>were</b> crimson.|$|R
60|$|And {{to those}} faces gazing up, George's lips were grim, and over them {{came and went}} a little bitter smile; but on his {{forehead}} he felt still the touch of his horse's muzzle, and his eyes, which none <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>were</b> dark with pain.|$|R
2500|$|During {{a spring}} {{training}} {{game against the}} Chicago White Sox in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, Don Blasingame, pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and {{made the most of}} it. During another spring training game against the New York Yankees, Whitey Ford gave him the derisive nickname [...] "Charlie Hustle" [...] after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a walk. Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In Ken Burns' documentary Baseball, Mickey Mantle claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> headed over everything.|$|E
60|$|This kept us silent {{again for}} a moment. Mabane, I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> getting a little ruffled.|$|E
60|$|Harût {{followed}} her words {{with an interest}} that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> intense, although he attempted to hide it. Then {{he asked me to}} translate them, which I did.|$|E

60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|R
60|$|Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> agitated. His {{face grew}} white at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Black One! O thou who consumeth with rage! [Dhlangamandhla]" [...] {{broke out}} Saduko, who, I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> much disturbed. [...] "I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Just then Dick {{came out}} of his door. Belding eyed him keenly. The only change he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that Dick had put on a hat and a pair of heavy gloves.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett rose. She was dignified even in defeat. She {{collected}} Ogden and Mr. Pett {{with an eye}} {{which even}} Ogden <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> not to be trifled with. She uttered no word.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very intently to <b>see</b> if I <b>were</b> mocking. He laughed. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> very much moved.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> {{in one of his}} moods.|$|R
60|$|The {{driver had}} just pulled up his horses, {{allowing}} them to go at a walk so as to restore their wind and ease them for awhile. Gilda tried her best to peer through the darkness. All that she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> those lights far away on the right which proclaimed the distant city.|$|R
60|$|So we {{went into}} the smoking-room, and Lord Ragnall, who, I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> annoyed, {{instantly}} fetched a blank cheque from his study and handed it to Van Koop in rather a pointed manner.|$|E
60|$|The {{speaker was}} a grizzled man, middle-aged, and rather too plump for a sailor. He had a genial, good-natured countenance, {{and so far}} as I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the only {{occupant}} of the vessel.|$|E
6000|$|My heart almost {{stood still}} waiting the answer. By that answer my {{professional}} medical prestige stood or fell. Martin, I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> quite {{sure it was}} going to fall. And then the answer--O blessed answer! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{track of}} totality passed across the North Atlantic {{and into the}} Arctic Ocean. The only {{populated}} places from which the totality <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>were</b> the Faroe Islands and Svalbard.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's all I <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There <b>was</b> {{a little}} carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man took}} us to the inn which he recommended, and we found it was the Angel. It was a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house. As far as I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> they <b>was</b> all women that managed it, and it couldn't have been managed better; and as far as I <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> we <b>was</b> the only guests, unless there was [...] "commercial gents," [...] who took {{themselves}} away without our seeing them.|$|R
