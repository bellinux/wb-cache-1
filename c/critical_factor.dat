5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a <b>critical</b> <b>factor.</b> Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E

Due to lack of inadequate resources, inadequate staff and many problems PHCs of India in general and PHCs of Karnataka are in particular are suffering. An attempt is made to assess <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> affecting the quality treatment. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present a frame work for north karnataka rural area PHC by assessing various <b>factors,</b> considering <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> using existing model and the literature of health care services for quality treatment and improvement of PHC. This would enable PHC medical officer understand how patient evaluate the quality treatment provided and aid them to allocate necessary resources, facilities, staff etc to various aspects of healthcare, considered to be important by the patients.

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the <b>critical</b> <b>factor.</b> The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze whether quality management practices implemented and carried out by the rural accommodation establishments under study influence society results obtained by organizations, which are understood as the participation therein and the development of local community. ´ Design/methodology/approach – The working methodology consists of carrying out an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in order to test the psychometric properties of measurement scales, and the hypothesized relationships between <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> and society results are examined using structural equation modeling. Findings – The study provides evidence of a weak relationship between the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> of quality and society results in rural accommodation establishments. The results suggest that process management is the only quality practice that has a direct effect on society results {{and the rest of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> are considered antecedents of it. Originality/value – The contribution of this study, which explores the impact of the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> of quality on society results, is to confirm that there is an effect of the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> of quality on society results (social and environmental responsibilities) through the direct relationship of process management.

40|$|Driven by {{spiraling}} {{costs and}} the increasing demands of consumers, workers and funding bodies, change is an ongoing and inevitable condition {{in the health care}} industry. Traditional structures, high professional differentiation and provider-centred processes have resulted in an inefficient system that requires radical change to meet the new demands of the environment and the market place. The literature on the shift towards decentralized organizational models such as Program Management, was reviewed. A Readiness Model was developed based upon the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> for successful implementation of Program Management as identified in the literature. A two part field study was then conducted in a multidivisional community hospital. Results confirmed that the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> identified in the literature were also viewed as <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> in the study setting. Correlational analysis indicated a positive relationship between the perceived degree of development of the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> and the perceived success of implementation of Program Management. In the hospital studied, results for perceived readiness and perceived success ranked the hospital divisions highest to lowest for Rehabilitation, Regional Children 2 ̆ 7 s Centre, Long Term Care and Acute Care. The most important factors were perceived to be interdisciplinary teamwork, a philosophy of client-centred care, and shared vision and values. The results suggested a model incorporating the concept of the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> with the concept of the team-based organization. Self directed teams must be supported by the <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> as they develop processes to deliver client-centred care to specific program populations. The Readiness Model may be used by healthcare organizations to evaluate the level of development of <b>critical</b> <b>factors</b> and to target areas requiring further development in order to facilitate successful implementation of decentralized structures.
