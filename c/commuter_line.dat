5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in 1953 {{to see if the}} spur {{could be used as a}} part of a <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> with stops at Merchandise Mart, State Street, and Michigan Avenue, but the plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons. In the 1970s architect Harry Weese suggested a light rail line along the spur to connect Chicago's downtown stations with the River North neighborhoods. In 2008 the City of Chicago Department of Transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis to look at a proposal to create a transit link from Union Station and the Ogilvie Transportation Center to Michigan Avenue using the Union Pacific train tunnel running under the Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart and other buildings east toward North Michigan Avenue. The proposed Carroll Avenue Transitway would include the retrofitting of Kinzie Street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing <b>commuter</b> <b>line.</b> A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E

25|$|Some 30,000 flats were {{originally}} {{planned to be}} built along the route between 2006 and 2011, only {{to be put on}} hold when the property market crashed. The <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> was built after the new towns in north-west New Territories, along with road-based transport networks, were nearing completion. Attempts to boost patronage were made by cutting longstanding bus services, which in turn necessitated government compensation to private bus operator Kowloon Motor Bus.|$|E
25|$|Three {{commuter}} lines radiated from North Western Station; the C West Line to Geneva, Illinois; the C Northwest Line to Harvard, Illinois; and the C North Line to Kenosha, Wisconsin.

25|$|Donabate railway station, in {{the centre}} of the town, is on the Dublin–Belfast main line and is served by Northern <b>Commuter</b> <b>line</b> trains between Dublin and Dundalk. The Transport 21 {{infrastructure}} plan envisages electrification north of Malahide and through Donabate as far as Balbriggan by 2015, though this has since been delayed. Trains serving Donabate would be incorporated into a new DART service between Balbriggan and Hazelhatch and Celbridge, south of the capital, using the planned Interconnector rail tunnel beneath Dublin city centre.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the Air Force, Gabreski worked for Grumman Aerospace until August 1978. He {{was asked by}} New York Governor Hugh Carey to serve {{as president of the}} financially stressed and state-owned Long Island Rail Road in an attempt to improve the <b>commuter</b> <b>line.</b> Carey was opposed in the Democratic gubernatorial primary election by his own lieutenant governor, Maryanne Krupsak, and in part appointed Gabreski to enhance his election campaign based on Gabreski's Polish extraction and Long Island affiliations.|$|E
25|$|Between Burlish and Stourport station, the {{alignment}} of the former Bewdley to Hartlebury section has been redeveloped for housing. However, from the Hartlebury direction the trackbed is intact as a bridleway from Mitton (the eastern throat of the original station), with only a span over the A449 Worcester to Kidderminster main road missing. The abutments are intact. Almost all of the trackbed is in Council ownership and in 2007 they {{expressed an interest in}} reopening as a <b>commuter</b> <b>line.</b> The goal of this proposal was unclear.|$|E

25|$|Yeomans was {{promoted}} to chair of the MUC's public transit committee in November 1986. Shortly thereafter, he called for the province to finish delayed renovations on the Dorion–Rigaud <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> and expressed disappointment when the government instead allocated the money for a road link to Mirabel Airport. Yeomans later opposed the provincial government's plan to extend Highway 440 to the Trans-Canada Highway, arguing that it would create more urban sprawl and reduce investment in Montreal. He did, however, strongly support the province's plans to renovate Montreal's Deux-Montagnes Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} also operated suburban commuter trains between downtown Detroit and Pontiac, Michigan from August 1931 until January 1974 {{when the}} now defunct Southeast Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took over operating the commuter trains. Amtrak's Detroit–Chicago trains now originate or terminate over this former <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> making {{stops in the}} northern Detroit suburbs of Pontiac, Troy and Royal Oak, Michigan. Part of GTW's former route in Detroit to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock known as the Dequindre Cut {{has been transformed into}} an urban greenway rail trail.|$|E
25|$|The Dyre Avenue Line was {{originally}} {{part of the}} four-track main line of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, an electrified <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> that connected White Plains and Port Chester, New York to a station at the Harlem River adjacent to the IRT Third Avenue Line. The NYW opened on May 29, 1912. Soon a transfer station opened at East 180th Street, with transfers to the IRT White Plains Road Line and various surface lines. Express trains stopped within the Bronx only at Pelham Parkway and East 180th Street. The NYW was abandoned on December 31, 1937 due to bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|During his {{announcement}} on Great Western electrification in March 2011, transport secretary Phillip Hammond stated {{that a good}} business case existed for the electrication of several south Wales <b>commuter</b> <b>lines.</b> In July 2012, the UK Government announced that the south Wales <b>commuter</b> <b>lines</b> would be electrified. The lines which would be electrified are: all Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes, the Ebbw Valley Railway and the Maesteg Line.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Main Line of Public Works across Pennsylvania enhanced the village's stature, as the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad passed through it. This became the Pennsylvania Railroad, which built suburban <b>commuter</b> <b>lines</b> out from Philadelphia in the late 19th century, spurring the growth of that city's suburbs. The largest and longest of these <b>commuter</b> <b>lines,</b> the [...] "Main Line", terminated in Paoli.|$|R
50|$|The Illinois Central Railroad {{electrified}} {{its three}} <b>commuter</b> <b>lines</b> serving Chicago in 1926 pursuant to ordinances {{passed by the}} city. The IC <b>commuter</b> <b>lines</b> remain electrified and are now operated as Metra Electric. The catenary is energized at 1500 V DC and serves four tracks of commuter operations. Two tracks are unelectrified and used for freight and Amtrak service to downstate Illinois and beyond.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{dismantling}} began, TCRT had purchased {{a significant number}} of PCC streetcars. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still in very good operating condition. The cars ended up in Mexico City (91 cars), Newark, New Jersey (30) and Shaker Heights, Ohio (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their extra width and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated right-of-way. For instance, the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> in Cleveland was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.|$|E
25|$|Coastal {{cities and}} towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the Shore Line East <b>commuter</b> <b>line.</b> Several new {{stations}} were completed along the Connecticut shoreline recently, and a commuter rail service called the Hartford Line between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak's New Haven-Springfield Line {{is scheduled to begin}} operating in 2018. A proposed commuter rail service, the Central Corridor Rail Line, will connect New London with Norwich, Willimantic, Storrs, and Stafford Springs, with service continuing into Massachusetts and Brattleboro. Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and Springfield, Massachusetts, serving Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, Hartford, Windsor Locks, and Springfield, MA and the Vermonter runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{new lines}} were opened in this era, the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in 1941 and the IND Rockaway Line in 1956, with an {{extension}} of the latter to Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue in 1958. Both of these lines were rehabilitations of existing railroad rights-of-way rather than new construction. The former line was the City portion of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, an electrified <b>commuter</b> <b>line</b> closed in 1937, and the latter a line obtained from the Long Island Rail Road. While the latter is a long and substantial line, it consists mostly of a long right-of-way crossing Jamaica Bay with a single station on Broad Channel island and two branches on a peninsula that is only several city blocks wide. For a time, the IND Rockaway Line was considered its own subway division.|$|E
