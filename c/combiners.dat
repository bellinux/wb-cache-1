500|$|Directional couplers, power splitters, {{and power}} <b>combiners</b> [...] are all {{essentially}} {{the same type of}} device, at least when implemented with passive components. [...] A directional coupler splits a small amount of power from the main line to a third port. [...] A more strongly coupled, but otherwise identical, device may be called a power splitter. [...] One that couples exactly half the power to the third port (a [...] coupler) is the maximum coupling achievable without reversing the functions of the ports. [...] Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse, whereupon they become power <b>combiners.</b>|$|E
500|$|Applications of {{the hybrid}} include {{monopulse}} comparators, mixers, power <b>combiners,</b> dividers, modulators, and phased array radar antenna systems. [...] Both in-phase devices (such as the Wilkinson divider) and quadrature (90°) hybrid couplers {{may be used}} for coherent power divider applications. [...] An example of quadrature hybrids being used in a coherent power combiner application is given in the next section.|$|E
500|$|Power {{dividers}} (also power splitters and, {{when used}} in reverse, power <b>combiners)</b> and directional couplers are passive devices used mostly {{in the field of}} radio technology. They couple a defined amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit. [...] An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction. [...] Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port but not to the coupled port. [...] A directional coupler designed to split power equally between two ports is called a hybrid coupler.|$|E

The proposed edge <b>combiner's</b> architecture is well suited for frequency multiplier applications. The proposed edge <b>combiner</b> is tested for input frequencies of up to 250 MHz. The design is implemented on 65 nm {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process. The simulation results show that the total power consumption of proposed design is 7. 68 times less than the total power of conventional XOR edge <b>combiner.</b> The switching power of proposed design is only 8 % of the total power which was 25 % in conventional edge <b>combiner.</b> Area of the edge <b>combiner</b> is 7. 8 nm i. e. 3. 33 times less than the XOR edge <b>combiner...</b>|$|R

500|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of filters whose design objectives are {{something other than}} rejection or passing of certain frequencies. [...] Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. [...] However, a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes {{on the nature of}} a filter. [...] Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks, directional couplers, power dividers, power <b>combiners,</b> and diplexers. [...] Other possible applications include multiplexers, demultiplexers, negative-resistance amplifiers, and time-delay networks.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals for {{the tour}} began in March 2007. The set list of the shows {{included}} songs from the standard and deluxe edition of B'Day as well as songs from Dangerously in Love (2003). Ten shortened versions of Destiny's Child's songs were performed, as well as [...] "Listen", a track performed by Knowles on the [...] of the 2006 musical drama film Dreamgirls, in which Knowles had starred. Twenty three people were present on stage with Knowles: ten instrumentalists, three harmony vocalists and ten dancers, from which only four were male. Anthony Venutolo from The Star-Ledger noted that the inclusion of female persons on stage was [...] "a simple, effective way" [...] to underscore the theme of female empowerment showcased during the concerts. Both Venutolo and Jon Pareles of The New York Times agreed that the shows used men only as dancers for the female audience. The conception and staging for the concert was done by Knowles, Kim Burse and Frank Gatson Jr. Gatson, Jonte Moaning, Ramone, Anthony Burrell and Danielle Polanco choreographed the dance routines. The tour was managed by Alan Floyd and its sponsors were Samsung and L'Oréal Paris. 75 stage and crew members and 60 tons of stage equipment, most of which was lighting, were present {{for the tour}}. 38 Sennheiser wireless channels {{were used for the}} shows and in a different frequency range, 38 backup wireless channels. The engineering team comprised James Berry who handled monitors for the band, Ramón Morales for Knowles, and Horace Ward at front of house. Sixteen of the wireless channels were devoted to personal monitor systems: 11 in stereo and five in mono. Knowles {{and the rest of the}} band members had a Sennheiser EK 300 IEM G2 monitoring receiver. Eleven of the channels provided wireless instrument support for guitar, bass and horns, using Sennheiser SK 500 G2 bodypack transmitters. The remaining channels covered Knowles' vocal microphone and those of her backup singers and guest vocalists. Sennheiser EM 3032-U and EM 550 G2 true-diversity receivers with Sennheiser A 5000-CP antennas and AC 3000 <b>combiners</b> rounded out the system. Knowles sang through a nickel Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter outfitted with a Neumann KK 105-S capsule. Ward commented that The KK 105-S was an [...] "absolutely stunning microphone... is beautifully smooth and captures every nuance of a talented vocalist's performance". He specified Sennheiser SKM 935 G2 microphones for the backup and guest vocalists because they sounded [...] "excellent even under less-than-ideal conditions".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how some known techniques, like combining [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and achieving more parallelism, {{can be applied}} to existing STM systems [6] that have a central point of synchronization, in order to boost their performance. In the combining synchronization technique, information about active synchronization requests is stored in a list which contains one node for each such request. One thread, called the <b>combiner,</b> undertakes the task of applying all (or some of the) synchronization requests stored in the list in addition to its own. Each of the other threads performs local spinning until it finds out that its synchronization request has been served by the <b>combiner</b> (or that it should try to become a <b>combiner</b> itself). The <b>combiner</b> is identified by accessing a global lock. The first thread that manages to acquire the global lock becomes a <b>combiner.</b> Before leaving the system the <b>combiner</b> will either identify some other active thread as the <b>combiner</b> or it will release the global lock to allow to another thread to acquire the loc...|$|R

We propose a novel iterative scheme to design the codebook-based analog precoder and <b>combiner</b> in forward and reverse channels. During each iteration, we apply compressive sensing (CS) technology to efficiently estimate the equivalent MIMO-OFDM mmWave channel. Then, the analog precoder or <b>combiner</b> is obtained based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to alleviate the interference between different data streams as well as maximize the spectral efficiency. The digital precoder and <b>combiner</b> are finally obtained based on the effective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency.

A (k, `) -robust <b>combiner</b> for collision-resistant hash-functions is a {{construction}} which from ` hash-functions constructs a hash-function which is collision-resistant if at least k {{of the components}} are collision-resistant. One trivially gets a (k, `) -robust <b>combiner</b> by concatenating the output of any ` − k + 1 of the components, unfortunately this is not very practical as {{the length of the}} output of the <b>combiner</b> is quite large. We show that this is unavoidable as no black-box (k, `) -robust <b>combiner</b> whose output is significantly shorter than what can be achieved by concatenation exists.
