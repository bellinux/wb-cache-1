40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on the financial performance of the Nigerian market after consolidation. The authors use data from all Nigerian banks that survived the consolidation between 2001 and 2009. Logistic regression models are structured to {{determine the influence of}} M&A activities on the financial performance of the Nigerian market. Also, the authors critically evaluate the findings by shedding the light on the lessons other developing nations can learn from the Nigerian market. The results show that M&A have a positive influence on the financial performance of the Nigerian market. Still, M&A are not enough to achieve the wider objectives of banking sector reform. Towards this end, corporate governance reform must take place vis-à-vis <b>consolidation</b> <b>exercises</b> especially when these M&A are regulatory based rather than market based. The investigation uses a novel approach by comparing pre- and post- M&A results performance of merged banks as well as comparing these results with non-merged banks. Finally, the paper puts the results in context of the wider reform context and considers the effectiveness of the M&A as a tool for banking sector reform in developing countries. The investigation offers insights into the policy of banking consolidation which can be useful for policy makers in Nigeria and other similar economies...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of monetary policy {{in the operation of}} a successful modern economy and the use of official interest rates as tools in its implementation, this study investigates the implications of changing bank concentration on the operation of the Interest Rate Pass Through (IRPT) of official rates to bank lending and deposit rates. This is an issue made more poignant by growing mergers, acquisitions and bank <b>consolidation</b> <b>exercises</b> around the world that have brought interest to their implications for economic performance. However, with contention high in the industrial organisation theory on the likely relationship between bank concentration and the IRPT, and the outcomes of empirical investigations producing conflicting evidence, the desire to investigate the issue in the African context necessitated a thorough empirical investigation of four African countries (South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria and Zambia). This study not only extended the investigation of the issue to the African context, but it merged different IRPT measurement techniques that had not been jointly applied to this particular issue, namely; Symmetric and Asymmetric Error Correction Models, Mean Adjustment Lags, Ordinary Least Squares estimations and Autoregressive Distributed Lag models. These measures of the IRPT were compared with three firm concentration ratios on two different levels of analysis, one, over the entire period and, another, through eight year rolling windows. The results reveal that bank concentration can sometimes be related to the speed and magnitude of the IRPT but that these relationships are not consistent amongst the countries, over the entire sample period or across the two levels of analysis, suggesting reasons why empirical results have arrived at contrasting conclusions. The results revealed more evidence of a relationship between bank concentration and the magnitude of the IRPT than between bank concentration and the speed of the IRPT. Furthermore, where relationships were identified there was evidence supporting both the structure conduct performance hypothesis and the competing efficient market hypothesis as the true representation of the relationship between bank concentration and the IRPT. The key implication of the result for African countries is that increased bank concentration through bank consolidation programmes should not be automatically regarded as detrimental to the effective implementation of monetary policy through the IRPT. Consequently,banking sector regulation need not stifle bank consolidation and growth to preserve monetary policy effectiveness. Rather, since the relationship cannot be neatly represented by a single theory or hypothesis each country must determine its own interaction between bank concentration and its IRPT before policies regarding the banking sector concentration and effective monetary policy, through the use of official interest rates, are determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{world economy}} is {{experiencing}} a vigorous upswing. Having overcome their financial crises, the countries of Asia and Latin America are contributing most strongly to economic growth. At the same time, the economies of Central and Eastern Europe have again started to expand. For {{the world as a}} whole, a growth rate of about 4 percent has been forecast for both this year and 2001, up from just above 3 percent in 1999. This production boom will result in a doubling of the growth rates of world trade to about 10 percent this year. A slight decline is being forecast for the coming year. The prolonged cyclical upturn of the American economy is continuing almost unabated. Nevertheless, the USA (GDP + 3 percent) may well be overtaken by Europe (above all the euro zone with 3 ¼ percent growth of GDP) due to the weakness of the euro. This estimate is based on the scenario of a "soft landing" for the USA. The Japanese economy is unlikely to return to the high growth rates of the period before the recession in the coming year. Overall, the current upswing of the world economy will be accompanied by low inflation rates (around 2 percent in the EU both this and next year). For the first time, employment growth is accelerating substantially in Europe and will reach the U. S. level in the coming year. Thus, unemployment is expected to fall noticeably within the European Union {{for the first time in}} years (from around 10 percent in 1998 to 8 percent in 2001). Since its start on January 1, 1999, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has already had a major impact on the economic policy positions adopted by the economies of Western Europe. This applies not only to the members of the euro zone, but also to the other EU countries not participating in EMU. The asymmetrical economic policy structure – centralised monetary policy of the ECB and decentralised fiscal policies of the member states – has ultimately resulted in a culture of high stability. On the one hand, inflation rates have reached their lowest level in many years. On the other hand, the pressure for budget <b>consolidation</b> <b>exercised</b> within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact has generated a surprising degree of fiscal discipline, with a number of EU countries expected to report a budget surplus in the coming years. The active and co-ordinated approach to employment policy is also bearing fruit in the form of growing employment and falling unemployment rates. The weakness of the euro is partly accounted for by the negative interest differential to the USA, but can also be attributed to the lack of confidence in the euro prior to its introduction as legal tender in 2002.
