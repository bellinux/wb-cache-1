5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled, though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace stand as a reminder to Windy Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at <b>Crossfield</b> Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E

40|$|Leaf floras in fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) {{portion of}} the Winton Formation suggest a {{community}} with co-dominance of angiosperms, conifers, ginkgo and other seed plants. To date wood floras associated with the Winton Formation have not been examined in detail. Winton Formation wood has been presumed to comprise araucarian, podocarp and taxodiaceous components, but this has been based largely on the identification of other plant macro and microfossils. Here we describe a new species of podocarp fossil wood from the genus Protophyllodadoxylon based on eleven specimens of silicified wood found as surface material at two broadly coeval sites in the Cenomanian-Turonian {{portion of the}} Winton Formation: QM L 311 and Bladensburg National Park. The new species is characterised {{by the presence of}} araucaroid tracheid pitting and phyllodadoid oopores, the absence of oculipores, and the paired arrangement of the oopores within the <b>crossfields.</b> The recognition of Protophyllocladoxylon in the Winton Formation supports previous palynological frequency counts that suggest a dominance of podocarp conifers.

The study concerns Uganda?s (1) HIV and AIDS history, (2) workforce demographics, (3) decentralized government for diffusion capabilities, (4) AIDS fundings, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), and their effectiveness, and (5) utilization of change agents to overcoming socio-cultural barriers in the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS. Human Resource Development (HRD) theories examined are Lewin Field Theory involving leadership identification characteristics as they interact with the group dynamics in force fields, Nadler?s Hierarchal Order for Training and Development, and Organizational Development in Systems, Swanson?s Systems Ringland, and Shoemaker?s Performance Improvement Performance Needs Model, Swanson and Holton?s Basic Human Resource Development Model, Kuhn?s use of paradigms, Dubin?s Theory Building Model, and The Body of Knowledge Model. Findings indicate ten major areas where the workforce could be improved and decreases in HIV and AIDS incidence and prevalence could occur. These areas are: (1) overcoming socio-cultural stigmas, (2) increased verifiable HIV testing and treatment, (3) HRD instructions, strategies, tools, and skills for training and development, organizational development, and cultural sensitivity for Westerners; (4) evaluation tools for measuring INGO activities: accountability needed, (5) implementation of the ABC Program transnationally, (6) advocacy for maintaining philanthropy, (7) building of infrastructures and schools - increasing teachers, managers, and engineers and apprenticeships, 8) empowering women and orphans with skills and education, (9) partnering resources and decision making amongst stakeholders and (10) outlining areas for further research...|$|R

2500|$|Recycling {{plants such}} as those at Kaybob, West Whitecourt and <b>Crossfield</b> {{produced}} liquids-rich gas from [...] "retrograde condensation" [...] reservoirs.

In the case of West Whitecourt, they also processed dry but sour gas from the Pine Creek field (near Edson) as a source of make-up gas. In the case of <b>Crossfield,</b> the liquids-rich gas came from the Wabamun D-1 zone and the make-up gas from the uphole Elkton zone. Most of these plants were built in the days of 16 cent long-term [...] contracts from TransCanada PipeLine when the National Energy Board required 25 years of reserves in the ground in order to gain an export permit (from Canada).

2500|$|Attacking kicks {{are also}} employed, usually if the {{opposition}} is out of position or running at them is proving ineffective. Common attacking kicks include the [...] "up and under", box kick, [...] "grubber", <b>crossfield</b> kick and chip kick. The up and under, {{also known as a}} [...] "bomb" [...] or Garryowen, is a high punt. A well executed up and under will be high enough to give anyone chasing enough time to compete for the ball. Box kicks are similar, but are kicked by the scrum-half over their shoulder when a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out occurs near the touchline. The ball is kicked high and parallel to the touchline with the wingers chasing. If the ball is kicked along the ground it is called a grubber. It can catch the defenders unaware and because the ball is oval shaped it does not bounce consistently, making it hard for them to collect it. A cross field kick occurs when the ball is kicked from one touchline to a player waiting near the other one. Chip kicks are short kicks just behind the defensive line for attacking players to run onto. Like defensive kicks there is still a risk that the opposition will regain possession after an attacking kick.|$|E
