40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>assignments</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in education. While some academics would admit that they lessen their workload, many would say <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> give students the “real world ” group experience needed for later employment. Problems with <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> have been noted in the literature, but {{the extent to which}} staff are aware of problems is not clear, nor is it clear whether students think <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> could be valuable. The present study set out to obtain staff and student views on the problems with, and the worth of, <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> and, given the comments, to consider a better strategy for implementing group work. A questionnaire was administered to 69 students and 12 academicians in an IT school at a university.

Reasons for the discrepancy are considered. The perceived benefits and negative aspects of <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> were also considered. The students seem to put more store on sharing ideas and social interaction than staff and they are concerned about timetabling and logistical problems, which staff are unaware of.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that teamwork {{is a fundamental}} skill of construction personnel and therefore construction management students must develop this skill during their studies. <b>Group</b> <b>assignment</b> has been put forward to help students in developing their teamwork skills. Although research in team learning and teamwork is abundant, team learning in terms of students' perceptions on <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> in construction management studies has not been thoroughly investigated. Using a survey questionnaire, the benefits, problems, formation, process progression and assessment of the <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> in postgraduate construction management education were investigated. Development of cooperation and communication skills and being exposed {{to a variety of}} ideas were considered the main benefits, while unfair assessment and the difficulty of arranging times for group meetings, as well as low quality work by some members, were the major problems. The students preferred to form groups themselves with three or four members in a group.

40|$|Aspergillus nidulans is a {{holomorphic}} fungus, {{capable of}} producing both meiotically and mitotically derived spores. Meiosis may be an evolutionary relic in this species because it is potentially capable of mitotic recombination and because most Aspergilli lack the ability to produce meiotic spores. We tested the null hypothesis that meiosis {{has been a major}} factor in the origin of strains of A. nidulans from Great Britain by estimating linkage disequilibrium among restriction fragment length polymorphisms. These strains belong to different heterokaryon <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> and are thus incapable of undergoing mitotic recombination with one another, so any recombination evidenced by linkage equilibrium is assumed to be the result of meiosis. Eleven cosmid clones of known chromosomal origin were used to generate multilocus genotypes based on restriction-pattern differences for each heterokaryon <b>compatibility</b> <b>group.</b> Low levels of genetic variation and little linkage disequilibrium were found, indicating that the heterokaryon <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> represent recently diverged lineages that arose via meiotic recombination. The null hypothesis that loci are independent could not be rejected. Additionally, low levels of electrophoretic karyotype variation were indicative of meiosis. We conclude that although A. nidulans probably propagates in a primarily clonal fashion, recombination events are frequent enough to disrupt the stable maintenance of clonal genotypes. We further conclude that the British heterokaryon <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> arose via recombination and not through novel mutation...|$|R
40|$|Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causative {{agent of}} bean anthracnose, {{is one of}} the most common {{pathogens}} leading to expressive damage to plants beyond presenting noticeable variability. The knowledge on vegetative <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> (VCGs) is of particular interest in asexual fungi as they subdivide the population in groups that can exchange genetic information via heterokaryosis and the parasexual cycle. Among the techniques used in studies about vegetative <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups,</b> the obtainment of nit mutants is apparent. This paper is aimed at obtaining heterokaryons between different isolates of C. lindemuthianum, grouping them in VCGs and evaluating their genetic variability by using the nit mutants system. Nit mutants were obtained from 20 single spore isolates. The mutants were phenotypically classified and paired for complementation and formation of heterokaryons so as to group them in VCGs. Seventeen mutants from the different phenotypic-rates were recovered: nit 1, nit 2, nit 3 and nitM. At the same time, 10 mutants were selected for pairing and division of the anastomosis groups. Nine heterokaryons were obtained and the isolates were divided into 9 vegetative <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups.</b> In the combinations for the formation of anastomosis, 31 compatible combinations and 24 incompatible combinations were observed. It was concluded that the methodology used to select nit mutants in C. lindemuthianum made it possible to determine the vegetative <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> and that such a technique was adequate to prove genetic variability...|$|R
40|$|Twelve wild {{collections}} and one commercial strain {{were used to}} characterize breeding systems and to develop molecular identities in the Arvenses section of the genus Agaricus, which includes the “horse mushroom” A. arvensis. Two morphotypes were identified based on macro- and micromorphological features. However, not all collections could be delimited by conventional taxonomic characters. Sequencing of the small subunit intergenic spacer (ITS) region (368 to 370 bp) of the rRNA genes clearly resolved the 13 collections into two clusters consistent with the identified morphotypes. Single-spore progenies and mating type testers were established and used to test intra- and interstock compatibility. The two <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> identified were consistent with ITS clusters. <b>Compatibility</b> <b>group</b> I stocks readily interbred within the constraints of a unifactorial heterothallic system with a multiallelic mating type factor. <b>Compatibility</b> <b>group</b> II had a more restricted breeding pattern, and interactions were difficult to predict {{on the basis of}} mating type. Morphological data, ITS sequences, and the ability to interbreed suggest that these collections are part of a complex of interrelated species. Single-spore, homokaryotic isolates from both <b>compatibility</b> <b>groups</b> were able to fruit in compost culture, and two of the collections may represent natural homokaryotic fruiting. We conclude that species from the section Arvenses have versatile unifactorial heterothallic life cycles that permit both interbreeding and homokaryotic fruiting...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} {{experiment}} {{we have shown}} that output-sharing can overcome the “tragedy of the commons ” as long as individuals share their output in groups of optimal size. Sharing in groups induces free-riding, while individual extraction from a common pool (CPR) causes overharvesting. By choosing the right output-sharing group size we can therefore create an incentive to harvest efficiently. In this paper we evaluate our group-sharing mechanism in {{an environment in which}} CPR users can communicate with others who are either in their output-sharing group or in a communication group (like a community) that is not necessarily linked to the output-sharing group. We implement a modified 2 x 2 design in a controlled laboratory experiment with within-group communication versus no communication defining one dimension, and random linked <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> versus fixed linked <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> defining the other. In these linked <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> treatments, members in communication groups are placed into output sharing groups in each round. A not-linked <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> treatment is added to the design in which the communication group membership is fixed across all of the rounds of a session, but the output-sharing group membership changes after each round.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that assessment {{is the single}} most powerful driver on learning in postgraduate education. Effective assessment methods are held to be very important in maximising students' learning, motivating students, fairly and reliably evaluating the subject and providing informative feedback to lecturers and to students on their learning progression. Assessment normally consists of individual <b>assignments,</b> <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> and final exams. Furthermore, <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> have been commonly used in postgraduate education to allow students to learn about teamwork skills. Assessment of <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> in a proper and fair manner has been a major concern, however, and a challenge to both students and lecturers. Using a questionnaire survey, students' perceptions on the various assessment methods used in a postgraduate construction project management course are investigated. The findings suggest that while the research-based <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> was considered effective in demonstrating learning of technical content and collaboration skills, the students strongly favoured assessment of individual contributions to <b>group</b> <b>assignments.</b> Furthermore, it was found that group-based in-class oral presentations were also effective in demonstrating learning of technical content and developing presentation and communication skills, and peer assessment of the oral presentations was found to be worthwhile. While <b>group</b> <b>assignment</b> is a common assessment format, individual assignments and the final exam are also a necessary part of the overall assessment of a course. The research findings suggest that well-designed learning activities which correspond to learning objectives and the use of different assessment methods with prescribed assessment criteria are useful strategies contributing to successful learning and teaching in postgraduate construction management studies...|$|R

These themes could be applied by giving university <b>group</b> <b>assignments</b> tighter deadlines than individual assignments, by providing tools to encourage communication within student groups (e. g. online information-sharing tools, and group logs to record details of meetings), encouraging student groups to develop a collective identity, and by encouraging student groups to choose a leader.
