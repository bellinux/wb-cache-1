5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, iridium coating was {{produced}} by double glow plasma on various substrates.

5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting.

5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer <b>coat.</b> <b>The</b> eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{deposition}} of ceramic powder coating TiB 2 -TiC mix with aluminium powder on the 6082 -T 651 aluminium alloy by means of laser <b>coating.</b> <b>The</b> resulting <b>coating</b> was studied {{by means of a}} microstructural and microchemical analysis. Microhardness was measured in <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> and in <b>the</b> substrate area under <b>the</b> <b>coating.</b> A thermodynamic analysis of the system showed the potential existence of aluminium carbide Al 4 C 3 in <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> whereas <b>the</b> EDS analysis indicated a possible occurrence of aluminium oxycarbides in <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> containing TiB 2, TiC and Al. An additional thermal analysis explained the existence of two separate exothermic peaks, on the basis of which it could be inferred that the precipitation of phase Mg 2 Si, which is a typical precipitate in aluminium alloy 6082, occurred. Microhardness measurements confirmed the differences in the hardness of <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> resulting from different energy input during <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> process. Due to the thermal effect of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> process and <b>the</b> rapid cooling of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> and <b>the</b> coating-substrate interface, microstructural changes occurred on the substrate surface under <b>the</b> <b>coating.</b> <b>The</b> modified microstructure under <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> resulted in reduced hardness, which could be attributed {{to the use of the}} alloys in the precipitation-hardened state.

Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the <b>coat.</b> <b>The</b> African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} Co–P-CNT <b>coating</b> on <b>the</b> {{magnetic}} properties of grain oriented electrical steel was investigated. To analyse <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> Raman spectroscopy, Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID), single strip testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and talysurf surface profilometry were performed.

30|$|Herein, we {{prepared}} the MoS 2 /ZnO heterostructures by <b>coating</b> <b>the</b> tunable ZnO layers {{onto the surface}} of flower-like MoS 2 nanoparticles with facile methods.

After ZnO <b>coating,</b> <b>the</b> adsorption capacity is decreasing and the photocatalytic ability is increasing. And hence the relationship between the surface adsorption and photocatalytic degradation was discussed in detail.|$|R
5|$|With a liver-and-white or {{black-and-white}} <b>coat,</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk Spaniel {{was described}} as being a large cocker spaniel. The Spaniel Club set out a breed standard for Norfolk Spaniels, but specimens of the breed varied greatly across England. Members of the breed were difficult to train, but formed a strong attachment with their owners and were useful for hunting both on land and in water. The breed ceased to exist after 1903, when it was rolled into the new English Springer Spaniel breed created by The Kennel Club to contain all spaniels of this type.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted <b>coat,</b> <b>the</b> battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (<b>coat)</b> <b>the</b> surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E

30|$|Also, for <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> on <b>the</b> black {{background}} between 600 and 900  nm, {{the recorded}} intensity {{is higher than}} the background reflectance.
