50|$|A caisson is sunk by self-weight, {{concrete}} {{or water}} ballast placed on top, or by hydraulic jacks. The leading edge (or cutting shoe) of the caisson is sloped {{out at a}} sharp angle to aid sinking in a vertical manner; it is usually made of steel. The shoe is generally wider than the caisson to reduce friction, and the leading edge may be supplied with pressurised bentonite slurry, which swells in water, stabilizing settlement by filling depressions and voids. An open caisson may fill with water during sinking. The material is excavated by <b>clamshell</b> <b>excavator</b> bucket on crane.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{permeable}} reactive barriers (PRB) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widespread techniques for the remediation of contaminated aquifers. Over the past 10 years, the use of iron-based PRBs has evolved from innovative to accepted standard practice for the treatment of a variety of groundwater contaminants (ITRC in: Permeable reactive barriers: lessons learned/new directions. The Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council, Permeable Reactive Barriers Team 2005). Although, a variety of excavation methods have been developed, backhoe excavators are often used for the construction of PRBs. The aim of this study is to describe the emplacement of a full-scale PRB and the benefits deriving from the use of a crawler crane equipped with a hydraulic grab (also known as <b>clamshell</b> <b>excavator)</b> in the excavation phases. The studied PRB was designed to remediate a chlorinated hydrocarbons plume at an old industrial landfill site, in Avigliana, near the city of Torino, in Italy. The continuous reactive barrier was designed to be 120 m long, 13 m deep, and 0. 6 m thick. The installation of the barrier was accomplished using a clamshell for the excavation of the trench and a guar-gum slurry to support the walls. The performance of this technique was outstanding and allowed the installation of the PRB in 7 days. The degree of precision of the excavation was very high because of the intrinsic characteristics of this excavation tool and of the use of a concrete curb to guide the hydraulic grab. Moreover, the adopted technique permitted a saving of bioslurry thus minimizing the amount of biocide required...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} solutions for the remediation of contaminated aquifers. Although, a variety of excavation methods have been developed, backhoe (hydraulic excavators) are commonly used for the construction of PRBs in North America. Approach: In Europe, the most common method of slurry excavation is with a hydraulic grab and crane. The aim of this study is to compare clamshell and backhoe excavation techniques and to describe the installation of a full scale PRB using a crawler crane equipped with a hydraulic grab. Results: Backhoes have been used on a larger number of PRB installations and permit a rapid rate of excavation and generally require less skill to master. Long stick backhoes are capable of digging as deep as 30 m. Instead, <b>clamshell</b> <b>excavators</b> require more skill to use, but are able to excavate to a depth of more than 70 m, with a high degree of precision. Two similar case studies are presented to compare the relative merits of the two excavation techniques. Conclusion/Recommendations: The first describes a funnel and gate system excavated by long stick backhoe, in the US, whose longest gate is 0. 73 m thick, 68 m long and up to 13 m deep. The latter is a 0. 6 m thick, 120 m long and 13 m deep continuous PRB, excavated by crane mounted grab to remediate a chlorinated hydrocarbons plume, in Avigliana, near the city of Torino, in Italy. Comparison of the two techniques is performed on the availability of instrumentation, excavation power and precision, potential for cost savings...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{excavation}} methods {{for the construction}} of tunnels in urban areas are the â€˜cut and cover' method and the traditional method of excavation at the tunnel face. The first method is usually used for works at shallow depths, even though it frequently involves burdensome deviations and shifting of the existing underground plants and networks. It has been used to realise the Underground Railway Link in Turin (Italy), where excavation was made using trench-cutters and clam excavators. The results of a technical-operational comparison between the two techniques are presented in this work, from which the advantages concerning the use of trench-cutters compared to the use of <b>clamshell</b> bucket <b>excavators</b> have been determine...|$|R
