50|$|Crack vaporizes near {{temperature}} 90 °C (194 °F), {{much lower}} than the <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> melting point of 190 °C (374 °F). Whereas <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> cannot be smoked (burns with no effect), crack cocaine when smoked allows for quick absorption into the blood stream, and reaches the brain in 8 seconds. Crack cocaine can also be injected intravenously with the same effect as powder cocaine. However, whereas powder cocaine dissolves in water, crack must be dissolved in an acidic solution such as lemon juice or white vinegar, a process that effectively reverses the original conversion of powder cocaine to crack.|$|E
5000|$|Cocaine {{freebase}} ("white tornado") {{is prepared}} from <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> by extracting the cocaine with an alkaline solution (sodium hydroxide or ammonia) and adding a non-polar solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The mixture separates into two layers, the top solvent layer containing the dissolved cocaine. The solvent is then evaporated leaving almost pure cocaine crystals, white and crumbly like feta (cheese). A solution of <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{can also be}} heated ("cooked") in a pan with baking soda added until a solid [...] "rock" [...] is formed, pieces {{of which can be}} smoked directly (crack cocaine).|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{intranasal}} usage can {{degrade the}} cartilage separating the nostrils (the septum nasi), leading eventually to its complete disappearance.

50|$|In contrast, <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{does not}} {{vaporize}} until heated {{to a much}} higher temperature (about 197 °C), and considerable decomposition/burning occurs at these high temperatures. This effectively destroys some of the cocaine and yields a sharp, acrid, and foul-tasting smoke.|$|E
50|$|As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was {{the only}} company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> a {{prescription}} drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.|$|E
5000|$|Cocaine in its purest form is a white, pearly product. Cocaine {{appearing}} {{in powder form}} is a salt, typically <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Street cocaine is often adulterated or [...] "cut" [...] with talc, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol, caffeine, procaine, phencyclidine, phenytoin, lignocaine, strychnine, amphetamine, or heroin.|$|E
50|$|Crack is a lower purity form of free-base cocaine that {{is usually}} {{produced}} by neutralization of <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> with a solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and water, producing a very hard/brittle, off-white-to-brown colored, amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate, entrapped water, and other by-products as the main impurities.|$|E

5000|$|Freebasing {{is a more}} {{efficient}} method of self-administering alkaloids via the smoking route. For example, <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> decomposes at the high temperatures necessary for smoking. Free base cocaine, in which the cocaine alkaloid is [...] "freed" [...] from the hydrochloride salt, has a melting point of 98 ℃ and is volatile at temperatures above 90 ℃, therefore providing an active drug for smoking. The free base form of an alkaloid is more lipid-soluble and crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily, thus having a faster and stronger [...] "impact" [...] or [...] "kick", which is comparable to intravenous injection. Extraction kits for converting the hydrochloride to the base are commercially available. Freebasing also tends to remove water-soluble impurities and adulterants such as sugars (lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol), which are often added to street cocaine. Cocaine freebase is only slightly soluble in water (1 in 600 of water) {{as compared to the}} high solubility of <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (1 in 0.5 of water).|$|E

50|$|As a result, Bolivian lab {{operators}} {{are now using}} inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and sodium bicarbonate instead of ammonia and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel are even used in place of solvents. Manufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less cocaine alkaloid is extracted from the leaf, producing less <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Speedball (also {{referred}} to as powerballing) is a term commonly referring to the (sometimes intravenous) use of cocaine with heroin or morphine (if intravenously, in the same syringe). The speedball can also be taken by insufflation. The original speedball used <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> mixed with morphine sulfate, as opposed to heroin. The term can also be applied to use of pharmaceutical opioids, benzodiazepines or barbiturates along with stimulants. However, since opioids and sedative-hypnotics have different objective and subjective effects, stimulant-depressant mixtures are known by the slang term [...] "set up" [...] A cocktail of drugs containing an opioid can cause a strong physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff {{under the influence of}} <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest.|$|E
50|$|Coca paste (paco, basuco, oxi) is a crude extract of the {{coca leaf}} which {{contains}} 40% to 91% cocaine sulfate along with companion coca alkaloids and varying quantities of benzoic acid, methanol, and kerosene. In South America, coca paste, {{also known as}} cocaine base and, therefore, often confused with cocaine freebase in North America, is relatively inexpensive and is widely used by low-income populations. The coca paste is smoked in tobacco or cannabis cigarettes and use has become widespread in several Latin American countries. Traditionally, coca paste has been relatively abundant in South American countries such as Colombia where it is processed into <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> ("street cocaine") for distribution {{to the rest of}} the world. The caustic reactions associated with the local application of coca paste prevents its use by oral, intranasal, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Coca paste can only be smoked when combined with a very inflammable material such as tobacco or cannabis.|$|E
5000|$|Crack cocaine is {{frequently}} purchased already in rock form, {{although it is}} not uncommon for some users to [...] "wash up" [...] or [...] "cook" [...] powder cocaine into crack themselves. This process {{is frequently}} done with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), water, and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine, forming free base cocaine and carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Loss of CO2 prevents the reaction from reversing back to <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Free base cocaine separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape.|$|E
5000|$|The drug—usually (but not always) in {{a powder}} or crystal form—is {{dissolved}} in water, normally in a spoon, tin, bottle cap, {{the bottom of}} a soda can, or another metal container. Cylindrical metal containers—sometimes called [...] "cookers"—are provided by needle exchange programs. Users draw the required amount of water into a syringe and squirt this over the drugs. The solution is then mixed and heated from below if necessary. Heating is used mainly with heroin (though not always, {{depending on the type of}} heroin), but is also often used with other drugs, especially crushed tablets. Cocaine HCl (powdered cocaine) dissolves quite easily without heat. Heroin prepared for the European market is insoluble in water and usually requires the addition of an acid such as citric acid or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) powder to dissolve the drug. Due to the dangers from using lemon juice or vinegar to acidify the solution, packets of citric acid and Vitamin C powder are available at needle exchanges in Europe. In the U.S., vinegar and lemon juice are used to shoot crack cocaine. The acids convert the water-insoluble cocaine base in crack to a cocaine salt (cocaine acetate or cocaine citrate), which is water-soluble (like <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Then, {{driven by}} the 1986 cocaine {{overdose}} of black basketball star Len Bias, Reagan was able to pass the Anti-Drug Abuse Act through Congress. This legislation appropriated an additional $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs. More importantly, it established 29 new, mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. In {{the entire history of}} the country up until that point, the legal system had only seen 55 minimum sentences in total. A major stipulation of the new sentencing rules included different mandatory minimums for powder and crack cocaine. At the time of the bill, there was public debate as to the difference in potency and effect of powder cocaine, generally used by whites, and crack cocaine, generally used by blacks, with many believing that [...] "crack" [...] was substantially more powerful and addictive. Crack and powder cocaine are closely related chemicals, crack being a smokeable, freebase form of powdered <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> which produces a shorter, more intense high while using less of the drug. This method is more cost effective, and therefore more prevalent on the inner-city streets, while powder cocaine remains more popular in white suburbia. The Reagan administration began shoring public opinion against [...] "crack", encouraging DEA official Robert Putnam to play up the harmful effects of the drug. Stories of [...] "crack whores" [...] and [...] "crack babies" [...] became commonplace; by 1986, Time had declared [...] "crack" [...] the issue of the year. Riding the wave of public fervor, Reagan established much harsher sentencing for crack cocaine, handing down stiffer felony penalties for much smaller amounts of the drug.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence {{and patterns of}} use of crack and <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> among heroin users in Spain. To explore if the expansion of heroin smoking {{is accompanied by a}} similar phenomenon for cocaine. DESIGN: Cross sectional study in 1995. Face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. SETTING: Three cities with different prevalences of heroin use by smoking: high (Seville), intermediate (Madrid), and low (Barcelona). PARTICIPANTS: 909 heroin users, 452 in treatment and 457 out of treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Last month prevalence of crack use was 62. 3 % in Seville, 19. 4 % in Madrid, and 7. 7 % in Barcelona. Most users in Madrid (86. 5 %) and Barcelona (100 %) generally prepared their own crack, usually with ammonia as alkali; in Seville most users (69. 7 %) bought preprocessed crack. The proportion of users who began taking cocaine (crack or <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> by smoking has increased progressively since the seventies, rising to 74. 1 % in Seville, 61. 5 % in Madrid, and 28 % in Barcelona in 1992 - 1995, with the earliest increase in Seville. The factors associated with crack use were: residence in Seville (odds ratio (OR) = 16. 3), <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> use mainly by smoking (OR = 5. 0), by sniffing (OR = 2. 7) or by injecting (OR = 2. 5), heroin use mainly by smoking (OR = 2. 8) and weekly use of cannabis (OR = 1. 9). CONCLUSIONS: In Spain smoking cocaine may be progressively diffusing from the south west to the north east, similar to what has happened with smoking heroin, but beginning later in time. The factors associated with smoking cocaine are basically ecological or cultural in nature (characteristics of the available drugs and the main route of heroin administration in each city) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent times}} several new {{products}} {{have been prepared}} from the quinine complex mainly by altering the vinyl and methoxy groups. The present paper is concerned with {{certain aspects of the}} mode of action of some of these products introduced first by Morgenroth in 1917 (1). Hydroquinine, from which most of the newer and more valuable derivatives are formed, has the vinyl group CH = CH 2 converted into CH 2 = CH 3. Ethyl hydrocu-preine is hydroquinine in which the methoxy group OCH 3 is changed to OC 2 H 5, and by substituting the higher homologues we can obtain the isopropyl, isoamyl and isooctyl hydrocupreines. In these experiments the following derivatives were used: salts of quinine, quitenine, isopropyl hydrocupreine, benzoyl isopropyl hyd,rocupreine, isoamyl hyrocupreine, benzoyl isoamyl hydrocupreine, eucupinotoxin (isomeric with isoamyl hydrocu-preine), isooctyl hydrocupreine and allyl hydrocupreine. ’ All these alkaloids produce when applied to the cornea or in-jected subcutaneously, local anaesthesia to a larger or smaller degree. This effect is so pronounced that Morgenroth stated that eucupinotoxin is 40 to 50 times more active weight for weight than <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (2) and Copeland (3) estimated that the borate of isoamyl hydrocupreine is 60 times more effective than <b>cocaine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Nevertheless it is easy to show that these derivatives differ from cocaine or any of its substitutes in that they do not paralyse nerve fibres of mammals, motor, ‘We are indebted to Howards and Sons for supplying us with these compounds...|$|E
