5|$|Due to the {{participation}} of the three Smolensk regiments, Russians saw the battle as a victory of a Polish–Lithuanian–Russian coalition against invading Germans. Chronicler Jan Długosz praised the Smolensk banners, who fought bravely and were the only banners from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not to retreat. In Soviet historiography, the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics. The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler's armies, while the battle itself was seen as the medieval <b>counterpart</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Enrichto's role in Pharsalia {{has often}} been {{discussed}} by classicists and literary scholars, with many arguing that she serves as a antithesis and <b>counterpart</b> <b>to</b> Virgil's Cumaean Sibyl, a pious prophetess who appears in his work the Aeneid. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante Aligheri referenced her in his Divine Comedy (wherein it is revealed that she once commanded Virgil to retrieve a soul from the lowest circle of Hell). She also makes appearances in both Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 18th century play, Faust, as well as John Marston's Jacobean play The Tragedy of Sophonisba.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Gravitational wave (GW) bursts (short {{duration}} signals) {{are expected}} to be associated with highly energetic astrophysical processes. With such high energies present, it is likely these astrophysical events will have signatures in the EM spectrum as well as in gravitational radiation. We have initiated a program, “Locating and Observing Optical <b>Counterparts</b> <b>to</b> Unmodeled Pulses in Gravitational Waves ” (LOOC UP) to promptly search for <b>counterparts</b> <b>to</b> GW burst candidates. The proposed method analyzes near real-time data from the LIGO-Virgo network, and then uses a telescope network <b>to</b> seek optical-transient <b>counterparts</b> <b>to</b> candidate GW signals. We carried out a pilot study in the summer of 2007 to develop methods and software tools for such a search. We will present the method, with an emphasis on the potential for such a search to be carried out during the next science run of LIGO and Virgo, expected to begin in 2009. PACS numbers: 95. 55.

The trophy features a golden eagle, the league's emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and clutching the American League banner. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The Houston Astros are the current holders of the Harridge Trophy in honor of their 2017 American League championship, after defeating The New York Yankees. Unlike its National League counterpart, a new trophy is awarded each year.|$|E

On April 13, 2009, the title was moved from SmackDown to Raw {{as a result of}} then Divas Champion Maryse being drafted to Raw in the 2009 WWE draft. On September 19, 2010, at the Night of Champions pay-per-view event, Michelle McCool (defending the Women's Championship on behalf of tag team partner and official champion, Layla) defeated Divas Champion Melina, retiring the Women's Championship and unifying it with the Divas Championship.|$|E

5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes <b>counterpart</b> <b>to</b> the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|Following Lego Racers success, news {{arose in}} April 2001 that Pocket Studios {{was working on}} a sequel to the Game Boy Advance version of Lego Racers, titled Lego Racers 2, which was then shown at E3 2001 in May that year. The eponymous Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 <b>counterpart</b> <b>to</b> Lego Racers 2, {{developed}} by Attention to Detail, was announced in August 2001, and released in September 2001. The sequel followed up immediately after Rocket Racer's deafeat in Lego Racers, who is shown a new opportunity to reclaim his title as world champion, by travelling to Xalax and prove himself worthy of it. After Rocket Racer proceeds to do so and succeeds, the player is tasked to control their self-built protagonist, racing through various worlds based on Lego themes, and eventually face Rocket Racer again. Lego Racers 2 was received less favorably than Lego Racers, and too far incorporated elements from both, Lego Racers and Rollcage, another game developed by Attention to Detail.|$|E
