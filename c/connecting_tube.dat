500|$|In tetrapods, the pharynx is much shorter, and the {{esophagus}} correspondingly longer, than in fish. In {{the majority of}} vertebrates, {{the esophagus}} is simply a <b>connecting</b> <b>tube,</b> but in some birds, which regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach.

2500|$|Like that of {{the spider}} order, the Araneae, the body plan of the Solifugae has two main tagmata: the prosoma, or cephalothorax, is the {{anterior}} tagma, and the 10-segmented abdomen, or opisthosoma, is the posterior tagma.

5000|$|The actual {{construction}} of the Icyball is slightly more complex than described above, to improve the efficiency: The <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> runs to {{the lower part of}} the warm ball, allowing the ammonia vapor to bubble through the water speeding absorption, and also serving to stir the solution so heat is better transported to the finned walls. This [...] "bubbler" [...] was bypassed by a liquid (no moving parts) check-valve during regeneration, so that only gas, and not liquid solution was transferred to the cold side. The operation of the liquid check valve was somewhat similar to the water seals (J-traps) used in plumbing drains. Mechanical check valves require too much pressure to function properly in this application. To minimize the amount of water transferred to the cold ball during the recharge cycle, trapping structures were placed in the upper part of the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube,</b> allowing only gas to pass, and directing water back to the warm side ball.|$|E

50|$|As {{observed}} by Springer Healthcare, The main {{advantage of the}} Omnipod System is the freedom it grants its users. Contrary to previous pump technology, it contains no external tubing. Insulin is pumped directly from the reservoir into the imbedded cannula, removing {{the need for a}} <b>connecting</b> <b>tube.</b> Having a patch style pump eliminates many worries that most pump wearers have to think about. The all-in-one style of the Omnipod allows the user to wear their pump at all times, even without clothing. They don’t have to worry about clipping it onto their belt or pants, so it can be worn at all times. Also, this means that any form of physical activity can also be performed while still wearing the pump; It is even waterproof up to 25 feet. Since the pump user doesn’t have to disconnect their pump for common activities, they will consistently receive insulin and have better control over their blood sugars.|$|E

50|$|Every toy balloon has {{an opening}} (or mouth) through which gases are blown into it, {{followed}} by a <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> known as the neck. Balloons are usually filled by using one's breath, a pump, or a pressurized gas tank. The opening can then be permanently tied off or clamped temporarily. Foil balloons are typically self-sealing. By filling a balloon with a gas lighter than air, such as helium, the balloon {{can be made to}} float. Helium is the preferred gas for floating balloons, because it is inert and will not catch fire (like hydrogen) or cause toxic effects when inhaled. Small, light objects (postcards, in balloon mail for example) are sometimes placed in balloons along with helium and released into the air and, when the balloon eventually falls, the object inside might be found by another person. Rubber balloons can also be filled with liquids (usually water) and can burst when they impact a solid object. Liquid-filled balloons are commonly referred to as water balloons or water bombs and used in playful fights, and sometimes vandalism.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{operation}} of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement {{at the opposite end}} of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic fluid path, providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a suspension component which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal brake line tubing, and the brake at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that braided stainless steel hose is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1917 {{there were}} {{available}} {{several types of}} instruments for measuring and recording pressures internal combustion engine cylinders. Some of these were refinements of the conventional pressure indicator designed for low-speed steam engines while others were designed primarily for high-speed work {{with a view of}} minimizing the effects of inertia. These instruments were found to be useful for various classes of work, depending on theirdesign and characteristics, although none of them had found more than very limited application in a comparatively few laboratories. Some of the inherent difficulties which have prevented the development of a wholly convenient and successful high-speed indicator are inertia, friction, and backlash in moving parts where mechanical means of recording are adopted; inertia and vibration of the system when a photographic method of magnification is applied to an instrument mounted on the engine; time lag of the gases in the <b>connecting</b> <b>tube</b> where a photographic apparatus is mounted independently of the engine and connects to it by a flexible tube; as well as the usual mechanical difficulties in the construction and operation of instruments of this class. It is noted that these difficulties are increased {{in the case of the}} aircraft engine, which usually must be mounted on a more or less flexible stand and in which at best the mechanical vibrations of the parts are excessive, due to their light weight and lack ofrigidity. An important mechanical consequence of this excessive flexibility of the engine structure seems to have been overlooked, since it has not been discussed in the literature or taken account of other than accidentally in design of any indicator. To illustrate this effect, assume an indicator whose moving parts are mounted on the head of an engine cyIinder. In order to reduce the effect of inertia, the range of motion of the piston or diaphragm is reduced as much as practicable and the motion magnified either mechanically or optically so as to give a readable scale. It should be noted that the motion actually recorded is always the relative motion between the movable part of the indicator and the (supposeclIy) fixed partmounted rigidly on the cylinder head. But if the cylinder head itself flexes under pressure or mechanical vibration, this motion of the fixed support relative to the movable piston is recorded and magnified as well as the motion of the piston relative to its support. Hence it may happen that thus limiting the range of motion of the piston or heavy diaphragm and greatly magnifying the record, increases the bad effects of inertia. on a light flexible engine cylinder since the motions of the cylinder head itself, relative to the moving member, are subject to the same degree of magnification.|$|E
