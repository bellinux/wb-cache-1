40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the <b>co-benefits</b> of clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) projects, and further to discuss the policy of its implications. It {{has been found that}} many energy-related climate change mitigation (CCM) activities, including CDM projects, are able to produce a significant amount of <b>co-benefits,</b> while the policy implications have been limited. Through <b>co-benefits</b> assessment of Chinese CDM projects, it can be concluded that: (1) there are uncertainties relating to <b>co-benefits</b> assessment; (2) <b>co-benefits</b> assessment can be only applied to energy related projects (ERPs) and not to HFC 23 decomposition projects; (3) hydropower and wind power projects are the largest contributors to cobenefits.

Through a discussion about policy implications of <b>co-benefits,</b> this paper suggest that <b>co-benefits</b> should neither be involved into current international CCM negotiation, nor used to ensure projects’ contribution to sustainable development. However, <b>co-benefits</b> analysis can indicate synergies or optimised trade-offs between CCM and protecting local environment, which is valuable for decision-making in developing countries, especially for local governments.

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{warming and}} air {{pollution}} are of great concerns in China due to the rapid industrialization. Iron and steel industry accounts for the largest industrial source of Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and emits a lot of local air pollutants (NOx, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and SO 2). Multiple energy conservation technologies have been promoted by Chinese government to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on the national China-TIMES model, the Base scenario and two carbon constraint scenarios are formulated, to assess the emission reduction potentials and the <b>co-benefit</b> effects for these promoted technologies in the iron and steel industry. The results are as follows: the emissions of CO 2 and SO 2 will reach the peak in 2015; and the emissions will be 1264 Mt and 2. 79 Mt, and then keep decreasing to 244 Mt and 0. 43 Mt in 2050, other local air pollutants will keep declining during 2010 ∼ 2050. The CO 2 reduction potential is about 45. 7 Mt∼ 91. 6 Mt, in which the coke-making, iron-making and casting processes have the largest contribution to this. The emissions of local air pollutants will be reduced significantly under the two CO 2 emission reduction scenarios.

40|$|Why do climate <b>co-benefits</b> {{matter for}} cities? • The {{evidence}} suggests that citizens {{are more likely to}} take action on climate change, or more likely to support governments that take action on climate change, if the wider <b>co-benefits</b> of those actions are emphasised. • At the same time, policies that are aimed at supporting innovation, delivering economic benefits and enhancing {{the quality of life of}} citizens can potentially lead to major climate cobenefits (e. g. reduced greenhouse gas emissions) which would be more challenging to achieve if climate action were the primary objective. • At the city level, the potential of <b>co-benefits</b> is particularly great as citizens can often witness the results of policy actions more directly on their daily lives. Definition and taxonomy of <b>co-benefits</b> • The term <b>co-benefits</b> has a wide range of definitions in the climate literature, with over 20 terms identified in the literature that are used synonymously or in a similar context. • The term <b>co-benefits</b> varies in intentionality (e. g. is climate the primary or secondary objective, or simply an unintentional benefit?), scope (e. g. does it include mitigation benefits, adaptation benefits or both?), and scale (e. g. are the benefits short term and local, or long term and global?). • <b>Co-benefits</b> may be (1) secondary benefits from climate policy action, (2) secondary climate benefits from other policy actions, or (3) the combination of climate and non-climate benefits; both of which are targeted under an integrated policy programme. • The wide range of established definitions of <b>co-benefits</b> used by authoritative organisations means that formulating a taxonomy of <b>co-benefits</b> with broad buy-in from policy makers is challenging. Results of literature review • Health, Land Use and Transport were the top three sectors for the number of <b>co-benefits,</b> with over 40 <b>co-benefits</b> identified in each. • Waste, Air Quality, Transport and Energy had particularly high numbers of mitigation cobenefits in the literature reviewed.

However, to achieve biodiversity <b>co-benefits,</b> carbon payments often require support from other policy mechanisms(2) such as regulation(3, 4), targeting(5, 6), and complementary incentives(7, 8). We evaluated 14 policy mechanisms for supplying carbon and biodiversity <b>co-benefits</b> through reforestation of carbon plantings (CP) and environmental plantings (EP) in Australia's 85. 3 Mha agricultural land under global change. The reference policy-uniform payments (bidders are paid the same price) with land-use competition (both CP and EP eligible for payments), targeting carbon-achieved significant carbon sequestration but negligible biodiversity <b>co-benefits.</b> Land-use regulation (only EP eligible) and two additional incentives complementing the reference policy (biodiversity premium, carbon levy) increased biodiversity <b>co-benefits,</b> but mostly inefficiently.

40|$|An {{innovative}} approach is introduced for helping {{developing countries to}} make their development more sustainable, and also to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a <b>co-benefit.</b> Such an approach is proposed {{as part of the}} multilateral framework on climate change. The concept of sustainable development policies and measures (SD-PAMs) is outlined, making clear that it is distinct from many other approaches in starting from development rather than explicit climate targets. The potential of SD-PAMs is illustrated with a case-study of energy efficiency in South Africa, drawing on energy modelling for the use of electricity in industry. The results show multiple benefits both for local sustainable development and for mitigating global climate change. The benefits of industrial energy efficiency in South Africa include significant reductions in local air pollutants; improved environmental health; creation of additional jobs; reduced electricity demand; and delays in new investments in electricity generation. The <b>co-benefit</b> of reducing GHG emissions could result in a reduction of as much as 5 % of SA’s total projected energy CO 2 emissions by 2020. Institutional support and policy guidance is needed at both the international and national level to realize the potential of SD-PAMs. This analysis demonstrates that if countries begin to act early to move towards greater sustainability, they will also start to bend the curve of their emissions path...|$|E

40|$|Policies to {{mitigate}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{will not only}} slow climate change but can also have ancillary benefits of improved air quality. Here we examine the <b>co-benefits</b> of both global and regional GHG mitigation for US air quality in 2050 at fine resolution, using dynamical downscaling methods, building on a previous global <b>co-benefits</b> study (West et al., 2013). The <b>co-benefits</b> for US air quality are quantified via two mechanisms: through reductions in co-emitted air pollutants from the same sources and by slowing climate change and its influence on air quality, following West et al.  (2013). Additionally, we separate the total <b>co-benefits</b> into contributions from domestic GHG mitigation vs. mitigation in foreign countries. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to dynamically downscale future global climate to the regional scale and the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) program to directly process global anthropogenic emissions to the regional domain, and we provide dynamical boundary conditions from global simulations to the regional Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The total <b>co-benefits</b> of global GHG mitigation from the RCP 4. 5 scenario compared with its reference {{are estimated to be}} higher in the eastern US (ranging from 0. 6 to 1. 0  µg m − 3) than the west (0 – 0. 4  µg m − 3) for fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), with an average of 0. 47  µg m − 3 over the US; for O 3, the total <b>co-benefits</b> are more uniform at 2 – 5  ppb, with a US average of 3. 55  ppb. Comparing the two mechanisms of <b>co-benefits,</b> we find that reductions in co-emitted air pollutants have a much greater influence on both PM 2. 5 (96  % of the total <b>co-benefits)</b> and O 3 (89  % of the total) than the second <b>co-benefits</b> mechanism via slowing climate change, consistent with West et al.  (2013). GHG mitigation from foreign countries contributes more to the US O 3 reduction (76  % of the total) than that from domestic GHG mitigation only (24  %), highlighting the importance of global methane reductions and the intercontinental transport of air pollutants. For PM 2. 5, the benefits of domestic GHG control are greater (74  % of total). Since foreign contributions to <b>co-benefits</b> can be substantial, with foreign O 3 benefits much larger than those from domestic reductions, previous studies that focus on local or regional <b>co-benefits</b> may greatly underestimate the total <b>co-benefits</b> of global GHG reductions.

However, sustainability of these projects {{in terms of their}} co-benefits at urban level is not well clear. Therefore, the aim of this research is to contribute towards a comprehensive sustainability assessment of EU Smart and Sustainable Energy District Projects, considering co-benefits (social, economic, environmental and institutional benefits). To achieve this aim, a database of Smart and Sustainable Energy District Projects funded by EU Framework Programs 6 and 7 is established.

40|$|Impacts {{of climate}} change require that society {{urgently}} develops ways to reduce amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. Tropical forests present an important opportunity, as they take up and store large amounts of carbon. It is often suggested that forests with high biodiversity have large stocks and high rates of carbon uptake. Evidence is, however, scattered across geographic areas and scales, and it remains unclear whether biodiversity is just a <b>co-benefit</b> or also a requirement {{for the maintenance of}} carbon stocks and uptake. Here, we perform a quantitative review of empirical studies that analyzed the relationships between plant biodiversity attributes and carbon stocks and carbon uptake in tropical forests. Our results show that biodiversity attributes related to species, traits or structure significantly affect carbon stocks or uptake in 64 % of the evaluated relationships. Average vegetation attributes (community-mean traits and structural attributes) are more important for carbon stocks, whereas variability in vegetation attributes (i. e., taxonomic diversity) is important for both carbon stocks and uptake. Thus, different attributes of biodiversity have complementary effects on carbon stocks and uptake. These biodiversity effects tend to be more often significant in mature forests at broad spatial scales than in disturbed forests at local spatial scales. Biodiversity effects are also more often significant when confounding variables are not included in the analyses, highlighting the importance of performing a comprehensive analysis that adequately accounts for environmental drivers. In summary, biodiversity is not only a <b>co-benefit,</b> but also a requirement for short- and long-term maintenance of carbon stocks and enhancement of uptake. Climate change policies should therefore include the maintenance of multiple attributes of biodiversity as an essential requirement to achieve long-term climate change mitigation goals...|$|E

Since 2008 Thai government has proposed the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) {{for renewable energy}} utilization. Results from energy efficiency measures indicate total cost saving of 1. 34 % and cumulative CO 2 emission reduction of 59 Mt-CO 2 in 2030 {{when compared to the}} business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. It was found that subsidies in the AEDP will promote renewable energy utilization and provide substantial CO 2 mitigation. As a <b>co-benefit,</b> fuel import vulnerability can be improved by 27. 31 % and 14. 27 % for CO 2 reduction targets of 20 % and 40 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Actions {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions often reduce co-emitted air pollutants, bringing <b>co-benefits</b> for air quality and human health. Past studies 1 – 6 typically evaluated near-term and local <b>co-benefits,</b> neglecting the long-range transport of air pollutants 7 – 9, long-term demographic changes, {{and the influence}} of climate change on air quality 10 – 12. Here we simulate the <b>co-benefits</b> of global GHG reductions on air quality and human health using a global atmospheric model and consistent future scenarios, via two mechanisms: a) reducing co-emitted air pollutants, and b) slowing climate change and its effect on air quality. We use new relationships between chronic mortality and exposure to fine particulate matter 13 and ozone 14, global modeling methods 15, and new future scenarios 16. Relative to a reference scenario, global GHG mitigation avoids 0. 5 ± 0. 2, 1. 3 ± 0. 5, and 2. 2 ± 0. 8 million premature deaths in 2030, 2050, and 2100. Global average marginal <b>co-benefits</b> of avoided mortality are $ 50 – 380 (ton CO 2) − 1, which exceed previous estimates, exceed marginal abatement costs in 2030 and 2050, and are within the low range of costs in 2100. East Asian <b>co-benefits</b> are 10 – 70 times the marginal cost in 2030. Air quality and health <b>co-benefits,</b> especially as they are mainly local and near-term, provide stron...|$|R
2500|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and other sustainability improvements for low-income households have external benefits as well. [...] Governments, energy-providers, property owners, and taxpayers all experience direct financial, indirect financial, {{and social welfare}} and livelihood <b>co-benefits</b> from green affordable housing projects. The improved quality and energy efficiency of these projects result in direct financial benefit {{in the form of}} reduced energy bills, reduced outlays for assistance to low-income households, reduced rates of shut-offs and thus reduced related administrative costs. Indirect financial <b>co-benefits</b> accrue to residents, property owners and tax-payers and society as a whole. Examples of these <b>co-benefits</b> are increased property values and economic activity, increased home and fire safety and reduced involuntary mobility for low-income households. Potential <b>co-benefits</b> for social welfare and livelihood include improved comfort, health and safety for the residents, community pride and improved health outcomes.|$|R
40|$|Land use {{changes to}} {{sequester}} carbon also provide "co-benefits," {{some of which}} (for example, water quality) have attracted {{at least as much}} attention as carbon storage. The non-separability of these <b>co-benefits</b> presents a challenge for policy design. If carbon markets are employed, then social efficiency will depend on how we take into account <b>co-benefits,</b> that is, externalities, in such markets. If carbon sequestration is incorporated into conservation programs, then the weight given to carbon sequestration relative to its <b>co-benefits</b> will partly shape these programs. Using the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) as an example, we show that CRP has been sequestering carbon, which was not an intended objective of the program. We also demonstrate that more carbon would have been sequestered had CRP targeted this objective, although the "co-benefits" would have increased or decreased. carbon sequestration, <b>co-benefits,</b> Conservation Reserve Program. ...|$|R
