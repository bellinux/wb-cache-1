40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of answering devices, acoustic couplers, personal custom telephones, intercom systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the specialized common carriers are beyond the scope of this project. The specialized common <b>carrier</b> <b>area</b> is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|E
40|$|Treating nitrogen-rich reject {{water from}} anaerobically digested sludge with deammonification {{has become a}} very {{beneficial}} side stream process. One common technique is the one-stage moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs), which {{in comparison with the}} other deammonification techniques can be started up without seeding anammox bacteria. This study investigated the impact of biofilm seeding on the start-up of one-stage deammonification MBBRs. Two lab-scale reactors were run in parallel with partial nitritation for 56 days until 11 % of the <b>carrier</b> <b>area</b> in one reactor was replaced with fully developed deammonification biofilm to work as the seeding material. The seeded reactor started nitrogen reduction immediately up to a plateau of 1. 3 g N m(- 2) d(- 1); after another 54 days on day 110, the reduction significantly increased. At the same time, the non-seeded reactor also started to reduce nitrogen due to deammonification. The development was followed with both nitrogen analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. On day 134, the biofilm in both reactors contained> 90 % anammox bacteria and reached maximum nitrogen removal rates of 7. 5 and 5. 6 g N m(- 2) d(- 1) in the seeded and non-seeded reactor, respectively. Over 80 % of the inorganic nitrogen was reduced. In conclusion, the seeding did not contribute to a shorter start-up time or the achieved anammox enrichment, although it did contribute to a partial, immediate nitrogen reduction. The boundary conditions are the most important factors for a successful start-up in a deammonification MBBR system...|$|E
40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEGs) {{are solid}} state devices (no moving parts) that directly convert thermal energy into electrical energy utilizing thermoelectric phenomena {{known as the}} Seebeck and Peltier effect. TEGs have been studied over the past 100 years as a possible energy generation and cooling technology. Interest in TEGs has become considerably popular in the last 10 - 15 years due to the awareness of climate change, environmental issues, and advancement in material fabrication. TEGs can recover energy from waste heat, the byproduct of many industrial/commercial processes, an example of which is automobiles, where waste heat accounts for ~ 30 % of energy losses. However, relatively low efficiencies have limited TEG application to niche areas. Significant increase in the efficiency is necessary before TEGs can be implemented in widespread applications. In this work, the effects of scaling the dimensions of a TEG are analyzed using finite element modeling in Synopsys Sentaurus software. Temperature dependent material parameters and a thermodynamic model are utilized to determine the output power and efficiency of Silicon and Silicon Germanium TEGs for dimensions ranging from 1 mm to 5 nm and operating temperatures from 300 K to the melting temperature. The role of minority carriers is examined using TEG designs which utilize built-in electric fields to extract generated minority carriers and transport them to a corresponding majority <b>carrier</b> <b>area.</b> Temperature dependent material parameters are critical for modeling TEG operation at high temperatures. TEGs can be tailored to achieve optimum efficiency and power generation depending upon operating temperature and dimensions. Large aspect ratios at small dimensions exhibit the greatest power density suggesting that nanowire TEGs are a possible option for waste heat recovery. Results show that minority carriers {{are one of the}} TEG performance limitations at higher temperatures. TEG geometries that use PIN junctions are able to extract and transport minority carriers to their corresponding majority carrier leg. Extraction decreases the minority carrier density improving efficiency at higher temperatures due to reduced recombination. If leg widths are scaled down, depletion of majority carriers occurs for lower operating temperatures. Depletion can be minimized by converting PIN junction into PN junctions...|$|E
