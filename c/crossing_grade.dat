With the 'near-side platforms' configuration, each platform appears before the intersection and with 'far-side platforms' they are positioned after the intersection.|$|E
5000|$|A zebra {{crossing}} {{appears on the}} cover of The Beatles' Abbey Road album. It made it a tourist attraction, and it has been incorporated into the Abbey Road Studios logo. Since the Abbey Road photo was taken, zigzag lines at the kerb and in the centre of the road have been added to all {{zebra crossing}}s to indicate the no-stopping zones on either side. The band Shriekback's album Sacred City contains an entire song, [...] "Beatles Zebra Crossing?", about the Abbey Road zebra crossing and its status as a tourist attraction. English Heritage has given this <b>crossing</b> <b>Grade</b> II Listed Building status.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis’ {{reputation}} attracted Miss Janet Jacobs, {{who succeeded}} Helen Moore in 1971. During her tenure, extracurricular activities, field trips, and visiting speakers, artists, and authors took on increased importance. [...] "We serve our students well, {{but we are}} learning to serve them even better," [...] Miss Jacobs said in 1974, announcing a new Ellis dimension - May Mini-Courses for the Upper School, the first program {{of its kind in}} Pittsburgh. This [...] "third semester" [...] {{in the last few weeks}} of the school year offered and continues to offer a curriculum of more than fifty academic and nonacademic courses, <b>crossing</b> <b>grade</b> levels and taught by Ellis teachers, outside experts in various fields, and the occasional student.|$|E

30|$|The {{gradient}} {{is comprised}} of the upstream/downstream gradient (longitudinal gradient) and the left/right gradient (<b>cross</b> <b>grade)</b> {{with respect to the}} traveling direction. The composite gradient refers to the shape of the road surface that includes the <b>cross</b> <b>grade</b> addition to the longitudinal gradient. There is a report that such a gradient becomes a major factor in increasing stroller users’ body burdens and senses of danger [25]. The composite gradient was determined to be the label of the road surface shape in addition to that of the flatness and slope, and considered to be an example of a place recognized subjectively to be difficult to pass through, as it is difficult to be measured by objective criteria. Furthermore, it was expected that problems to the label estimation model would be clarified by adding the composite gradient.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the months}} leading up to SunRail going operational, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) ran an {{aggressive}} public-safety campaign to warn drivers and passengers about railroad safety using pamphlets, puppet shows for children, YouTube and even a Safety Mascot Squirrel named Tie. [...] Despite this effort, SunRail has experienced several accidents with both motorists and pedestrians. Nearly a year into service, officials began installing dial-up <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> systems at <b>grade</b> crossings that are located closest to the stations. This system allows train crews to manually activate <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> warning devices (i.e. crossing gates, lights and bells) from the locomotive cab via key-coded radio transmission, thus eliminating the confusion of the <b>grade</b> <b>crossing</b> warning devices automatically activating, deactivating and reactivating whenever trains approach, stop at and depart the stations.|$|R
