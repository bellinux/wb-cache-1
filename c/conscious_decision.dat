By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E

5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|West made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> {{to abstain}} from the {{widespread}} recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

40|$|According to Unconscious Thought Theory, {{people make}} better {{decisions}} after unconscious than after conscious thought (Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, & van Baaren, 2006 a). Unconscious Thought Theory yields four specific predictions. First, an exact replication of Dijksterhuis et al. (2006 a) study should indicate that unconscious decisions {{are superior to}} <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions.</b> Second, decisions should improve with duration of conscious thought. Third, unconscious decisions should be superior to <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions,</b> even if unconscious decisions are deliberated while having access to information. Fourth, unconscious decisions {{should be based on}} a weighting strategy. We report results of four studies, featuring 480 participants, that yield no evidence in favor of these predictions. Therefore our findings cast doubt on Unconscious Thought Theory and its advice to base decisions on unconscious thought. The results of our studies suggest that it is better to base <b>decisions</b> on <b>conscious</b> thought while having access to information...|$|R

40|$|Subliminal {{manipulation}} {{is often}} considered harmless because its effects typically decay within a second. So far, subliminal long-term effects on behavior were only observed in studies which repeatedly presented highly familiar {{information such as}} single words. These studies suggest that subliminal messages are only slowly stored and might not be stored at all if they provide novel, unfamiliar information. We speculated that subliminal messages might affect delayed decision making especially if messages contain several pieces of novel information that must be relationally bound in long-term memory. Relational binding engages the hippocampal memory system, which can rapidly encode and durably store novel relations. Here, we hypothesized that subliminally presented stimulus pairs would be relationally processed influencing the direction of delayed <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions.</b> In experiment 1, subliminal face-occupation pairs affected <b>conscious</b> <b>decisions</b> about the income of these individuals almost half an hour later. In experiment 2, subliminal presentation of vocabulary of a foreign language enabled participants to later decide whether these foreign words are presented with correct or incorrect translations. Subliminal influence did not significantly decay if probed after 25 vs. 15 minutes. This is unprecedented evidence of the longevity and impact of subliminal messages on <b>conscious,</b> rational <b>decision</b> making...|$|R

25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise {{because of any}} <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E

As the third son, Khurram did not challenge the two major power blocs of the time, his father's and his step-brother's; thus he enjoyed the benefits of Imperial protection and luxury while being allowed to continue with his education and training. This relatively quiet and stable period of his life allowed Khurram to build his own support base in the Mughal court, which would be useful later on in his life.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} might have the opportunity to make a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E

A <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> by the band to write more diverse material, these albums saw a near-complete forfeit of the brass-driven ska of their previous albums {{in favor of more}} guitar and synthesizer-structured songwriting, embracing a punk rock and new wave sound greatly influenced by Devo and Oingo Boingo, two of The Aquabats' biggest inspirations. The band also began widening their genre experimentation to encompass such disparate styles as electronica, synthpop and even hip-hop, elements which persist in their sound to present day.|$|E

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E

At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Apollo is {{a product}} of the late archaic period (530–480 BC) in which the Greek {{sculpture}} attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create an harmonious whole. It is among the very few such bronzes that have survived. The statue seems to differentiate from the previous formality and represents a kind of motion. The symmetry and the analogies of the members are closer to the post-archaic sculpture which gives more emphasis not to the illusive reality but to the analogy and the interaction of each member with the others in the whole. In the last few decades of the 6th century, the philosophical mystic currents were to have a considerable influence on late archaic art. The logical move from Ionian natural philosophy to metaphysics was the <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> of post-archaic mind. In post-archaic period, the illusive imaginative reality was displaced by harmony and symmetry.|$|E
