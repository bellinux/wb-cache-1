25|$|The {{important}} point of Monier's {{idea was that}} it combined steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or <b>crushing</b> <b>strength,</b> but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in tensile or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. But it is difficult and expensive to work up into customized forms. Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of tensile strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the tensile stresses occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|E

In this study, {{the energy}} {{absorption}} capacity and <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> of cylindrical thin-walled structures is investigated using nonlinear Finite Elements code LS-DYNA. For the thin-walled structure, Aluminum A 6063 is used and its behaviour is modeled using power-law equation. In {{order to better}} investigate the performance of tubes, the simulation was also carried out on structures {{with other types of}} cross-sections such as triangle, square, rectangle, and hexagonal, and their results, namely, energy absorption, <b>crush</b> <b>strength,</b> peak load, and the displacement at the end of tubes was compared to each other. It was seen that the circular cross-section has the highest energy absorption capacity and <b>crush</b> <b>strength,</b> while they are the lowest for the triangular cross-section. It was concluded that increasing the number of sides increases the energy absorption capacity and the <b>crush</b> <b>strength.</b> On the other hand, by comparing the results between the square and rectangular cross-sections, it can be found out that eliminating the symmetry of the cross-section decreases the energy absorption capacity and the <b>crush</b> <b>strength.</b> The <b>crush</b> behaviour of the structure was also studied by changing the mass and the velocity of the striker, simultaneously while its total kinetic energy is kept constant. It was seen that the energy absorption of the structure is more sensitive to the striker velocity than its mass...|$|R

40|$|In {{designing}} a package for transporting hazardous or radioactive materials, {{there are a}} number of components whose design can lead to the success or failure to meet regulatory requirements for Type B packages. One of these components is the impact limiter. The primary purpose of the impact limiter is to protect the package and its contents from sudden deceleration. It can also act as a thermal barrier. The package is protected by the impact limiter`s ability to act as an energy absorber. The <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> of most impact limiting materials is determined by a standard quasistatic (QS) method. However it has been observed that {{there are a number}} of factors that affect <b>crush</b> <b>strength.</b> The material being used as an impact limiter may appear incompressible because of one or more of these factors. Factors that determine compressive strength of impact limiter materials are; the material density; the thickness of the impact limiter material. There must be adequate material to absorb the impact and not go into lockup, lockup up occurs when the free volume of the material is eliminated and the <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> sharply increases; the angle of impact; and the loading rate and operating temperature. All of these are interactive and therefore difficult to model. It is the intent of tests discussed in this paper to determine the dependency of <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> to loading rate and angle of impact to the basic grain direction of two different densities of four impact limiting materials...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the chemical composition, mineralogy, morphology and <b>crushing</b> <b>strengths</b> of fly ash bricks, conventional concrete bricks and fly ash samples has been undertaken.

50|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of concrete {{is influenced by}} the water-cementitious ratio (w/cm), the design constituents, and the mixing, placement and curing methods employed. All things being equal, concrete with a lower water-cement (cementitious) ratio makes a stronger concrete than that with a higher ratio. The total quantity of cementitious materials (portland cement, slag cement, pozzolans) can affect strength, water demand, shrinkage, abrasion resistance and density. All concrete will crack independent of whether or not it has sufficient compressive strength. In fact, high Portland cement content mixtures can actually crack more readily due to increased hydration rate. As concrete transforms from its plastic state, hydrating to a solid, the material undergoes shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage cracks can occur soon after placement but if the evaporation rate is high they often can actually occur during finishing operations, for example in hot weather or a breezy day.In very high-strength concrete mixtures (greater than 70 MPa) the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength. In lean concretes (with a high water-cement ratio) the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> of the aggregates is not so significant. The internal forces in common shapes of structure, such as arches, vaults, columns and walls are predominantly compressive forces, with floors and pavements subjected to tensile forces. Compressive strength is widely used for specification requirement and quality control of concrete. Engineers know their target tensile (flexural) requirements and will express these in terms of compressive strength.|$|E
50|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. Coke's superior <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> allowed blast furnaces to become taller and larger.

Before this time, iron-making used large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As the coppicing of forests became unable to meet the demand, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps on the ground so that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 18th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.|$|E
