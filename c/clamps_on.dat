The essential weakness of the spiritist's testimony {{lies in the fact}} that for the most part he assumes that the facts of mediumship are somehow, and necessarily, in opposition to somebody's religion. He finds it sustained (or opposed) by the Bible, or he fancies it mixed with deviltry or the black art. He trembles for fear it will affect the scheme of redemption or assist some theosophical system. Whereas, a man like Bottazzi is engaged merely with the facts; he lets the inferences fall where they may. He is not concerned with whether Eusapia's manifestations oppose Christian theology or not; he wants the phenomena. He is alert to note their effect on biologic science, but he does not shrink from any report of them. So far as I am concerned, my lot is cast with these men who put the <b>clamps</b> <b>on</b> the fact and wait for larger knowledge before constructing a system of religion on the half-discovered." ...|$|E

"I {{would not}} place much {{dependence}} on my present recollection," [...] I frankly responded, [...] "but I {{reported on the}} case at once while my mind was most accurate as to details. Speaking further of these tricks, {{if you choose to}} call them such, I have had several failures, where the failure meant as much as a success. I have held two slates with a psychic (while we were both standing) when the creaking and scratching and grinding went on between my hands. I give you my word I was convinced at the moment of holding between my palms a sentient force. I felt as Franklin must have felt when he played with the lightning in the bottle at the tail of his kite. Once I heard the writing going on in a half-opened slate, but I did not see the pencil in motion. Some of these cases of 'direct-writing' are the most convincing of all my experiences. People ask me why I didn't talk with the spirits about heaven and angels. I was not interested in their religious notions. I kept to this one line--I wanted to see a particle of matter move from A to B without a known push or pull. I paid very little attention to 'trance-mediums' like Mrs. Piper; and although I saw a great deal of what is called 'mind-reading' and 'thought-transference,' I did not permit the cart to get before the horse. 'Independent slate-writing' interested me, for the reason that I could put the <b>clamps</b> <b>on</b> it. Materialization, on the contrary, is so staged and arranged for that to prove its genuineness seems impossible at present; but slate-writing under your hand is a different matter." ...|$|E

30|$|The Q-learning agent {{uses the}} action set to {{constrain}} TCP aggressive behavior. Findings of [1] {{suggested that the}} maximum TCP congestion window size {{plays a crucial role}} in the aggressive behavior of TCP. However, putting a static <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> TCP congestion window size might cause an under-utilization of the network resources. Therefore, to avoid any under/over-utilization of network resources, we use a dynamic <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> TCP congestion window size. The learning agent dynamically changes the maximum congestion window size of TCP without interfering with the congestion control mechanism via the action set. As such, TCP uses the standard congestion control mechanism along with a dynamic <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> the congestion window to limit any aggressive window increase. The agent uses the action functions in Algorithm 1 to change TCP parameters in each decision epoch.|$|R

5000|$|PICCs {{can remain}} in situ for {{extended}} periods of time, from seven days to 12 months, although little information is available with respect to viability timeframes. They are used in both the hospital and community settings.PICCs {{can be used for}} intravenous delivery of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), chemotherapy, antibiotics or other medications, and can also be used for blood sampling if the lumen is 4 French or larger in size (Arrow and Bard manufacturers guidelines). To maintain patency, PICC management should include regular flushing with normal saline and [...] "locking" [...] with Heparin or normal saline when not in use. The type of locking procedure depends on the type of PICC and bung; Groshong PICCs have a three-way valve at the tip so the use of a heparin lock is not necessary, and there are no <b>clamps</b> <b>on</b> the external length. In comparison, Arrow PICCs have <b>clamps</b> <b>on</b> the exterior line and require a heparin lock. The use of heparin to maintain line patency, though, is questionable, and currently randomized clinical control trials are investigating this further. Heparin locks have been associated with complications, including heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia.|$|E

The effect of 21 mm, 60 mm diameter of <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> tubular reactor and conventional stirring method to removing free fatty acid (FFA) and optimizing time of reaction at the acid catalyzed esterification were observed. Transesterification of jatropha curcas oil with methanol, in the sodium hydroxide as a catalyst was investigated using <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> tubular reactor. The effect of different operating parameter such as methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration to reach optimum condition was studied. The influence of output power on water to oil concentration and time of reaction in the purification were investigated. In the esterification process, the high FFA concentration was removed lower 1 % by tube of diameter 60 mm at 5 minutes time of reaction. The optimum condition of the transesterification process was achieved at molar ratios of methanol to oil of 7 : 1, catalyst concentration of 1 %, time of reaction of 5 minutes. On the other hand the optimal condition of the purification process at water concentration of 10 % (v/v), power output of 240 w, time of reaction of 5 minutes was obtained. Compared with conventional stirring method, the time of esterification reaction by <b>clamp</b> <b>on</b> tubular reactor reduces until 96 %, while for the transesterification reaction reduces until 83 %...|$|R
