For example, if parents perceive that the accumulation of skills has a high return—say in terms of their children eventually gaining admission into a selective university or securing high-wage employment—they will be more willing to invest their time and money in schooling. Similarly, the organization of the education system may affect parents’ investment choices. To illustrate, some European and African <b>countries</b> have <b>school</b> <b>systems</b> structured such that not all children are entitled to the transition from primary into academic secondary schools. Their entry, as the school and class to which they are assigned, is contingent on testing performance.

To select the sample of teachers, initially two districts and the 2 study centres in those districts were selected. After that, the teacher samples were selected randomly from those registered for the PGDE programme in the current academic year for the 2 centres. The main instrument for data collection was a questionnaire while a semi structured interviews were conducted with a few teachers from both centres. The findings were that the availability of some resources was good while some are not.

This is quite understandable since the survey asks students to make subjective assessments about issues such as how enjoyable, difficult or boring mathematics is in relation to their classmates, {{while at the same time}} students perceive their attitudes and behaviors within a frame of reference shaped by their schools and cultures. The cultural factors can profoundly influence the way in which these responses are decided.

However, the actual scientific evidence on this question is not quite as clear. Evaluation studies in Europe - especially in Germany - are still rare, although some European countries have a long tradition in mother tongue teaching. In contrast, there are numerous studies on North American experiences. However, it is controversial which of them have a methodologically sound basis and what conclusions should be drawn. Questions: What is the effect of bilingual {{education programs}}, i. e. the teaching of and through the mother tongue, on L 2 acquisition and on the academic achievement of immigrant children? And how large is this effect controlled by and in comparison to other influences, like migration biography, social characteristics of the family, of the social environment and school structures? What forms of bilingual programs and what kinds of evaluation studies have been carried out that address this issue? Which are the ideal and/or minimum methodological standards of evaluation studies, what are common problems and possible solutions? Which groups of students are compared for which reasons? Which differentiations among groups of students and types of programs have to be made when judging the possible effect of such programs?

In modern parlance, one frequently encounters this homespun wisdom in the statement that highly effective schools are led by highly effective principals. This study investigates the perceptions of six practicing principals {{of the elements of}} highly effective principalship in Solomon Islands' Community High schools. The study investigates and explores these perceptions and tries to describe the elements of highly effective principalship and the impediments that may prevent principals from becoming effective. The study hopes to contribute towards the possible development of highly effective principalship in the Solomon Islands schools. The finding of this research reveals that although the participating principals were very experienced, their responses indicate that there appeared to be no theory-driven basis for their practice. Similarly, the perceptions expressed reveal the urgent need for the Solomon Islands {{to pay more attention to}} leadership development strategies that will see the creation of national, and personal, leadership philosophies and set the process of ongoing leadership development, enhancement and improvement in the country. The proposed strategies must incorporate current international research and literature on educational leadership theories as well as building on current practice in the Solomon Islands that is nationally and culturally appropriate. In addition, the study suggests that current practitioners should be encouraged to engage in educational leadership research and begin to build a national literature base. This study suggests that the process of establishing the notion of highly effective educational leadership in the <b>country's</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> should start as soon as possible. Those in policy and decision-making positions must have the courage to implement strategies that will contribute to improved levels of educational leadership in order to raise the quality of education for all learners in the country.
