In the article, some of the results of that analysis, which was published in January 2006 in Working Paper n° 78, are given. More specifically, the article investigates borrowing and payment behavior according to debtor characteristics. The analysis finds that borrowing patterns, especially as credit portfolio composition is concerned, clearly diverge according to age and residence. Furthermore, striking differences were found for the percentage of loan defaults if these variables were taken into account. In particular, the article comes to the conclusion that loan defaults aggregated at the regional level show remarkably strong correlations with economic and demographic factors. credit bureau, consumer credits, mortgage loans, loan payment defaults...|$|R

The evidence that we report is based on questionnaires directed to private <b>credit</b> bureaus and <b>central</b> banks, on direct interviews and on official sources. The European experience highlights a set of important issues. First, European privacy protection laws affect greatly the amount and type of information shared between lenders. Second, credit bureaus tend to originate from local lenders. Third, in Europe as elsewhere there are powerful forces pushing towards consolidation of the credit bureaus industry. While this process reflects the "natural monopoly" feature of the industry, its pace has been accelerated by technological factors and, especially within Europe, by the increasing international integration of capital markets.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Minister for Climate and Energy, Paul Magnette, who is also {{responsible}} for Consumer Affairs, the NBB's Microeconomic Analysis Service conducted an investigation into the link between payment arrears for mobile telephony and arrears on loan repayments. In this inquiry, which was carried out using data drawn from the Preventel records and from the <b>Central</b> Individual <b>Credit</b> <b>Register,</b> the profile of people with arrears for both types of debt was also analysed. The profile analysis shows that defaulters with a Preventel registration form a specific group among CICR defaulters. People with payment arrears for both types of debt tend to have a demographic and credit profile which to a large extent matches that of CICR defaulters with no mobile phone payment arrears, but a few differences were also found between both groups of defaulters. A number of trends in borrowing and repayment behaviour turn out to be much more pronounced in the first of these two defaulter groups, but it is above all in regard to the age aspect that the differences are most striking. In cases where people have fallen behind in their payments for both types of debt, it actually {{turns out to be a}} younger group. Generally speaking, these borrowers take out their first loan at an earlier age, and they also tend to run up their first arrears when they are younger. The inquiry further revealed that there is a statistically significant link between payment arrears for mobile telephony and credit arrears, and this applies for various definitions of payment arrears. Repayment problems generally tend to emerge sooner in payment arrears for mobile telephony bills than in arrears on loans. A simple logistic regression model indicates that dummy variables for a Preventel registration, and for the duration of that registration, still have a definite predictive value with regard to credit arrears, after controlling for a number of demographic and credit variables in the model. As the assessment of the credit risk of private individuals is based on a set of socio-economic variables, payment arrears for mobile telephony could therefore be a useful complementary variable in that assessment. consumer credit bureau, credits, mobile telephony, payment arrears...|$|R

Our analysis shows that the existence of both types of registers increases the share of branching in the overall entries. Additionally, the establishment of public registers reduces concentration ratios, and some banking competition indicators (such as overhead costs/assets). The introduction of a private credit bureau, on the other hand, has no effect on concentration ratios, but positively contributes to competition (by decreasing interest rate margins). This suggests that <b>credit</b> <b>registers</b> facilitate direct entry through a reduction of information asymmetries, which in turn intensifies competition. credit registries, foreign entry, asymmetric information...|$|R

Our results point to the importance of income leverage (together with other relatively standard financial ratios) for the financial pressure on firms, but also to the relevance of non-linearities and the inability of purely firm-level variables to capture completely the temporal behaviour of aggregate firm default rates. Thus, the real GDP growth rate and an average interest cost of debt are significant additional predictors of a firm's probability of default. ...|$|E

To this end, we use extensive databases (the <b>Central</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Register</b> and the Central Balance Sheet Register) as well as specific surveys, which allow us to fill information gaps about this industry and to quantify regional diversity. Second, we investigate whether MGIs’ support to small firms continued to be effective in 2008 - 09, when credit constraints to Italian firms peaked. We find that MGIs played a role in avoiding a break-up in credit flows to affiliated firms, which also benefited from a lower cost of credit. However, this came at the cost of a deterioration in credit quality, which was more intense for customers with guarantees from MGIs. microfinance, peer monitoring, small business finance...|$|E

The paper improves on existing literature by distinguishing between real and personal guarantees. Further, the paper investigates the potential different role of guarantees in the bank-borrower relationship during the recent financial crisis. This paper draws from individual Italian bank and firm data taken from the Banks’ Supervisory Reports to the Bank of Italy and the <b>Central</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Register</b> over the period 2006 - 2009. Our analysis demonstrates that collateral affects the cost of credit of Italian firms by systematically reducing the interest rate of secured loans, while personal guarantees increase it. These effects are amplified during the crisis. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for ex-ante riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers. Indeed, riskier borrowers obtain significantly lower interest rates on secured loans than interest rate they would be charged on unsecured loans. ...|$|E
40|$|Results from {{portfolio}} {{models for}} credit risk {{tell us that}} loan concentration in certain industry sectors can substantially increase the value-at-risk (VaR). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze whether a tractable "infection model" can provide a meaningful estimate of the impact of concentration risk on the VaR. I apply rather parsimonious data requirements, which are comparable to those for Moody's Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) and considerably lower than for a multi-factor model. The infection model extends the BET model by introducing default infection into the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is mapped in order to obtain a simple solution for the VaR. The infection probability is calibrated for a range of typical values of input parameters, which capture the concentration of a portfolio in industry sectors, default dependencies between exposures and their credit quality. The accuracy of the new model is measured for test portfolios with a realistic industry-sector composition, obtained from the German <b>central</b> <b>credit</b> <b>register.</b> I find that a carefully calibrated infection model provides a reasonably close approximation to the VaR obtained from a multi-factor model and outperforms by far the BET model. The simulation results suggest that the calibrated infection model promises to provide a fit-for-purpose tool to measure concentration risk in business sectors that could be useful for risk managers and banking supervisors alike.

It {{is not easy}} to identify its determinants since they are connected to organisational,technical, commercial and financial factors. In this paper we empirically examine the determinants of the usage of trade credit by Italian industrial firms. We use an original database that contains detailed information from an ad hoc survey of Bank of Italy on trade credit, from Italian <b>Central</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Register</b> on banking relations and from firmsÂ’ balance sheet. The focus of the paper concerns the role of financial reasons among the determinants of trade credit demand. The Bank of Italy survey shows that financial motives are less frequent than transactive ones; nevertheless we find a positive correlation between financial reasons and the amount of accounts payable, while the opposite occurs for firms that delay the payments to their suppliers in order to control the quality of purchased goods. The main findings of our empirical analysis are: i) financial determinants of trade credit demand are more frequent among firms in financial distress (rationed firms, firms with lower unused lines of credit and firms with a higher cost of credit); ii) firms in financial distress and firms in trouble have more accounts payable; iii) finally, these firms do not obtain from their suppliers a higher amount of accounts payable (or more delayed payments) but they are able to increase their usage of trade credit by paying over the due date. trade credit,corporate finance,credit rationing...|$|E
