5|$|In the UK <b>Control</b> <b>Risks,</b> a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. <b>Control</b> <b>Risks</b> took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence concerning {{the significance of}} assessing operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> {{as part of an}} integrative evaluation of internal controls. We examine whether operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> indicators can be used as cues to potential unreported financial reporting control weaknesses and financial reporting deficiencies. We use data breaches and an operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> index, created through textual analysis of Form 10 -Ks, as our two primary indicators of operational <b>control</b> <b>risk.</b> We find positive relations between our operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> indicators and future financial reporting control weaknesses, restatements, SEC comment letters, and audit fees, even after controlling for contemporaneous financial reporting control weaknesses. These findings suggest that operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> is informative of potential financial reporting deficiencies...|$|R

2500|$|Stakeholders {{concerned}} {{by the lack of}} a regulatory framework to assess and <b>control</b> <b>risks</b> associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" [...] disease), thalidomide, genetically modified food, nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and asbestosis. Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine whether}} {{auditors}} effectively {{respond to an}} assessment of high <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> at the account level. The audit risk model assumes that auditors alter their audit procedures to compensate for {{a greater risk of}} material misstatement to maintain a low risk of audit failure (i. e., low audit risk). I use internal control weakness disclosures in interim and annual filings to identify assessments of high <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> within specific accounts, and restatements of these specific accounts to identify account–level audit failures. I find an increased incidence of account–level misstatements when <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> within that particular account is high, suggesting that, on average, auditors do not maintain a consistent level of audit risk at the account level in the presence of high <b>control</b> <b>risk.</b> In further analyses, I examine whether the effectiveness of the auditor’s response varies as auditor effort (measured using excess audit fees) increases. For certain accounts, I find that additional auditor effort mitigates the likelihood of an ineffective response to high <b>control</b> <b>risk,</b> but that this mitigating effect occurs only at high levels of auditor effort. The results of this study provide insight into the effectiveness of auditors’ use of the audit risk model at the account level and suggest areas of the audit where auditors can improve the link between account–level risk assessments and the design, performance, and evaluation of substantive audit tests...|$|R

The paper divides {{environmental}} <b>risk</b> <b>control</b> {{modes of}} residential projects into four types: static and non-integrated mode, static and integrated mode, dynamic and non-integrated mode, and dynamic and integrated mode.

The Dynamic and Integrated Environmental <b>Risk</b> <b>Control</b> System(DIERCS) for residential projects is established.
