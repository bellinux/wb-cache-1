5|$|Stage IV or AIDS: severe {{symptoms}} {{which include}} toxoplasmosis of the brain, <b>candidiasis</b> of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma. A CD4 count {{of less than}} 200/µl.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, <b>candidiasis</b> and histoplasmosis. Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal <b>candidiasis</b> may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic <b>candidiasis).</b> Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal <b>candidiasis.</b> Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, <b>candidiasis</b> or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of <b>Candidiasis,</b> causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, <b>candidiasis,</b> coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of <b>candidiasis</b> of {{the breast}} include pain, itching, burning and redness, or a shiny or white patchy appearance. The baby could have a white tongue that does not wipe clean. <b>Candidiasis</b> is common and may be {{associated}} with infant thrush.|$|E
25|$|<b>Candidiasis</b> (thrush, or a yeast infection).|$|E
25|$|Some women consume good {{bacteria}} in food with live culture, such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi, or in probiotic supplements either {{to try to}} prevent <b>candidiasis,</b> or to reduce the likelihood of developing bacterial vaginitis following antibiotic treatment. There is no firm evidence to suggest that eating live yogurt or taking probiotic supplements will prevent <b>candidiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>candidiasis</b> – A {{loss of the}} {{antimicrobial}} {{actions of}} saliva may also lead to opportunistic infection with Candida species.|$|E
25|$|In {{autoimmune}} polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g. hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) {{and chronic}} mucocutaneous <b>candidiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Voriconazole, (trade name Vfend) is a {{triazole}} antifungal medication used {{to treat}} and prevent invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis and <b>candidiasis</b> and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} prone to several pathologies {{including}} glossitis and other inflammations such as geographic tongue, and median rhomboid glossitis; burning mouth syndrome, oral hairy leukoplakia, oral <b>candidiasis</b> (thrush) and black hairy tongue.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{could be}} the presenting symptom of type 1 diabetes mellitus, classically associated with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; weight loss, lethargy, and diaper <b>candidiasis</b> may also be present in those with new-onset disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{differential diagnosis}} is extensive and requires consideration {{of many other}} infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, shigellosis, rickettsial diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, EHEC enteritis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, plague, Q fever, <b>candidiasis,</b> histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, measles, and viral hepatitis among others.|$|E
25|$|While in custody, Petrelis {{complained of}} {{inadequate}} medical attention. He suffered from an esophageal <b>candidiasis</b> infection (thrush) {{and a serious}} skin condition affecting sixty percent of his body. On December 8, 2001, a judge ordered Petrelis rushed to the prison medical unit for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) {{associated with}} the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal <b>candidiasis,</b> pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.|$|E
25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} {{is common}} and occurs worldwide. Usually the people affected are middle aged or elderly, with females being affected slightly more commonly than males. Prevalences {{of up to}} 70% {{have been reported in}} elderly care home residents. It {{is by far the most}} common type of oral <b>candidiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diflucan (fluconazole), {{the first}} orally {{available}} treatment for severe fungal infections. Fluconazole is recommended as a first-line treatment in invasive <b>candidiasis</b> and {{is widely used}} in the prophylaxis of severe fungal infections in premature infants. Fluconazole is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.|$|E
25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed denture sore mouth, denture stomatitis, chronic atrophic <b>candidiasis,</b> Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis, and denture-associated erythematous stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a denture. In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people. Denture-related stomatitis {{is the most common}} form of oral <b>candidiasis</b> (a yeast infection of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete upper denture (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw). Denture-related stomatitis is more likely to develop when the denture is left constantly in the mouth, rather than removing it during sleep, and when the denture is not cleaned regularly.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of <b>candidiasis,</b> {{the most}} common type of vaginitis, {{includes}} using loose cotton underwear. The vaginal area should be washed with water. Perfumed soaps, shower gels, and vaginal deodorants should be avoided. Douching is not recommended. The practice upsets the normal balance of yeast in the vagina and does more harm than good.|$|E
25|$|There {{are usually}} no {{symptoms}} {{other than the}} unusual appearance of the tongue, {{but in some cases}} persons may experience pain or burning e.g. when eating hot, acidic, spicy or other kinds of foods (e.g. cheese, tomatoes, fruit). Where there is a burning symptom, other causes of a burning sensation on the tongue are considered, such as oral <b>candidiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is usually}} due to infection. The three main kinds of {{vaginitis}} are bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal <b>candidiasis,</b> and trichomoniasis. A woman {{may have a}} combination of vaginal infections at one time. Testing for vaginal infections is {{not a part of}} routine pelvic exams. If there is discomfort in the vulvovaginal area, women can request their health care providers evaluate for the presence of an infection.|$|E
25|$|Topically {{administered}} ketoconazole {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, <b>candidiasis</b> (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole is a {{synthetic}} imidazole antifungal drug used primarily to treat fungal infections. Ketoconazole is sold commercially as a tablet for oral administration (although this use has been discontinued {{in a number}} of countries), and in a variety of formulations for topical administration, such as creams (used to treat tinea; cutaneous <b>candidiasis,</b> including candidal paronychia; and pityriasis versicolor) and shampoos (used primarily to treat dandruff—seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp).|$|E
25|$|An early proponent was Jacob Harich (19191996). A {{long time}} {{promoter}} of GSE was Aubrey Hampton, {{the founder of}} Aubrey Organics. Some marketers of GSE affirm this extract to be a safe, natural, and effective preservative. This extract has been stated by some practitioners of alternative medicine to possess antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. It has been recommended by some nutritionists {{for the treatment of}} <b>candidiasis,</b> earache, throat infections, and diarrhea. GSE is promoted at health food shops and on the internet.|$|E
25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal <b>candidiasis</b> or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including <b>candidiasis),</b> allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
25|$|More than 20 {{types of}} Candida can cause {{infection}} with Candida albicans {{being the most}} common. Infections of the mouth are most common among children less than one month old, the elderly, and those with weak immune systems. Conditions that result in a weak immune system include HIV/AIDS, the medications used after organ transplantation, diabetes, {{and the use of}} corticosteroids. Other risks include dentures and following antibiotic therapy. Vaginal infections occur more commonly during pregnancy, in those with weak immune systems, and following antibiotic use. Risk factors for invasive <b>candidiasis</b> include being in an intensive care unit, following surgery, low birth weight infants, and those with weak immune systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{partnership between}} Hazen in New York City and Brown in Albany {{was due in}} part to the efficiency of the United States Postal Service in the 1940s. In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease cryptococcosis, which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes <b>candidiasis,</b> which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a vaginal yeast infection), or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she found such promising antifungal activity in a particular culture, she would mail it to Brown in a mason jar.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It {{is also important to}} note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine) can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral <b>candidiasis</b> developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E
25|$|Leukoedema lesions {{disappear}} {{when the}} mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth. The differential diagnosis is with leukoplakia, oral <b>candidiasis,</b> oral lichen planus, white sponge nevus, morsicatio buccarum, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis and dyskeratosis congenita. Tissue biopsy is not indicated, but when taken, the histologic appearance {{is one of}} increased epithelial thickness, broadening and eleongation of the rete ridges, parakeratosis and intracellular edema of the spinous layer. The cells of the spinous later are vacuolated, large and possess pyknotic nuclei. The superficial squamous cells have a clear, seemingly empty cytoplasm {{but it has not}} been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term edema misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish. The diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance alone, but oral exfoliative cytology {{has been used as a}} diagnostic aid.|$|E
25|$|Rask {{apparently}} {{suffered from}} symptoms of Pre-AIDS starting in late 1974, including diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and fatigue. Although the symptoms receded temporarily following drug treatments in 1975, the symptoms later grew considerably worse. Following {{a vacation in}} South Africa in July 1977, {{she could no longer}} breathe and relied on bottled oxygen. She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), <b>candidiasis</b> (yeast infection), and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia). Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system. At the time, the doctors treating Rask were at a loss to explain her disease progression, which in retrospect, would come to be seen {{as one of the first}} cases of AIDS recorded outside Africa.|$|E
500|$|Inflammation of the {{esophagus}} {{is known as}} esophagitis. Reflux of gastric acids from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis. Esophageal <b>candidiasis</b> is an infection of the yeast candida albicans that may occur {{when a person is}} immunocompromised. [...] the cause of some forms of esophagitis, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, is not known. Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.|$|E
500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), oral <b>candidiasis,</b> and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|E
