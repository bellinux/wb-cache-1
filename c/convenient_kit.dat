40|$|Objectives: The {{evaluation}} of Mutans streptococci (MS) {{is one of}} the index for caries risk. Dentocult TM and CRT TM are commercial kits to detect and evaluate MS, conveniently. However, the {{evaluation of}} MS has also been carried out simply using an instruction manual. But the instruction manual is not easy to use for evaluation of MS. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the utility of modified Mitis-Salivalius Bacitracin (MSB) agar medium compared with MSB agar medium and commercial kits, and to establish a <b>convenient</b> <b>kit</b> (mMSB-kit) using modified MSB agar. Methods: The MS in stimulated saliva from 27 subjects were detected by MSB, modified MSB agar medium and commercial kits. Laboratory and clinically isolated strains of MS were similarly evaluated. The ratios of MS in detected bacteria were compared by ELISA. Results: The scores using an mMSB-kit on the basis of modified MSB agar medium were tabulated. Saliva samples showed different levels of MS between culture methods and the commercial kit. Some samples which were full of MS were not detected by the commercial kit. The detection of MS by modified MSB agar medium and mMSB-kit were significantly higher when compared with MSB agar medium, CRT TM, (P<. 01) and Dentocult SM TM (P<. 05). Conclusion: The sensitivity for detection of MS is higher for modified MSB agar medium when compared with MSB agar medium. The mMSB-kit can be used simply, and can be an important contributor for the evaluation of MS as a caries risk factor. (Eur J Dent 2007; 1 : 31 - 39...|$|E
40|$|Progress {{in three}} areas of {{research}} is summarized. These are as follows: Labeling Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with Tc- 99 m and Re- 186; human melanoma tumors and specific MAbs; evaluation of biological response modifiers (BRM). The techniques of labeling MAbs (IgM, IgG, F(ab{prime}) {sub 2 } or F(ab{prime})) with Tc- 99 m {{was developed in the}} author`s laboratory in 1989 and that with Re- 186 in 1992. The techniques are in daily use in the laboratory since then and are adapted to a <b>convenient</b> <b>kit</b> formulation. The metal ions are bound at MAb sulfhydryls generated by a controlled reduction of a pair of disulfide groups. At least two types of MAbs labeled with Tc- 99 m by this method have been administered into patients and excellent diagnostic results have been obtained. Over the past {{two and a half years}} the author has been successfully growing human melanoma tumors in athymic Balb/c nude mice. The cell LINE, WM- 9, was obtained from Dr. D Herlyn`s laboratory at Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. Sufficient quantities of antihuman melanoma specific antibodies ME 31. 3 (Wistar, IgG- 1) and MEM- 136 (Hybritech, IgG- 2 A) and their F(ab{prime}) {sub 2 } fragments are also available in the laboratory. The use of BRM is a rapidly evolving field. Over the past four years, the author has evaluated a number of BRMs in a quest for agents that may augment MAb tumor uptake. These included interferon-{alpha}; a pokeweed mitogen and Ukrain, an alkaloid separated from a plant Chelideonium Majis. In these preliminary studies, normal Balb/c mice were used and the BRMs were given i. p. one hour prior to the i. v. administration of tumor necrosis factor or an MAb (TNT-F(ab{prime}) {sub 2 }) labeled with Tc- 99 m which served as an imaging agent. Animals were sacrificed at 1. 5 hr or 4 hrs post-injection. Highlights of the work are given here in a table...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} pathway of the carbamidodiacetyl colorimetric assay was investigated. The experimental {{variables that}} were studied include reaction temperature, heating time, and {{the ratio of}} the mineral acid mixture to the reactants. Evidence is presented establishing the involvement of either 7 -or 8 -methyl, or 7, 8. d imethyltetrahyd roimidazo(4, 5 -d) imidazole- 2, 5 -d iones as chromogens, all three being equally acceptable.

40|$|AIM: To {{provide a}} {{colorectal}} cancer screening {{service for the}} general public, based on the detection of blood in faeces, that was effective, affordable and <b>convenient.</b> METHODS: <b>Kits</b> for collecting faecal specimens were sold directly to the public and, after collecting three specimens, kits were transported to the laboratory for testing by an immunochemical procedure involving a positive cut-off value. Reports were sent to participants and their nominated doctors who were requested to provide information on participants testing positive. RESULTS: Over a 10 -year period, 35 139 kits were analysed and 5. 63 % were positive. After follow-up, 7. 4 % of positive testing participants {{were found to have}} colorectal cancer, 23. 4 % adenomas, 34. 6 % miscellaneous non-neoplastic pathology and in 25. 0 % no abnormality was found. Sixty-six per cent of cancers were early stage, Dukes stages A and B. There were 35 139 kits processed on 16 240 individuals, indicating that a number were repeat testing. CONCLUSIONS: The screening service was able to detect a high yield of colorectal pathology, especially early stage neoplasia which is curable, and encouraged repeat testing. Education of doctors about how to investigate a positive test, and of participants about symptoms, have been important lessons arising from this screening service.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveIn {{this study}} we sought to assess the {{efficacy}} of a technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) -labeled third-generation cephalosporin as an infection imaging agent in the accurate detection of the sites of bacterial infection in vivo. DesignCeftriaxone (CRO) was formulated into a ready-to-use single-vial cold kit with a shelf-life of over 6 months and was successfully labeled with technetium. The radiolabeled drug, Tc- 99 m-CRO, was subjected to the following preclinical evaluations: radiochemical purity, in vitro and in vivo stability, bacterial binding assay, and pharmacokinetic studies in animals and in human patients. ResultsThe kit formulation exhibited excellent radiolabeling efficiency (âˆ¼ 99 %) and high in vitro and in vivo stability. The radiolabeled drug exhibited slow blood clearance (12 % at 4 h), and the high protein binding and excretion pattern of the labeled formulation mimics the reported pharmacokinetic profile of the drug alone. In the animal model, scintigraphy scans showed higher uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in infectious lesions, even at 1 h post-administration, in comparison to inflammatory lesions. The clinical evaluation of Tc- 99 m-labeled CRO showed a diagnostic accuracy of 83. 3 %, and a sensitivity and specificity of 85. 2 % and 77. 8 %, respectively. ConclusionsThis kit formulation {{has the potential for}} imaging bacterial infections with much higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to other Tc- 99 m-labeled antibiotics available as <b>convenient</b> ready-to-use <b>kits</b> in routine clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|As long as {{typhoid fever}} and other {{salmonellosis}} are endemic in our country, Widal test will be extensively used even in laboratories {{that are doing}} very routine services like urinalysis, microscopic examination of stools and blood counts. This has been especially so because of {{the introduction of the}} very <b>convenient</b> slide test <b>kits.</b> This is quite alarming since "fevers of undetermined origin " or FUO has been the most common cause that make people go to the hospital fast. Nowadays with the medicare services, and the utilization of the benefits it gives, the situation is a little bit worse. All laboratory examinations are utilized. Widal test will be widely used {{for as long as the}} development of microbiological laboratories is at a snail's pace. It is time, however, that we all analyze the Widal test to determine how useful it is as a diagnostic tool. Some variables affect the result of the test. Its interpretation is affected by the frequency distribution of agglutinins in the population. There is a certain proportion of the population whose sera will give antibodies capable of reacting to a variable titer in test due partly to the occurrence of latent and post infections with members of the bacterial enteric group like members of the salmonella a group or other groups with antigenic factors similar to the used as antigen in the test...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical Tissue Engineering, Biomaterials and Medical Devices Poster SessionIt is {{estimated}} that in the United States diabetes affects 25 million children and adults, and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. Cost of diabetes in the United States is over $ 175 billion a year. To optimize insulin dose diabetic patients regularly measure their blood glucose. Random glucose measurement does not provide indication of long-term glucose control. The long-term indicator of glucose control is the hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). It provides average blood glucose level of the previous 2 to 3 months. In most cases, for HbA 1 c testing, patients come to clinical laboratories for blood draw. It is time consuming and inconvenient. In recent years efforts have been made to develop sample mail-in kit where the blood sample can be collected at home and mailed to a testing laboratory. We present the development of a stabilizing solution (SS) and mail-in kit for Hb A 1 c testing. With this kit, after a simple finger prick, a patient collects blood using a capillary tube. The blood-containing capillary tube is dropped in a tube containing SS, and is mailed to the laboratory in a pre-stamped box in a regular mail. Validation of the kit included 1) Comparing HbA 1 c levels in the whole blood to hemolysate and SS immediately after preparation of the samples, 2) Stability of HbA 1 c in SS for 4 and 7 days at 4 oC, room temperature and 37 oC, 3) mailing the samples in the regular mail and comparing the values of HbA 1 c in mailed-in samples to the whole blood samples. The data for some of these comparisons are shown in the Table below. No significant difference was found in the values of HbA 1 c in various test groups. In conclusion, we have developed a <b>convenient</b> mail-in <b>kit</b> for the measurement of HbA 1 c. The advantages of mail-in kit for HbA 1 c measurement include patients' satisfaction as it negates the need for venipuncture and laboratory visit for sample collection, and the availability of results to a physician before the patient's visit for optimal care...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and was awarded by Brunel UniversityBACGROUND:Unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among young people are priority public health issues in the UK. Social marketing is the preferred Government approach to intervention despite limited evidence on efficacy. There is need to understand its applicability and effectiveness in addressing the specified sexual health issues. METHODS:Three studies were carried out, of which {{the first was a}} systematic review of 12 studies assessing the effectiveness of social marketing in reducing unintended teenage pregnancies. The second and third were consumer research applications examining factors associated with Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) use and Chlamydia screening respectively. The second study involved analysing five ONS Contraception survey datasets while the third involved analysing Havering PCT Chlamydia screening records and qualitative data from 28 participants. Data were analysed using Stata. 10 and Framework statistical packages and maps drawn using MapInfo. 10. 5. RESULTS:The systematic review showed that nine studies achieved significant effects on {{at least one of the}} specified outcomes (reduced pregnancy rates and related behaviour changes). The second study showed that the NICE guidelines published in 2005 successfully addressed the disparity in LARC uptake previously experienced by women aged below 20. The third study identified females and non-white participants as more likely to take Chlamydia tests. Motivating factors for testing included <b>convenient</b> access to <b>kits</b> and fear of infertility, while barriers included ignorance and fear of results. CONCLUSIONS:Social marketing appears to be effective in reducing unintended teenage pregnancies but evidence is limited to particular outcomes and context. Consumer research provides vital intelligence about target populations necessary for designing effective interventions and addressing inequalities. However to assess its influence on outcomes, studies that feature all social marketing components are required. Overall there is need for more studies that specifically utilize social marketing principles to enable more robust evaluations...|$|R
