50|$|The {{outlook for}} the oil supply is complex (as of 2010) because of the trend of {{decreasing}} oil reserves and the sharp increase in international oil prices in 2008. The government was considering a variety of options to ensure an appropriate supply of energy for {{the nation as a}} whole. In 2003 important changes in oil policy were introduced that led to an increase in exploration, production, and reserves of oil and gas. Among those changes is the separation of state roles: Ecopetrol assumed a role as an operator with greater autonomy and more ability to compete. The new National Hydrocarbons Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos, ANH) became a resource administrator. A <b>contingency</b> <b>tax</b> should give the government a share of profits when prices of oil are higher than a given threshold price. Compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and ethanol are also being promoted as options to increase the nation's domestic supply of energy resources.|$|E
40|$|Commentary {{during the}} {{development}} of FASB Interpretation no. 48 suggests the interpretation could be costly for firms because new disclosure requirements {{could be used by}} the IRS to more effectively challenge uncertain tax positions. Stock returns around FIN 48 pronouncements suggest investors were not concerned about an increase in tax costs, and investors responded favorably to initial disclosures required under FIN 48. However, we document a significant negative market reaction to subsequent news of a Senate inquiry into these disclosures consistent with investors revising their beliefs over the potential for additional tax costs.

40|$|This paper studies {{policy in}} a class of economies in which {{information}} about commonly-relevant fundamentals [...] such as aggregate productivity and demand conditions [...] is dispersed and can not be centralized by the government. In these economies, the decentralized use of information can fail to be efficient either because of discrepancies between private and social payoffs, or because of informational externalities. In the first case, inefficiency manifests itself in excessive non-fundamental volatility (overreaction to common noise) or excessive cross-sectional dispersion (overreaction to idiosyncratic noise). In the second case, inefficiency manifests itself in suboptimal social learning (low quality of information contained in macroeconomic data, financial prices, and other indicators of economic activity). In either case, a novel role for policy is identified: the government can improve welfare by manipulating the incentives agents face when deciding how to use their available sources of information. Our key result is that this can be achieved by appropriately designing the <b>contingency</b> of marginal <b>taxes</b> on aggregate activity. This contingency permits the government to control the reaction of equilibrium to different types of noise, {{to improve the quality of}} information in prices and macro data, and, in overall, to restore efficiency in the decentralized use of information. ...|$|R
40|$|Since 1999, the French {{accounting}} rules have been undergoing many reforms {{generated by the}} IFRS. In France, adoption of IFRS standards is mandatory for the accounts published by listed companies, and optionally for consolidated accounts of the non-listed companies. The accounts of French companies must be published in accordance with French standards but the convergence of the French standards and the international standards is in progress. Since 2005, several texts inspired by the IFRS have applied the international standards to all firms. This in-depth reform involves many tax consequences, but the progressive convergence of the individual accounts towards IFRS should not {{be done at the}} expense of the accounting and taxation connection. In this paper, we will try to give a progress report on the adoption of international standards and the divergence from French traditional accounting. After having reviewed the organisation of accounting standard setting bodies, we will examine the accounting reform and the impact on <b>tax</b> <b>contingencies</b> by respecting the constraints of IFRS standards. Lastly, we will examine the issue of application of international standards to SMEs and the likelihood of adoption in France. accounting practice; Chart of Accounts; conceptual framework; convergence; fair value; financial statements; French regulation; IFRS; limits; rules; standards; France; accounting regulation. ...|$|R
