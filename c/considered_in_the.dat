5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can be <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E

5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes were <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency {{to do it on}} its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of americium {{are known}} with mass numbers from 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; {{both of them}} can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has to be <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data analysis.|$|E

The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme to be cancelled again in 1950. Various proposals have been evaluated since, including an extension to Peckham <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s, but the costs have always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E
