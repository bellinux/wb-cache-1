5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|On the {{syndicated}} version's first season, two contestants correctly answered all 15 questions {{and won the}} top prize of $1,000,000: Kevin Smith on February 18, 2003, and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year. During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009, Sam Murray, who had previously supplied <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> for eleven questions, risked his winnings on a special $1,000,000 question; {{he was the only}} contestant to answer his question correctly.|$|E
25|$|The name item {{response}} {{theory is}} due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term item is generic: covering all kinds of informative item. They might be multiple choice questions that have incorrect and <b>correct</b> <b>responses,</b> but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a rating or Likert scale), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.|$|E

25|$|Oracle Social Engagement and Monitoring (SEM) System – Oracle has {{developed}} a Social Engagement and Monitoring Cloud service that allows businesses to capture relevant brand conversation from global web and social channels to understand commentary on their products. The Social Engagement and Monitoring cloud provides {{the most effective and}} efficient responses across social and customer experience channels. SEM is able to route <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> to the right team, member, or customer-experience channel to ensure the best customer service. The analysis helps vendors to understand what is important to customers. It identifies trends, spikes, and anomalies to make real-time course corrections. It also can identify brand advocates. The SEM cloud identifies customer intention and interests by analyzing the common ways customers talk about a product or a service.|$|E
25|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{dedicated}} to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed {{of a number of}} stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|By November 1972 Genie {{could use}} the word on, {{although}} it was uncertain whether she distinguished between on and in and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing on and in were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix -ing to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of -ing on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb to be until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> to it on tests, {{and use of the}} suffix -ing was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.|$|E
5000|$|The same {{board layout}} was used, {{with the left}} and right sides now colored gold, and the object was to {{complete}} a path across the board within 60 seconds. Each hexagon now contained up to five letters, standing for the initial letters in the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> to a clue (e.g. for [...] "RTRNR" [...] and a clue of [...] "He guided Santa's sleigh," [...] the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> would be [...] "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"). A <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> turned the hexagon gold, while a miss or pass blacked it out, forcing the contestant to work around that space to complete the path.|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} discrimination of /er/ and /est/ suffixes as {{labels for}} stimuli exemplifying comparative or superlative relationships {{was established in}} three institutionalized retardates through differential reinforcement. The subjects were first taught <b>correct</b> pointing in <b>response</b> to opposite adjectives (e. g., “big—small”) presented as labels for simple visual stimuli, and then taught each of the comparatives, or each of the superlatives possible for those opposites (e. g., “big—bigger” and “small—smaller”, or “big—biggest” and “small—smallest”). As training proceeded, novel combinations of the training stimuli were presented as unreinforced probes to display any developing generalization of the training. As training of comparative discrimination proceeded, <b>correct</b> pointing <b>response</b> to comparative probes was high, but <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> to superlative probes was low. When training of superlative discriminations replaced training of comparatives, <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> to superlative probes increased, and <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> to comparative probes remained high...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{promoted}} as an ability test, the MSCEIT is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items {{do not have}} objectively <b>correct</b> <b>responses.</b> Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means {{that it is impossible}} to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally [...] "intelligent" [...] only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|An older empiricist theory, the behaviorist theory {{proposed}} by B. F. Skinner [...] suggested that language is learned through operant conditioning, namely, by imitation of stimuli and by reinforcement of <b>correct</b> <b>responses.</b> This perspective {{has not been}} widely accepted at any time, but by some accounts, is experiencing a resurgence. New studies use this theory now to treat individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Additionally, Relational Frame Theory is growing from the behaviorist theory, which is important for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. [...] Some empiricist theory accounts today use behaviorist models.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{experiments}} conducted in psycholinguistics, especially earlier on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they {{may be asked to}} make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of priming effects, whereby a [...] "priming" [...] word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related [...] "target" [...] word later.|$|E

While these programs offer many benefits from traditional teaching methods, humans still need to program them. There is inconsistency in the literature regarding {{the best way to}} design such programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of three training procedures in teaching individuals to type a specified three-letter response in the presence of a corresponding symbol. Results show that the training format that prompted individuals to copy the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> before the opportunity to respond was more efficient than viewing the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> after an error, or copying the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> after an error.

2500|$|In {{behavioral}} studies, {{subjects are}} often presented with linguistic stimuli {{and asked to}} perform an action. For example, they {{may be asked to}} make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Speed (often reaction time: time taken to respond to the stimulus) and accuracy (proportion of <b>correct</b> <b>responses)</b> are commonly employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. [...] Researchers infer that the nature of the underlying process(es) required by the task gives rise to differences; slower rates and lower accuracy on these tasks are taken as measures of increased difficulty. [...] An important component of any behavioral task is that it stays relatively true to 'normal' language comprehension—the ability to generalize the results of any task is restricted when the task has little in common with how people actually encounter language.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1973 Genie seemed {{unable to}} grasp on or under on one test, {{even though she}} had {{correctly}} used on in non-test settings, but the scientists suggested this was because of logistical difficulties unique to that test. On a different test Genie at first gave <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> to on 48% of the time, and her confusion was mostly with the words in or under, but by September 1973 she showed full comprehension of both in and on. Soon afterward she began consistently including a in noun phrases, and eventually used both articles and the words and and more in noun phrases. In the early spring of that year she began to use the determiner another and started occasionally including prepositions and determiners in adverbial phrases, such as, [...] "In hospital, shot hurt arm". Genie's acquisition of locative adverbs came before she learned ones for either time or manner, which was normal, but although she started to use time adverbs a few months later she never used any manner adverbs.|$|E

2500|$|Lorazepam {{is a type}} of benzodiazepine, a {{psychoactive drug}} used for the {{short-term}} treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures including status sedation of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of aggressive patients. Research has been conducted to investigate the effects of lorazepam on TOT states in response to general knowledge question. In a recall task, participants who received lorazepam showed the same number of total recall answers to participants who had not received lorazepam. [...] However, the lorazepam participants produced more incorrect recall responses to their TOT states. Lorazepam may inhibit the retrieval of the correct response. Participants under the influence of lorazepam did not experience the subjective feeling that they were in a TOT state (i.e., the feeling of being on the verge of recalling the word). These participants experienced the subjective feeling of a TOT state only after they were told that their response was incorrect. [...] As a result, it appears that these participants are not aware that their answer is incorrect and only experience the subjective feeling of TOT states if they are told their answer is incorrect. Lorazepam may create conditions where alternative answers come to mind more easily. Furthermore, lorazepam suppresses emotions, which may be why participants taking this drug do not experience the subjective feelings that accompany TOT states; thus enabling the recall of alternative responses. These findings suggest that lorazepam does not increase the probability of TOT states but it does inhibit the retrieval of <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> and the subjective feeling of TOT states, leading participants to give incorrect answers without being aware.|$|E
