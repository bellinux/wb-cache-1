40|$|Many English verbs {{that allow}} object alternations have Kimaragang {{translation}} equivalents which alternate in very similar ways, {{in spite of}} the major morphological and syntactic differences between the two languages. This observation suggests that there must be a semantic basis for such alternations. We consider several different alternation patterns in Kimaragang in light of a proposal by Levin and Rappaport Hovav, who suggest that object alternations are impossible when the lexically specified event structure of the verb is complex; and we propose independent tests for event complexity in Kimaragang. Levin and Rappaport Hovav (L&RH; see references below) observe that the potential for object alternations in English is to some extent predictable based on the meaning of the verb. 1 They note that verbs which allow alternations, like those in (1 – 5), are primarily transitive activity verbs. In contrast, verbs like those in (6 – 8), which specify a caused change of state, do not allow such alternations. They propose that the complexity of the verb’s event structure is the critical factor. Only verbs whose inherent, lexically specified event structure is simple can alternate. Verbs with complex lexical event structures cannot alternate. (1) a. Jack sprayed paint on the wall. b. Jack sprayed the wall with paint. (2) a.

40|$|The use of {{relative}} structural timing and isotope geochronology as means of correlating Precambrian orogenic belts and testing {{the role of}} continental drift in crustal assembly was first proposed by Holmes (1951), using the network of Proterozoic orogenic belts and Archaean cratons of south-central Africa as an example. Subsequent work in the region emphasized a limited role for relative lateral movements, based principally on a distinctive outcrop pattern in which older belts occur {{on both sides of}} younger cross-cutting belts with no apparent offset. This spatial relationship is more consistent with ensialic rejuvenation than with continental collision (Kröner 1977), and perhaps the best known of these cross-cutting relationships is that between the Irumide and Zambezi belts. The Zambezi Belt is part of an east-west trending zone of Neoproterozoic tectonism that passes westwards into the Damara Orogen. It is associated with eclogite relics and reworking of older basement blocks including possible island arc and ophiolite terranes, and Coward & Daly (1984) noted that high-strain structures within the belt are consistent with significant sinistral transcurrent movement and oblique collision along a probable plate margin.

40|$|Cache {{coherence}} in {{shared memory}} multiprocessor systems {{has been studied}} mostly from an architecture viewpoint, often by means of aggregating metrics. In many cases, aggregate events provide insufficient information for programmers to understand and optimize the coherence behavior of their applications. A better understanding would be given by source-code correlations of not only aggregate events but also finer-granularity metrics directly linked to high-level source code constructs, such as source lines and data structures. In this paper, we explore a novel application-centric approach to studying coherence traffic. We develop a coherence analysis framework based on incremental coherence simulation of actual reference traces. We provide tool support to extract these reference traces and synchronization information from OpenMP threads at run-time using dynamic binary rewriting of the application executable. These traces are fed to ccSIM, our cache-coherence simulator. The novelty of ccSIM lies {{in its ability to}} relate low-level cache coherence metrics (such as coherence misses and their causative invalidations) to high-level source code constructs including source code locations and data structures. We explore the degree of freedom in interleaving data traces from different processors and assess simulation accuracy in comparison to metrics obtained from hardware performance counters. Our quantitative results show that: (a) Cache coherence traffic can be simulated with a considerable degree of accuracy for SPMD programs, as the invalidation traffic closely matches corresponding hardware performance <b>counters.</b> (<b>b)</b> Detailed high-level coherence statistics are very useful in detecting, isolating and understanding coherence bottlenecks. We use ccSIM with several well known benchmarks and find coherence optimization opportunities leading to significant reductions in coherence traffic and savings in wall clock execution time...|$|R
40|$|Past work on {{studying}} {{cache coherence}} in sharedmemory symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) concentrates on studying aggregate events, often from an architecture point of view. However, this approach provides insufficient {{information about the}} exact sources of inefficiencies in parallel applications. For SMPs in contemporary clusters, application performance is impacted by the pattern of shared memory usage, and it becomes essential to understand coherence behavior {{in terms of the}} application program constructs — such as data structures and source code lines. The technical contributions of this work are as follows. We introduce ccSIM, a cache-coherent memory simulator fed by data traces obtained through on-the-fly dynamic binary rewriting of OpenMP benchmarks executing on a Power 3 SMP node. We explore the degrees of freedom in interleaving data traces from the different processors and assess the simulation accuracy by comparing with hardware performance counters. The novelty of ccSIM lies in its ability to relate coherence traffic — specifically coherence misses as well as their progenitor invalidations — to data structures and to their reference locations in the source program, thereby facilitating the detection of inefficiencies. Our experiments demonstrate that (a) cache coherence traffic is simulated accurately for SPMD programming styles as its invalidation traffic closely matches the corresponding hardware performance <b>counters,</b> (<b>b)</b> we derive detailed coherence information indicating the location of invalidations in the application code, i. e, source line and data structures and (c) we illustrate opportunities for optimizations from these details. By exploiting these unique features of ccSim, we were able to identify and locate opportunities for program transformations, including interactions with OpenMP constructs, resulting in both significantly decreased coherence misses and savings of up to 73 % in wall-clock execution time for several real-world benchmarks. 1...|$|R

In contrast to TB, EB was less toxic to cultured HL- 60  cells during the cell counting process.

Here we demonstrate that {{in the absence of}} exogenous help, a CD 28 -B 7 interaction is necessary and sufficient for generation of class I major histocompatibility complex- specific CTL. Costimulation is required only during the inductive phase of the response, and not during the effector phase. Transfection of the CD 28 <b>counter</b> receptor, <b>B</b> 7, into nonstimulatory P 815 cells confers the ability to elicit P 815 -specific CTL, and this response can be inhibited by anti-CD 28 Fab or by the chimeric B 7 -binding protein CTLA 4 Ig. Anti- CD 28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) can provide a costimulatory signal to CD 8 + T cells when the costimulatory capacity of splenic stimulators is destroyed by chemical fixation. CD 28 -mediated signaling provokes the release of interleukin 2 (IL- 2) from the CD 8 + CTL precursors, as anti- CD 28 mAb could be substituted for by the addition of IL- 2, and an anti- IL- 2 mAb can block the generation of anti-CD 28 -induced CTL. CD 4 + cells are not involved in the costimulatory response in the systems examined.
