The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyzes}} {{civil-military relations}} in European security institutions {{by analyzing the}} organization and institutional mechanisms to exercise democratic civilian control over the military elements adapted to or emerged as a need to conduct peace operations. The goal is to assess the importance of civil-military relations in planning and conducting peace operations. European security institutions {{have been involved in}} peace keeping operations in the Balkans for more then ten years. Their effectiveness is measured by the dramatic decrease of violence. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the number of troops decreased from 60, 000 in 1996, when NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) was deployed, to a planned 2, 500 at the end of 2007. The number of military forces involved in providing security, a normal task for them, is even smaller. The thesis argues that one of the factors which influenced the improvement of the effectiveness of the peace-keeping forces in Balkans after NATO took over the mission in 1995 is that NATO and EU military forces received clear missions and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> from their political decision-making bodies. Because civilian structures did not micro-manage the conduct of operations despite the complex environment in which they operated, their effectiveness increased. Romanian Air Force author...|$|E

25|$|Moreover, criticisms {{have been}} made {{on the way the}} {{operation}} was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues.|$|R

40|$|Der Bericht entwickelt die Besonderheiten {{regional}}politischer Steuerung aus drei Kernthemen der Problematik politischer Steuerung: der Diskussion neuerer gesellschaftlicher Steuerungsmodelle, der Idee der Kontextsteuerung und der Konzeption gemischt öffentlichprivater Steuerungsregimes. Hauptanliegen des Berichts ist eine präzisere Bestimmung der Steuerungskompetenzen der Politik im Bereich neuer Technologien, insbesondere des Multimedia-Bereichs. Die Grundthese der Argumentation ist, daß politische Steuerung nicht (mehr) hierarchisch-direkt ansetzen kann, sondern auf Kooperationsregimes verwiesen ist, welche zugleich die transregionale Vernetzung und Einbettung regionaler Veränderungsprozesse anzielen. Wichtigste Leistungen der Regionalpolitik sind Wissensmanagement und Infrastrukturentwicklung als Kernelemente einer Orientierung auf Support und Supervision. The report {{looks at}} the scope for regional <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> {{from the vantage point}} of recent models of <b>political</b> <b>guidance,</b> of the idea of contextual guidance, and of the concept of privatepublic partnerships. The main goal of the paper is to give a more conclusive and concise description of the possibilities and limits of political intervention in advancing multimedia technologies, contents and uses. The report argues that <b>political</b> intervention and <b>guidance</b> needs to rely on cooperative regimes based on private-public partnerships and a transregional network to support regional transformation. The core resources of regional policies are knowledge management and the development of intelligent infrastructures within a context of providing political support and concertation for networks of cooperation...|$|R
