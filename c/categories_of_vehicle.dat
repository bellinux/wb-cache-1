50|$|The new B-Spec mode puts {{players in}} the place of a racing crew chief: telling the driver how aggressively to drive, when to pass, and mandating pit stops (by {{monitoring}} tire wear and fuel level). The speed of the time in the race can be increased up to 3x, allowing for Endurance races to be completed in less time than would take in A-Spec mode. The 3x feature, however, must be turned on after every pit stop because it resets to normal time. The game manual says that the player may speed up B-Spec mode by up to 5x, but this is believed to be a typo. B-Spec points are given out for each race completed in B-Spec mode. This increases the skill level of the AI driver in the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> skill, course skill, and battle skill. Players can thereby use B-Spec mode in harder races as the game progresses, but this mode cannot be used on wet, dirt and snow courses.|$|E
50|$|The {{suitability}} of Japan's domestically sold cars for export {{to other countries}} is constrained by various factors. Vehicles in Japan have right-hand drive—the driver's seat {{is on the right}} side of the vehicle—in accord with Japan's left-hand traffic. Some countries with right-hand traffic permit right-hand drive vehicles, though right-traffic headlamps are generally unavailable for models exclusive to Japan. Some countries with right traffic do not allow right-hand drive cars, but in some such markets the extensive labor required to convert a car to left-hand drive is economically feasible; such conversions are sometimes done by the local importers. The Philippines is an example of a market where such conversion is common, until recently, when the importation of such used vehicles (except for heavy vehicles) was banned by E0 156. Japan's automobile safety regulations also differ substantially from the ECE Regulations used throughout most of the world and the U.S. North American regulations that apply in the United States and Canada. Vehicle components such as windows and windshields, seat belts, lamps and reflectors, and mirrors, as well as design features for crashworthiness such as bumpers, fuel tanks, and structural rigidity of vehicles meant for the Japanese market may not comply with non-Japanese standards. They often lack structural reinforcements needed to meet side-impact crashworthiness standards in effect outside Japan. Moreover, entire <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> such as Kei cars, do not exist in regulations outside Japan.|$|E

40|$|Advances {{in motor}} vehicle {{engineering}} will allow greater refinement {{of the dynamic}} qualities of passenger cars in the near future. This paper describes the development and initial validation of a reliable and valid multidimensional scale to assess these parameters based upon a technique previously developed to evaluate aircraft handling qualities. The scaling methodology developed emphasizes {{the interaction between the}} vehicle's dynamic behaviour and the category of vehicle (e. g. sports car, executive saloon). This three-part study describes the initial extraction and the subsequent verification of the scale dimensions from an analysis of the opinions of circa 500 drivers, followed by an evaluation of the sensitivity and diagnosticity of the scale to distinguish between the road behaviour exhibited by vehicle types. The results suggest that the scale shows both content and construct validity, being able to distinguish both between broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> and different models of vehicle within a particular category in a consistent and meaningful manner...|$|E
40|$|Because fixed missile bases {{have become}} {{increasingly}} vulnerable to strategic nuclear attack, an air-mobile missile system is proposed, whereby ICBMs can be launched from the hold of large subsonic aircraft following a missile-assisted supersonic dash of the aircraft to a safe distance from their base (about 50 n mi). Three major <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> design are presented: staged, which employs vertical take-off and a single solid rocket booster {{similar to that used}} on the Space Shuttle; unstaged, which employs vertical take-off and four internally-carried reusable liquid rocket engines; and alternative concepts, some using horizontal take-off with duct-burning afterburners. Attention is given to the economics of maintaining 200 ICBMs airborne during an alert (about $ 600 million for each fleet alert, exclusive of acquisition costs). The chief advantages of the system lie in its reduced vulnerability to suprise attack, because it can be launched on warning, and in the possibility for recall of the aircraft if the warning proves to be a false alarm...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Crash test based {{consumer}} information systems, such as EuroNCAP or US NCAP, have indicated a substantial {{reduction in the}} risk of serious injury to car occupants since the mid- 1990 s. In parallel with these improving experimental results, there has been a steady reduction in the total numbers of car occupants seriously or fatally injured and it has been generally assumed that improved crash protection accounts for much of the reductions observed societally. Nevertheless, there has been very little analysis of the relationship between experimental results and any real reductions in casualties because of the influence of confounding effects of other parameters including the exposure to risk of different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the underlying trends in mobility. This paper uses UK national accident data and recently available exposure data to evaluate the developments of risk of fatal or serious injury in parallel with the risks of crash involvement...|$|E
40|$|The recogniseability <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{can be much}} {{improved}} by standardisation of their illumination. In particular the standardisation of the rear-lights of cars, trucks, lorries and bicycles is important {{from the point of}} view of road safety. The conspicuousness <b>of</b> all <b>vehicles</b> can be improved when vehicles have their lights on during daylight. These are the main conclusions of research aimed at reducing front-rear collisions and collisions with parked vehicles. It is suggested that vehicles should be subdivided into seven categories. Bicycles should have a red rear light and a yellow one below it. On cars the rear lights must be placed as far as possible from each other. Lorries and trucks should have four red rear lights. Signal lights on cars should be divided, in particular braking and rear lights. standardisation of an emergency-stop signal is suggested. The use of illumination during daylight must not be limited to one <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b> If one <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> is more easily discernible, the other ones will be less so...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that individual variations in driving style {{have a significant impact}} on vehicle energy efficiency. The literature shows certain parameters have been linked to good fuel economy, specifically acceleration, throttle use, number of stop/starts and gear change behaviours. The primary aim of this study was to examine what driving parameters are specifically related to good fuel economy using a non-homogeneous extended data set of vehicles and drivers over real-world driving scenarios spanning two countries. The analysis presented in this paper shows how three completely independent studies looking at the same factor (i. e., the influence of driver behaviour on fuel efficiency) can be evaluated, and, despite their notable differences in location, environment, route, vehicle and drivers, can be compared on broadly similar terms. The data from the three studies were analysed in two ways; firstly, using expert analysis and the second a purely data driven approach. The various models and experts concurred that a combination of at least one factor from the each of the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed, engine speed, acceleration and throttle position were required to accurately predict the impact on fuel economy. The identification of standard deviation of speed as the primary contributing factor to fuel economy, as identified by both the expert and data driven analysis, is also an important finding. Finally, this study has illustrated how various seemingly independent studies can be brought together, analysed as a whole and meaningful conclusions extracted from the combined data set...|$|E
40|$|In India, the {{unprecedented}} growth rate and urbanization {{along with the}} rapid increase in motor vehicle activity and industrialization are contributing {{to high levels of}} urban air pollution. The population is mainly exposed to high air pollution concentrations, where motor vehicle emissions constitute the main source of fine and ultrafine particles. Motor exhaust emissions is a mixture of gases and Particulate Matter (PM). Diesel and petrol fuels in vehicles produce combustion-derived particles as a result of combustion. Vehicle exhaust particles are the main constituents of environmental nanoparticles. In the present investigation, environmental nanoparticles such as Diesel Exhaust Particles (DEP) and Petrol Exhaust Particles (PEP) were collected from on-road vehicles using a specially designed collection chamber. The surface morphology of the collected particles was analyzed through Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and the elemental mapping was performed through EDAX analysis. Results indicated the presence of nanometer-size particles in both the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> exhaust. These small-size particles of respirable range can enter the respiratory tract of humans and get deposited in the lungs and cause various effects inside the human body. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the cytotoxicity of the collected Diesel Exhaust Nanoparticles (DENPs) and Petrol Exhaust Nanoparticles (PENPs).

40|$|The {{vibration}} in 100 different vehicles {{has been}} measured, evaluated and assessed according to British Standard BS 6841 (1987) and International Standard ISO 2631 (1997). Vibration {{was measured in}} 14 <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> including cars, lift trucks, tractors, lorries, vans and buses. In each vehicle, the vibration was measured in five axes: vertical vibration beneath the seat, fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical vibration on the seat pan and fore-and-aft vibration at the backrest. The alternative methods of evaluating the vibration (use of different frequency weightings, different averaging methods, the inclusion of different axes, vibration dose values and equivalent r. m. s. acceleration) as defined in the standards have been compared. BS 6841 (1987) suggests that an equivalent acceleration magnitude is calculated using vibration measured at four locations around the seat (x -, y -, z -seat and x -backrest); ISO 2631 (1997) suggests that vibration is measured in the three translational axes only on the seat pan but only the axis with the most severe vibration is used to assess vibration severity. Assessments made using the procedure defined in ISO 2631 tend to underestimate any risks from exposure to whole-body vibration compared to an evaluation made using the guidelines specified in BS 6841; the measurements indicated that the 17 m/s 1. 75 "health guidance caution zone" in ISO 2631 was {{less likely to be}} exceeded than the 15 m/s 1. 75 "action level" in BS 6841.
