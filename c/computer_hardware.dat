5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be {{understood}} as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive <b>computer</b> <b>hardware.</b> In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E

In September, the Chinese government chose Windows to be the operating system of choice in that country, and entered into {{an agreement with the}} company to standardize a Chinese version of the operating system. Microsoft also released the Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro joystick in an attempt to further expand its profile in the <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> market.|$|E

In September 1961, NASA's Space Task Group was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston, Texas, and Lunney moved with it.

5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern <b>computer</b> <b>hardware.</b> The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Pixar {{continued}} its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become {{its most important}} partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced {{the total number of}} employees to just 42, essentially its original number. Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> was complete.|$|E

5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much <b>computer</b> <b>hardware</b> inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E
