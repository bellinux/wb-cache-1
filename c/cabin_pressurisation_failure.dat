40|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} high altitude operations are generally pressurised {{to protect the}} occupants from the adverse effects of hypoxia, decompression illness and hypothermia. <b>Failure</b> of the <b>pressurisation</b> system is a potential threat to flight safety. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and consequences of aircraft decompression events in Australian civil aviation. The aim was to document the prevalence, nature, type, degree and extent of decompression events in Australian civil aviation, as well as the consequences of such events, especially hypoxia and pressure-related medical effects. A search of all incidents and accidents on the ATSB database was made for <b>pressurisation</b> <b>failure</b> events between 1 January 1975 and 31 March 2006. A total of 517 <b>pressurisation</b> <b>failure</b> events were found (two accidents, eight serious incidents and 507 incidents). Only one <b>pressurisation</b> <b>failure</b> event was fatal (0. 2 per cent of the total events). Hypoxia was reported in four of the events, and ear barotrauma was also reported in four events, due to the subsequent emergency descent. A total of 10 events involved death, hypoxia or minor injury. Mechanical factors were responsible for the majority of <b>pressurisation</b> system <b>failures</b> (73 per cent). The average rate of cabin pressure change was 1, 700 feet per minute, and the average maximum cabin altitude reached was 10, 978 feet. In general, the results of this study show that there is a high chance of surviving a <b>pressurisation</b> system <b>failure,</b> provided that the failure is recognised and the corresponding emergency procedures are carried out expeditiously. Aircrew should maintain a high level of vigilance with respect to the potential hazards of <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> system <b>failure...</b>|$|R

50|$|The F27 was {{developed}} during the early 1950s with the expressed intent of producing a capable successor to the earlier piston engine-powered airliners that had become commonplace on the market, such as the successful Douglas DC-3. A key innovation of the F27 was {{the adoption of the}} Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine, which produced substantially less vibration and noise which provided improved conditions for passengers; another major comfort feature was <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation.</b> Innovative manufacturing techniques were also employed in the aircraft's construction.|$|R
50|$|When an oil {{metering}} unit was installed on a <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> blower, locking wire {{was used to}} ensure the five securing nuts did not rotate and become loose. In the wreckage of number 2 cabin blower accident investigators found none of the nuts and no locking wire. The investigators believed that when the blower was last overhauled the oil {{metering unit}} may have been re-attached without locking wire securing the nuts. The blower was overhauled and then installed on VH-RMI in April 1966.|$|R

For example, without intervention exposure to high G force would cause the pilots to lose consciousness through lack of blood to the brain - G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC). Medical effects caused by flying, such hypoxia and the effects of G-force are researched at the Centre (Eurofighter Typhoon pilots regularly experience 9G). Other dangers include rapid uncontrolled decompression from <b>failure</b> of <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation,</b> and the centre has four hypobaric chambers.|$|R
5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, and other materials new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|R
50|$|The DFS 228 was {{designed}} by Felix Kracht and a first prototype was completed in March 1944 and was undergoing gliding tests by August, carried aloft piggyback, strut-mounted atop a Dornier Do 217. The aircraft was of conventional sailplane design, with long, slender wings, and intended to land on a retractable skid mounted on its belly. The nose of the aircraft could be separated in an emergency, and formed a self-contained, pressurised escape capsule for the pilot. Because of problems with the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> system, the second prototype accommodated the pilot in a prone position.|$|R

XM607, captained by Flight Lieutenant Martin Withers, took over.|$|R
50|$|Basing {{their design}} on the Whirlwind, Westland {{developed}} the Welkin high altitude interceptor, Penrose flying the prototype in November 1942. He described how the cabin was 'like {{sitting in an}} oven' due to the unshielded <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> blowers. He developed pneumonia in early 1943 which he attributed to the extreme changes in temperature on leaving the Welkins cabin drenched in sweat and the bitter wind across the airfield. He survived thanks to the recently discovered M&B drug. As {{a result of this}} illness Petter devised a better method for cooling the cabin. Penrose contrasted the arctic conditions in the open cockpits of the PV.3/Wallace during the high altitude flights with the 'delightfully warm' cabin of the Welkin, describing these flights as the 'peak of experience'.|$|R

To provide a buffer for those not fully fit, the maximum certified cabin altitude in normal operation is 8, 000 ft. During flight, air is derived from the compression stage of the jet engine or, {{in the case of the}} B 787, from electrically driven compressors.

5000|$|SNCAC {{began work}} on two prototypes as a private venture in 1938. These two prototypes {{were not to be}} fitted with <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation,</b> {{although}} this was planned for a third prototype. The French Air Ministry placed an order for the two prototypes on 24 April 1939, with the second aircraft to carry full armament. The first prototype, designated NC.150.01, made its maiden flight from Toussus-le-Noble on 11 May 1939. Meanwhile, the French Air Ministry had become worried about possible delays to the Lioré et Olivier LeO 45 and Amiot 354 twin-engined bombers which were planned to re-equip the medium bomber squadrons of the Armée de l'Air caused by shortages of light alloys, and after successful testing in early 1940, ordered a change of plans. Pressurisation was to be abandoned, and the unusual central supercharger with its dedicated engine (known as the [...] "bi-tri" [...] concept) was to be replaced by individually supercharged engines. Two production versions were planned, the NC.152, powered by Hispano-Suiza engines, and the NC.153, with imported American radial engines.|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually {{determined that}} the rotors in the <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation</b> blower on number 2 engine began to break up, resulting in severe vibration that loosened the nuts securing the oil metering unit to the blower and allowed oil to escape freely. [...] The rear bearing {{of one of the}} rotors also came free, so the rotor gyrated, causing metal-to-metal contact and great heat. [...] The blower was located aft of the firewall, and a fire started {{in the rear of the}} nacelle when the escaping oil was ignited by contact with the hot metal in the damaged blower. The fire burned the engine control rods, preventing feathering of the propeller. [...] Burning oil flowed into the wheel bay and from there into the leading edge of the left wing, where the fire breached the wall of a fuel tank. The abundant supply of fuel caused the fire to spread throughout much of the left wing and become so intense it caused softening of aluminium alloy and loss of strength of the upper boom (or upper flange) in the wing spar. The spar was critically weakened in the region between number 1 and 2 engines.|$|R

50|$|A licence {{will contain}} {{one or more}} ratings. These are sub-qualifications that specify in more detail the exact {{privileges}} that the licence conveys. One type of rating is an Aircraft rating. This specifies the type or types of aircraft which can be flown, and is either a Class rating, when a whole broad class of aircraft can be flown, or a Type rating where the privileges are confined to a single type or group of very closely related types. The very basic aircraft rating usually obtained by PPL(A) holders at their initial skills test is the Single Engine Piston Landplane (SEP-land) Class Rating. This allows flight of single-piston-engined, non-turbocharged, fixed-pitch propeller, fixed tricycle gear, non-pressurised land aeroplanes (with a few exceptions). SEP class rating holders may optionally extend the privileges of this rating to cover complex features by taking formal differences training from a suitably qualified instructor. There are five categories of difference: tailwheel aircraft, retractable undercarriage, variable-pitch propeller, turbocharged engine and <b>cabin</b> <b>pressurisation.</b> There is no formal test for any difference training; the training is signed off as satisfactorily completed in the pilot's logbook by the instructor conducting the training. Other class ratings include Multi Engine Piston (MEP) landplane, Single and Multi engined piston Seaplane, Single Engine Turbine (SET) and Touring Motor Gliders. Note: There is no MET class rating, as multi engine turbine and all jet powered aircraft require a type rating. To add these to their licence a pilot has to undergo a course of training and pass an additional skills test. Differences training is also required for certain complex features within these class ratings. Aircraft ratings are type-specific for multi engine turboprop & all jet aircraft {{and for a few}} other very complex types. To obtain one of these a pilot must undergo specific training and pass a skills test. It is also possible to obtain permission from the CAA to fly an aircraft not covered by any type or class rating.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates three {{problems}} in the general area of environmental fluid mechanics. The first two problems are related to liquid or gas flow through clay-water suspensions, with relevance for the underground storage of radioactive waste and also for understanding the mechanism of eruption in mud volcanoes. The third problem centres on the different problem of mixing in a turbulent buoyant plume. First, the injection of gas and water from a central source into a two-dimensional layer of clay confined between two circular horizontal plates is investigated. This provides {{a model of the}} potential <b>pressurisation</b> and <b>failure</b> of the seal rock around a radioactive waste repository as may arise if gas is continuously generated in the repository. As the gas injection pressure is gradually increased the cell walls deform and the clay moves radially outwards. However, at a critical radius, the liquid-clay interface becomes unstable and a series of channels propagate through the clay. When one of the channels reaches the edge of the domain the gas escapes and the pressure is released. As a result, the domain relaxes by elastic deformation and the clay seals the channel. In this way, continuous fluid injection leads to episodic release of gas from the cell. The second problem concerns the flow of mud along a vertical conduit driven by the combined effect of reservoir pressure and buoyancy associated with the gas injected {{at the base of the}} conduit. This represents an analogue model of the eruption of a mud volcano, in which mud rises from a deep reservoir to the surface. I find that the pressure associated with the reservoir and any buoyancy force produced by the migration of gas from deep in the reservoir to the surface leads to a continuous eruption if the net pressure is greater than the yield stress of the clay. If the reservoir pressure falls during such an event, the eruption will eventually stop, once the pressure reaches a dynamic yield stress condition. Only later, if the reservoir pressure increases to the static yield stress of the clay will the eruption start again, and this can lead to a series of eruption cycles which depend on the non-Newtonian rheology of the clay. In contrast, if this pressure is smaller than the yield stress of the clay, a series of episodic gas burst events can occur until the conduit is cleared of mud. The third problem relates to the mixing in a turbulent buoyant plume. Through a series of new experiments and some complementary theoretical modelling I show that the mixing in a turbulent plume is strongly affected by the eddies and leads to significant longitudinal dispersion in the flow. The implications of the modelling for determining the residence time distribution of the fluid in the plume is discussed...|$|R
