40|$|Many {{juvenile}} {{salmon and}} trout migrated from the Lemhi River drainage each fallwinter-spring period. Seaward migration of anadromous trout and salmon normally occurred inthe spring but pre-smolt anadromous and non-anadromous fishes also left the stream usuallybeginning in the fall. I compared data on temperature, food abundance, stream flow, cover andpopulation density with movements and conducted field and laboratory tests to determinereasons for {{the two types of}} movements. Smolts of the anadromous species migrated for an obvious reason but none of the factors Iexamined appeared to 2 ̆ 7 stimulate or release 2 ̆ 7 their seaward migration. Movement frequentlycoincided with changes in water temperature and stream flow, but I could not establish aconsistent causal relationship and concluded that photoperiod and perhaps growth must initiatethe physiological and behavioural changes associated with seaward migration. Non-anadromous and pre-smolt anadromous species emigrated from the streams for differentreasons than the smolts. I postulated that fish found the stream environment unsuitable duringthe winter. Stream temperature declined in the fall as fish began moving from the streams but Icould not induce more fish to stay in test troughs with 12 C water versus troughs with 0 - 10 <b>Cwater.</b> Fish emigrated before abundance of drift insects declined in winter. Emigration occurred inspite of the relatively stable flows in both streams. Population density modified the basic migrationpattern by regulating the number and percentage of fish that emigrated and to a limited extenttime of emigration. Movements of non-smolt trout and salmon correlated best with the amount of cover provided bylarge rubble substrate. Subyearling trout emigrated from Big Springs Creek which contained norubble substrate but remained in the Lemhi River which did. In both field and laboratory testsmore fish remained in troughs or stream sections with large rubble substrate than in troughs orsections with gravel substrate. Trout and salmon in many Idaho streams enter the substrate whenstream temperatures declined to 4 - 6 C. A suitable substrate providing adequate intersticesappears necessary or the fish leave...|$|E
40|$|Consultation {{with and}} {{inclusion}} of the public on measures to manage and improve water resources is a key tenet of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This involves establishing people 2 ̆ 019 s opinions but also the perspectives (both metaphoric and literal) which inform these. In particular water is a complex and dynamic spatial entity with many spatial expressions relating to its various functions, so perspectives as to its utility and proper management are equally various. In establishing a catchment rather than discipline based approach to management, the WFD recognises the spatially integrated nature of the issues. It also poses a challenge to research, in that the pattern presented by the interaction between human and biophysical processes is a compound of {{the complexities of the}} two systems. Capturing the detail of such a pattern from a sample requires a strategy which is sensitive to the relevant dynamics of each system. This paper considers a case study relating to a postal survey carried out by the Macaulay Institute on behalf of the EU Life Environment Fund 2 ̆ 019 s Ythan Project, which aimed to develop wider participation in the protection of the River Ythan (Scotland 2 ̆ 019 s first Nitrate Vulnerable Zone). A thousand questionnaires were sent to residents and farmers in the Ythan catchment in spring 2002, for comparison the adjacent River Ugie and the more distant Loch Leven catchments were surveyed the following year. The methodology presented represents the attempt to maximise at the design stage the utility this data would have for analysis of responses in relation to both respondent 2 ̆ 019 s social-environs and the proximity of the water body, as well as to ensure a representative over all sample. The somewhat awkward term 2 ̆ 01 <b>cwater</b> body 2 ̆ 01 d highlights the difficulties for the key issue of definition, be that for rivers and lochs, or people, residences and urban areas. The decisions made with regards to definition are explained and results from the survey presented illustrating the practical significance of initial object definitions in conditioning the outcome. The importance of considering spatial aspects post survey is also highlighted. Keywords: Spatial, Sampling, Water Framework Directive, Survey...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{establishes}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) {{in marine}} water for 34 priority substances. Among these substances, 25 are hydrophobic and bioaccumulable (2 metals and 23 organic compounds). For these 25 substances, monitoring in water matrix {{is not appropriate}} and an alternative matrix should be developed. Bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels (Mytilus edulis, Mytilus galloprovincialis), are used by Ifremer as a quantitative biological indicator since 1979 in France, to assess the marine water quality. This study {{has been carried out}} in order to determine thresholds in mussels at least as protective as EQS in marine water laid down by the WFD. Three steps are defined: -	Provide an overview of knowledges about the relations between the concentrations of contaminants in the marine water and mussels through bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and bioconcentration factor (BCF). This allows to examine how a BCF or a BAF can be determined: BCF can be determined experimentally (according to US EPA or ASTM standards), or by Quantitative Activity-Structure Relationship models (QSAR) : four equations can be used for mussels. BAF can be determined by field experiment; but none standards exists. It could be determined by using QSAR but this method is considered as invalid for mussels, or by using existing model: Dynamic Budget Model, but this is complex to use. -	Collect concentrations data in marine water (<b>Cwater)</b> in bibliography for those 25 substances; and compare them with concentration in mussels (Cmussels) obtained through French monitoring network of chemicals contaminants (ROCCH) and biological integrator network RINBIO. According to available data, this leads to determine the BAF or the BCF (Cmussels /Cwater) with field data. -	Compare BAF and BCF values (when available) obtained with various methods for these substances: BCF (stemming from the bibliography, using experimental process), BCF calculated by QSAR and BAF determined using field data. This study points out that experimental BCF data are available for 3 substances (Chlorpyrifos, HCH, Pentachlorobenzene). BCF by QSAR can be calculated for 20 substances. The use of field data allows to evaluate 4 BAF for organic compounds and 2 BAF for metals. Using these BAF or BCF value, thresholds in shellfish can be determined as an alternative to EQS in marine water...|$|E
40|$|The {{difference}} in the affinity for water of peptide groups embedded in different molecular environments was investigated. The chemical shift of an amide proton is sensitive to conformational variations, {{as well as to}} changes in the molecular environment [D. S. Wishat, B. D. Sykes and F. M. Richards, J. Mol. Biol., 222 (1991) 3112 ̆ 013333]. Therefore, if the conformational motions are minimized or excluded, the observed changes in the chemical shift can simply be related to the environmental effects. The conformation(s) of the cyclic 3 ̆b 2 -turn models studied in this work has been previously reported using X-ray, NMR, circular dichroism, and (FT-IR) spectroscopic methods, as well as MD calculations. [M. Holl 3 si, K. E. K 6 ver, S. Holly, L. Radics and G. D. Fasman, Biopolymers, 26 (1987) 15272 ̆ 0131572; A. Perczel, M. Holl 3 si, B. M. Foxman and G. D. Fasman, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113 (1991) 97722 ̆ 0139784; and H. H. Mantsch, A. Perczel, M. Holl 3 si and G. D. Fasman, Biopolymers, 33 (1993) 2012 ̆ 013207]. The backbone of the cyclo[(3 ̆b 4) Ava 2 ̆ 014 Gly 2 ̆ 014 Pro 2 ̆ 014 Aaa 2 ̆ 014 Gly] (where Aaa = Ser(OtBu), Ser or Thr(OtBu), and 3 ̆b 4 (Ava) is 3 ̆b 4 -aminovaleric acid) compounds was found to be rigidly incorporated in the structure and to contain two intramolecular hydrogen bonds. These 3 ̆b 2 -turn models also include one (or two) 2 ̆ 01 cfree 2 ̆ 01 d amide group(s) that are not involved in any type of interaction. The 2 ̆ 01 <b>cwater</b> titration 2 ̆ 01 d of these amide groups in acetonitrile, where they are involved in various degrees of hydrogen bonding, revealed their molecular environment. Owing to the rigidity of these structures, the observed changes in the amide proton chemical shifts, during titration were attributed to their involvement in hydrogen bonding. This was confirmed by monitoring the water titration simultaneously with FT-IR spectroscopy. The phenomenon described here, with the proposed characterization of the investigated peptide/water system, comprise an improvement in the NMR method for analyzing the hydrogen bonding of small rigid peptides.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 1999 Ülkemizdeki ısıtma sistemlerinde doğal gazın yakıt olarak kullanılmaya başlanması ile birlikte bireysel ısıtma daha fazla tercih edilen bir uygulama haline gelirken radyatör kullanımında da önemli artışlar olmuştur. Bireysel ve merkezi ısıtma uygulamalarında değişik malzemelerden ve değişik tiplerde radyatörler kullanılmaktadır. Radyatör seçimindeki önemli kriterler maliyet, birim ısıl verim, kullanım ömrü, ısıtma sistemlerine uygunluğu ve rejime girme süreleridir. Enerji tasarrufu sağlaması açısından radyatörlerin rejime girme süreleri, seçilen ısıtma sistemine uygunluk ve birim ısıl verimleri son derece önemlidir. Bu çalışmada ısıtma cihazlarının ısıl davranışları incelenmiş farklı malzemelerdeki radyatör tipleri için {{transfer}} fonksiyonları çıkartılarak, bu fonksiyonların zaman sabitleri hesaplanmıştır. Sıcak su panel radyatöre girdiğinde, radyatörün kanalları içinde soğumakta olan suyla, arasında bir miktar karışma meydana gelecektir. Mükemmel karışımın belirtisi su sıcaklığının radyatör boyunca aynı sıcaklıkta olmasıdır. Panel radyatörün ısıl reaksiyonu;As {{the individual}} heating becomes a more preferred application within {{the beginning of}} natural gas usage at the heating systems in our country, there also have been increases in radiator using. Radiators of different materials and with different types are being used in individual and central heating. The most important creations in radiator selection is cost, thermal output per unit, life time, appropriateness to heating system and time constant. Time constant, appropriateness to the heating system chosen and thermal output per unit are very important {{in the case of}} saving energy. With this work, the thermal attitudes of heating equipment have been examined and the time constants of transfer functions found for the radiators of different types have been calculated. When hot water enters a panel radiator some mixing will occur between it and water already cooling in radiator's channels. The symptom of perfect mixing would be that the water temperature throughout the radiator. The equation for the thermal response of the panel radiator; CR =mwater <b>cwater</b> + mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In some designs of low water content radiator, the radiator channels consist in fact of a small number of pipes bonded to the convector surface. Very little mixing would be expected to take place in such an arrangement. The equation for the thermal response of the aluminum radiator; Cm: Thermal capacity of metal = mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In the much older column radiator the thermal mass of iron columns may not be correctly modeled by simply aggregating it with the water content as was inferred earlier for the steel panel radiator. In effect this gives two equations describing the radiator dynamics; Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; The risk of instability and system gain had been examined by comparing radiator output at different flow temperatures. The risk of instability therefore occurs at low load condition. The risk can be reduced by separately reducing the flow temperatures in accordance with external load. In addition to this it was given transfer function at fluctuations in water flow rate and fluctuations flow temperature by examining behavior of coils, embedded heating panels. For fluctuations in water flow rate: For fluctuations in water flow temperature: (? = ?c 0 / v) The BSRIA model estimates these time constants on the basis of length of tubes per circuit actively transferring heat, the number of tubes per header, the water velocity in the tube and the air velocity through the heat exchanger. It has been seen that the time constants of aluminum radiators are shorter than the other radiator types. Panel, iron and steel radiators are following aluminum radiators. Radiators, which have shorter time constant, will be adept to any changes in the systems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
