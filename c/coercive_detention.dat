40|$|Between 8 : 30 and 9 : 00 a. m. on 16 June 1948, three Europeans {{were shot}} {{dead in the}} Sungei Siput area of Perak in {{northern}} Malaya. The three were estate managers of rubber plantations, and the perpetrators were guerrillas in the “mobile corps” of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The shootings were {{the culmination of a}} long series of attacks and “outrages” against estate managers in Penang, Selangor, and the southern state of Johore. Late that afternoon, the colonial government {{declared a state of emergency}} in Perak and Johore that was extended, two days later, to the whole ofMalaya. An immediate casualty was respect for civil liberties. Under emergency regulations the authorities enacted a range of draconian measures, including a ban on “seditious” publications; the introduction of <b>coercive</b> powers of <b>detention,</b> arrest, trial, deportation, and “banishment”; the establishment of the death penalty for anyone carrying unauthorized ªrearms; and the registration of the entire adult population...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} detention of asylum-seekers, more specifically how European Union law simultaneously constructs the asylum-seeker as a detainable subject, while also limiting States’ powers of detention. The power to detain {{is limited by}} international refugee and human rights law, but European Union law sets more stringent standards. While international refugee law regards the asylum-seeker as a presumptive refugee, European Union law seems {{to take a different}} view. Nowadays, the legal and physical rite of passage from irregular migrant to asylum-seeker to refugee defines the predicament of refugees who seek protection in the European Union. Asylum-seekers are vulnerable to detention as irregular entrants, when they are in transit in search of effective protection, and if they become deportable under the Dublin System. <b>Coercive</b> forms of <b>detention</b> are, too glibly in our view, assumed to be permitted to ensure they cooperate with identification and registration processes. The article aims to problematise this detainability of asylum-seekers, examining in particular how their increasing deportability and transferability may increase their detainability. Drawing on empirical examples from the treatment of refugees arriving in the European Union in 2015, it suggests that the Union’s legal limits on detention need further implementation and institutionalisation...|$|R
40|$|This {{review of}} Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency argues that Posner 2 ̆ 7 s {{particular}} brand of pragmatic utilitarianism is particularly ill-suited to constitutional interpretation, {{as it seems}} to negate the very idea of precommitment that is so essential to constitutionalism. Instead, Posner treats the Constitution as little more than an invitation to pragmatic policy judgment, and then employs that judgment through speculative cost-benefit balancing to find constitutionally unobjectionable most of what the Bush Administration has done thus far in the war on terror, including <b>coercive</b> interrogation, incommunicado <b>detention,</b> warrantless wiretapping, and ethnic profiling. Indeed, Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution would permit the Administration to go much further than it has - among other things, he defends indefinite preventive detention, banning Islamic extremist rhetoric, mass wiretapping of the entire nation, and making it a crime for newspapers to publish classified information. All of this is permissible, Posner argues, because unless the Constitution bend[s] in the face of threats to our national security, it will break. Ironically, Posner reaches these results with a constitutional theory more in keeping with Chief Justice Earl Warren than Justice Antonin Scalia. Eschewing popular conservative attacks on judicial activism, Posner argues that given the open-ended character of many of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s most important terms, it is not objectionable, but inevitable, that constitutional law is judge-made. He dismisses the constitutional theories of textualism and originalism favored by many conservative judges and scholars as canards. But having rejected textualism and originalism, Posner proceeds unwittingly to offer a book-length demonstration of what textualists and originalists most fear from constitutional theorists who emphasize the document 2 ̆ 7 s open-ended and evolving character. In Posner 2 ̆ 7 s approach, the Constitution loses almost any sense of a binding precommitment, and is reduced to a cover for judges to impose their own subjective value judgments on others. The review first discusses Posner 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of several specific security-liberty issues, in order to illustrate how his method works in concrete scenarios. I then turn to the broader implications his theory has for constitutional law, which in my view are quite dangerous...|$|R
