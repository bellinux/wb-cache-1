These pieces are glazed on the interior, with the outside decorated with black and or pastillaje (small bits of clay rolled into designs). Most of the pottery {{is made in the}} city of Puebla, especially in the Barrio de la Luz neighborhood. This kind of pottery-making remains a viable occupation because of the creativity and organization of the artisans who work principally to make large size cooking utensils. Production can be highly specialized among artisans, with those dedicated to different aspects of the process such as molding and firing. The making of these utensils survives because traditional rural cooking techniques still survive {{in many parts of the}} state, where meals are prepared in clay pots over wood fires, especially for major festivities and celebrations.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{productive}} archaeological site is Aratashen, Armenia: a village occupied between 5000 and 3000 BC (Neolithic and Copper Age). The archaeological excavations have provided thousands of {{pieces from the}} knapping of obsidian (suggesting that Aratashen was a centre of production and trade of artefacts of that highly regarded stone); {{the rest of the}} archaeological record consists mainly of fragments of <b>common</b> <b>pottery,</b> ground stones, and other agricultural tools. Analysing a sample of 200 lithic flakes and blades, selected from the best-preserved pieces, it is possible to differentiate between those used in sickles and those used in threshing boards. The lithic blades of obsidian were knapped using highly developed and standardized methods, {{such as the use of}} a [...] "pectoral crutch" [...] with a copper point.

50|$|In 1983, G. Möbes {{published}} {{a number of}} new finds from Thuringia. In Großbrembach in Sömmerda a nearly square complex with rounded corners measuring 10.8 x 10.4 metres contains two crouching inhumations lying on their right sides and oriented south-north. The grave ditch was described as partially flat, partially trough shaped. Bright bands in the soil filling seem to indicate the inflow of water. Unetice stone packed graves around it indicate that the flat barrow must have remained well known. A similar complex was investigated in 1974 at Sommerberg near Großfahner in the proximity of Erfurt. It was a 19/17 x 15.5/14.5 metre trapezoid containing a 2.3 metre wide grave. The west side was overlapped by a small burial hut of the Corded Ware culture with several skeletons. This Corded Ware grave in the centre also shows that the main tomb must have remained well known even 1000 years after its construction. This reuse by later cultures, including the Globular Amphora culture and the Unetice culture, is <b>common.</b> <b>Pottery</b> was found as grave goods, including combinations of pitchers and cups.|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} visual, mineralogical, textural, {{chemical and}} statistical study is presented of thirty ceramic specimens recovered from various Roman archaeological sites in central Spain (Ávila). Therefore, {{the novelty of}} this work is that we report the first complete study of pottery fragments in the Ávila region (Castile and Leon, Spain) {{dating back to the}} Roman Empire. Potential/local raw materials were characterised, in order to classify ancient pottery samples by origin. The presence of firing minerals in the ancient ceramic samples was studied, to investigate the technology used in their manufacture. Another innovation of this article is that the statistical study has established links between ceramic samples, shedding further light on knowledge of manufacturing techniques in this region during the Roman Empire. Similar materials were identified in most of the ceramic pieces from the archaeological sites, all present in the local geological environment, which underlines their autochthonous origin. The raw materials were initially chosen {{on the basis of the}} final use of the sample (typology of the samples: Terra sigillata hispanica, <b>common</b> <b>pottery</b> and tegulae). The samples were manufactured within three different temperature ranges (temperature > 900 Cº, between 900 – 800 ºC and between 800 – 600 ºC) and under three different redox environments (oxidizing, reduction and irregular conditions).

40|$|In the two border provinces – Dacia Traiana and Scythia Minor – ceramic pots {{prove the}} {{spreading}} of the Roman Empire’s {{art on the}} territory of our country today. One of the debated problems of the present paper is the propagandistic importance of this field of ornamental arts which, more easily and more rapidly than sculpture and architecture, brought the Roman features in {{all corners of the}} conquered world. Forms and decorations, and even their presence in the provinces was a proof of the existence of the Roman way of living in that area, in connection with the autochthonous basis and then, a proof of the spreading of the new religion, Christianity. Moreover, the present paper records the general aspects of pottery, and also the evolution of the technique used (from the procedures through which <b>common</b> <b>pottery</b> was used, to those of obtaining luxury ceramics – terra sigilata, terra estampata), but also the evolution of forms and their decor, from amphorae and big cley pots with two lugs, to cups and plates.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of Roman pottery from the Maltese islands from the 1 st century BC to the mid- 4 th century AD, and how pottery can help assess Malta's economic role in the wider central Mediterranean region. The archipelagoâs locally produced vessels, its range of ceramic exports, and the quantification {{of the types of}} amphorae, fine, and cooking wares the islands imported, were studied and the data were used to compare with the pottery available from the small islands of Pantelleria, Lampedusa and the Kerkennah isles. The aim is to revisit the theme of the economic role of the Maltese islands and other similar-sized islands in the region by moving away from the tradition of unilateral and monographic narratives, which more often than not, omit the wealth of information that can be garnered from pottery. In the first instance, a detailed study of three complete and new ceramic assemblages, including amphorae, fine, cooking and coarse wares, was undertaken. The opportunity to quantify identifiable imports and compare them with local productsâthe first of its kind for fine, cooking and coarse waresâprovided valuable proxy data for comparing Malta with neighbouring islands and centres, and demonstrated what proportion of ceramic vessels were locally supplied, and how these changed over time. These data were also fed into a series of network analyses, which plotted the <b>common</b> <b>pottery</b> links shared between small-island and mainland sites in the region. The analyses were interpreted in conjunction with a critique of existing pottery quantification methods, and the potential acceptance for utilising all known pottery data irrespective of {{the quality and quantity of}} the published data available. Most importantly, the import trends obtained from this study were incorporated into the existing narrative of how small islands and their local industries featured in the central Mediterraneanâs regional economy, highlighting the types of archaeologically visible industries that existed; how these developed symbiotically alongside other larger supply networks; and what effect this might have had on the integration of small islands in the Roman Mediterranean. </p...|$|E
