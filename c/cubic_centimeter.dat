25|$|The {{formation}} of a plasma for polymerization depends {{on many of the}} following. An electron energy of 1–10 eV is required, with electron densities of 109 to 1012 per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimeter,</b> in order to form the desired plasma state. The {{formation of}} a low-temperature plasma is important; the electron temperatures are not equal to the gas temperatures and have a ratio of Te/Tg of 10 to 100, so that this process can occur at near ambient temperatures, which is advantageous because polymers degrade at high temperatures, so if a high-temperature plasma was used the polymers would degrade after formation or would never be formed. This entails non-equilibrium plasmas, which means that charged monomer species have more kinetic energy than neutral monomer species, and cause the transfer of energy to a substrate instead of an uncharged monomer.|$|E

25|$|The plasma {{composition}} in Saturn's inner magnetosphere {{is dominated by}} the water group ions: O+, H2O+, OH+ and others, hydronium ion (H3O+), HO2+ and O2+, although protons and nitrogen ions (N+) are also present. The main source of water is Enceladus, which releases 300–600kg/s of water vapor from the geysers near its south pole. The released water and hydroxyl (OH) radicals (a product of water's dissociation) form a rather thick torus around the moon's orbit at 4Rs with densities up to 10,000 molecules per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimeter.</b> At least 100kg/s of this water is eventually ionized and added to the corotating magnetospheric plasma. Additional sources of water group ions are Saturn's rings and other icy moons. The Cassini spacecraft also observed small amounts of N+ ions in the inner magnetosphere, which probably originate from Enceladus as well.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} xenon-133 and xenon-135 were {{detected}} in gas-samples {{taken from the}} containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimeter.</b> Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes {{are the result of}} nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could only mean that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. No significant change in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so {{there was no sign of}} large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also. Professor Koji Okamoto of the University of Tokyo Graduate School made the comment that localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor.|$|E

500|$|Cumulus clouds can be {{composed}} of ice crystals, water droplets, supercooled water droplets, or a mixture of them. The water droplets form when water vapor condenses on the nuclei, and they may then coalesce into larger and larger droplets. In temperate regions, the cloud bases studied ranged from [...] above ground level. These clouds were normally above , and the concentration of droplets ranged from 23to 1300droplets per <b>cubic</b> <b>centimeter</b> (380to 21,300droplets per cubic inch). This data was taken from growing isolated cumulus clouds that were not precipitating. The droplets were very small, ranging down to around 5micrometers in diameter. Although smaller droplets may have been present, the measurements were not sensitive enough to detect them. The smallest droplets {{were found in the}} lower portions of the clouds, with the percentage of large droplets (around 20to 30micrometers) rising dramatically in the upper regions of the cloud. The droplet size distribution was slightly bimodal in nature, with peaks at the small and large droplet sizes and a slight trough in the intermediate size range. The skew was roughly neutral. Furthermore, large droplet size is roughly inversely proportional to the droplet concentration per unit volume of air. In places, cumulus clouds can have [...] "holes" [...] where there are no water droplets. These can occur when winds tear the cloud and incorporate the environmental air or when strong downdrafts evaporate the water.|$|E
