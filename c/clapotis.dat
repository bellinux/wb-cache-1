5000|$|In hydrodynamics, the <b>clapotis</b> (from [...] "lapping of water") is a non-breaking {{standing}} wave pattern, caused for example, by {{the reflection of}} a traveling surface wave train from a near vertical shoreline like a breakwater, seawall or steep cliff.The resulting clapotic wave does not travel horizontally, but has a fixed pattern of nodes and antinodes.These waves promote erosion at the toe of the wall,and can cause severe damage to shore structures.The term was coined in 1877 by French mathematician and physicist Joseph Valentin Boussinesq who called these waves ‘le clapotis’ meaning ‘’the lapping".|$|E

Above all, in a case where tsunami overflows some structure after colliding against it, the generation mechanism and the magnitude of dynamic wave force due to mean water particle velocity of tsunami bore reflected from the structure are not yet elucidated. In the paper, the structure is treated as a vertical wall model simulating a tsunami protection gate against river run-up tsunami or a land dike protecting against land run-up tsunami. Profiles of wave height and cross-sectional mean velocity of both partial <b>clapotis</b> bore in front of wall and transmitted surge to rear of it are experimentally obtained, by which wave force of tsunami bore on a vertical wall is evaluated and mechanism of wave force is tried to make clear. As the result, it became evident that the dynamic wave force is mainly generated by drag force and the magnitude of it is some 10 ～ 40 % of static wave force...|$|E
40|$|As {{well as the}} {{alignment}} of breakwaters which contribute to calmness of harbour regions, the plane distribution of total wave pressures to breakwaters is also important in design of reakwaters. In the planning of the New Naha Port, the wave sheltering effects of breakwaters have been studied by the same authors in these four years. Concerning with the plane distributions of total wave pressures to the breakwaters, {{it is not so}} easy to estimate the distributions for the particular places, where the breakwaters are to be constructed and have very complicated bottom topography. Therefore, the authors carried out the experimental study on the wave pressures to the breakwaters using the modified models shown in Fig. 3 - 7, and also conducted experiments on sliding of the breakwaters in two dimensional models. The results obtained from the experimental research are shown as follows; 1) The ware heights in the region where sea bottom elevation is ± 0. 0 cm are very small comparing with the other regions in all cases of these expements. 2) In the cases with the breakwaters, the <b>clapotis</b> are caused and hydraulic phenomena are very complicated in front of the breakwaters. 3) The wave pressures take their maximum values on point B in Fig. 2 - 1 when the incident wave directions are normal to the breakwaters, and Point C in Fig. 2 - 1 takes the highest wave pressure when the incident wave directions are 45 ° to the breakwaters. 4) The areas, influenced by corner-shaped bottom topography in distribution of wave pressures and wave heights, are large in the cases of the incident wave directions of 45 ° than in the cases of normal to the breakwaters. 5) The relative values of breakwater sliding S/L become smaller as the relative weights of breakwaters, μW/ F, become large...|$|E
