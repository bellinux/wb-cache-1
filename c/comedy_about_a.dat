Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II.

T. E. B. Clarke, the script writer for the film, had heard about the {{preservation of}} the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film.

5|$|In 2002, Fey {{suggested}} a pilot episode for a situation <b>comedy</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{cable news network}} to NBC, which rejected it. The pilot was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series, and was accepted by NBC. She {{signed a contract with}} NBC in May 2003, which allowed her to continue in her position within SNL as head writer at least through the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on Liz Lemon, the head writer of a variety show on NBC, and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile stars and the new head of the network.

25|$|In early 1941, Kees {{signed a}} {{provisional}} contract with Alfred A. Knopf for a novel, Fall Quarter, an academic black <b>comedy</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young professor who battles the dreariness and banality of a staid Nebraskan college. For Kees, the book ensured that a future book of verse would be published. However, Fall Quarter, part surreal, part social commentary, {{was rejected by}} Knopf {{in the days after}} the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the declaration of war having changed publishing contingencies for war books. A farce about a dystopic heartland would look unpatriotic on Knopf's 1942 list. From this point on, Kees turned from fiction to writing only poetry.|$|E

Chase and his business partner Bruce Bodner hired Boam to adapt the book for film. The three spent several weeks developing the script.

Boam, Chase, and Bodner then spent the remainder of the year rewriting the screenplay.|$|E
25|$|Between The Last Wave and {{his next}} feature, Weir wrote and {{directed}} the offbeat low-budget telemovie The Plumber (1979). It starred Australian actors Judy Morris and Ivar Kants and was filmed in just three weeks. Inspired by a real-life experience told to him by friends, it is a black <b>comedy</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> woman whose life is disrupted by a subtly menacing plumber. Weir scored a major Australian hit and further international praise with his next film, the historical adventure-drama Gallipoli (1981). Scripted by the Australian playwright David Williamson, it is regarded as classic Australian cinema. Gallipoli was instrumental in making Mel Gibson (Mad Max) into a major star, although his co-star Mark Lee, who also received high praise for his role, has made relatively few screen appearances since.|$|E

Their second script concerned a religious single from Jerusalem named Nati, who is frustrated with dating and has resolved to give it only another year and then marry the first woman he encounters. This second entry was also declined. Shapiro and Divon returned to their regular jobs.|$|E
