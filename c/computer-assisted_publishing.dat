He developed Seaway Promer SARL in 1987, a company specialized in <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>publishing,</b> with his cousin, Pierre-Yves Gires.

Diacom SA became a partner of L'Oreal, BMW, Procter & Gamble. Allard teamed up with Cisco Systems and developed the first Oracle database linked to the Internet in 1994.

50|$|As of 2000 {{the school}} offered {{training}} programs in technical skills, including work and school cooperative programs, with business education, <b>computer-assisted</b> drafting, desktop <b>publishing,</b> office management, and office technology available. In 1999 {{there were six}} teachers that {{were a part of}} this program, and the number doubled by 2000. In 2000 the school did not offer skilled manufacturing and trade courses. These courses were offered at five different technical centers in Detroit, and interested students would arrive to their regular school early and board buses bound for a technical center. That year the technical schools had limited numbers of recruitment information available in Spanish, the primary language of many students at Western.|$|R

This analysis is based on the transcripts and collations of these witnesses published on my CD-ROM of The Wife of Bath’s Prologue, and uses the techniques outlined in my article (with Robert O’Hara) on <b>computer-assisted</b> stemmatic analysis <b>published</b> in the first volume of the Canterbury Tales Project Occasional Papers (Robinson and O’Hara 1993; Robinson 1996.) The aim of the Canterbury Tales Project is to determine, as thoroughly as we can, the textual history of The Canterbury Tales. The rationale of the Project is twofold. First, the computer methods now at our disposal, for discovering, storing, sorting, and filtering all the information in all eighty-eight witnesses to the text of the Tales, may enable us to travel further towards this goal than previously possible. Secondly, the magic of hypertext and the spaciousness of computer publication,whether on CD-ROM or network, may permit us to provide other scholars with the most complete and convenient access to all th...|$|R
