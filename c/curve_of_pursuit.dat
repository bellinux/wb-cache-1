5000|$|A tractrix (from the Latin verb trahere [...] "pull, drag"; plural: tractrices) is {{the curve}} along which an object moves, under the {{influence}} of friction, when pulled on a horizontal plane by a line segment attached to a tractor (pulling) point that moves at a right angle to the initial line between the object and the puller at an infinitesimal speed. It is therefore a <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>pursuit.</b> It was first introduced by Claude Perrault in 1670, and later studied by Isaac Newton (1676) and Christiaan Huygens (1692).|$|E

The difficulties of adopting a <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> attack on present day high-speed bombers have been explained, leading to an introduction of interception or collision course of attacks. </span...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{horizontal and}} vertical smooth pursuit eye movements in five healthy human subjects. When maintenance <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> was tested using predictable waveforms (sinusoidal or triangular target motion), the gain <b>of</b> horizontal <b>pursuit</b> was greater, in all subjects, than that of vertical pursuit; {{this was also the}} case for the {{horizontal and vertical}} components of diagonal and circular tracking. When initiation <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> was tested, four subjects tended to show larger eye accelerations for vertical as opposed to horizontal pursuit; this trend became a consistent finding during diagonal tracking. These findings support the view that different mechanisms govern the onset <b>of</b> smooth <b>pursuit,</b> and its subsequent maintenance when the target moves in a predictable waveform. Since the properties of these two aspects <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> differ for horizontal and vertical movements, our findings also point to separate control of horizontal and vertical pursuit.

40|$|AbstractA {{number of}} studies have shown that {{stationary}} backgrounds compromise smooth pursuit eye movements. It has been suggested that poor attentional selection <b>of</b> the <b>pursuit</b> target was responsible for reductions <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> gain. To quantify the detrimental effects of attention, we instructed observers to either pay attention to background objects or to ignore them. The to-be-attended object was indicated by peripheral or central cues. Strong reductions <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> gain occurred when the following conditions were met: (a) the subject payed attention to the object (b) a salient event was present, for instance the onset of the target or cue and (c) the attended target produced retinal motion. Removing any of the three conditions resulted in no or far smaller decreases <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> gain. Further, decreases in pursuit gain were present with perceptual discrimination and simple manual detection...|$|R
