5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire.</b> With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
25|$|In 1834, a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> seriously {{damaged the}} house, with the {{exception}} of the dining room wing. This prompted Jackson to have the current 13-room Greek Revival structure built on the same foundation as the former house, which was completed two years later. The architects for the house were Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume, who were building Tulip Grove across the road.|$|E

5000|$|A {{structure}} fire is a fire {{involving the}} structural components {{of various types}} of residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Residential buildings range from single-family detached homes and townhouses to apartments and tower blocks, or various commercial buildings ranging from offices to shopping malls.

25|$|On 11 March 1944, Petiot's {{neighbors in}} Rue Le Sueur complained to police about a foul stench {{in the area}} and large amounts of smoke {{billowing}} from a chimney of the house. Fearing a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire,</b> the police summoned firemen, who entered the house and found a roaring fire in a coal stove in the basement. In the fire, and scattered in the basement, were human remains.|$|E
25|$|Edgartown is {{well known}} as having {{been one of the}} primary ports for the whaling {{industry}} during the 1800s. Ships {{from all over the world}} would dock in its sheltered bay and captains would build grand mansions for their families with ornate top floor rooms called widow's walks, which overlooked the harbor. A myth developed that wives would watch for months from these tiny rooms, hoping to see the sails of ships that would bring their husbands home from the sea. There is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used for this purpose. They were frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating an easy access route to the structure, allowing the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> in the hopes of preventing the house from burning down.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of a season {{creosote}} deposits can become several inches thick. This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for complete combustion. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire.</b> Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any combustible material in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.|$|E
50|$|Causes of the {{deposits}} {{which lead}} to <b>chimney</b> <b>fires</b> include using green/wet fuels, the operation of appliances with insufficient air intake, and low operating temperatures for prolonged periods followed by hot fires. Such practice typically occurs when mild weather periods are followed by cold snaps.|$|R
5000|$|At {{that time}} {{about a third}} of <b>fires</b> were either <b>chimney</b> <b>fires</b> or were caused by {{children}} playing with matches. Sparks from railway locomotives were also a problem. A growing area of work was special service calls, many involving the rescue of animals from [...] "precarious positions".|$|R
50|$|Manzanita wood, when dry, is {{excellent}} for burning in a campfire, barbecue, fireplace, or stove. It is dense and burns {{at a high}} temperature for long periods. However, caution should be exercised, because the high temperatures can damage thin-walled barbecues, and even crack cast iron stoves or cause <b>chimney</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R

[...] and panic at a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> combine with a complex rhyming pattern to create a humorous picture of the disastrous event. The story ends with the priest pocketing some of the collection money. A later Epistle, No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind (The sun gleams smooth and round), narrates the relaxed and peaceful journey of a boat bringing Ulla Winblad home to Stockholm across Lake Mälaren on a lovely spring morning, {{after a night of}} carousing. The boatmen call to each other, apparently haphazardly, but each detail helps to create a pastoral vision as [...] "Gradually the wind blows up / In the fallen sails; / The pennant stretches, and with an oar / Olle stands on a hayboat;".

25|$|A {{characteristic}} {{problem of}} chimneys is they develop deposits of creosote {{on the walls}} of the structure when used with wood as a fuel. Deposits of this substance can interfere with the airflow and more importantly, they are combustible and can cause dangerous <b>chimney</b> <b>fires</b> if the deposits ignite in the chimney.|$|R
50|$|The safe {{operation}} of a wood-burning stove requires regular maintenance such as emptying ash pans (containers) beneath the wood grate. Routine cleaning of the stove pipes and chimney is also needed to prevent <b>chimney</b> <b>fires.</b> Creosote and soot gradually build up in stovepipes and chimneys. This could damage the <b>chimney</b> and spread <b>fire</b> to the surrounding structure, especially the roof. When soot blocks the airflow through the stove pipes or chimney, smoke can build up in the stove pipes and in the house through the stove.|$|R

50|$|Despite outcry {{and public}} demands to change chimney {{sweeping}} practices, such as suggesting that young chimney sweeping boys {{be replaced with}} mechanical devices, insurance companies, and homeowners argued that Chimney Sweeper’s carcinoma was {{a small price to}} pay for the protection of the mass population against smoke and <b>chimney</b> <b>fires.</b> Despite the call for action as early as 1788, Pott’s work finally began to influence change in 1875, when a decline in scrotal cancer incidence and mortality was noted.|$|R
5000|$|In some designs, {{exhaust gases}} contain so little heat that chimney draft becomes an issue. Conventional {{chimneys}} {{may not be}} suitable for discharge without additional energy inputs. [...] The cool heater exhaust leaves open the question of chimney deposits such as creosote, and reliable measures for cleaning such combustible deposits {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>chimney</b> <b>fires.</b> This can be a problem if the rocket mass heater is built incorrectly; the properly built rocket mass heater burns all combustibles in the burn chamber and barrel and the exhaust exhibits minimal or no combustible properties.|$|R
50|$|Soot also {{tends to}} form in {{chimneys}} in domestic houses possessing one or more fireplaces. If a large deposit collects in one, it can ignite and create a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire.</b> Regular cleaning by a chimney sweep should eliminate the problem.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} major {{issues that are}} at risk from a <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> event. There is of course the danger of burning debris being {{expelled}} {{from the top of}} the chimney that could ignite other portions of the structure, but the major cause of damage is where the heat of the <b>chimney</b> <b>fire</b> will pass through the masonry materials and overheat nearby combustibles. Even though codes and standards require a specific clearance of the framing members from the masonry materials, often this is not found in actual construction. Many fires reported as chimney fires, are actually structure fires ignited by the overheating of the framing members. These structure fires can be traced to the normal use of the fireplace or sealed combustion chamber.|$|E

40|$|Sweden {{recently}} {{changed the}} national regulation of chimney sweeping. This study has two purposes. The first {{purpose is to}} evaluate {{the effect of this}} reform to see if the new regulation has led to an effect in terms of increased <b>chimney</b> <b>fires</b> in single-family houses and for the wood-burning and oil-burning stoves, respectively. The second purpose is an updating of a previous study (Mattsson 1994) of analysis of society´s benefits and costs of different alternative sweeping frequencies for wood-burning and oil-burning stoves. This study also has a secondary purpose to examine {{the extent to which the}} local sweeping rules vary with climate conditions.   Mattsson, based on his results, proposed that the sweeping requirements for oil-burning stoves should be reduced from twice a year to once every second year and for wood-burning stoves the sweeping should be reduced from four times to once each year. Recommendation for oil- burning stoves was implemented in the new regulation from 2003. The results from the statistical analysis show that the differences between the various municipalities sweeping frequencies cannot be explained by differences in climate conditions, i. e. municipalities don´t have perfectly adapted the sweeping frequencies with temperature. The results even show that the reform of year 2003 has led to fewer <b>chimney</b> <b>fires.</b>   Results from the cost-benefit analysis show that for oil-burning stoves, a cut from a sweeping every two years to a sweeping every three years is socially efficient if the value of the environmental factor is below 60 kronor per stove and year. For wood- burning stoves, a cut from 3 - 5 times to once each year would be efficient if the value of the environmental factor is below 1290 kronor per stove and year...|$|R
