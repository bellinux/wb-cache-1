50|$|Acidic {{anodizing}} solutions produce pores in the anodized coating. These pores {{can absorb}} dyes and retain lubricants, {{but are also}} an avenue for corrosion. When lubrication properties are not critical, they are usually sealed after dyeing to increase corrosion resistance and dye retention. Long immersion in boiling-hot deionized water or steam is the simplest sealing process, {{although it is not}} completely effective and reduces abrasion resistance by 20%. The oxide is converted into its hydrated form, and the resulting swelling reduces the porosity of the surface. Cold sealing, where the pores are closed by impregnation of a sealant in a room-temperature bath, is more popular due to energy savings. Coatings sealed in this method are not suitable for adhesive bonding. Teflon, nickel acetate, <b>cobalt</b> <b>acetate,</b> and hot sodium or potassium dichromate seals are commonly used.
