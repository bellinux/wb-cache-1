40|$|This study {{examines}} {{part of the}} thick palaeoweathering mantle that formed on the northern area of the Spanish Central System. The study of a <b>compound</b> <b>profile</b> indicates that despite weathering processes, the primary structure of the metamorphic rocks is preserved, and is only partially lost in some intervals of {{the upper part of}} the <b>compound</b> <b>profile.</b> Macro/micromorphology, mineralogy and geochemical changes within the profiles revealed two weathering paths. In the first path, Fe-chlorite weathered to chlorite-smectite mixed-layer/smectite/kaolinite+ iron oxides. In the second path, biotite and/or muscovite weathered to kaolinite + iron oxides. The profiles show a progressive decrease, from base to top, in mica and mixed-layers and an increase in smectite and kaolinite. Thus, the profiles only comprise the lower or intermediate zones of the weathering mantle. The weathering occurred under humid climates; the lower zones of the profiles were poorly drained, whereas the topmost zones were better drained and more oxidizing. The results obtained indicate that detailed mineralogical studies are very useful to reconstruct the characteristics of the weathering mantles, and as palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic indicators.

40|$|Background: The {{study of}} {{phenolic}} <b>compounds</b> <b>profiles</b> and antioxidative activity in ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots {{with respect to}} cultivation years, and has been little reported to date. Hence, {{this study examined the}} phenolic <b>compounds</b> <b>profiles</b> and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical-scavenging activities in the fruit, leaves, and roots of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) as a function of cultivation year. Methods: Profiling of 23 phenolic compounds in ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots was investigated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with the external calibration method. Antioxidative activity of ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots were evaluated using the method of DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity. Results: The total phenol content in ginseng fruit and leaves was higher than in ginseng roots (p< 0. 05), and the phenol content in the ginseng samples was significantly correlated to the DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity (r= 0. 928 ****). In particular, p-coumaric acid (r= 0. 847 ****) and ferulic acid (r= 0. 742 ****) greatly affected the DPPH activity. Among the 23 phenolic compounds studied, phenolic acids were more abundant in ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots than the flavonoids and other compounds (p< 0. 05). In particular, chlorogenic acid, gentisic acid, p- and m-coumaric acid, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds in 3 – 6 -yr-old ginseng fruit, leaves, and roots. Conclusion: This study provides basic information about the antioxidative activity and phenolic <b>compounds</b> <b>profiles</b> in fruit, leaves, and roots of Korean ginseng with cultivation years.

Twelve compounds were quantified and classified as either phenolic acids or flavonoids. The fractionation process did not generate fractions with different compositions except for chloroformic fraction, which showed only 6 out of 12 standard compounds used. DPPH assay revealed samples with a concentration-dependent radical scavenging activity, being methanolic fraction the one with the largest activity (SC 50 11. 45 ± 0. 02 μg/mL). Lipid peroxidation assessment, in the presence and absence of stress inducer, showed that particularly the ethanol extract (IC 50 26. 75 ± 0. 08 μg/mL) and the ethyl acetate fraction (IC 50 6. 14 ± 0. 03 μg/mL) could inhibit lipid peroxidation. The ethyl acetate fraction performed best in chelating iron (48 % complexation at 1000 μg/mL). Cell imaging experiments showed that the ethanolic extract could protect cells against oxidative stress as well as restore the oxidative balance upon stress induction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the ability of four strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae endowed with β-glucosidase activity to improve the Trebbiano wine aroma profiles and quality. In particular, the strain effects on fermentation kinetics, sugar and acid concentrations, volatile aroma <b>compound</b> <b>profiles,</b> colour, and catechins parameters were evaluated. The four strains of S. cerevisiae were tested in comparison with a commercial strain. The results showed that the four wild strains had high fermentation rates associated with an efficient conversion of grape sugars to alcohol. In addition, each strain imparted specific features to the wine. In fact, significant differences in relation to the inoculated strain were observed mainly in residual sugar content, succinic and tartaric acid concentrations, and volatile aroma <b>compound</b> <b>profiles</b> as esters, higher alcohols, and terpenes. In particular, the products obtained with S. cerevisiae BV 12 and BV 14 were characterized by lowest residual sugar contents.

The aim of this work was to characterize the aroma and sensory of an innovative product that belongs to the same confectionery spreadable cream product category. Six spreadable cream prototypes were produced by using sugar, roasted sunflower kernel, carob or cocoa powder, palm or coconut fat and, lecithin.

We observed opposing trends in the volatile compound composition for the cultivars during storage at low temperature, in which 'Sevillana' lost compounds and 'Maravilla' was enriched. Therefore, storage at low temperature causes important changes in the volatile <b>compound</b> <b>profile</b> of raspberry, particularly the Sevillana cultivar, with significant decreases in C- 13 -norisoprenoids and increases in terpenes.

40|$|Introduction: To reduce {{continuously}} increasing {{costs in}} drug development, {{adverse effects of}} drugs need to be detected {{as early as possible}} in the process. In recent years, compound-induced gene expression profiling methodologies have been developed to assess compound toxicity, including Gene Ontology term and pathway over-representation analyses. The objective {{of this study was to}} introduce an additional approach, in which literature information is used for <b>compound</b> <b>profiling</b> to evaluate <b>compound</b> toxicity and mode of toxicity. Methods: Gene annotations were built by text mining in Medline abstracts for retrieval of co-publications between genes, pathology terms, biological processes and pathways. This literature information was used to generate compound-specific keyword fingerprints, representing over-represented keywords calculated in a set of regulated genes after compound administration. To see whether keyword fingerprints can be used for assessment of compound toxicity, we analyzed microarray data sets of rat liver treated with 11 hepatotoxicants. Results: Analysis of keyword fingerprints of two genotoxic carcinogens, two nongenotoxic carcinogens, two peroxisome proliferators and two randomly generated gene sets, showed that each compound produced a specific keyword fingerprint that correlated with the experimentally observed histopathological events induced by the individual compounds. By contrast, the random sets produced a flat aspecific keyword profile, indicating that the fingerprints induced by the compounds reflect biological events rather than random noise. A more detailed analysis of the keyword profiles of diethylhexylphthalate, dimethylnitrosamine and methapyrilene (MPy) showed that the differences in the keyword fingerprints of these three compounds are based upon known distinct modes of action. Visualization of MPy-linked keywords and MPy-induced genes in a literature network enabled us to construct a mode of toxicity proposal for MPy, which is in agreement with known effects of MPy in literature. Conclusion: Compound keyword fingerprinting based on information retrieved from literature is a powerful approach for <b>compound</b> <b>profiling,</b> allowing evaluation of compound toxicity and analysis of the mode of action...|$|R

The interspecies differences are explained {{on the basis of the}} larger size of the lipophilic compartment (for compounds with low K-OA) and the lower ratio of surface area to volume in the Melaleuca leaves.
