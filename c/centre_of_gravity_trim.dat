40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of the aerodynamic behaviour of Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft is important because of its high lift to drag ratio. The use of Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) has accelerated aerodynamic analysis of BWB aircraft. Steady-state, three-dimensional CFD calculations were made of the BWB model using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Comparisons of aerodynamic characteristics such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, pitching moment coefficient, pressure contours and Mach number contours were made both of two-dimensional aerofoil sections in the BWB model and a complete three-dimensional model. The lift coefficient distributions along the body and wing span were analyzed. The effect of changing the angles of attack and aerofoil profiles were investigated. The BWB design presented here has achieved an unprecedented capability in terms of sustainability of flight at high angle of attack, low parasite drag coefficient, efficient thrust required at optimum flight speed and acceptable margin <b>of</b> <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> for <b>trimmed</b> flight at optimum speed without control surface interference...|$|R

The sensitivity of the probabilistic regulations was investigated for a typical large RoPax vessel, with variation of parameters, such as the number, positioning and local optimisation of transverse bulkheads; the presence and position of longitudinal bulkheads below the main vehicle deck; the presence of side casings; and the height of the main deck and double bottom. The effects of water on deck and of operational parameters (draught, <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and <b>trim)</b> were also investigated. The results of the study, presented in graphical form, can provide valuable assistance to the designer when determining subdivision characteristics at the very early stage of the design process, resulting in optimal, efficient and safe ships...|$|R
50|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional {{apart from}} one feature. The trapezoidal fixed surfaces were built around pairs of spars and skinned with corrugated dural, with a cantilever tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. Its slightly tapered, unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel and worked in a small cut-out between the similarly shaped elevators. The novel feature {{was the result of the}} colonial's need for multi-tasking and consequent wide range <b>of</b> <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> Instead <b>of</b> <b>trim</b> tabs, the LH.70 had a pair of trapezoidal winglets, mounted on the lower longerons about 2.2 m ahead of the elevator hinge and projecting about 850 mm out of the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The Norélic was a {{prototype}} two-seat, single rotor helicopter {{with an unusual}} anti-torque system, without a manual cyclic pitch control. Its two crew {{sat side by side}} with large, single curvature transparencies in front of them but with open cockpit sides. [...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit cyclic pitch control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> lift and <b>gravity.</b> Effects due to variations in the position <b>of</b> the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> could be <b>trimmed</b> out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective pitch override lever.|$|R

If it is not in a desired location, a part might not work properly, e. g. unbalanced force might be generated in a rotational part. After a part is modeled, its <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> cannot be altered unless its external shape or internal mass distribution is changed. However, the external shape is usually constrained by other design considerations.
