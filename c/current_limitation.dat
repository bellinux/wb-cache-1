25|$|Multimodal imaging {{frequently}} {{consists of}} the coupling of an electrophysiologic measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention {{is to use the}} strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another <b>current</b> <b>limitation</b> is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.|$|E

50|$|The Rectiverter handles peak {{rectifier}} loads very well. The load {{peak current}} {{will be limited}} by the maximum <b>current</b> <b>limitation</b> of the AC output stage.

50|$|However, Hall {{thrusters}} {{operate at}} the high specific impulses that is typical for electric propulsion. One particular advantage of Hall thrusters, as compared to a gridded ion thruster, is that the generation and acceleration of the ions {{takes place in a}} quasi-neutral plasma, so there is no Child-Langmuir charge (space charge) saturated <b>current</b> <b>limitation</b> on the thrust density.

50|$|Capacitive load {{means that}} there will be a {{reactive}} current in addition to the real active load current. This reactive current will increase the total RMS current delivered by the AC-output stage. The Rectiverter has a maximum RMS <b>current</b> <b>limitation</b> set by the need for protecting the AC output fuse in continuous operation. The max RMS current for continuous operation is therefore set to approximately 150% of the nominal active RMS current limitation,IP_max.|$|E

50|$|A leakage transformer, {{also called}} a stray-field transformer, has a {{significantly}} higher leakage inductance than other transformers, sometimes increased by a magnetic bypass or shunt in its core between primary and secondary, which is sometimes adjustable with a set screw. This provides a transformer with an inherent <b>current</b> <b>limitation</b> due to the loose coupling between its primary and the secondary windings. In this case, it is short-circuit inductance which is actually acting as a current limiting parameter. The output and input currents are low enough to prevent thermal overload under all load conditions—even if the secondary is shorted.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{primary purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} requirements of naval command and control for future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and to propose solutions for <b>current</b> <b>limitations.</b> Currently, UAVs co-exist as a collection of independent systems that have poor interoperability and limited functionality beyond strategic reconnaissance. As UAVs mature, they will increasingly be deployed at the unit level and employed tactically, increasing the need for coordination and the dissemination of information. Command and control systems must evolve to keep pace with this development.
