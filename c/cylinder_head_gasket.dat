5000|$|Following the {{collapse}} of MG Rover in 2005, the Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile acquired the Longbridge plant and the intellectual property rights to many designs, {{including those of the}} K series engine. The Chinese owner, now SAIC Motor, went on to further develop the K series engine, renaming it [...] "N series" [...] and using it to power its current range of MG cars, the MG 6. The revisions included a different design of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket,</b> higher tensile strength through-bolts and a stronger oil-rail fitted in the bottom end of the engine that the through bolts screw into. These revisions are sold by the British company XPart to solve the issues that some K series engines had of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} road-tested in light lorries, but {{nothing seems to}} have been heard of it after 1937. A claimed {{advantage}} was the lack of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket,</b> which was a reliability problem for early diesels at this time. Possibly it was successful, but simply its unusual nature led to it being ignored during World War II in favour of concentrating on more established designs.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} {{from the engine}} are minimized by measures including optimal design of the combustion chambers, optimal control of the intake air motion {{by means of the}} cylinder-head ports, employment of the MIVEC system, employment of an ultra-thin <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket,</b> and employment of micro-droplet fuel injectors. The vehicle's overall exhaust emissions are further suppressed by location of the exhaust manifold {{at the rear of the}} engine. This layout is beneficial since it minimizes the heat capacity of the exhaust system upstream of the catalytic converter and thus, together with combustion control, promotes activation of the catalytic converter.|$|E

50|$|The Austin A40 Somerset saloon's {{reputation}} for being somewhat slow and lumbering to drive is not wholly deserved. It had to endure poor-quality petrol supplies in 1952, and in consequence had retarded ignition settings to tolerate the low octane rating of the fuels available to avoid the engine knocking or 'pinging' condition that was well known in those times. In fact British Motor Corporation later produced a kit to improve the performance and fuel consumption of these cars once premium fuel supplies resumed under the popular petrol brands. This kit comprised a replacement distributor and an optional <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> that was thinner and therefore raised the compression slightly from the standard 7.2:1.|$|E
50|$|The next {{race was}} the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. As {{there were only}} 19 entrants, there was no threat of failing to qualify, and Bucknum was well within three seconds of Jim Clark's pole time for Lotus. The high quality of the field, however, meant that he was down in 14th place, {{although}} he did outqualify 1961 world champion Phil Hill, now driving for Cooper. He once again ran the race just outside the top ten, fighting for long periods with the Lotuses of Walt Hansgen (works) and Mike Hailwood (RPR) and Richie Ginther's BRM. However, on lap 51 a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> {{in one of the}} Honda's twelve cylinders failed, and Bucknum was out of the race.|$|E
50|$|The R-Series {{was mainly}} a stop gap, {{and had a}} very short {{production}} run that lasted barely two years. BL {{had been working on}} a more substantially revised version of the E-Series, but this was not ready for production in time for the Maestro's already badly delayed launch. The company was instead forced into launching the Maestro with the half-developed power unit which cost the company dearly - R-Series equipped Maestros soon gained a reputation for hot starting problems, <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> failures (endemic to the E-Series also), and premature crankshaft failure. Because the E-Series was turned through 180 degrees in order to accommodate an end-on transmission, the R-Series was fitted to the Maestro with the carburettor facing the front of the car, which also led to a reputation for carburettor icing in cold weather.|$|E
50|$|Many ways were {{explored}} {{to enhance the}} power output of the standard engine, most notably special exhaust manifolds, twin carburettors, stiffer valve springs, thinner <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> and modified camshafts.The nominal horsepower quoted for each engine size comes from the British method of power calculation for road taxation purposes, and bears no relationship with the actual power output. Displacement volume, which was calculated from the cylinder diameter, stroke and number of cylinders being the dimensions that determined the power for road taxation purposes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem with}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> was the {{arrangement}} of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> fixing studs, half of which were vertical {{and the other half}} at an angle. The angled studs when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted at a different rate to the alloy heads, causing sideways forces which caused premature failure of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Anecdotally this arrangement was to reduce production costs as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> mounting studs and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to completely assemble the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> assembly before fitting to the engine. However this was not possible in the end due to the cam chain fitting and setting of the cam timing requiring the removal of the rocker covers.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{designed}} and built to run on leaded fuel may require modification to run on unleaded gasoline or autogas. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed {{to compensate for the}} relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane unleaded gasoline (or LPG) has reduced or eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.|$|R

Downton was to prepare two new 1325 cc engines, {{enlarged}} from 1275 cc, but were unable {{to do the work}} and transferred the work to the BMC racing department at Abingdon who eventually delivered two 1293 cc engines. Prior to the race the two cars were not running well, so time was spent re-jetting the carburetors. Immediately after this one Deep Sanderson was destroyed in an accident while still in practice. The second, being driven by Lawrence and Gordon Spice, started poorly and then retired in the third hour of the race with a blown <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezoelectric sensor {{to pick up}} compression oscillations from combustion engines and its force-fitted clamped arrangement {{in the region of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> between the cylinder block and the cylinder head, characterized by the following features: the piezoelectric component (4) is secured permanently to a fixed axial housing wall (2 a) within a housing (2) whose thickness is definable; said housing wall (2 a) is located in a directly or indirectly elastic clamping arrangement against one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or cylinder head (21) adjacent to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> (11).

40|$|Machine {{configuration}} selection has a {{great impact}} on the system-level reliability of a manufacturing system, while the absence of proper consideration of the product quality and the tool degradation on tool failure when determining the machine-level reliability is likely to result in unanticipated machine downtimes or inappropriate maintenance decisions. A generic methodology is thus developed to incorporate both the machine-level and the system-level reliability analyses. Firstly, the machine-level reliability is investigated based on the product dimensional quality and the tool degradation. A novel machine-level quality reliability-integrated model is developed to address the interaction between product quality and tool reliability. The developed machine-level reliability model is then used to estimate the system-level reliability for a manufacturing system with selected configurations. Various hybrid configurations of the multi-operational manufacturing system are investigated in terms of the system-level reliability.

5000|$|In the {{interest}} of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. Originally developed for use in race cars {{as a way to}} prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, the system circulated twelve litres of oil between the storage tank mounted inside the right front fender and the engine as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km).

40|$|One {{mechanism}} by which some fuel may escape the main combustion process in spark-ignition engines and be exhausted as unburned hydrocarbons is by absorption in the lubricating oil on the cylinder liner. The importance of this mechanism is, however, uncertain. Modeling {{studies suggest that the}} process can take place within an engine cycle, and that the amount of fuel absorbed in the oil layer is significant. Investigations in combustion bombs, and engines operated without lubricant indicate that this contribution is substantial. However, several researchers have reported no significant effect, when using combinations of fuels and oils with very different solubility characteristics. This study comprise the results from several experiments and modeling efforts. A ten component synthetic fuel, and different lubricants formulated to study the effect of base stock and viscosity were tested. The predicted variation in oil layer thickness caused by viscosity differences, were of the order of 20 - 40 %.

This had advantages in improving the structural integrity of the weak open deck design. Extensive FEM analysis determined the correct amount of interference needed for successful operation under all operating conditions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an intelligent diagnostic technique POET (Passive Optical Emission Tomography) for the investigation of in cylinder combustion chemiluminescence. As a non-intrusive optical system, the POET system employs 40 fibre optic cables connected to 40 PMTs (Photo Multiplier Tube) to monitor the combustion process and flame front propagation in a modified commercial OHV (Over Head Valve) Pro 206 IC engine. The POET approach overcomes several limitations of present combustion research methods {{using a combination of}} fibre optic detection probes, photomultipliers and a tomographic diagnostics. The fibre optic probes are placed on a specially designed <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> for non-invasively inserting cylinder. Each independent probe can measure the turbulent chemiluminescence of combustion flame front at up to 20 kHz. The resultant intensities can then be gathered tomographically using MART (Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) software to reconstruct an image of the complete flame-front. The approach is essentially a lensless imaging technique, which has the advantage of not requiring a specialized engine construction with conventional viewing ports to visualize the combustion image. The fibre optic system, through the use of 40, 2 m long thermally isolated fibre optic cables can withstand combustion temperatures and is immune from electronic noise, typically generated by the spark plug. The POET system uses a MART tomographic methodology to reconstruct the turbulent combustion process. The data collected has been reconstructed to produce a temporal and spatial image of the combustion flame front. The variations of lame turbulence are monitored by sequences of reconstructed images. Therefore, the POET diagnostic technique reduces the complications of classic flame front propagation measurement systems and successfully demonstrates the in-cylinder combustion process. In this thesis, a series of calibration exercises have been performed to ensure that the photomultipliers of the POET system have sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to quantitatively map the flow velocity turbulence and chemiluminescence of the flame front. In the results, the flame has been analyzed using UV filters and blue filters to monitor the modified natural gas fuel engine. The flame front propagation speed has been evaluated and it is, on average, 12 m/s at 2280 rpm. Sequences of images have been used to illustrate the combustion explosion process at different rpm...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The presence of gas in engine liquid cooling systems can have severe consequences for engine efficiency and life. The presence of stagnant, trapped gases will result in cooling system hotspots, causing gallery wall degradation through thermal stresses, fatigue and eventual cracking. The presence of entrained, transient gases in the coolant flow will act to reduce its bulk thermal properties {{and the performance of}} the system s coolant pump; critically the liquid flow rate, which will severely affect heat transfer throughout the engine and its ancillaries. The hold-up of gas in the pump s impeller may cause the dynamic seal to run dry, without lubrication or cooling. This poses both an immediate failure threat should the seal overheat and rubber components melt and a long term failure threat from intermittent quench cooling, which causes deposit formation on sealing faces acting to abrade and reduce seal quality. Bubbles in the coolant flow will also act as nucleation sites for cavitation growth. This will reduce the Net Positive Suction Head available (NPSHA) in the coolant flow, exacerbating cavitation and its damaging effects in locations such as the cylinder cooling liners and the pump s impeller. This thesis has analysed the occurrence of trapped gas (air) during the coolant filling process, its behaviour and break-up at engine start, the two-phase character of the coolant flow these processes generate and the effects it has on coolant pump performance. Optical and parametric data has been acquired in each of these studies, providing an understanding of the physical processes occurring, key variables and a means of validating numerical (CFD) code of integral processes. From the fundamental understanding each study has provided design rules, guidelines and validated tools have been developed, helping cooling system designers minimise the occurrence of trapped air during coolant filling, promote its breakup at engine start and to minimise its negative effects in the centrifugal coolant pump. It was concluded that whilst ideally the prevention of cooling system gases should be achieved at source, they are often unavoidable. This is due to the cost implications of finding a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> capable of completely sealing in-cylinder combustion pressures, the regular use of nucleate boiling regimes for engine cooling and the need to design cooling channel geometries to cool engine components and not necessarily to avoid fill entrapped air. Using the provided rules and models, it may be ensured stagnant air is minimised at source and avoided whilst an engine is running. However, to abate the effects of entrained gases in the coolant pump through redesign is undesirable due to the negative effects such changes have on a pump s efficiency and cavitation characteristics. It was concluded that the best solution to entrained gases, unavoidable at source, is to remove them from the coolant flow entirely using phase separation device(s) ...|$|E
