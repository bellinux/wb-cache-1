To find the main reason, continuous cast product macro-acid etching test，metallographic examination，scanning electron microscope and EDAX are carried out.

As a result, the inner surface of these defects can not be welded-on in the rolling process and the cracks happen finally. Related measures are suggested to eliminate the defect...|$|R

The products of super steel sheet {{have been used in}} automobile parts, which not only improves the quality of the automobiles, but also reduces the cost and weight of automobiles, decreases energy consumption and environmental pollution. At present, several automobile manufacturers have applied the super steel products to their parts, such as Across Beam and Longitude Beam, Automotive wheel, et al.

40|$|AbstractCold bending {{of glass}} {{involves}} the straining of relatively thin glass components, (typically plates), at ambient temperatures, {{and is a}} low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms required in modern glass applications. <b>Cold</b> <b>bending</b> is also popular because it is thought to eliminate the optical imperfections in curved glass plates that arise during alternative and more conventional thermal bending techniques. Experimental and numerical investigations on the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> of monolithic glass plates into anticlastic shapes are undertaken and described in this paper. The aim is to characterise the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour during the bending process and to evaluate the surface/optical quality of the curved plates. Two distinct phenomena of interest are observed: (i) {{a change in the}} deformation mode that under particular boundary and loading conditions lead to snap-through buckling and; (ii) a local instability termed “cold bending distortion” that appears on curved plates when certain applied displacement limits are exceeded. This <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> distortion is found to occur at stresses significantly below the fracture strength of the glass plate, but the distortions can be sufficiently large to breach optical serviceability requirements. An optical quality evaluation procedure for predicting the <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> response and the resulting optical quality of monolithic glass plates are provided {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R

Young's and shear moduli obtained by these methods were compared with those derived from the asymmetric <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on these comparisons, we concluded that the shear modulus can be properly obtained by the asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> when the span is 20 times larger than the depth.|$|R

Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens. A compressive load was axially applied to the specimen supported with pin ends. Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
40|$|Arches are {{structural}} elements applied in roofings and bridges. They may be formed by <b>cold</b> <b>bending</b> of hot-rolled wide flange sections. The original residual stress pattern due to differential cooling {{in the wide}} flange section is altered {{as a result of}} <b>cold</b> <b>bending.</b> Residual stresses resulting from differential cooling in straight I-sections have been well documented; however, {{this is not the case}} for residual stress patterns resulting from <b>cold</b> <b>bending.</b> Residual stresses can have a significant influence on the strength and stability of arches. This paper presents experimentally measured residual stresses and a finite-element-based method for obtaining residual stresses, in cold-bent arches consisting of HE 100 A wide flange sections. Residual stresses in cold bent specimens were measured with the sectioning method. A finite element model has been implemented using ANSYS 11. 0. The residual stresses obtained from numerical analyses and actual measurements on cold bent steel arches do not only differ from typical hot-rolled residual stress patterns but also deviate from earlier proposed cold formed stress distributions. The results obtained from the finite element method show moderate to good agreement with experimental results...|$|R

The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement.
