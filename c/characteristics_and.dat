5|$|Much of the {{diversity}} and heterogeneity of AML is because leukemic transformation can occur {{at a number of}} different steps along the differentiation pathway.

40|$|There is a digraph {{corresponding}} to every square matrix over ℂ. We generate a recurrence relation using the Laplace expansion {{to calculate the}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>and</b> the permanent polynomials of a square matrix. Solving this recurrence relation, {{we found that the}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>and</b> the permanent polynomials can be calculated in terms of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>and</b> the permanent polynomials of some specific induced subdigraphs of blocks in the digraph, respectively. Interestingly, these induced subdigraphs are vertex-disjoint and they partition the digraph. Similar to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>and</b> the permanent polynomials; the determinant and the permanent can also be calculated. Therefore, this article provides a combinatorial meaning of these useful quantities of the matrix theory. We conclude this article with a number of open problems which may be attempted for further research in this direction...|$|R

Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> are grouped together in the clade Glires.
