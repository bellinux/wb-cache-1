40|$|A {{study of}} isoproterenol-induced (1 mg/kg) {{myocardial}} fibrosis in the rat was undertaken, {{taking advantage of}} the differential colorization provided by thick and thin collagen fibers to picrosirius red and polarization microscopy. The objective was to monitor the sequence (day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8), fibrillar composition, and nature of isoproterenol-induced collagen remodeling, which was found previously to adversely influence myocardial stiffness. The following were found: 1) a distortion and widening of intermuscular spaces on day 1 that was accompanied by the disruption of collagen fibers; 2) by day 2, these spaces were closing and a new fibrillar collagen network had appeared consisting primarily of thinner collagen fibers that crossed over muscle fibers; 3) the new fibrillar network took on a clear <b>crisscrossing</b> <b>pattern</b> on day 3 and 4 as an ever-increasing number of thicker fibers became entwined perpendicular to the thinner fibers; and 4) by day 8, a dense mesh of thick and thin collagen fibers had formed to encircle muscle while a greater number of intermuscular spaces, previously devoid of collagen, were now filled with thicker and thinner collagen fibers. Thus, isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis is initiated by the appearance of interstitial edema and fibrillar collagen disruption and is followed soon thereafter by the formation of thinner collagen fibers that extend across muscle fibers and into which thicker collagen fibers become entwined in a <b>crisscrossing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Once formed, this mesh of collagen fibers encircles cardiac muscle.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that plasma {{membrane}} compounds are involved in the contact-dependent inhibition of growth of human diploid fibroblasts. The purification of the active plasma membrane glycoprotein is described in this report. The glycoprotein has an apparent molecular mass of 60 - 70 kD and, due to differential sialylation, isoelectric points between pH 5. 5. and 6. 2. Treatment with sialidase yielded one spot in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with an isoelectric point of 6. 3. After removal of the N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide chains, the apparent molecular mass is reduced by approximately 22 kD. Treatment was diluted NaOH, which removes the O- glycosidically linked portion of oligosaccharides, resulted in a reduction of the apparent molecular mass by approximately 5 kD. The addition of 50 ng/ml of this glycoprotein-for which the term "contactinhibin" is proposed-in immobilized form to sparsely seeded human fibroblasts resulted in a reversible 70 - 80 % inhibition of growth. The inhibition was not confined to human fibroblasts as other cells were also inhibited, with the exclusion of transformed cells, which are refractory to contactinhibin. The inhibitory activity was abolished by treatment with beta-galactosidase or glycopeptidase F, indicating that the glycan moiety is the biologically active part of the molecule. Confluent cultures treated with antibodies raised against contactinhibin were released from the contact-dependent inhibition of growth. In addition to enhanced saturation density, these cultures exhibited a <b>crisscross</b> growth <b>pattern</b> and the formation of foci. Immunocytochemical studies showed that contactinhibin was associated with vimentin. Furthermore, contactinhibin was found to be not expressed in a species- or organ-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|In the oil/gas related {{geophysical}} processing domains we {{deal with}} data obtained mainly from geophysical measurements that are utilized to find evidence of hydrocarbon in the underground. For such data various analysis methods are applied and new processing techniques are also attempted in our industry domain. This thesis focuses on statistical approaches to mainly single-well acoustic imaging data for (1) analyzing characteristics of these data and (2) denoising. Single-well acoustic imaging is a generic name to imply both data acquisition by hardware and data processing by software in order for delineating geological structural features or subsurface bedding boundaries {{in the vicinity of}} wellbores. Chapter 1 is intended to introduce background of single-well acoustic imaging and notations. This includes introducing sonic logging tool and concepts of single-well acoustic imaging. Our target data domain is also defined. The importance of single-well acoustic imaging is explained in terms of a resolution gap that lies in between seismic method and borehole logs. Key oilfield related terminologies are described for self-completeness. Chapter 2 attempts to study Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its related techniques such as PCA on-line and local PCA. We studied these techniques on both synthetic and single-well acoustic data to observe functional features. Specifically we use local PCA for migrated images from single-well acoustic data and found that <b>crisscross</b> like <b>patterns</b> or annoying noises on the migrated images are effectively eliminated. The core methodology of this thesis, local likelihood regression, appears in Chapter 3. We intend to (1) formulate our model and estimation methods; and to (2) present their applicability to single-well acoustic data. Therefore, we first formulate the local regression model, whose predictor variable is a scalar and response variables have a vector shape, in the 2 -d (space, time) domain. An optimal parameter selection is also dealt. In our model we consider polynomial models up to the cubic order. In order to measure the performance of model fitting we introduce the leave-one-out cross validation (CV) criteria. Then we apply our local regression model to the real data and present estimate results. The use of CV is attempted to identify an optimal parameter, which defines a degree of locality in the selected model. This single bandwidth selection is then extended to multiple bandwidth selection that takes into account the variant locality over the time domain. Our results demonstrate that the applied method successfully achieved: (1) identification of continuous reflectors, and (2) suppression of random noise in the data processed. In Chapter 4 local approaches are attempted in another geophysical analysis domain. It is spatial interpolation named kriging. Both local constant and local linear regressions are considered between a scalar predictor variable and scalar response variable. This Chapter concentrates on the semi-variogram cloud from the porosity data with local regression approaches. This cloud indicates the dissimilarities against the spatial separation of sample pairs and is important when determining a sequence of average dissimilarities over the lateral direction. Normally this sequence is fitted with a theoretical curve, however this process may be practically difficult because a wrong model selection falls away from key features embraced by the original data. This local regression approach facilitates easy computation for forming an appropriate sequence of average dissimilarities with no worry about selecting an optimal model from theoretical models such as exponential, Gaussian, spherical and so on. We have demonstrated that the local regression approach produces reasonable kriged maps under an optimal locality and regression model. Lastly conclusive remarks are stated in Conclusion. Single-well acoustic imaging is still emerging technology. On this technically new field what we have contributed can be re-phrased as follows: ・ Local analysis of PCA is found to be effective for removing <b>crisscross</b> like <b>patterns</b> on migrated images from single-well acoustic imaging. ・ Local regression approach is introduced on the single-well acoustic data mainly for denoising. ・ The vector-valued response variable is considered for a scalar predictor in the local regression approach. ・ Visualization of local regression results is made. ・ The bandwidth selection is made along the depth axis. ・ The cross validation is used for selecting an optimal bandwidth. ・ Multiple bandwidth selection is proposed by additionally taking account for the time axis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 A {{multiple}} stage crosscurrent {{packed column}} suitable for gas-liquid mass transfer was constructed and operated. The absorption column {{consisted of a}} rectangular box constructed of plexiglass and metal. Deflection baffles were positioned at regular intervals {{on opposite sides of}} a central packed section to divert the gas phase into the packing affecting a <b>crisscross</b> gas-liquid flow <b>pattern.</b> The column was used for absorbing ammonia from air in an ammonia-air-water system. Pressure drop data were collected for three crosscurrent arrangements and for the conventional countercurrent arrangement. The results indicate that crosscurrent operation with α = 1 (α is a baffle spacing variable) has a higher pressure drop per meter of packed height than the countercurrent operation. When α is decreased to 2 and 3 the crosscurrent column has better pressure drop characteristics than the countercurrent column. The overall mass transfer efficienty was studied experimentally for the three crosscurrent arrangements and for the countercurrent arrangement. Crosscurrent operation with α = 1 is more efficient at removing ammonia than countercurrent operation for the system and ranges of flow rates studies. At a liquid to gas molar ration of two (L/G = 2. 0) the α = 2 crosscurrent arrangement was also more efficient than countercurrent but this advantage is lost at lower L/G ratios. Overall, the multiple stage crosscurrent packed column is comparable to and at some conditions more efficient than the conventional countercurrent packed column. It is therefore a viable alternative mass transfer device...|$|R
40|$|SAW devices can be {{realized}} as sensors by coating a suitable sensing medium on the acoustic path of the device to detect various physical and chemical measurands. ZnO is a compound widely employed as sensing and wave propagation medium in SAW devices. In particular, high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires are a promising candidate as sensing medium for SAW gas sensors and UV detectors because of its favorable sensing properties, high surface-to-volume ratio and variety of growth techniques. In this thesis, high aspect ratio catalyst-free ZnO nanowires were directly grown as sensing medium {{on the surface of}} SAW devices for the first time through the self-seeding thermal evaporation method. Initially, growth of ZnO nanowires were conducted on blank 128 °-YX LiNbO 3 substrates and the alignment nature of the as-grown nanowires was studied. As-grown ZnO nanowires exhibited a <b>crisscross</b> aligned growth <b>pattern</b> due to step bunching of the polished LiNbO 3 surface during the nanowire growth process. However, it was experimentally observed that nanoscale etching of the LiNbO 3 surface could realize growth of well-aligned ZnO nanowires because of the added surface roughness. The thermal evaporation method was then adopted for direct growth of ZnO nanowires on SAW devices. High temperature stable Rayleigh mode SAW resonators were designed, and fabricated using Pt/Ti electrodes on 128 °-YX LiNbO 3 substrates to facilitate the on-chip nanowire growth conducted at 620 °C. As {{a key part of the}} on-chip growth process, a mask and sleeve setup was used to protect one-half of the IDT aperture during the nanowire growth process to enhance post-growth device functionality. It was observed that the proposed device had approximately 3 times higher sensitivity to UV light of 365 nm wavelength as compared to the only previous report where 1 -D ZnO nanostructures were directly grown on a LiNbO 3 based SAW device using solution grown method for UV detection purposes. Further, FEM simulations were conducted to study the prospects of coupled resonance phenomenon towards enhancing the sensitivity of the ZnO nanowire integrated SAW device to conductivity changes in the sensing medium. It was observed that sensitivity increases by more than 200 times when the ZnO nanowire heights are adjusted such that the resonance frequency of the nanowires approaches the original resonance frequency of the SAW device. FEM simulations were also used to investigate the possibility of switching from Rayleigh waves to higher order Sezawa waves propagating on layered SAW devices to enhance the mass loading sensitivity of SAW sensors. As an example, it was shown that Sezawa waves propagating on a ZnO/Si layered SAW device has 2 to 8 times higher mass loading sensitivity as compared to Rayleigh waves propagating on the same device. The use of the self-seeding thermal evaporation method instead of the conventionally used solution grown method opens up possibilities towards scalable growth of catalyst-free ZnO nanowires without fusion among their roots which increases the surface area of the sensing medium. Moreover, on-chip growth of ZnO nanowires in the absence of a liquid medium has future prospects for in situ measurement of the SAW device response...|$|R

This was a big-ticket, reserved-seats spectacle, and the Cinerama projectors were adjusted carefully and operated skillfully. To prevent adjacent images from creating an overilluminated vertical band where they overlapped on the screen, vibrating combs in the projectors, called [...] "jiggolos," [...] alternately blocked the image from one projector and then the other; the overlapping area thus received no more total illumination {{than the rest of the}} screen, and the rapidly alternating images within the overlap smoothed out the visual transition between adjacent image [...] "panels." [...] Great care was taken to match color and brightness when producing the prints. Nevertheless, the seams between panels were usually noticeable. Optical limitations with the design of the camera itself meant that if distant scenes joined perfectly, closer objects did not (parallax error). A nearby object might split into two as it crossed the seams. To avoid calling attention to the seams, scenes were often composed with unimportant objects such as trees or posts at the seams, and action was blocked so as to center actors within panels.
