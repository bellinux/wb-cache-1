40|$|This study {{describes}} {{experiments and}} findings {{of an investigation}} {{to evaluate the use}} of laser cutting as an alternative to traditional sawing techniques in marquetry completion conservation. Experiments on veneer from 11 different species of wood, <b>covering</b> <b>ring</b> porous, semi-diffuse/-ring porous and diffuse porous woods, were carried out and examined. The optimal cutting metrics with respect to speed, power and frequency for the types of wood were determined.  The most important ethical question for a conservator {{is to be able to}} preserve as much as original material as possible. The results of this project show that the use of a laser cutting machine is indeed a suitable solution to produce replacement veneer for marquetry works in furniture conservation with respect to quality and time. Especially when it comes to the precision in the shape of the replacement piece, laser cutting is superior to hand sawing. This makes laser cutting an interesting option and reduces the need for expert skills in hand sawing in order to perform very detailed completion work. It also reduces the need of invasive work on the original marquetry to accommodate the replacement piece. The findings are general for all of the examined types of wood. On the negative side, the laser cutting machine requires a relatively big initial investment, making it difficult to say if it is really a cost-effective method of cutting replacement veneer pieces. Syftet med projektet är att hitta en alternativ metod för att producera kompletteringsbitar av fanér till gamla intarsiaobjekt. En lämplig metod ska vara tids- och kostnadseffektiv, hållbar och reversibel. Laserskärning innebär stora möjligheter att kraftigt reducera tid och kostnad vid komplettering av intarsia, vilket möjliggör för flera möbelägare att låta utföra en professionell konservering av sina historiska objekt. ...|$|E

However,times will change and survival will very much depend onprocessing flexibility and being at the frontiers of refiningtechnology, a technology where catalysts play leading roles. Today oil refiners are faced with the challenge to producefuels that meet increasingly tight environmentalspecifications, in particular with respect to maximum sulphurcontent. At the same time, the quality of crude oil is becomingworse with higher amounts of polyaromatics, heteroatoms(sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metals. In order to staycompetitive, it is desirable to upgrade dense streams withinthe refinery to value-added products. For example, upgradingthe fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) by-product light cycle oil(LCO) into a high quality diesel blending component is a veryattractive route and might involve a two-step catalyticprocess. In the first step the LCO is hydrotreated andheteroatoms are removed and polyaromatics are saturated, in thesecond step naphthenic rings are selectively opened to improvethe cetane number of the final product. The present research is devoted to the second catalytic stepof LCO upgrading and was carried out within the framework of aEuropean Union project entitled RESCATS. From the patent literature it is evident that iridium-basedcatalysts seem to be good candidates for ring-opening purposes. A literature survey <b>covering</b> <b>ring</b> opening of naphthenicmolecules shows the need for extending investigations toheavier model substances, more representative of the dieselfraction than model compounds such as alkylated mono C 5 and C 6 -naphthenic rings frequently employed in academic studies. Ring-opening catalysts, mainly Pt-Ir based, were synthesisedat KTH by two different methods: the microemulsion and theincipient wetness methods. Characterization of the catalystswas performed using a number of techniques including TPR,TEM-EDX, AFM and XPS etc. Catalytic screening at atmosphericpressure using pure indan as model substance was utilized todetect ring-opening activity and the magnitude of selectivityto desired cetane-boosting products. The development of suchring-opening catalysts is the topic of Paper I.

40|$|The global oil {{refining}} industry with its present product distribution essentially shifted towards fuels such as gasoline and diesel {{will most likely}} hold the fort for considerable time. However, conditions are changing and refinery survival will very much depend on long-term planning, process and product flexibility and being at the frontiers of refining technology, a technology where catalysts play leading roles. Today oil refiners {{are faced with the}} challenge of producing fuels that meet increasingly tight environmental specifications, in particular with respect to maximum sulphur content. At the same time, the average quality of crude oil is becoming poorer with higher amounts of aromatics, heteroatoms (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metals. In order to stay competitive, it is of decisive importance for refiners to upgrade dense petroleum fractions of low quality to highly value-added products. A practicable route, for example, is upgrading the catalytic cracking by-product Light Cycle Oil (LCO) into a high-quality diesel-blending component in a two-step catalytic process. In the first step the LCO is hydrotreated over a Pt Pd based acidic catalyst bringing about heteroatom and aromatic reduction and isomerization of C 6 to C 5 naphthenic structures. In the second step these naphthenic structures are selectively opened over an Ir-based catalyst to improve the cetane value. The present thesis is mainly devoted to the second catalytic step of LCO upgrading and was partly conducted {{within the framework of the}} European Union project RESCATS. From the patent literature it is evident that iridium-based catalysts could be good candidates for ring-opening purposes. A literature survey <b>covering</b> <b>ring</b> opening of naphthenic structures made in the beginning of the project (in 2001), showed the need for extending investigations to heavier hydrocarbons, more representative of the diesel fraction than model compounds such as alkylated mono C 5 and C 6 naphthenic rings frequently employed in previous academic studies. Ring-opening catalysts, mainly Pt-Ir based, were synthesised at KTH by two different techniques: the microemulsion and the incipient wetness techniques. Paper I is a review of the microemulsion technique and its applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Characterization of catalysts was performed employing a multitude of techniques including quantitative TPR, TEM-EDX, XPS, CO FT-IR, NH 3 -DRIFTS and XRF etc. Catalytic screening at 325 oC and atmospheric pressure with hydrogen and pure indan as model substance was conducted to investigate ring-opening activity in terms of conversion and selectivity to desired cetane-boosting products. This development process is the topic of Papers II-IV. The possible industrial implementation of the best catalyst candidate is demonstrated in Paper V. When designing a catalytic system aimed at refining petroleum, it is crucial to monitor the evolution of the sulphur distribution throughout the different stages of the process so that catalyst properties and reaction parameters may be optimised. The final section of this thesis and Paper VI are devoted to high-resolution sulphur-distribution analysis by means of a sulphur chemiluminescence detector (SCD) following gas chromatographic separation.

40|$|Neutral {{excitons}} in strained axially symmetric In(Ga) As/GaAs {{quantum dots}} with ringlike shape are investigated. Similar to experimental self-assembled quantum rings, the analyzed quantum dots have volcano-like shapes. The continuum mechanical model is employed {{to determine the}} strain distribution, and the single-band envelope function approach is adopted to compute the electron states. The hole states {{are determined by the}} axially symmetric multiband Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, and the exciton states are obtained from an exact diagonalization. We found that the presence of the inner layer <b>covering</b> the <b>ring</b> opening enhances the excitonic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations. The reason is that the hole becomes mainly localized in the inner part of the quantum dot due to strain, whereas the electron resides mainly inside the ring-shaped rim. Interestingly, larger AB oscillations are found in the analyzed quantum dot than in a fully opened quantum ring of the same width. Comparison with the unstrained ring-like quantum dot shows that the amplitude of the excitonic Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are almost doubled in the presence of strain. The computed oscillations of the exciton energy levels are comparable in magnitude to the oscillations measured in recent experiments.

In quantum networks {{it is possible to}} control the `super arrival' time in one of the arms by changing the parameters on another arm which is spatially separated from it. This is yet another quantum nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement) and `ultra Hartman effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in some parameter regimes. In presence and absence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux quantum rings show Hartman effect. We obtain the analytical expression for the saturated phase time. In the opaque barrier regime this is independent of even the AB flux thereby generalizing the Hartman effect.

Hence, this study was undertaken to clarify the morphologic variations of these structures. Materials and Methods: The anterior abdominal walls were removed en bloc from 57 adult cadavers and dissected under a surgical microscope. Results: One case of umbilical hernia was observed, and the remaining 56 umbilical rings were classified into 3 types: oval or round in 33 cases (Type A, 59. 0 %), obliterated or slitted in 12 cases (Type B, 21. 4 %), and completely covered by a connecting band between the ligamentum teres hepatis and umbilical ligaments in 11 cases (Type C, 19. 6 %). The median and medial umbilical ligaments were classified into four types based on their interrelationships. The most common type was the median umbilical ligament terminated by joining one or both medial umbilical ligaments (Type II, 41. 1 %).
