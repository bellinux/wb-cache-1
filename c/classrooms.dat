40|$|<b>Classroom</b> {{discussion}} of literature is often lauded {{as a powerful}} pedagogical tool {{in the high school}} English <b>classroom.</b> Researchers have shown that student talk in the <b>classroom</b> is a powerful teaching strategy. Many teachers express a belief in <b>classroom</b> discussions as a means of teaching literature. At the same time, relatively few teachers actually use <b>classroom</b> discussions of literature in their teaching. Research has identified that student talk in the <b>classroom</b> is a powerful pedagogical tool, and also that such discussions are difficult for many <b>classroom</b> teachers to enact. Little research has explored why teachers might have this disconnect. Teachers believe that <b>classroom</b> discussions are good for students and for their practice, yet they don't use this strategy in the <b>classroom.</b> This study looks at one teacher who believes that <b>classroom</b> discussions of literature should be a powerful teaching tool, but who has struggled to effectivelyactualize this practice in his <b>classroom.</b> A combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses of the teacher's statements beliefs and his practices, as seen in <b>classroom</b> transcripts and student work, was conducted to determine what the teacher believes to be the attributes of a good <b>classroom</b> discussion, and what he did, inside and outside th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{advances}} in ideology and in method have unlocked {{new directions for}} education research. The flipped <b>classroom</b> is considered as the most attractive way in this discussion. The flipped <b>classroom</b> is a new pedagogical method, which swaps the arrangement of knowledge imparting and knowledge internalization comparing to traditional <b>classroom.</b> Although anecdotal evidence suggests that student learning is improved for the flipped compared to traditional <b>classroom,</b> it is still an open issue. According to the survey of the prior and ongoing research of the flipped <b>classroom,</b> {{we found that the}} flipped <b>classroom</b> still has {{a lot of room for}} improvement. In this paper, with an example of computer courses teaching at universities, we study a designing method of <b>classroom</b> interaction, design a test method of teaching effect, and construct a fully functional online learning system and a video recording platform.
