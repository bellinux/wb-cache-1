40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{computing}} <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> for open faults (opens) in a circuit layout in the presence of multilayer loops and redundant interconnects. The extraction of <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> is the main computational bottleneck in predicting the yield loss of a VLSI design due to random manufacturing defects.

To model open faults we formulate a new geometric version of the classic min-cut problem in graphs, termed the geometric min-cut problem. Then the <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> extraction problem gets reduced to the construction of a generalized Voronoi diagram for open faults, based on concepts of higher order Voronoi diagrams.

The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other <b>critical</b> <b>areas.</b> There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{computing}} <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> for missing material defects in a circuit layout. The extraction of <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> is the main computational problem in very large scale integration yield prediction. Missing material defects cause open circuits and are classified into breaks and via blocks. Our approach is based on the medial axis of polygons and the weighted Voronoi diagram of segments. We also introduce the min–max Voronoi diagram of rectangles, a combinatorial structure of independent interest. The <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> problem for breaks and via blocks is reduced to variations of weighted Voronoi diagram of segments. Plane sweep algorithms to compute the appropriate Voronoi diagrams for each case are presented. As a result, the <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> for breaks and via blocks on a single layer can be computed accurately in one pass of the layout. The time complexity is (log) in the case of breaks and ((+) log) in the case of via blocks, where is the size of the input and is upper-bounded by the number of interacting vias (in practice is small). The <b>critical</b> <b>area</b> computation assumes square defects and reflects all possible defect sizes following the () = 2 0 3 defect size distribution. The method is presented for rectilinear layouts. Index Terms—Breaks, <b>critical</b> <b>area,</b> missing material defects, opens, via blocks, Voronoi diagrams, VLSI layout, yield prediction.
