30|$|Gas turbine {{compressor}} blades are {{an integral}} component to a gas turbine assembly and their failures can lead to catastrophic downstream damage. Meher-Homji and Gabriles [1] identified and listed the predominant failure mechanisms for gas turbine blades such as high cycle fatigue (HCF), low cycle fatigue (LCF), thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF), environmental attack (oxidation, sulfidation, corrosion), damage due to <b>creep,</b> <b>erosion</b> and wear, impact damage (due to foreign object damage (FOD), domestic object damage (DOD) or clash/clang of compressor blades owing to surge) {{or a combination of}} above failure mechanisms. According to this study [1], HCF is mostly caused by aerodynamic excitations (like nozzle and vane passing frequencies, strut pass frequencies) or by self-excited vibration and flutter. If a periodic force acts at the blade natural frequency, then resonance can take place. Therefore, they explain that resonant fatigue is an important failure mechanism and if damping is insufficient to adequately absorb the periodic input energy, stresses can grow until failure occurs by overstress or through propagation of a fatigue crack. They also note that although HCF stresses themselves may not be very high, the magnitude of stresses can increase quite dramatically at resonance.|$|E

Materials used in nuclear reactors encounter hostile environment and aggressive media during service, {{and are expected to}} retain their structural and metallurgical integrity {{over a long period of}} use. The major challenges are the effect of radiation on embrittlement, <b>creep,</b> <b>erosion,</b> corrosion, radiation induced growth, swelling, stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement and radioactivity build up. In order to realize a high degree of reliabilit y and at the same time meet the imposing challenges, material specification and acceptance criteria are extremely stringent and the products have to undergo a detailed testing and characterization prior to their use. To ensure the conformance to the specification, processes need to be developed which involves melting the alloy with stringent chemistry control, optimizing thermo-mechanical treatment and modifying heat treatment schedule suitably to achieve mechanical properties. A typical nuclear power plant makes use of nuclear fuel materials such as uranium, structural materials such as zirconium alloys, stainless steels, nickel base alloys as well as low alloy and carbon steels. The paper outlines processing methodologies and gives an overview of some of the structural materials...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of sediment generation and transport on hillslopes provides important constraints on the rate of sediment output from orogenic systems. Hillslope sediment fluxes are recorded by organic material found in the deposits infilling unchanneled convergent topographic features called hollows. This study describes the first hollow infilling rates measured in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Infilling rates (and bedrock erosion rates) were calculated from the vertical distribution of radiocarbon ages at two sites in the Coweeta drainage basin, western North Carolina. At each site we dated paired charcoal and silt soil organic matter samples from five different horizons. Paired radiocarbon samples were used to bracket {{the age of the}} soil material in order to capture the range of complex soil forming processes and deposition within the hollows. These dates constrain hillslope erosion rates of between 0. 051 and 0. 111 mm yr- 1. These rates are up to 4 times higher than spatially-averaged rates for the Southern Appalachian Mountains making creep processes one of the most efficient erosional mechanisms in this mountain range. Our hillslope erosion rates are consistent with those of forested mountain ranges in the western United States, suggesting that the mechanisms (dominantly tree throw) driving <b>creep</b> <b>erosion</b> in both the western United States and the Southern Appalachian Mountains are equally effective...|$|E

40|$|Cryoturbation in high-latitude soils {{is crucial}} for the {{long-term}} cycling of elements, but the rates of soil motion are poorly constrained. Here, we test whether the rate of frost creep, soil erosion and vertical soil mixing in frost boils can be estimated using short-lived radionuclides (Cs- 137 and Pb- 210). We find a small-scale variation in Cs- 137 and Pb- 210 inventories in {{the lower levels of}} the eroding regions of frost boils in comparison to the expected depositional sites; hence, the distribution of the radionuclides appears to reflect a lateral transport of atmospheric fallout from the centre of the boil (inner domain) towards the surrounding soil (outer domain). C- 14 dating of the soil indicates that fallout of Cs- 137 was mobile in the soil and that Pb- 210 moved with the soil matrix. A soil creep model and a surface soil erosion model are derived and applied to the lateral and vertical distributions of Pb- 210 in the frost boil. Both models predict the expected trajectories of soil motion and provide rates of <b>creep,</b> <b>erosion</b> and mixing at a mm yr(- 1) to cm yr(- 1) scale. The distribution of Pb- 210 provides new insights about the processes and rates of soil mass movement in frost boils, if sound mass-balance models are applied.

This paper provides a comprehensive practical treatment of the subject, taking into account the complex nature of blading problems, influence of the operating environment, design factors, and maintenance practices. Blade failure modes such as fatigue, environmental attack, <b>creep,</b> <b>erosion,</b> and embrittlement are addressed along with a synopsis of design tools to review blade reliability. Peripheral issues affecting blade integrity such as fuel and blade quality control are addressed. A blade failure troubleshooting chart is furnished to assist users in diagnosing common failure modes. The object {{of this paper is to}} show, in the context of blading problems, the interrelationship between design, operation, maintenance, and the operational envelope. Several case studies are presented dealing with a variety of failure modes.

30|$|In {{the light}} of the {{presented}} evidence, the Hartz reforms did not destroy the German model. However, it has undergone transformations and there are aspects of these that could be seen as representing the <b>creeping</b> <b>erosion</b> of some of its cornerstones. It would therefore be wrong to sweep the challenges to the German model under the rug. These challenges relate to the decline in the importance of collective bargaining agreements, growing labor market segmentation and increase in wage inequality. It should again be emphasized that all these phenomena—although often attributed to the reforms—were not caused by the Agenda policy implemented under chancellor Schröder from 2003 to 2005. They are due to long-run trends that had already started in the 1990 s or even before. At most, the labor market reforms have led to a certain acceleration of these erosion processes, such as the increase in atypical employment among certain groups.|$|R

Blades typically fail because of low-cycle fatigue (LCF), and high-cycle fatigue (HCF), environmental attack, <b>Creep,</b> Oxidation, <b>erosion,</b> embrittlement. In the present work the turbine blade is modeled and analyzed using finite element method the eigen value extraction for flexural and torsional modes is obtained. Foreign object damage is simulated by considering a circular crack along {{the leading edge of the}} blade. It was found that the stretching induced by the centrifugal inertia force due to the rotational motion of the blades was the cause for the increment of the bending stiffness of the structure. This resulted in maximum operational Vonmises stresses; the object is to provide understanding and information for designers to improve the life and efficiency of gas turbines.

40|$|Abstract:- For {{the past}} few decades, the gas {{turbines}} have been operated at elevated temperatures to {{have the advantage of}} achieving higher and higher power output and engine efficiency. The turbine blade {{is one of the most}} important components of the gas turbine and is principally made of Nickel base super alloys. Superalloys are metallic materials for service at high temperatures and the excellent thermal stability, tensile and fatigue strengths, resistance to creep and hot corrosion, and micro structural stability possessed by Nickel-base super alloys render the material an optimum choice for application in turbine blades. The main function of turbine blade is to translate thermal energy of gas at high temperature and high pressure into mechanical work. The gas turbine blades operate at very high temperature under conditions of extreme environmental attack and subjected to degradation by oxidation, corrosion and wear etc. Generally, during operation, the turbine blades are subjected to the failure mechanisms like Fatigue, <b>Creep,</b> Corrosion, <b>Erosion</b> and sulphidation etc. The failure of turbine blades may have severe impact on safety and reliability of the gas turbine engine. Keeping this in view, in this paper an attempt has been made to review the blade failure mechanisms and blade failures with some case studies...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 87 - 96 When capital {{expenditures}} arc made for plant equipment, it is routine to anticipate that this equipment will meet reliability and performance expectations {{and will not}} experience untimely failure. Being realistic, however, it must be acknowledged that unanticipated equipment failures can and do occur and {{for a variety of}} reasons. These events arc commonly both costly and disruptive to plant operations and may also have safety implications. To minimize the frequency and severity of such failures, it is necessary for personnel who have equipment responsibility to understand the failures and to confront their causes. One tool used widely for this purpose is the metallurgical failure analysis, which is explored here in terms of WHAT it is, and WHY it is undertaken and HOW it is executed. The development of the subject includes some metallurgical background information. In defining and describing various damage and failure mechanisms, such as brittle fracture, fatigue, <b>creep,</b> corrosion, <b>erosion,</b> and sulfide cracking, actual field experiences are utilized. Dual objectives of an in-depth treatment of the metallurgical failure analysis are (1) exposing involved personnel to the numerous modes of equipment damage and failure and (2) achieving improved plant reliability through increased awareness of the causes of failure and the means of prevention...|$|R
40|$|Contact Number: 8010080095 Abstract- Nickel based super alloys {{are fast}} gaining {{relevance}} and {{importance in the}} aerospace and steam power industries, as they have high strength to weight ratio, and exhibit superior mechanical properties. In addition, they possess high resistance at high temperatures; maintaining their resistance to corrosion, thermal shock, <b>creep</b> and <b>erosion</b> at elevated temperatures. Nickel based alloys contain {{a high percentage of}} Nickel and Chromium elements, and a continuous face centered cubic austenitic phase with poor thermal diffusivity, which is formed after various surface treatments. The austenitic phase contributes to the high yield strength and results in poor machinability of Nickel based alloys. The basic problem in machining of Nickel based alloys is their high chemical activity at high cutting forces and temperatures. Most of the tool coatings (TiN, TiC, TiSn, etc.) have higher chemical affinity with Nickel based alloys. So, chemical diffusion between the tool and the machined work-piece takes place, thus affecting the tool life and machined surface quality. To be able to accurately predict the temperature distribution across the Nickel based work piece, we developed a 3 D simulation for temperature modelling of Nimonic 90 during turning and then contrasted the values predicted by the model with the actual experimental values. Tweaking the various variables, we can find out the optimum parameters to be used while machining so as to have the desired temperature distribution across the work piece...|$|R
40|$|Sulphide {{corrosion}} {{is known}} as the predominant form of deterioration which reduces the service life of sewer systems and increases the costs of maintenance and rehabilitation. Reliability analysis can help pipeline owners and sewer system managers to predict service life of the pipes and the time for repair or replacement. To include uncertainties in the reliability analysis, the corrosion process can be considered as a stochastic process. This paper presents a stochastic gamma process model to account for temporal variability and uncertainties associated with the corrosion process in concrete sewer pipes that typically increases the probability of failure with the aging of the pipe. The proposed methodology is then applied to numerical values of a concrete sewer system in the UK. The Monte Carlo simulation method is also used to verify the obtained results. The results showed that a gamma process can properly model the monotonic behavior of aging and deterioration. The application of the gamma process presented in this paper would contribute to widening the use of stochastic processes for modeling of structural degradation processes such as wear, fatigue, corrosion, crack, <b>erosion,</b> <b>creep,</b> and so on. The results can provide guidance for both the assessment of existing concrete sewers and the designing of new pipes with longer service life...|$|R
40|$|Sahelian Africa {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} regions of the world, where {{approximately}} 90 per cent of the population depends on subsistence agriculture. Due to the high population growth, with annual growth rates of about 3 per cent during recent decades, farmers have expanded their cropping areas to increase production. At the same time the traditional bush fallow system collapsed and more land became subject to soil degradation processes. Wind erosion {{is one of the}} main degradation processes that has received much scientific attention since the 1980 s. The objective of this paper is to review the latest research results on wind-erosion causes, consequences, perceptions and control in the Sahel. First the main processes involved in wind <b>erosion</b> (<b>creep,</b> saltation and suspension) are described and related to the Sahelian climate, soils and farming systems. Then the agricultural consequences of wind erosion are evaluated. Three types of damage are distinguished: undesired sedimentation, crop damage and soil degradation. Several studies were done to determine farmers knowledge and perceptions of wind erosion. In general the Sahelian farmers have a good qualitative understanding of wind-erosion processes, and they are concerned about the consequences, especially about crop damage and soil productivity decline. Finally, the possibilities and constraints for wind-erosion control are evaluated. The most widely applied control measure is mulching with crop residues, but the quantity of residue is insufficient due to low biomass yields and multiple uses. It is concluded that regeneration and exploitation of natural, scattered vegetation is a promising control strategy that needs more research...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{sound-absorbing}} ceramics {{contribute to}} the passive damping of thermo-acoustic instabilities and sound dissipation. As ceramic liners, they must satisfy all requirements respecting mechanical strength and thermal resistance. Design and development of such ceramics concern various aspects like thermal shock resistance, crack behavior, fatigue limit, <b>creep</b> and <b>erosion</b> resistance. The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanical behavior of highly porous sound absorbing ceramics and to predict the brittle damage behavior considering the material microstructure. It studies the applicability of such ceramics as insulation liners for the combustion chambers and gives a clue to further material improvement in terms of mechanical strength. Experiments were performed in this work to characterize the mechanical strengths of a new developed sound absorbing ceramic for the application as ceramic heat shields for the combustion chambers of premixed gas turbines. Compressive tests at both room and high temperature as well as four-point bending tests at room temperature have been carried out. Furthermore, the fits of fracture strengths of the material to the Normal, Weibull and Type I extreme value distributions are investigated. The characterization was then expanded to other physical properties such as porosity, density, thermal conduction coefficients and thermal expansion coefficients. A non-multi-physic but multi-scale approach is applied in this work which predicts {{the influence of the}} microstructure on the macroscopic properties. The scale transition method is known as mean-field homogenization method, based on assumed relations between average values of micro-strain and -stress fields in each phase. This homogenization model is based on the Eshelby model and assumes the pores (or rather inclusions) to be ellipsoidal. Influence of the pore density, pore form and pore orientation on the strength of these porous sound absorbing ceramic are studied here. Depending on the loading condition higher strength by higher porosity values is achievable by for example aligning the pores on a desired direction or changing their form from spherical to ellipsoid with high aspect ratios. Furthermore, direct finite element simulations of a representative-volume element (RVE) are also implemented in this work to investigate the pure brittle damage of this sound absorbing ceramic. An effective-stress degradation model has been implemented in a predefined user-subroutine of ABAQUS. It is based on the three dimensional rupture criterion and describes the pure brittle damage under mechanical, thermomechanical, static and quasi-static loadings. Different RVE s have been generated and investigated in terms of damage considering different structural parameters. The present results demonstrate the application potential of these sound absorbing ceramic as liner in terms of mechanical strengths, predict their brittle damage behavior considering the microstructure and provide a base for further material developments and numerical investigations. The applicability of these ceramic to line the combustion chambers in terms of sound absorption is investigated on an experimental set-up at the Faculty of Combustion of the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM). The validation of the results from this chapter will be performed on this set-up...|$|R

Landscape sensitivity assessment becomes therefore a crucial step {{in the development of}} a landscape and management plan, aiming to reconcile conservation with public recreation. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of geomorphology-pedology, together with other parameters (topographic features, plant communities and cultural resources) in assessing Islet landscape sensitivity. The methodology used was based in a parametric approach. Relative values were given to the different classes of geomorphology-pedology, vegetation and topography based on natural value and resistance to recreation use. The overlaying of these values enabled de assessment of the landscape sensitivity. The Islet is a volcanic cone of stratified palagonitic tuffs from the Holocene age. Besides, in the Northwest and South-Southwest summit zones pumiceous deposits with a trachyte composition occur. The exterior hillsides of the volcanic cone (mainly NW and W cliffs) are under intensive wind and marine erosion. The geomorphic dynamics evaluated by means of the morphogenesis/pedogenesis rate allowed to consider the following areas: (a) area on Morphogenesis processes (M). This area is submitted to relative intense ablation processes by <b>creeping</b> and rill <b>erosion.</b> The area correspond mainly to outcrops of palagonitic tuffs or pumice with different weathering stages and a zone with incipient soils; (b) area on Intergrade processes to Morphogenesis (IM) which is associated to steep slopes (> 25 %) incipient soils or Andosoils where mass movements are observed; (c) area on Intergrade processes to Pedogenesis (IP), located on the summit zone, correspond to Andosoils which can attain 200 cm depth.
