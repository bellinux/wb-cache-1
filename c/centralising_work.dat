40|$|Tailorability {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as a key issue concerning groupware applications in general and componentbased groupware applications in particular. Tailoring activities are usually classified according to three levels, viz., customisation, integration and extension.

Our approach allows the extension and integration of new components into a legacy groupware application without the need for changes in the existing components.

INTRODUCTION One of the characteristics of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is the diversity of situations involved in an everyday project. For example, within the same project, the members of a group can combine and alternate between synchronous and asynchronous <b>work,</b> <b>centralised</b> and distributed <b>work</b> and collaborative and individual work.

50|$|During the 1990s, {{a site in}} {{the south}} of Edinburgh was {{developed}} for the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which opened in 2003. As part of this redevelopment, a number of smaller hospitals were to be closed, with their <b>work</b> <b>centralised</b> at the new Infirmary. The Princess Margaret Rose was closed in 2000, with the site sold for housing for £4.3 million in 2002.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive summary on modelling of micro-pollutants' (MPs) fate and transport in wastewater. It indicates the motivations of MP modelling and summarises and illustrates the current status. Finally, some recommendations are provided {{to improve and}} diffuse {{the use of such}} models. In brief, we conclude that, in order to predict the contaminant removal in <b>centralised</b> treatment <b>works,</b> considering the dramatic improvement in monitoring and detecting MPs in wastewater, more mechanistic approaches should be used to complement conventional, heuristic and other fate models. This is crucial, as regional risk assessments and model-based evaluations of pollution discharge from urban areas can potentially be used by decision makers to evaluate effluent quality regulation, and assess upgrading requirements, in the future. © 2013 IWA Publishing...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of large-scale computing technology into British high street banking in the 1960 s was {{a solution to}} shortages of space and staff. Computers required a first-time dislocation of customer accounting from its confines in the branch, {{where it had been}} dealt with by paper-based and mechanised systems, to a new space: the bank computer centre. The implications of this shift have, up until now, not been explored. While historians of business and technology have stressed the continuities between computerisation, punched-card machines, and <b>centralised</b> <b>work,</b> the demands of the computer on decentralised business activities have received little attention. This thesis addresses that shortcoming. The main vehicle for my analysis is a case study of Barclays Bank. I begin in 1954, when the bank took its initial steps towards branch computerisation, and end twenty years later, when the last of its branches was connected to the system. Blending oral testimonies with visual and written sources, I follow activities inside and outside the computer centre to consider the relationship between computers, business, space and work as the material and discursive aspects of computing technology are connected to existing banking practice. I contend that while computers did not appear to achieve the quantitative changes in staffing and space that the banks initially desired, there were qualitative effects that reveal different dimensions to technological change. I demonstrate how the computer centre was constructed as an iconic symbol of modernity to project a new organisational identity for the banks; how technology’s materiality changed the look of banking and signalled the approach of “Americanisation”; how the computer could provide opportunities both for learning and for expensive failure; and how the computer centre was a place that reconfigured temporal, occupational and organisational structures to become a nexus of new careers for bank workers turned computer specialists. The result is an analysis of computing use that moves beyond simple causal connections between computers, space and work to highlight the reciprocal and changing nature of their relationships.

50|$|The {{building}} {{which would}} later become known as Canada House was built between 1824 and 1827 to designs by Sir Robert Smirke, {{the architect of the}} British Museum. It was originally two buildings used by the Union Club and the Royal College of Physicians. Under the leadership of High Commissioner Peter Charles Larkin the Canadian government acquired the Union Club in 1923 for the sum of £223,000. It was Larkin's intention to <b>centralise</b> the <b>work</b> of 200 Canadian employees scattered among offices in Victoria Street in one central building. Renovations cost $1.3 million CDN and were supervised by the architect Septimus Warwick, who moved the main entrance from Trafalgar Square to Cockspur Street. The designers imported Canadian furniture, carpets and maple and birch flooring. The exterior was reclad in Portland stone to match the facade of the Royal College of Physicians. The building was officially opened on 29 June 1925 by King George V.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A local {{algorithm}} is a distributed algorithm that {{runs in a}} constant number of synchronous communication rounds, regardless {{of the size of}} the network. Hence the output of a node in the network is a function of the input available within its constant-radius neighbourhood. Local algorithms are not only highly scalable but also robust to changes in the network. Moreover, local algorithms can be used as subroutines in the design of <b>centralised</b> algorithms. This <b>work</b> is a survey of local algorithms. We review impossibility results, deterministic local algorithms, randomised local algorithms, and local algorithms for geometric problems...|$|R
40|$|This exploratory, {{small-scale}} research {{aimed to}} understand parents’ and grandparents’ experiences {{and expectations of}} child protection investigations. Semi-structured, in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} nine participants. The central theme, captured as ‘a domino effect’, crystallises the participants’ views of why it is important to improve child protection services; that there were significant practical relationship repercussions in families’ lives beyond the immediate investigation. The sub-themes that emerged – support within systemic complexity, policies in practice, intervention processes and practices, and ‘it’s just a job to them’ –suggested how child protection services contributed to ‘the domino effect’ in their lives. A final sub-theme indicated participants’ awareness of the complexity and difficulty of child protection as a job, notwithstanding their expressed frustrations. We have made practical recommendations based on participants’ perspectives about ‘what needs to change?’, and suggestions for improvements to practise that <b>centralise</b> social <b>work</b> as a profession which values the professional relationship with services users. We also suggest that the professional relationship should extend beyond the interpersonal to guiding services users within the legal complexities in contemporary child protection. Being exploratory, this study and its recommendations guide future research to contribute improving child protection services...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} size of networks {{has resulted in}} a corresponding escalation of administration costs and lengthy deployment cycles. Clearly, more scalable and flexible network management systems are required to replace existing <b>centralised</b> services. The <b>work</b> described in this paper forms part of a new network management system that fuses dynamic extensibility, Java Management Extension (JMX), and mobile agents. The primary focus is on integration with the many widely deployed legacy SNMPbased network management systems. One of the primary contributions is the design of a generic SNMP adaptor to enable JMX compliant agents to be accessed by SNMP-based management applications. A set of SNMP APIs have been developed to support the development of the SNMP adaptor. A number of other tools have been developed to support the SNMP adaptor, these include: a Management Information Base (MIB) compiler that automatically generates MBeans representing a given SNMP MIB; and a SNMP proxy service to allow non-SNMP management applications to access the SNMP agent using a variety of protocols...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is a resurgent {{disease in}} many regions of the world, {{including}} Namibia, fuelled by poor TB control programmes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and poverty. The purpose of this survey was to identify nurses’ perceived challenges in implementing a community-based TB programme in the Omaheke region of Namibia. Structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 40 nurses involved in providing TB treatment and care in the Omaheke region. Patient-related challenges which hampered TB treatment included alcohol and drug abuse, poverty and stigma. Lack of transport for nurses to do community-based TB <b>work,</b> <b>centralised</b> TB services and patients’ lack of transport were access-related challenges. Knowledge-related challenges involved a lack of TB knowledge by both nurses and community members. The HIV pandemic has increased the number of TB patients and increased nurses’ workloads, aggravating the burden of TB as a resurgent disease in this region. Decentralisation of TB care to community and family levels would be necessary {{to reduce the number of}} people with active TB in the community, and to enhance the TB cure rates, in the Omaheke region of Namibia. In order to implement a successful communitybased TB programme, the patient-related, access-related and knowledge-related challenges, perceived by the nurses, need to be addressed effectively.

40|$|There are few {{literary}} {{characters who}} {{speak to the}} imagination such as Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion Dr John Watson. The city in which these stories are set has an equally strong grasp on the imaginations of the masses: the moment Sherlock Holmes and London are mentioned within the same breath, a very iconic and somewhat stereotypical image of the city comes to mind. A foggy, smoke ridden city, congested with traffic, populated by exotic figures, which {{in the nineteenth century}} has become the heart of a global Empire. 1 This of course, is a stereotypical image of the city, a way of describing the city by authors in order to gain some form of control over the immense city. This will be discussed in greater depth in the following chapter. The characters Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are still quite as popular {{as they were in the}} nineteenth century, maybe even more so. In the recent years the two iconic characters have starred in movies, various TV-shows as well as new books. There are some authors who have tried to recapture the magic of Sherlock Holmes. 2 Whether they have succeeded is another matter, and does not fit within the scope of this research. Though the stories have always focussed on the world’s only consulting detective and the good doctor, they are always connected to capital of an Empire, London. This connection between Sherlock Holmes and London is precisely the subject of this research. The question which has been <b>centralised</b> in this <b>work</b> is: What was the message that Conan Doyle was possibly trying to send his contemporary readers through his description of London and his use of the genre of crime fiction...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Tourism and Hospitality Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2010 This study {{investigated}} the extent of local community involvement in tourism development and conservation activities in eastern Rwanda by using Akagera National Park as a case study. The study used a structured questionnaire to collect data from local residents, while face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} key informants from Rwanda National Tourism and Conservation Agency and local government officials as means to obtain deeper insights. Tosun (2000 : 626) contends that community involvement in tourism can be considered from at least two viewpoints, namely the decision-making process that would involve community participation and the benefits of tourism development such as employment and business opportunities. Results of this research suggest that community participation in Akagera National Park has been recognised by Rwanda National Tourism and Conservation Agency and the government of Rwanda only in the sense of helping local people to obtain economic benefits via employing them as workers within industry [though, still at a low rate], whilst encouraging them to operate small scale businesses such as curio shops, rather than create opportunities for them to have a say in the process of decision making of tourism management and conservation policies. Although Rwanda has opted for a decentralised system in its rural development plans, it is evident that it has failed {{to do so in the}} areas of tourism and conservation - at least in Akagera National Park. The researcher believes that in the light of the research results, the decision making system for Akagera National Park tourism and conservation development plans is still highly <b>centralised,</b> which, conversely, <b>work</b> against participatory development approach. The study recommends that local communities in the Akagera area should be consulted and involved in development programmes within their villages from the start, as this process will present a significant step towards ensuring more adequate participation in conservation and tourism. Finally, the researcher recommends that further studies should be conducted to engage in evaluation of impacts and successes of governmental policy of 5 % revenue sharing, which should be implemented in communities around Akagera National Park...|$|R
