The plans for the TS18 recommends ballast of up to 150 kg forward of the <b>centre</b> <b>case.</b> This assists sailing performance. Auxiliary outboard power of 4 hp upwards is sufficient for general use with TS 16 and TS 18, with TS 21 a 6 hp is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Centre board - (also dagger board) an {{elongated}} underwater appendage that fits vertically {{in the slot}} of a <b>centre</b> <b>case</b> and extends below the hull. It can be retracted so the boat can float in very shallow water. The board has a length to breadth ratio of about 4;1. The board is tapered to a hydrodynamic (teardrop) shape in plan section to promote laminar flow of the water. This shape prevents stalling or eddying when sailing to windward. Together with the sails it lifts the hull in the windward direction. Common materials are wood often reinforced with fibreglass or carbon to obtain more stiffness and abrasion resistance. When sailing to windward the board is fully down but is retracted about half way when sailing directly down wind. When sailing to windward an efficient board prevents most leeway (sideways movement).|$|E

40|$|Background A {{substantial}} scale-up {{in public}} health response is needed to control the unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in west Africa. Current international commitments seek to expand intervention capacity in three areas: new EVD treatment <b>centres,</b> <b>case</b> ascertainment through contact tracing, and household protective kit allocation. We aimed to assess how these interventions could be applied individually and in combination to avert future EVD cases and deaths. Methods We developed a transmission model of Ebola virus that we fi tted to reported EVD cases and deaths in Montserrado County, Liberia. We used this model to assess the eff ectiveness of expanding EVD treatment <b>centres,</b> increasing <b>case</b> ascertainment, and allocating protective kits for controlling the outbreak in Montserrado. We varied the effi cacy of protective kits from 10 % to 50 %. We compared intervention initiation on Oct 15, 2014, Oct 31, 2014, and Nov 15, 2014. The status quo intervention was defi ned in terms of case ascertainment and capacity of EVD treatment centres on Sept 23, 2014, and all behaviour and contact patterns relevant to transmission as they were occurring at that time.

DESIGN: A 10 year prospective multidisciplinary follow up study. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty children diagnosed with NF 1 according to criteria set by the National Institutes of Health. RESULTS: In 62 of 150 children (41. 3 %) complications were present, including 42 (28. 0 %) children with one complication, 18 (12. 0 %) with two complications, and two (1. 3 %) with three complications (mean (SD) duration of follow up 4. 9 (3. 8) years).
