40|$|The {{need for}} high performance, highly {{reliable}} storage for very large on-line databases, coupled with rapid advances in storage device technology, {{has made the}} study of generalized storage hierarchies an important area of research. This paper analyzes properties of a data storage hierarchy system specifically designed for handling very large on-line databases. To attain high performance and high reliability, the data storage hierarchy makes use of multiple page sizes in different <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> and maintains multiple copies of the same information across the <b>storage</b> <b>levels.</b> Such a <b>storage</b> hierarchy system is currently being designed {{as part of the}} INFOPLEX database computer project. Previous studies of storage hierarchies have primarily focused on virtual memories for program storage and hierarchies with a single page size across all <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> and/or a single copy of infprmation in the hierarchy. In the INFOPLEX design, extensions to the least recently used (LRU) algorithm are used to manage the <b>storage</b> <b>levels.</b> The read-through technique is used to initially load a referenced page of the appropriate size into all <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> above the one in which the page is found. Since each <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> is viewed {{as an extension of the}} immediate higher level, an overflow page from level i is always placed in level i + 1. Important properties of these algorithms are derived. It is shown that depending on the types of algorithms used and the relative sizes of the <b>storage</b> <b>levels,</b> it is not always possible to guarantee that the contents of a given <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> i is always a superset of the contents of its immediate higher <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> i- 1. The necessary and sufficient conditions for this property to hold are identified and proved. Furthermore, it is possible that increasing the size of intermediate <b>storage</b> <b>levels</b> may actually increase the number of references to lower <b>storage</b> <b>levels,</b> resulting in reduced performance. Conditions necessary to avoid such an anomaly are also identified and proved...|$|R

40|$|Utilizing an energy-as-substance {{conceptual}} metaphor as {{a central}} feature of the introductory physics curriculum affords students a wealth of conceptual resources for reasoning about energy <b>conservation,</b> <b>storage,</b> and transfer. This paper first establishes the utility and function of a conceptual metaphor in developing student understanding of energy concepts. Then a curricular framework with a prominent energy-as-substance conceptual metaphor is described. The curricular framework involves both a reorganization {{of the content of}} introductory physics as well as a renewed focus. Reorganizing includes treating energy early and spiraling back to energy treatments. The refocusing includes emphasizing energy’s role in modeling phenomena and attending to the tools for representing energy <b>conservation,</b> <b>storage,</b> and transfer.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the stock rationing {{problem of a}} single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. When demand is Poisson and processing time has an Erlang distribution, we show that a single-state variable called work <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> can be employed to completely capture the information regarding inventory level {{and the status of}} current production. The optimal rationing policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone critical work <b>storage</b> <b>levels.</b> For each demand class, there exists a work <b>storage</b> <b>level</b> at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher-priority demands.

30|$|Operational {{policies}} for future scenario were framed for various combinations of resource enhancement and demand management strategies. Resource enhancement strategy through reallocation of reservoir storage capacity encompasses increasing the <b>conservation</b> <b>storage</b> volume at {{the expenses of}} flood control storage volume for reservoirs. Again relatively small storage reallocation seems to be viable keeping in view the uncertainty in occurrence of extreme rainfall events and risk associated with loss in flood control storage capacity, particularly, in case of extreme flood event. Analysis of historical record revealed occasional spells of moderately high inflow to Maithon and Panchet reservoirs to occur every year during non-monsoon months—the occurrence {{was found to be}} higher for Panchet reservoir (located on the main stream of Damodar river system) than for Maithon reservoir. Hence, an increase in storage capacity of the reservoirs (by reallocating 15  % of flood storage of Maithon reservoir and 20  % of flood storage of Panchet reservoir (flood storage capacity of Panchet reservoir being larger than that of Maithon reservoir) to corresponding <b>conservation</b> <b>storages</b> during season- 3 and season- 4) may be explored as a measure to improve the performance.|$|R
