Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with your eyes and that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed it into something [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Richard M. Watt writes, [...] "On 5 November 1918, the Poles and the Czechs in {{the region}} {{disarmed}} the Austrian garrison (...) The Poles took over the areas {{that appeared to be}} theirs, just as the Czechs had assumed administration of theirs. Nobody objected to this friendly arrangement (...) Then came second thoughts in Prague. It was observed that under the agreement of 5 November, the Poles controlled {{about a third of the}} duchy's coal mines. The Czechs realized that they had given away rather a lot (...) It was recognized that any takeover in Teschen would have to be accomplished in a manner acceptable by the victorious Allies (...), so the Czechs <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> a tale that the Teschen area was becoming Bolshevik (...) The Czechs put together a substantial body of infantry – about 15,000 men – and on 23 January 1919, they invaded the Polish-held areas. To confuse the Poles, the Czechs recruited some Allied officers of Czech background and put these men in their respective wartime uniforms at the head of the invasion forces. After a little skirmishing, the tiny Polish defense force was nearly driven out." ...|$|E
500|$|Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News {{praised the}} film's humour and performances: [...] "The anger and hatred one often {{associates}} with a revenge tale is missing"; humour takes over, {{and the film}} [...] "busts the notion that revenge tales must be laden with gore and violence". According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is a boon for a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis". She praised the film's screenplay and direction: [...] "Every frame shows the minute detailing, which gives [...] its real heart. Charming you with wit, underlining humour and with characters who behave without any cinematic hangover". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> ...

[...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues".

500|$|After E.T., Spielberg {{started to}} consult experts, and put more {{scientific}} research into his science fiction films.

He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible [...] "future reality" [...] for the year 2054 {{as opposed to a}} more traditional [...] "science fiction" [...] setting. Dubbed the [...] "think tank summit", the experts included architect Peter Calthorpe, author Douglas Coupland, urbanist and journalist Joel Garreau, computer scientist Neil Gershenfeld, biomedical researcher Shaun Jones, computer scientist Jaron Lanier, and former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) architecture dean William J. Mitchell. Production designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the [...] "2054 bible", an 80-page guide created in preproduction which listed all the aspects of the future world: architectural, socio-economic, political, and technological. While the discussions did not change key elements in the film, they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects, though John Underkoffler, the science and technology advisor for the film, described it as [...] "much grayer and more ambiguous" [...] than what was envisioned in 1999. Underkoffler, who designed most of Anderton's interface after Spielberg told him to make it [...] "like conducting an orchestra", said [...] "it would be hard to identify anything [...] that had no grounding in reality."

500|$|RKO {{had scored}} a major {{financial}} success with Cat People (1942). The film, which cost $141,659, brought in almost $4 {{million in its}} first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel {{to build on the}} success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story [...] "The Amorous Ghost" [...] instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's existing ship set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. [...] "He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> the idea for this ship with a murderous captain." [...] One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.|$|E
