30|$|By {{demonstrating the}} {{important}} mediating role of affect in {{the effect of}} price discounts on <b>cognitive</b> <b>perceptions,</b> this study contributes {{to the understanding of}} the relationships between affect and cognitions in the formation of consumers’ perceptions, particularly focusing on online apparel shopping. There has been no consensus on whether cognition influences affect or affect influences cognition (Campbell 2007; Chebat and Michon 2003; Peine et al. 2009; Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999). As we found that the affective effect of price discounts is greater than cognitive effects (economic and informational effects), the current research confirmed that the affect-cognition model is more appropriate than the cognition-affect model to explain price discount effects in the context of online apparel shopping. Our results suggest that due to the limited information provided in online shopping and the hedonic nature of apparel products, consumers process <b>cognitive</b> <b>perceptions</b> according to affective status, which is a spontaneous manner from price discounts.|$|R

Cognitions were assessed after the game to examine if <b>cognitive</b> <b>perceptions</b> changed and then again one and four weeks later to evaluate if changes were maintained. Results reveal that experiencing repeated losses decreased perceived skill and increased perceptions of luck on gambling tasks in general. Cognitive changes in younger children were larger and were maintained longer than for older children. Analyses of game playing behaviour indicated that children in the losing condition chased losses by betting a larger percentage of bankrolls per hand in the final portion of game time. The results are discussed with emphasis on implications for prevention programs based on cognitive restructuring...|$|R

This study aimed to determine whether dental fear was better explained by experiences or by <b>cognitive</b> <b>perceptions</b> {{of going to the}} dentist as being uncontrollable, unpredictable, dangerous, and disgusting. A random sample of 1, 084 Australian adults (response rate = 71. 7 %) completed a mailed questionnaire with measures of dental fear, perceptions of going to the dentist, and dental experiences. Perceptions of uncontrollability, unpredictability, dangerousness, and disgustingness had strong bivariate associations with scores on the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF- 4 C). Vulnerability-related perceptions accounted for 46. 3 % of the variance in IDAF- 4 C scores beyond that accounted for by demographic variables and five possible dental experiences comprising intense pain, considerable discomfort, gagging, fainting, and having a personal problem with the dentist. In contrast, dental experiences accounted for < 1 % of the variance in IDAF- 4 C scores beyond that accounted for by the four <b>cognitive</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Perceptions of uncontrollability, unpredictability, dangerousness, and disgustingness were superior predictors of dental fear compared with negative dental experiences.

Pure experience does not contain any <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of oppositions {{such as those of}} subject and object, body and mind, and time and space. Nishida aimed to use the concept to define the value of religious experience. By transcending the dichotomous standpoint, Nishida opens a new metaphysical passage to the consideration of immediate experience absent all intervention by judgmental reflection. Nishida, who did not consider ethical problems separate from the problem of self for each individual, understood pure experience to be the realization of true selfhood. The good is the perfection of true individuality, the only foundation for the well-being of all humanity.|$|E
50|$|Another area of {{marketing}} a green brand is {{making use of}} functional and emotional strategies to position a brand in consumers’ minds. The functional characteristic approach delivers information on how a brand's products and services are environmentally friendly, which creates brand connections for buyers and powerful <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of the company (Danciu, 2015). Such information should include a company’s sustainable production process and ecological footprint in relation to its superiority to other competitors. The emotional approach for positioning focuses on emotions and alludes to a brand relationship with nature and the environment (Wang, 2016). It {{has been found that}} emotional strategies build brand loyalty very effectively because consumers feel they are helping preserve the environment through supporting sustainably made products (Danciu, 2015). Wang (2016) states that overall, a mixed strategy of using both emotional and functional approaches to market a green brand generates favorable brand relationships and commitment from consumers. It is noteworthy to mention that the most prosperous green brands are affiliated with either “alternative technology or a green corporate philosophy” (Wang, 2016).|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{psychology}} is the psychological study {{of humans and}} their interactions with their environments. The types of environments studied are limitless, ranging from homes, offices, classrooms, factories, nature, and so on. However, across these different environments, there are several common themes of study that emerge within each one. Noise level and ambient temperature are clearly present in all environments and often subjects of discussion for environmental psychologists. Crowding and stressors are a few other aspects of environments studied by this sub-discipline of psychology. When examining a particular environment, environmental psychology looks at the goals and purposes {{of the people in}} the using the environment, and tries to determine how well the environment is suiting the needs of the people using it. For example, a quiet environment is necessary for a classroom of students taking a test, but would not be needed or expected on a farm full of animals. The concepts and trends learned through environmental psychology can be used when setting up or rearranging spaces so that the space will best perform its intended function. The top common, more well known areas of psychology that drive this applied field include: <b>cognitive,</b> <b>perception,</b> learning, and social psychology.|$|E

40|$|The main thesis I shall try {{to defend}} {{in this paper}} is that, {{although}} Dretske’s distinction between simple perception and <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> constitutes an important milestone in contemporary theorizing on perception, it remains too coarse to account {{for a number of}} phenomena that do not seem to fall squarely {{on either side of the}} divide. I shall argue that what is needed in order to give a more accurate account of perceptual phenomena is not a twofold distinction of the kind advocated by Dretske but a threefold distinc-tion allowing for an intermediate level of perceptual content that is structured and yet non-conceptual. In the first section, I discuss Dretske’s distinction between sensory perception and <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> as well as a number of attendant notions. In section 2, two sets of phenomena that seem neither to constitute instances of sensory perception nor instances of <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> as defined by Dretske will be presented. I argue that they are evidence in favor of the existence of an intermediate level of perception. In section 3, I defend the view that this intermediate level of content is a level of structured non-conceptual perceptual content and I attempt to provide criteria for distinguishing among the three levels of content. 1 This section offers a brief review of the successive stages in the elaboration of the distinction between simple perception (non-epistemic seeing) and <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> (epistemic seeing), first introduced by Dretske in Seeing and Knowing (1969).

40|$|Title: Understanding {{resistance}} to organizational change: a cognitive approach Authors: Emmy Morehed & Sara Skoglund Level: Degree thesis, 30 hp Keywords: Organizational change, Resistance to change, <b>Cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> Background: Organizational {{change is a}} naturally occurring phenomenon and is vital {{for the survival of}} organizations. However, the majority of organizational change initiatives result in failure. Resistance to change {{has been found to be}} the key reason for this organizational change failure. It is therefore important for change agents to understand and manage the change recipients’ {{resistance to}} change, in order to achieve organizational change success. Research question: What role does the change recipients’ <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of organizational change have, when assessing their resistance to change? Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop our understanding of the change recipients’ resistance to organizational change, as it is cognitively perceived, in order to enhance the existing knowledge of resistance and how it in turn can be successfully managed by change agents. In this way, our purpose includes contributing with a theoretical development in regards to the change recipients’ <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of organizational change as well as providing change agents with managerial implications. Method: A qualitative research approach was applied, which included a case study design consisting of multiple cases. Semi-structured interviews and observations were the methods used for collecting the empirical data. The ten respondents were selected from one Swedish company, based on a theoretical sampling method. The data analysis method included both a within-case analysis as well as a cross-case analysis. Theoretical framework: The structure of the theoretical framework is based on three themes. The first theme considers organizational change, where our working definition and theories regarding organizational change are presented. The second theme considers resistance to change, where we define and present the theories regarding resistance to change. The third and last theme considers the change recipient’s <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of organizational change, where we provide our definitions of, and the theories regarding, the cognitive elements. Findings: The change recipients’ cognitive evaluation of organizational change have an important role, when assessing their resistance to change. In regards to the change process, knowledge required to handle the change is found to be the most important cognitive element. Change usefulness is found to be the second most important one. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as change necessity, are not found to be important cognitive elements...|$|E

40|$|High quality {{evidence}} suggests that current approaches to the management of CLBP show only limited effectiveness; one explanation of this finding is that current models of management are misdirected or incomplete. This talk proposes a model of CLBP underpinned by data on the psychological contributors to the LBP experience and recent evidence of neuroplastic changes in the brains of people with CLBP (see below). The model suggests that maladaptive <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> {{about the nature of}} the back problem and future consequences drive behaviours that might bring about maladaptive neuroplastic changes. These central nervous system changes may enhance sensitivity, influence normal attentional processing and potentially create a state of maladaptive self perception of the back, in terms of how the back feels to the individual, the control they feel they have over their back and the meaning of sensory information from the back. Maladaptive <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> and maladaptive self perception are potentially mutually reinforcing and contribute to the maintenance of the CLBP experience.

However, low CPAP adherence limits its treatment effectiveness, {{and it has been}} recognized as a contributing factor to poor physiological and psychosocial health in untreated or under-treated OSA patients. This study investigated the relationships between CPAP adherence, biomedical and cognitive factors in subjects with OSA. METHODS: Subjects who were newly diagnosed of OSA and CPAP therapy naïve were recruited. Their demographic, anthropometric and physiological data were obtained after the in-laboratory sleep studies. They filled in Self Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea (SEMSA) questionnaire (measuring <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> of risk, outcome expectancies and self-efficacy) in addition to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Fixed CPAP pressure was prescribed after in-laboratory titration as indicated. CPAP adherence was objectively measured at 1 and 4 weeks after CPAP use. RESULTS: 91 subjects (14 females) were evaluated, with mean ± SD age of 52 ± 9 years, body mass index (BMI) of 29 ± 5. 6 kg/m 2, ESS score of 9 ± 5, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 28. 7 (21, 53) /hr. Mean days of CPAP use (>= 4 hrs/day) in 1 and 4 weeks were 3. 9 ± 2. 7 days and 18. 9 ± 9. 5 days, respectively. On univariate analysis, there were no significant associations between CPAP adherence and clinical parameters (age, gender, BMI, sleep parameters), prescribed CPAP pressure and sleepiness. Self-efficacy score of <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> measured before the start of CPAP therapy was associated with CPAP use in 1 week (ß= 1. 272 (0. 556, 1. 987)) and 4 weeks (ß= 4. 163 (1. 462, 6. 863)), but not risk perception and outcome expectancies. Multiple linear analysis showed self-efficacy score is a significant predictor of CPAP adherence at 1 and 4 weeks after adjusting for age, gender and OSA severity. CONCLUSIONS: Self efficacy score of <b>cognitive</b> <b>perception</b> is a significant predictor of adherence to CPAP therapy in OSA. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
