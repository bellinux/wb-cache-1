50|$|An {{elliptical}} trainer or <b>cross-trainer</b> (also {{called an}} X-trainer) is a stationary exercise machine used to simulate stair climbing, walking, or running without causing excessive {{pressure to the}} joints, hence decreasing the risk of impact injuries. For this reason, people with some injuries can use an elliptical to stay fit, as the low impact affects them little. Elliptical trainers offer a non-impact cardiovascular workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on {{the speed of the}} exercise and the resistance preference set by the user.|$|E
5000|$|Hatfield joined Nike in 1981, and in 1985 {{started working}} on shoe design. He {{realized}} that his architectural skills {{could be applied to}} shoes. Hatfield was also published for the architectural design of his Portland, Oregon home.

50|$|Week 9 - Endurance: As part of {{immunity}} week, the prize is the penultimate immunity prize. It consists of cross-trainers in round 1, treadmills in round 2, and sky walls (climbing walls) {{in the final}} round. Joe and Meg didn't have {{to take part in}} this contest since both of them have won immunity and were ineligible to win another one. There are therefore sixchampions - Kellie, Lara, Leigh, Rebecca, Sarah & Sharlene. In each round, two champions would be knocked out until the final round. In the first round, the champions had to travel 2 km on a <b>cross-trainer</b> with a resistance of 16. The last two to make it were knocked out. Lara was first, Leigh was second, Sarah was third, and Kellie finished fourth. This meant that Rebecca and Sharlene were knocked out in the first round. In Round 2, the remaining champions had to run 2 km on a treadmill, with an incline of 15. The first two to reach 2 km were through to the sky wall round. Leigh was the first to finish, with Lara being seconds behind. Kellie ended up finishing third, with Sarah finishing in fourth place. This meant that Leigh and Lara were the two finalists, guaranteeing a Westren would be immune this week. The final round was a simple head-on race - the last man or woman standing would win immunity, and the loser would be knocked out. Leigh was unable to complete the Sky Wall, leaving Lara with a much needed immunity for the week.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: 1) To {{determine}} if self-selected exercise using the StreetStrider meets ACSM guidelines for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and 2) {{to determine how}} self-selected exercise intensity using the StreetStrider compares to exercise on a stationary elliptical <b>cross-trainer.</b> Methods: Seven male (age 29. 0 � 11. 18 years) and eight female (age 27. 5 � 11. 29 years) adults performed three separate exercise tests, including a 30 minute test at a self-selected pace on both the StreetStrider and on a stationary elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> {{as well as a}} maximal test using the elliptical <b>cross-trainer.</b> The subjects also completed an exercise enjoyment questionnaire after each of the two 30 minute exercise bouts. Results: It was found that self-selected exercise using the StreetStrider resulted in significantly greater heart rate (155 � 21. 6 vs. 140 � 20. 9 bpm; 85 � 9. 8 vs. 77 � 10. 5 %HRmax), V 02 (30. 5 � 3. 65 vs. 27. 0 � 5. 76 mllkg/min; 71 � 10. 1 vs. 63 � 15. 2 %V 02 max), and caloric expenditure (11. 5 � 3. 23 vs. 10. 2 � 3. 50 kcal/min) than exercise using a stationary elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> (p <. 05). The exercise enjoyment questionnaire showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between enjoyment of exercise using the StreetStrider and exercise using the elliptical <b>cross-trainer.</b> Conclusion: Self-selected exercise using the StreetStrider meets current ACSM guidelines for improving cardiorespiratory fitness. Also, exercise using the StreetStrider elicited significantly greater HR, V 02, and caloric expenditure responses in both men and women when compared to exercise on a stationary elliptical <b>cross-trainer.</b> Therefore, the StreetStrider seems to be an effective exercise modality for healthy adults especially those looking to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and control body weight. By using the StreetStrider regularly for exercise, healthy adults would be likely to experience the health and fitness benefits of physical activity...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{physiological}} responses during incremental exercise to fatigue using the elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> and treadmill running. Twenty recreationally active individuals (10 men and 10 women, mean age, height, weight, and body composition = 29. 5 ± 7. 1 yr, 173. 3 ± 12. 6 cm, 72. 3 ± 7. 9 kg, and 17. 3 ± 5. 0 BF%) completed two randomized VO 2 max tests: treadmill and Precor elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> separated by 1 - 3 days. Breath-by-breath data were collected using a fast response turbine flow transducer and custom developed software with AEI oxygen and carbon dioxide electronic gas analyzers. All breath-by-breath data were smoothed using a 7 -breath moving average. Criteria for attainment of VO 2 max included two of the following: respiratory exchange ratio (RER) > 1. 1, maximal heart rate (HR) within 15 b/min of the calculated value, or VO 2 plateau (DVO 2 0. 05) were found in VO 2 max (47. 9 vs. 47. 3 ml/kg/min), maximal HR (186 vs. 184 b/min), maximal RER (1. 22 vs. 1. 25), and protocol duration (11. 56 vs. 12. 17 min) between elliptical crosstraining and treadmill running.

40|$|Military {{recruits}} {{are known}} to be susceptible to chronic injuries. The knee is the most common injury site and patellofemoral pain has been demonstrated as the leading mechanism for medical military discharge. Military boots have been cited as a key mechanism responsible for the high incidence of chronic injuries. The British Army has therefore introduced two new footwears – a <b>cross-trainer</b> and running shoe to reduce the incidence of chronic injuries. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare knee joint kinetics of the <b>cross-trainer</b> and running shoe in relation to conventional military boots. Twelve male participants ran at 4. 0 m s− 1 in each footwear condition. Knee joint kinetics was obtained and contrasted using repeated-measures ANOVAs. The results showed that patellofemoral load was significantly greater in the military boots. However, peak knee abduction moment was significantly greater in the running shoes. On the basis of the findings from this study, it is recommended that recruits who are susceptible to injuries mediated through excessive knee loads select the <b>cross-trainer</b> for their running activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{equation}} to predict V̇O 2 max from a submaximal elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> test. Fifty-four apparently healthy subjects (25 men and 29 women, mean ± *SD* age: 29. 5 ± 7. 1 years, height: 173. 3 ± 12. 6 cm, weight: 72. 3 ± 7. 9 kg, percent body fat: 17. 3 ± 5. 0 %, and elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> V̇O 2 max: 43. 9 ± 7. 2 ml·kg - 1 ·min - 1) participated in the study and were randomly assigned to an original sample group (*n* = 40) and a cross-validation group (*n* = 14). Each subject completed an elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> submaximal (3 5 -minute submaximal stages) and a V̇O 2 max test on the same day, with a 15 -minute rest period in between. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to develop an equation for estimating elliptical <b>cross-trainer</b> V̇O 2 max from the data of the original sample group. The accuracy of the equation was tested by using data from the cross-validation group. Because there was no shrinkage in R 2 between the original sample group and the cross-validation group, data were combined in the final prediction equation (R 2 = 0. 732, standard error of the estimate = 3. 91 ml·kg - 1 ·min - 1, *p* 0. 05) between predicted (43. 8 ml·kg - 1 ·min - 1) and measured (43. 9 ml·kg - 1 ·min - 1) V̇O 2 max measurements. Results indicate that the protocol and equation developed in the current study can be used by exercise professionals to provide acceptably accurate estimates of V̇O 2 max in non-laboratory-based settings...|$|E

40|$|The ElliptiGO is {{a hybrid}} between a bicycle and an {{elliptical}} <b>cross-trainer</b> and {{is meant to}} be used outdoors. The purposes of this study were to 1) to determine the relative exercise intensity of exercise on the ElliptiGO, and 2) to determine if this intensity fell within ACSM guidelines for improving respiratory fitness. Subjects included 7 male (23. 6 ? 3. 8 years old) and 9 female (23. 2 ? 1. 0) active adults. All subjects completed two exercise tests. Tests included a 30 -minute self-selected exercise bout on the ElliptiGO, and a graded maximal exercise test on the treadmill. It was found that heart rate averaged 84 % of % maximal HR and VO 2 averaged 75 % of VO 2 max during the ElliptiGO workout. Males burned significantly more kcal/min than females (14. 5 kcal/min vs 11. 5 kcal/min).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the accuracy of various activity trackers in estimating steps taken and energy expenditure. The activity trackers included the Nike Fuelband, Jawbone UP, BodyMedia FIT Core, Adidas MiCoach, Fitbit Ultra, and the NL- 2000 i. Only the Nike Fuelband, Jawbone UP, FitBit Ultra, and the NL- 2000 i recorded steps. Twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females) participated in two, 50 -minute activity sessions. The first session consisted of treadmill walking and treadmill running. Each exercise was 20 minutes, with a 10 minute break between. The second session consisted of 20 minutes on an elliptical <b>cross-trainer,</b> a 10 -minute break, and the time needed to complete the agility drills. The activity trackers were worn concurrently with a portable metabolic gas analyzer. Steps were recorded using a hand counter. At the end of each mini-session, steps and kcals were recorded by each activity device. The results of the study showed steps to be fairly accurate for all devices, but calories to be less accurate. The accuracy of the devices varied depending on the exercise modality. Based on the results, choosing an activity device should be based on the information looking to be recorded and the type of activity to be performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the effects of}} footwear on kinetics and lower extremity electromyographic (EMG) activity during the vertical jump (VJ) and standing long jump. Fifteen men performed the 2 jump types in 3 footwear conditions: barefoot, minimal shoes, and cross-training shoes. Jump displacement and kinetic data were collected, along with EMG activity of the biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, peroneus longus, semitendinosus/semimembranosus, soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis. Subjective footwear performance and comfort were also assessed with a custom survey. No differences were found in jump displacement, peak ground reaction forces (GRF), countermovement and propulsive phase durations, vertical impulse, peak countermovement, or average propulsive EMG activity. Significant differences in peak propulsive root mean square EMG were found between barefoot and minimal shoes (p = 0. 030) and minimal shoes and shod (p = 0. 031) conditions for the SOL during the VJ, and for average countermovement EMG of the semitendinosus/semimembranosus during the VJ between barefoot and shod (p = 0. 039). Moderate-to-large effect sizes (3 ̆e 0. 59) were found between conditions for horizontal GRF, propulsive phase duration, average EMG amplitude, and duration of EMG activity during the countermovement. Participants reported higher comfort ratings when shod compared with barefoot and minimal shoes for both jumps. Participants also perceived better performance when shod compared with barefoot and minimal shoes for the VJ only. No acute differences in displacement were observed between barefoot, minimal shoes, and <b>cross-trainer</b> shoes during vertical and horizontal jumps. Some differences in muscle activation and timing seem to be present, and thus, training effects between footwear conditions should be examined. Footwear familiarization may prove beneficial, as acute increases in comfort seem unrelated to performance improvements...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare mean heart rate (HR) responses in prusik climbing and indoor rock climbing. Twenty-eight college-aged participants (18 - 25 yrs.) were randomized into Group 1 (n = 14) and Group 2 (n = 14). Each participant completed a 15 -minute walk prior to a 15 -minute exercise bout. Group 1 completed an indoor rock climbing exercise bout on day 1 of testing and prusik climbing exercise bout on day 2 of testing. Group 2 completed the exercise bouts in reverse order. During the walk and exercise bouts HR was recorded every 5 seconds and averaged into 5 -minute intervals. No interaction (gender x climb x time) was noted for mean HR. Significant interaction (mean HR of walk x mean HR of indoor rock climbing x time) (P < 0. 05) and (mean HR of walk X mean HR ofprusik climb x time) (P < 0. 05) was found. No significant difference was found in mean HR for the first minute of prusik climbing compared to indoor rock climbing. A significm 1 t difference was found in mean HR in prusik climbing compared to indoor rock climbing over a 15 -minute period (P < 0. 05).
