5000|$|Carrier frequency: Usually fixed carrier frequency, {{typically}} {{somewhere between}} 33 and 40 kHz or 50 to 60 kHz. The {{most commonly used}} protocol is the NEC protocol, which specifies a carrier frequency of 38 kHz. The NEC protocol {{is used by the}} vast majority of Japanese-manufactured consumer electronics. The Philips RC-5 and RC-6 protocols both specify a carrier frequency of 36 kHz. However, the early RC-5 encoding chips divided the master frequency of the 4-bit microcontroller by 12. This required a <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator</b> of 432 kHz to achieve a 36 kHz carrier, which was not widely available. Many companies therefore used a 455 kHz <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator,</b> which is commonplace due to that frequency being used in the intermediate frequency stages of AM broadcasting radios, resulting in a carrier frequency of 37.92 kHz (essentially 38 kHz). Even documentation for Philips' own controller chips recommended an easier-to-obtain 429 kHz <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator,</b> yielding a carrier frequency of 35.75 kHz. Modern IR transmitters typically use 8-bit microcontrollers with a 4 MHz master clock frequency, allowing a nearly arbitrary selection of the carrier frequency.|$|E

Synchronizing on 8-bit bytes permits a 9600 baud internet-0 connection to easily translate to a standard, low-speed 19,200 baud TCP/IP serial port. The baud rate measurement permits senders and receivers to use inexpensive low-precision oscillators such as <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonators</b> or resistor-capacitor oscillators.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator</b> is an {{electronic}} component {{consisting of a}} piece of a piezoelectric ceramic material with two or more metal electrodes attached.

40|$|The {{thickness}} stretch vibrations of {{piezoelectric ceramic}} plates are analyzed by solving the first-order Mindlin plate equations with {{finite element method}} in the twodimensional domain. The precise resonance frequency and distribution of displacements are obtained from the analysis in detail. The results based on the two-dimensional solutions are more important particularly {{in the evaluation of}} the energy-trapping feature of <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonators</b> because the accurate mapping of the displacements including the vital thickness stretch mode is of great practical interests. We start from the first-order Mindlin plate theory for PZT type <b>ceramic</b> plates for <b>resonator</b> applications. The cut-off frequency of the thickness stretch vibrations is obtained from the coupled equations. Then these equations are reformatted with the known fundamental resonance frequency and related elastic constants for finite element solutions. With given geometry of a resonator model, the numerical solutions include the resonance frequencies and associated mode shapes are calculated. The thickness stretch vibrations and the associated frequency are of great importance because these results can be directly used for the determination of the frequency of a resonator and the optimal layout of the electrodes for best performance. All these analyses are intended for the direct applications in the design of <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonators.</b> Further considerations of the effects of electrodes, support structures, and other complications can be readily included in current finite element analysis...|$|R
50|$|A {{crystal filter}} is very {{often found in}} the {{intermediate}} frequency (IF) stages of high-quality radio receivers. Cheaper sets may use ceramic filters built from <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonators</b> (which also exploit the piezoelectric effect), or tuned LC circuits. The use of a fixed IF stage frequency allows a crystal filter to be used {{because it has a}} very precise fixed frequency. Very high quality IF filters, called crystal ladder filters, can be constructed by using serial arrays of crystals.|$|R
50|$|Almost any object made of {{an elastic}} {{material}} {{could be used}} like a crystal, with appropriate transducers, since all objects have natural resonant frequencies of vibration. For example, steel is very elastic and has a high speed of sound. It was often used in mechanical filters before quartz. The resonant frequency depends on size, shape, elasticity, and {{the speed of sound}} in the material. High-frequency crystals are typically cut {{in the shape of a}} simple, rectangular plate. Low-frequency crystals, such as those used in digital watches, are typically cut in the shape of a tuning fork. For applications not needing very precise timing, a low-cost <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator</b> is often used in place of a quartz crystal.|$|E

The boards use single or double-row pins or female headers that facilitate connections for programming and incorporation into other circuits. These may connect with add-on modules termed shields. Multiple, and possibly stacked shields may be individually addressable via an I²C serial bus. Most boards include a 5 V linear regulator and a 16 MHz crystal oscillator or <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator.</b> Some designs, such as the LilyPad, run at 8 MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific form-factor restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Bandwidth and selectivity: See graphs. The {{information}} (modulation) in a {{radio transmission}} is contained in two narrow bands of frequencies called sidebands (SB) {{on either side of}} the carrier frequency (C), so the filter has to pass a band of frequencies, not just a single frequency. The band of frequencies received by the receiver is called its passband (PB), and the width of the passband in kilohertz is called the bandwidth (BW). The bandwidth of the filter must be wide enough to allow the sidebands through without distortion, but narrow enough to block any interfering transmissions on adjacent frequencies (such as S2 in the diagram). The ability of the receiver to reject unwanted radio stations near in frequency to the desired station is an important parameter called selectivity determined by the filter. In modern receivers quartz crystal, <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonator,</b> or surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters are often used which have sharper selectivity compared to networks of capacitor-inductor tuned circuits.|$|E

The ceramic structure can be designed to oscillate with low damping approaching the fundamental limits. The coating adds valuable functionality by enhancing the optical reflectivity and electrical conductivity, but severely degrades the quality factor and performance of the device due to the relatively large internal friction in polycrystalline metallic films. Thus, the design problem is to identify an optimal trade-off between performance and functionality.|$|R

PZT <b>ceramic</b> <b>resonators</b> with composition near the morphotropic phase boundary and with different dopants added were prepared for piezoelectric transducer applications.

In this work, nine PZT thick-film resonators have been fabricated and characterized, and two different types of resonators, namely thickness longitudinal and transverse modes, were used for material property characterization. The results were compared with those determined by the IEEE standard method, and they agreed well. It was found that depending on the PZT formulation and dopants, the relative permittivities T 33 / 0 measured at 2 kHz for these thick-films are in the range of 1527 to 4829, piezoelectric stress constants (e 33 in the range of 15 to 26 C/m 2, piezoelectric strain constants (d 31) in the range of- 169 10 - 12 C/N to- 314 10 - 12 C/N, electromechanical coupling coefficients (kt) in the range of 0. 48 to 0. 53, and k 31 in the range of 0. 35 to 0. 38.
