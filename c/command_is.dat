5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the Finnish nor the German high <b>command</b> <b>is</b> going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E

Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High <b>Command</b> <b>is</b> dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds {{is only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase <b>command</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} {{to remove all}} user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army's regular {{units are}} {{concentrated}} in a few bases, {{most of which are}} located in Australia's northern states. The Army's operational headquarters, Forces <b>Command,</b> <b>is</b> located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. Most elements of the Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. The 1st Division's Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks. Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia and Campbell Barracks in Perth. Dozens of Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.|$|E
5|$|The SSD {{controller}} {{will use}} any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling.

If the user saves data consuming {{only half of the}} total user capacity of the drive, {{the other half of the}} user capacity will look like additional over-provisioning (as long as the TRIM <b>command</b> <b>is</b> supported in the system).|$|E
5|$|The Whitlam Labor Government {{subsequently}} amalgamated {{the five}} defence ministries (Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply) {{into a single}} Department of Defence in 1973, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On 1 January 1976, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all-volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Today, the ADF is headquartered at Russell Offices in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations Commands. In addition, Northern <b>Command</b> <b>is</b> based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{benefits}} of a supreme commander were not forgotten, and a tri-service headquarters was revived in 1962, when the Far East <b>Command</b> <b>was</b> formed. The Far East <b>Command</b> <b>was</b> also disestablished in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Following the German {{conquest of}} Yugoslavia and the {{invasion}} of Greece, the Kriegsmarine set up two naval commands for regional operations in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas. The Aegean naval <b>command</b> <b>was</b> first established in February 1941, under Rear Admiral Hans-Hubertus von Stosch. <b>Command</b> <b>was</b> then assumed {{in the fall of}} that year by Erich Förste, who held it until February 1943, when <b>command</b> <b>was</b> past to Werner Lange.|$|R
5000|$|Gameplay is {{very similar}} to Knight Tymes predecessor, Spellbound. Once again, the games wide range of <b>commands</b> <b>are</b> carried-out using [...] "Windimation", a system whereby text <b>commands</b> <b>are</b> carried-out through {{choosing}} options in command windows.|$|R
5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's <b>command</b> <b>is</b> {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain {{began on}} 10 July 1940, {{when the first}} Luftwaffe bomber fleets began attacking convoys and Royal Navy forces in English ports and the Channel. The results were {{positive}} and the Germans succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the channel convoy route and to redirect shipping to ports in north-eastern Britain. With this achieved the Luftwaffe began {{the second phase of}} its air offensive, attacking RAF airfields and supporting structures on the British mainland. The codename of the offensive was Unternehmen Adlerangriff ("Operation Eagle Attack"). On 12 August, it flew its first missions in this regard. On 13 August, the Luftwaffe carried out its largest attack to date on the mainland. Christened Adlertag ("Eagle Day"), the attack was a failure. Nevertheless, the raids continued, at great cost to both sides. The impact of the German offensive on RAF airfields and Fighter <b>Command</b> <b>is</b> disputed. Some historians believe that the attacks were not having much effect and that the Germans were losing the attrition battle, while others believe the RAF was faltering.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{maintains}} several air bases, {{including three}} which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, Air <b>Command,</b> <b>is</b> located at RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force's combat aircraft are based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF's {{maritime patrol aircraft}} are based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide {{and most of its}} transport aircraft are based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF's training aircraft are based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three 'bare bases' in Queensland and Western Australia. Of the RAAF's operational bases, only Tindal is located near an area in which the service's aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF's assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and aircraft are generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, an inland {{waterways}} security <b>command</b> <b>was</b> established {{known as the}} Führer der Sicherungsstreitkräfte (B.d.Sich.). The <b>command</b> <b>was</b> headquartered in Swinemünde and <b>was</b> the administrative <b>command</b> for waterborne security on the Danube; operationally, units <b>were</b> <b>commanded</b> by a subordinate unit known as the [...] "Sicherungs-Lehr-Division". The <b>command</b> <b>was</b> later transferred to Bergen where it operated one transport flotilla and commanded the U-boat service training school for boats stationed in Norway. The unit's final commander was Rear admiral Ernst Lucht.|$|R
