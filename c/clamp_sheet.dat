40|$|Incremental {{sheet metal}} forming (ISMF) has {{demonstrated}} its great potential to form complex three-dimensional parts without using component-specific tools against the conventional stamping operation. Forming components without component-specific tooling in ISMF provides a competitive alternative for economically and effectively fabricating low-volume functional sheet metal products; hence, it offers a valid manufacturing process to match the need of mass customization, which {{is regarded as the}} future of manufacturing. In ISMF process, <b>sheet</b> is <b>clamped</b> in a fixture/frame with an opening window on a programmable machine, and a hemispherical/spherical ended tool is programmed to move in a predefined path giving shape to the <b>clamped</b> <b>sheet</b> by progressively deforming a small region in incremental steps. Although formability in incremental forming is higher than that of conventional forming, the capability to form components with desired accuracy and surface finish without fracture becomes an important requirement for commercializing the ISMF processes.

40|$|Incremental forming of {{aluminium}} sheets has been modelled by finite element simulations. However the computation time was prohibitive because the tool deforms {{every part of}} the sheet and the mesh along the tool path must be very fine. Therefore, an adaptive remeshing method has been developed. The elements that are close to the tool are divided into smaller elements {{in order to have a}} fine mesh where high deformations occur. Consequently, some new nodes become inconsistent with the non-refined neighbouring elements. To overcome that problem, their displacements are constrained, i. e. dependent on their master nodes displacements. The data concerning these new nodes and elements are stored in a linked list, which is a fundamental data structure. It consists of a sequence of cells, each containing data fields and a pointer towards the next cell. The goal of this article is to explain the developments performed in the finite element code, to validate the adaptive remeshing technique and to measure its efficiency using the line test simulation.

Among the promising new approaches is the conversion of planar sheet to components of complex curvature through sheet forming or stretch forming. In both cases, the potential for material stretch {{in the fiber direction}} appears to offer a clear advantage in formability over continuous fiber systems. In the present study, the authors have established a framework which allows the simulation of the anisotropic mechanisms of deformation of long discontinuous fiber laminates wherein the matrix phase is a viscous fluid. The initial study focuses upon the establishment of micromechanics models for prediction of the effective anisotropic viscosities of the oriented fiber assembly in a viscous matrix. Next, the developed constitutive relation is employed through an analogy with incompressible elasticity to exercise the finite element technique for determination of local fiber orientation and laminate thickness after forming. Results are presented for the stretch bending of a curved beam from an arbitrary composite laminate and the bulging of a <b>clamped</b> <b>sheet.</b> Structural analyses are conducted to determine the effect of microstructure on the performance of curved beams manufactured from long discontinuous fiber composites.

30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically <b>clamp</b> the <b>sheet</b> metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the roller path, not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|R

Utilizing modal stability analysis and asymptotic analysis, we studied the stability of the configuration before the coalescence occurred. Our analysis revealed previously unreported relations between viscous forces, body forces, and the instability yielding the coalescence, thus undermining a common assumption that coalescence will occur as long as it will not create a bundle larger than the maximal stable post-coalesced size. A mathematical description of the process creating the hierarchical coalescence structure was obtained and yielded that the mean number of sheets per coalesced region is limited to the subset 2 ^N where N is the set of natural numbers.

To verify these predictions we carried out experiments on thin (20 µm thick adhesive covered) elastomer sheets with different aspect ratios under displacement controlled pull tests.

Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, the geometric nonlinearity inherent in the mechanical response of thin solid objects renders the analysis of the resulting data a nontrivial task. Importantly, the essence of this difficulty is in the geometric coupling between in-plane stress and out-of-plane deformations, and hence is present in the behaviour of Hookean solids even when the slope of the deformed membrane remains small. Here we take a systematic approach to address this problem, using the membrane limit of the Föppl-von-Kármán equations.

On one hand the the adjustment of the material properties during prestressing is highly advantageous as in targeted strain regime the film becomes substantially linearly elastic (which is far not the case without prestress).

40|$|A vacuum {{thermoforming}} machine works by heating a <b>clamped</b> polymer <b>sheet</b> and then engaging the tooling {{to form the}} desired shape when the plastic is at the proper temperature. The current {{vacuum thermoforming}} machine in the Trine University Plastics Lab possesses a single top‐side heater. With the current setup, thicker materials will be scorched on the material’s top side and while the bottom side is not heated enough. In order for thicker materials {{to be used by}} the machine and heated effectively, a second bottom‐side heater is needed. Since an off the shelf solution is not feasible, the second heater must be designed and fabricated. Before fabrication of the secondary thermoforming heater, several analyses were conducted to ensure that the heater would function within the necessary operating parameters. Using thermal simulation software, the designed heater enclosure box was tested to ensure that the correct thermal flow was provided as needed. Material properties were then applied to the CAD files and finite element analysis software was used to ensure that the new heating enclosure and track system would be structurally sound. Although variations of the heating enclosure setup were taken into account as part of these analyses, the results favored mirroring the existing heater layout with some adjustments. Instead of sixteen individual horizontal coils like in the top heater, three coils with three bends each were used. Testing showed that the same watt density could be achieved with only three coils using this design. The new heater was also made thinner in order to allow for more space for the mold.

40|$|Sheet Incremental Forming (IF) is a forming {{technology}} {{which consists}} of a <b>sheet</b> <b>clamped</b> along its edges by a suitable blank-holder while an hemispherical head punch is moved along a defined path and locally deforms the sheet.

Forming forces were measured using self designed instrumented punch and table while the final workpiece geometry was detected using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM).

40|$|Nowadays, product {{manufacturing}} {{can be divided}} into two groups: relatively simple products produced in a large production chain and complex (specialized) components produced in reduced batches. Within the second group, prototyping through incremental sheet forming (ISF) has been subject of several studies. ISF refers to processes where the plastic deformation occurs by repeated contact with a relatively small tool. A crucial aspect in the ISF processes is that the final shape is determined only by the tool movement. The focus of this research is the single point incremental forming (SPIF) process variant, where a <b>clamped</b> <b>sheet</b> metal is deformed by using a relatively small spherical tool. SPIF has several advantages over traditional forming, such as the high formability attainable by the material. Different hypothesis haven been proposed to explain this behavior, but there is still not a clear and definitive understanding of the relation between the particular stress and strain state induced in the material during SPIF and the material degradation leading to localization or fracture. In this thesis, a fundamental research is proposed using the finite element (FE) code LAGAMINE, developed within the University of Liège. Numerical implementation and validation of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model into this FE code is performed. An experimental test campaign is developed to characterize plastic and damage behavior and to validate the damage model for the DC 01 steel grade. Finally, this damage model is applied to simulate the SPIF process in order to verify if it is capable to predict failure. The thesis discusses the material parameter identification for classical plasticity models, describing the anisotropy and hardening behavior of the sheet metal. The derivation of the equations of the numerical damage model and the efficiency of the implementation is presented in great detail. A methodology for the numerical parameter identification of the damage model is proposed, including microscopic measurements by optical microscopy and strain and displacement field measurements by digital image correlation (DIC). The identified Gurson model is applied to simulate standard SPIF geometries, like the line, cone and pyramid tests. The simulations are performed using the solid-shell element formulation and validated in terms of shape and force prediction. Literature reviews of the Gurson model and the SPIF process are also included. The experimental results show that the selected material (DC 01 steel sheet) exhibits a slight anisotropic behavior and work-hardening stagnation on cyclic tests. The performed microscopic measurements are not representative of the actual damage, but they give a qualitative estimation of the physical mechanism of fracture. The initial porosity of the material was determined using optical microscopy measurements in the base material. The numerical implementation of the model is developed with all variables integrated in an implicit way, based on the backward Euler scheme. Nucleation, coalescence and shear extensions implementations are validated by results obtained from the literature. The macroscopic campaign allowed to identify the parameters for nucleation, coalescence and shear. An unique set of results matching all experiments was not possible to obtain, so different sets of parameters are retrieved following an approach that includes inverse modeling and sensitivity analysis. A numerical-experimental comparison of strain values in the loading direction shows that the model is able to correctly predict the strain distribution except during localization of the strain. Globally, the obtained set of material parameters is in good agreement with the experimental results. For SPIF FE simulations, the results of the shape prediction are in good agreement with the experimental results, both for the line and pyramid test. Nevertheless, the force prediction is too high compared to reference values. On the other hand, the GTN model is capable to detect failure in a pyramid and a cone, but the prediction is too premature compared to the experimental failure angle for the same material and geometry. An accurate prediction of failure for the SPIF process was not possible to achieve. The GTN model extended to shear presents inherent flaws that prevent an accurate prediction of the failure angle for the SPIF process. Hence, an extensive research on the damage mechanisms leading to fracture for SPIF cannot rely (only) on the GTN model. The classical coalescence model of the GTN model is insufficient to correctly predict failure. Hence, it is recommended that further analysis concentrates on the description of this particular stage of damage evolution. During the development of this thesis, a robust implementation of the GTN model into the FE code LAGAMINE was done, including an extensive experimental database of microscopic and macroscopic measurements for the DC 01 steel sheet. Other phenomena can be explored thanks to this model...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{metal welding}} (USMW) for battery tabs must be {{performed}} with 100 % reliability in battery pack manufacturing as {{the failure of}} a single weld essentially results in a battery that is inoperative or cannot deliver the required power due to the electrical short caused by the failed weld. In ultrasonic metal welding processes, high-frequency ultrasonic energy is used to generate an oscillating shear force (sonotrode force) at the interface between a sonotrode and few metal sheets to produce solid-state bonds between the <b>sheets</b> <b>clamped</b> under a normal force. These forces, which influence the power needed to produce the weld and the weld quality, strongly depend on the mechanical and structural properties of the weld parts and fixtures in addition to various welding process parameters, such as weld frequencies and amplitudes. In this work, the effect of structural vibration of the battery tab on the required sonotrode force during ultrasonic welding is studied by applying a longitudinal vibration model for the battery tab. It is found that the sonotrode force is greatly influenced by the kinetic properties, quantified by the equivalent mass, equivalent stiffness, and equivalent viscous damping, of the battery tab and cell pouch interface. This study provides a fundamental understanding of battery tab dynamics during ultrasonic welding and its effect on weld quality, and thus provides a guideline for design and welding of battery tabs from tab dynamics point of view. © 2014 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Shearing is a {{fast and}} {{inexpensive}} method to cut sheet metal {{that has been}} used {{since the beginning of the}} industrialism. Consequently, published experimental studies of shearing can be found from over a century back in time. Recent studies, however, are due to the availability of low cost digital computation power, mostly based on finite element simulations that guarantees quick results. Still, for validation of models and simulations, accurate experimental data is a requisite. When applicable, 2 D models are in general desirable over 3 D models because of advantages like low computation time and easy model formulation. Shearing of sheet metal with parallel tools is successfully modelled in 2 D with a plane strain approximation, but with angled tools the approximation is less obvious. Therefore, plane strain approximations for shearing with angled tools were evaluated by shear experiments of high accuracy. Tool angle, tool clearance, and <b>clamping</b> of the <b>sheet</b> were varied in the experiments. The results showed that the measured forces in shearing with angled tools can be approximately calculated using force measurements from shearing with parallel tools. Shearing energy was introduced as a quantifiable measure of suitable tool clearance range. The effects of the shearing parameters on forces were in agreement with previous studies.

40|$|AbstractA thin <b>sheet</b> <b>clamped</b> at {{opposite}} ends and stretched develops wrinkles parallel to {{the direction of the}} applied tensile strain due to the hindered Poisson lateral contraction at the clamps. To study this phenomenon, a variational model recently proposed by Puntel, Deseri and Fried is adopted. The relevant energy functional includes bending and membranal contributions and is minimized subject to a constraint on the area of the mid-surface of the sheet. A fourth order partial-differential equation is henceforth obtained and numerically implemented using B-splines. Predictions are obtained concerning the number of wrinkles, critical applied stretches, and scaling relationships for wrinkle amplitude and wavelength. Both a linearized version of the boundary-value problem based on the small-slope approximation and a fully nonlinear one are considered: their results are found to be in good agreement for the whole range of applied stretches taken into account. Comparisons with previous analytical results by Puntel, Deseri and Fried, who used different boundary conditions and an Ansatz on the deflection function are also provided. The numerical results substantially confirm the validity of the analytical predictions. The present work provides then an alternative numerical method for the study of wrinkling in thin sheets and supports the use of analytical and semi-analytical solutions as viable options for specific geometries. Though further investigation, particularly experimental, is still needed, extensive comparisons of the results with other studies available in the literature provide confirmation for the scaling laws and signal that predicted values of the critical stretches may only be accurate for higher length-to-width aspect ratios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Incremental Sheet Forming is a {{flexible}} process characterized by low costs and higher process times {{with respect to}} traditional forming technologies. It is therefore suitable for prototypes, small series or custom mass productions. Its flexibility derives {{from the use of}} a hemispherical punch that is moved by a CNC machine and gradually deforms the sheet in presence, or not, of a counter die. As a consequence, the <b>sheet</b> <b>clamping</b> is reduced and the part accuracy is lower than traditional sheet forming process as stamping. Therefore, the improvement of the part accuracy in Incremental Sheet Forming is a relevant research topic and solutions for error reduction are required for improving the process quality. The present paper describes the use of an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm for compensating the ISF part geometrical error. In particular, it iteratively corrects the part geometry {{on the basis of the}} error map obtained as the difference between formed and target part geometries. The ILC uses the target geometry to form a first trial part, it measures the obtained geometry and estimates the geometrical error map. Then the error map is used to modify the target geometry and another part is formed. This procedure gets iterated until the desired geometrical tolerance is achieved. The correction algorithm was experimentally tested in forming both axisymmetric and not axisymmetric parts using aluminum sheets. Results showed that in few iteration steps it was possible to significantly improve the part accuracy and to achieve geometrical tolerances comparable with the traditional sheet forming processes...|$|R

In this field, heat treatable aluminum alloys, in age hardened condition, are used; consequently, superficial coatings must be carried out through “cold” processes, i. e. coating processes in which the component to be coated remains at low temperatures, below 100 °C. Cold gas dynamic spray technique (CGDS) is a process of deposition that consists in the realization of surface coatings with high-velocity metal particles sprayed on the substrate at temperature significantly lower than the melting one of the substrate itself and at relatively low temperatures if compared to other spray techniques. When processing conditions are optimized, the process can produce near fully dense coatings. This technique could be particularly useful in the coating of rolled sheets, needing of successive cold plastic deformations. One of the cold plastic processes is incremental forming, a high flexible process for rapid manufacturing of complex sheet metal part shapes; it presents the potential to be easy to automate and particularly attractive for small batches and customized parts. In this process, a simple tool describes a path that allows to locally deform the <b>sheet</b> <b>clamped</b> along its periphery. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the evolution and behaviour of aluminum coating deposed by CGDS on AA 2024 -T 3 sheets carried out by an incremental forming process. This evaluation is carried out by characterizing the cold sprayed coating after the forming process for different wall angles of simples geometries...|$|R
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to <b>clamp</b> the metal <b>sheets</b> together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|R
40|$|In this work, it was {{determined}} that with increasing weld pitch, the occurrence of a 2 ̆ 01 clazy S 2 ̆ 01 d defect in the weld nugget of friction stir welded (FSWed) AA 6061 became increasingly pronounced, though its impact on the bend performance of the weld was negligible. For a fixed weld pitch of 0. 48, the effect of gap, i. e. the spacing between two sheets at the butt joint interface, on the joint quality of AA 6061 was evaluated in terms of the welding defects, microstructure, hardness and bend performance. Fully penetrated welds without metallurgical defects such as wormholes were obtained up to a joint gap of 0. 5 mm. Though the overall microhardness and bend performance of the welds remained unaffected until a joint gap of 0. 8 mm, the decrease in the forge force during FSW beyond a joint gap value of 0. 5 mm may represent a more critical limit in regards to the industrial application of the process; this is especially important when applying force control during processing to ensure a constant shoulder penetration in the material for addressing practical considerations, such as thickness variations in the assembly, clamping distortions and tool wear. Based on these results and using force amplitudes recorded during the welding experiments, a robotic scenario was synthesized with an appropriate operational window for continuous-path friction stir butt welding (FSBW) of 3. 18 -mm-thick <b>sheets</b> <b>clamped</b> to a 1 m 7 1 m horizontal welding table. An appropriate industrial robot model was selected and the associated geometric workcell layout was developed for this application. This scenario was implemented in a physical prototype and used to successfully produce 1 -m-long FSWed assemblies that exhibited good tensile mechanical performance.

40|$|Background: Each year, {{more than}} 200 million {{children}} under the age of 5 years, almost all in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), fail to achieve their developmental potential. Risk factors for compromised development often coexist and include inadequate cognitive stimulation, poverty, nutritional deficiencies, infection and complications of being born low birthweight and/or premature. Moreover, many of these risk factors are closely associated with newborn morbidity and mortality. As compromised development has significant implications on human capital, inexpensive and scalable interventions are urgently needed to promote neurodevelopment and reduce risk factors for impaired development. Method/Design: This cluster randomized trial aims at evaluating the impact of volunteer community health workers delivering either an integrated neonatal survival kit, an early stimulation package, or a combination of both interventions, to pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy, compared to the current standard of care in Kwale County, Kenya. The neonatal survival kit comprises a clean delivery kit (sterile blade, cord <b>clamp,</b> clean plastic <b>sheet,</b> surgical gloves and hand soap), sunflower oil emollient, chlorhexidine, ThermoSpot(TM), Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable instant heater. Community health workers are also equipped with a portable hand-held electric scale. The early cognitive stimulation package focuses on enhancing caregiver practices by teaching caregivers three key messages that comprise combining a gentle touch with making eye contact and talking to children, responsive feeding and caregiving, and singing. The primary outcome measure is child development at 12 months of age assessed with the Protocol for Child Monitoring (Infant and Toddler version). The main secondary outcome is newborn mortality. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on effectiveness of delivering an innovative neonatal survival kit and/or early stimulation package to pregnant women in Kwale County, Kenya. Study findings will help inform policy on the most appropriate interventions for promoting healthy brain development and reduction of newborn morbidity and mortality in Kenya and other similar setting...|$|R
