This was the traditional approach toward defining parallel transport and was used by Dirac.

[...] "With a bevy of princes and famous soldiers" [...] accompanying the King, he inspected [...] "a blue body [...] with red wings flecked with gold [...] and lit up by the twinkling of the sun on many breastplates... paid unusual attention to his personal appearance." [...] Beginning as a courageous young officer and later a successful commander in colonial wars, Evelyn Wood understood the importance of progress and modern technology and lived long enough to see cavalry become almost obsolete.

Now a change has been wrought; earth-movement has drained the sea. But away to the north there still remain the lakes of Ala Kul, Sasik Kul, and Balkash, and on the south Ebi Nor,—pools left in the desert—all that remains of the great icy sea. The alluvial plains, once its bed, are now covered by desert grasses, while the forest clings only to the shaded slopes and gullies on the northern slopes of the mountains.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by the {{production}} on Wrapped in Red, Clarkson wanted all the tracks on Piece by Piece {{to sound like}} its own soundtrack, while also wanting every song to have potential as a single. Taking inspiration from the soundtracks of the feature films Cruel Intentions (1999) and Love Actually (2003), she remarked: [...] "I love soundtracks and I love how you can tell, 'Oh, this {{should be in a}} soundtrack!' You <b>can</b> <b>picture</b> the movie. I definitely wanted the orchestral elements going on and I definitely wanted the intense factor going on." [...] Clarkson illustrated the album as a concept record telling a single [...] "awesome" [...] story, using different pieces of her character, leading her to name the album Piece by Piece. Citing the aspects of heartbreak and personal struggle as well as peace and empowerment in its lyrical content, she described the record as an album within an uplifting and reflective environment. She recalled: [...] "I'm 32 years old, I have pretty much run the gauntlet of pretty much every emotion you could possibly go through — especially being 19 [...] and being thrust into the industry, and growing up really quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions.

It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description <b>can</b> <b>picture</b> -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk".

2500|$|Prior to {{the role}} of Edward being cast for the 2008 Twilight film, Meyer opined that, {{although}} Edward was [...] "Indisputably the most difficult character to cast, [...] is also the one that I'm most passionately decided upon. The only actor I've ever seen who I think could come close to pulling off Edward Cullen is....(drumroll)....Henry Cavill." [...] When the film was optioned by Summit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated that; [...] "The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward", as Cavill was by then 24 years old, and thus too old to realistically fill the role. Meyer reported on her website that the four most popular fan suggestions for actors to play Edward were Hayden Christensen, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerard Way. On 11 December 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, had been cast in the role. Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment’s President of Production, stated: [...] "It is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident, with Rob Pattinson, that we have found the perfect Edward for our Bella in Twilight." [...] Meyer stated that; [...] "I am ecstatic with Summit's choice for Edward. There are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time, and even fewer who I <b>can</b> <b>picture</b> in my head as Edward. Robert Pattinson is going to be amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Foundations sold well: eight editions and 60,000 copies within 10 years, 100,000 copies by the {{outbreak}} of World War I and 24 editions {{and more than a}} quarter of a million copies by 1938. The success of The Foundations after it was published in October 1899 made Chamberlain into a celebrity intellectual. The popularity of The Foundations was such that many Gymnasium (high school) teachers in the Protestant parts of Germany made [...] Die Grundlagen required reading for their students. One teacher remembered: [...] "I myself read the whole book in one go when as a young gymnasium teacher in Nürnberg it fell into my hands. And with a flushed face I put it aside full of excitement. I <b>can</b> <b>picture</b> the scene today [...] and can reawaken the old feeling". The book sold very well, but reviews in Germany were very mixed. Conservative and National Liberal newspapers gave generally friendly reviews to The Foundations. Völkisch newspapers gave overwhelming positive reviews to The Foundations with many völkisch reviewers calling Die Grundlagen one of the greatest books ever written. German universities were hotbeds of völkisch activity in the early 20th century, and The Foundations was extremely popular on university campuses with many university clubs using The Foundations as a reason to exclude Jewish students from joining. Likewise, military schools were centers of völkisch thought in the early 20th century, and so The Foundations was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, Die Grundlagen did not lead to Jews being excluded. The only exceptions to the otherwise total exclusion of German Jews from the officer corps were the Bavarian and Saxon armies, which were prepared to accept Jews as reserve officers. [...] Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in The Foundations, noted that Chamberlain quoted out of context the writings of Goethe to give him views that he had not held in The Foundations [...] and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism that they found extremely off-putting.|$|E
