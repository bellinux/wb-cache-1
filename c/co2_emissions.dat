5|$|The power station's use {{of biomass}} since 2004 {{has been part}} of an attempt to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) output. In 2002 and 2004 the station met its targets for {{reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest <b>CO2</b> <b>emissions</b> in the north of England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year. However, generally the station reduced it <b>CO2</b> <b>emissions</b> by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and European standards.|$|E
5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} <b>CO2</b> <b>emissions</b> from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's <b>CO2</b> <b>emissions.</b> Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of <b>CO2</b> <b>emissions</b> by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required {{to contribute to the}} delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton {{to the north of the}} Humber estuary.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> varying significantly among different vegetation types for plants could alter the microclimatic environment of soil. In a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation and an adjacent Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata shrub, which {{are located in}} a dry-hot valley region of Minjiang River in the Southwest of China, the daily soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> dynamics was measured in August 2004 and in May, July, and October 2005. The {{results showed that the}} soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> in the oak shrub was significantly higher than the pine plantation in each measurement period. Additionally, soil organic matter, microbial biomass carbon, and the leaf litter decomposition rate in the two vegetations differed significantly from each other. The variation of soil organic matter and microbial biomass carbon partially contributed to the evident difference in Soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission.</b> Moreover, the correlations between Soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission,</b> soil temperature, and soil water content were evaluated in this study. The soil temperature positively controlled Soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> in the pine plantation and the oak shrub, while the soil water content negatively influenced Soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> in the two vegetation types. However, the soil temperature and soil water content played varied roles in the different vegetation types. By the means of stepwise regression, the soil temperature more significantly influenced the dynamics of soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> for the plantation than the soil water content; oppositely, the soil water content was the more significant controlling factor for the shrub. Based on the exponent model between the Soil <b>CO(2)</b> <b>emission</b> and soil temperature, the Q(10) values were estimated, which was 1. 7 in the pine plantation and 3. 0 in the oak shrub. The former was lower than the global average level of 2. 0, whereas the latter was higher than the global average level...|$|R
