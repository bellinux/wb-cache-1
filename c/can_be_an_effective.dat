5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
