40|$|Excerpt: In {{several recent}} papers (Wilkinson, 1966 a, 1966 b, 1966 c, 1967), I have {{discussed}} the interesting origins of modern <b>collecting</b> <b>nets.</b> Actual illustrations of nets are very rarely found in entomological literature before the 1750 s, and we are extremely lucky to have in Réaumur 2 ̆ 7 s classic Mémoires pour servir á l 2 ̆ 7 histoire des insectes (Paris, 1734 - 42), a very early depiction {{of one of the}} ancestors of our present bag-net, with an explanation of its construction. René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1683 - 1757) is probably best known for his thermometer, still used in some countries. A prominent member of the Académie des Sciences, Réaumur distinguished himself in many fields of endeavor. His Mémoires contain the results of original research on such topics as the community life of social insects and the development of parasitic Hymenoptera. A follower of Swammerdam, Réaumur studied the immature stages of many species of insects and made a significant contribution to our knowledge of the nature of metamorphosis...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{economists have}} {{increasingly}} debated whether multilateral development banks, {{such as the}} World Bank, should switch from making subsidized loans to giving outright grants. It is no small question. The combined loans of the World Bank Group and brethren regional entities such as the Asian and Inter-American Development Banks, approach $ 300 billion. 1 Their funds constitute a main channel through which rich country governments provide assistance to developing country governments. In Bulow and Rogoff (1990), we first developed {{the case for a}} shift to outright grants. We argued that under the status quo, a vastly disproportionate share of aid goes to middle income countries via disguised interest subsidies, rather than to the poorest countries. We also argued that a shift to grants would protect donor banks from sometimes having to play a “bad cop ” role when trying to <b>collect</b> <b>net</b> repayments rather than fully rolling over loans. The “Meltzer Commission ” (2000) report on government sponsored international lending institutions famously took a similar view. Supporters of the status quo often argue that development bank loans to middl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Long-lasting insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets (LLINs) are {{a primary}} malaria prevention strategy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, emergence of insecticide resistance threatens {{the effectiveness of}} LLINs. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Cross-sectional surveys of LLINs were conducted in houses of seven and four villages in Gem and Bungoma Districts in western Kenya, respectively. Condition (number and area of holes in the nets), number and species of mosquitoes resting inside them, and insecticidal activity of nets were quantified. Mosquitoes <b>collected</b> inside <b>nets</b> were allowed to lay eggs and progeny tested for susceptibility to deltamethrin and permethrin, pyrethoids commonly deployed in LLINs in western Kenya. 				 				 					 						Results 					In Gem, 83. 3 % of nets were {{less than three years}} old and 32. 4 % had at least one hole of any size; while in Bungoma, 92 % were less than three years old and 48 % had at least one hole. No anopheline and five Culex spp. mosquitoes were found resting inside nets in Gem regardless of the number and size of holes, while 552 Anopheles gambiae s. l., five Anopheles funestus s. l. and 137 Culex spp. were in nets in Bungoma. The number of mosquitoes resting inside nets increased with hole areas > 50 &# 160;cm in Bungoma. In WHO resistance assays, f 1 offspring of samples <b>collected</b> in <b>nets</b> in Bungoma were 94 and 65 % resistant to deltamethrin and permethrin, respectively. Nets from Bungoma retained strong activity against a susceptible laboratory strain, but not against f 1 offspring of field-collected An. gambiae s. s. All An. gambiae s. s. samples <b>collected</b> in <b>nets</b> were homozygous for the kdr genotype L 1014 S. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					In areas with pyrethroid resistant vectors, LLINs with modest hole areas permit mosquito entry and feeding, providing little protection against the vectors. LLIN formulations develop large holes within three years of use, diminishing their presupposed lifetime effectiveness...|$|R
