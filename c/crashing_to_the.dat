5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E

Schilling {{attacked}} Walker's lead leg from the start and scored knockdowns with elbows in rounds one and two. As Schilling got more aggressive {{towards the end of}} round two and began to look for the finish, Walker let his hands go and connected with a short right cross which sent Schilling <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas in a state of unconsciousness.|$|E

25|$|In their highly {{anticipated}} July 15, 2006 rematch, Vargas {{was stopped}} in the 6th round via TKO. When the sixth round began, Mosley landed a huge left hook that sent Vargas <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas. Vargas rolled over onto all fours and was unsteady, but after stumbling twice he finally beat referee Kenny Bayless' count. Moments later, Mosley unleashed another flurry as Vargas could only protect his face, and the referee stopped the fight at 2:38 as a beaten and disoriented Vargas staggered back to his corner.|$|E

The fight started tense and cagey, with little to no action for the {{majority}} of round one until Filho, making his debut under kickboxing rules, landed the decisive strike, a perfectly timed counter right hook, which sent Hug <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas in a state of unconsciousness at the 2:37 mark.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the Veridian system, Enterprise makes {{contact with the}} Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran's location first. La Forge is returned to Enterprise, but he inadvertently reveals Enterprises shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to inflict crippling damage on Enterprise. Enterprise destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander William Riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive.

25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, GSA {{estimated}} {{the costs of}} renovating the Hoover Building at between $850 million to $1.1 billion. Additional problems also became apparent that same year. A piece of the concrete façade came loose and fell onto the sidewalk on busy Pennsylvania Avenue NW. A contractor was hired to remove loose concrete from the exterior. Construction netting was hung around the upper floors to prevent additional pieces of concrete from <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. The {{total cost of the}} concrete removal and safety netting installation was $5.9 million. In 2007, an architectural design and planning consultant reported that the cost of these renovations and the disruption to FBI work and staff were not justifiable. The consultant recommended building a new FBI headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Bardwell Mill {{was built}} in 1823. It worked by wind until 1925 and then by a Blackstone oil engine until 1941. The mill was {{derelict}} in 1978 but was later purchased by James Waterfield, who completed {{the restoration of the}} mill in 1985. The mill was sold to Geoffrey and Enid Wheeler in July 1987. On 16 October 1987, the mill was tailwinded when one of the gears in the fantail drive system became disengaged. The result was that the windshaft sheared {{at the rear of the}} canister, bringing the sails <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Restoration work began again in 1989 but was hampered by limited funds. Geoffrey Wheeler died in 1995 and in 1997 The Friends of Bardwell Windmill was set up. English Heritage and St Edmundsbury Borough Council gave over £73,000 towards the estimated cost of £92,000 to restore the mill. The balance was to be raised by the Friends. A replacement cap, cast iron windshaft and fantail were fitted to the mill in 2004.|$|E

25|$|In early August, the {{lightweight}} Breidis Prescott {{was chosen by}} Rubio as Khan's next opponent. Rubio had trained a fighter who had narrowly lost to Prescott before and thought that Khan {{would be able to}} handle the bigger Prescott, who had a prolific knock-out record of 17 KOs in 19 contests. On 6 September 2008, Khan was a huge favourite and was hoping to win a world title {{by the end of the}} year. Prescott came out fast in the fight and landed some good shots; a stiff jab jerked Khan's head back and foreshadowed what was to come. Prescott landed a left hook that jabbed Khan's temple; dizzying his senses. Instead of holding, Khan tried to punch back, but instead was punched on the head by a left hook, right hook combo, sending him <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas. He managed to get to his feet. Prescott ended it for good with another left that put Khan down again. This time, he was unable to get up. It was officially over in 55 seconds.The fight was at the Manchester Evening News Arena on Khan's Sky Box Office debut.|$|E
25|$|As {{the crews}} cut their ships {{free of the}} {{wreckage}} Minerve and Dido scraped alongside one another, their cannon opening fire once more at point blank range. The greater height of the French ship conferred an unexpected advantage as its higher spars ripped Didos topsails off her masts, allowing Minerve {{to pull away from}} the British ship. At this stage Lowestoffe, which had been hitherto prevented from joining the combat by the position of Dido, now arrived off Minerves bow and opened fire from close range. In less than eight minutes this raking fire had brought the foremast and the main and mizen topmasts <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck, rendering Minerve unable to manoeuvre. As this combat developed, Artémise had passed by at some distance, opening an ineffectual fire. Seeing that Minerve was badly damaged, Captain Charbonnier turned his ship and retreated northwards. Seeing the French ship withdraw, Towry ordered Middleton to pursue, Lowestoffe breaking off action with Minerve at 09:15 and chasing Artémise, which opened fire with its stern-chasers, damaging Lowestoffes mizenmast. Middleton replied with his own bow-chasers, but they had little effect and the faster Artémise soon pulled away from Lowestoffe. At 10:30 the chase was abandoned and Middleton returned to the isolated and battered Minerve.|$|E
25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel {{before he}} even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fence. His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family cheered and backed Hayden up to the hilt screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E

25|$|England's innings {{was more}} solid than Australia's - {{the first seven}} batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 - but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) {{struggled}} along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it wasn't a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boundary ten times {{as he and his}} vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence - and the lengthening shadows - got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.|$|E

In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the main shaft and trapping 350men underground.

500|$|Clive Owen {{called the}} {{shoot-out}} scene [...] "one {{of the most}} exquisitely executed sequences I've been involved in". Tom Tykwer planned the scene in detail and toured the museum with the principals months in advance. The lobby entrance scene was filmed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, but for the shooting sequences a [...] wide, life-size replica, including an audio visual exhibition with works of Julian Rosefeldt, was built in Germany. This set was too large for the studio, so it was instead built in a disused locomotive warehouse outside Berlin; its construction took ten weeks. Having filmed in the real museum interior and on the sound stage in Germany, the film crew had to track the lights and camera angles carefully throughout to ensure continuity.

500|$|Tyrannosaurus was {{acknowledged}} by Spielberg as [...] "the {{star of the}} movie", even leading him to rewrite the ending to feature the T. rex for fear of disappointing the audience. Winston's animatronic T. rex stood , weighed , and was [...] long. Jack Horner called it [...] "the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur". While the consulting paleontologists {{did not have a}} consensus on the dinosaur's movement, particularly regarding its running capabilities, animator Steve Williams decided to [...] "throw physics out the window and create a T. rex that moved at sixty miles per hour even though its hollow bones would have busted if it ran that fast". The major reason was the T. rex chasing a Jeep, a scene that took two months to finish. The dinosaur is depicted with a vision system based on movement, though later studies indicated the T. rex had binocular vision comparable to a bird of prey. Its roar is a baby elephant mixed with a tiger and an alligator, and its breath is a whale's blow. A dog attacking a rope toy was used for the sounds of the T. rex tearing a Gallimimus apart, while cut sequoias <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground became the sound of the dinosaur's footsteps.|$|E
500|$|Rocket {{engineer}} G. Harry Stine worked alongside Coandă from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation, {{and interviewed}} him in 1962. In 1967, the magazine Flying printed an account written by Stine, which described {{the landing gear}} as retracting into the lower wing, with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing. Stine wrote that Coandă flew on 10 December 1910, and described {{the heat from the}} [...] "two jet exhausts" [...] as being [...] "too much for me" [...] after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft. In the 1980s after Coandă's death, Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft, including new details such as the name of master mechanic Pierre Clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur. Stine's recounting of the 10 December flight included the group of eyewitness French dragoons, asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine, intended taxiing with unintentional flight, a steep climb with a stall, Coandă thrown clear, and the aircraft <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, burning. Stine gave his assessment that [...] "Coanda's turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet", but that the patent application had no indication of the [...] "critical stage—injection of fuel into the compressed air". He wrote that [...] "although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 Coanda Jet and the 1938 Caproni Campini N.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in 1938".|$|E
