50|$|The Detour {{for this}} leg was Pasacables (<b>Cableman)</b> and Timonel (Helmsman). In Pasacables, teams {{had to go}} to the Miraflores Locks Visitor Center, then pass a cable above a metal rod high above them. After passing three cables above the rod (with 6 shots per turn), a <b>cableman</b> would give them the next clue. In Timonel, teams {{had to go to}} Sidmar (Marine Training School) and sail a boat in a {{simulator}} of the Panama Canal without crashing into any other boat. If they sailed safely for 15 minutes, the captain would give them their next clue. In the Leg's Roadblock, at the Cargo Terminal of the Pacific, a team member had to look among 60 freight wagons for the only lamp which could be turned on; once it was found, they received the next clue.|$|E
40|$|In 1885 the Italian {{government}} {{entered into}} contract with Pirelli {{for the construction}} and maintenance of twelve cables to connect various islands with the mainland. For {{the execution of the}} contract, Pirelli built a cable-sheathing factory at San Bartolomeo, near La Spezia, ordering to Thompson yard the cable-ship Città di Milano, which worked also beyond national borders. It wrecked at Filicudi in 1919. In 1944 Ernesto Del Grande, a Pirelli <b>cableman,</b> wrote a story on this, also organizing a portfolio with seventy-two images. The two sources, belonging respectively to the Archivio Storico Pirelli and the Biblioteca Sormani, are published for the first time, with a selection of thirty-six images of the last one...|$|E
50|$|For {{nearly a}} month after American troops went into Korea, the Air Force strove to meet burgeoning {{personnel}} requirements with volunteers, offering its reservists and guardsmen opportunities for either enlistment or voluntary recall to active duty. The Air Force’s first voluntary recall on 30 June 1950, sought communications and electronic officers, radar officers and specialists, telephone and radio operators and maintenance men, cryptographer operators and technicians, and wiremen and <b>cablemen.</b> Additional calls followed, and by 20 July ConAC had a consolidated recall requirement for almost 50,000 reservists. They included 2,000 pilots, 1,900 specialized observers, 4,326 nonrated officers, and 41,536 airmen.|$|R
