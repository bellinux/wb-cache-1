However, focusing on multiple UML diagrams is a main cause of breaching the consistency problem, which ultimately reduces the overall software model’s quality. <b>Consistency</b> <b>management</b> techniques are widely used to ensure the model consistency by correct model-to-model and model-to-code transformation. <b>Consistency</b> <b>management</b> becomes a promising area of research especially for model-driven architecture. In this paper, we extensively review UML <b>consistency</b> <b>management</b> techniques. The proposed techniques have been classified based on the parameters identified from the research literature. Moreover, we performed a qualitative comparison of <b>consistency</b> <b>management</b> techniques {{in order to identify}} current research trends, challenges and research gaps in this field of study. Based on the results, we concluded that researchers have not provided more attention on exploring inter-model and semantic consistency problems. Furthermore, state-of-the-art <b>consistency</b> <b>management</b> techniques mostly focus only on three UML diagrams (i. e., class, sequence and state chart) and the remaining UML diagrams have been overlooked. Consequently, due to this incomplete body of knowledge, researchers are unable {{to take full advantage of}} overlooked UML diagrams, which may be otherwise useful to handle the <b>consistency</b> <b>management</b> challenge in an efficient manner...|$|E

40|$|As file systems {{continue}} to grow, metadata search {{is becoming an}} increasingly important way to access and manage files. However, existing solutions that build a separate metadata database outside of the file system face <b>consistency</b> and <b>management</b> challenges at large-scales. To address these issues, we developed Magellan, a new large-scale file system metadata architecture that enables the file system’s metadata to be efficiently and directly searched. This allows Magellan to avoid the <b>consistency</b> and <b>management</b> challenges of a separate database, while providing performance {{comparable to that of}} other large file systems. Magellan enables metadata search by introducing several techniques to metadata server design. First, Magellan uses a new on-disk inode layout that makes metadata retrieval efficient for searches. Second, Magellan indexes inodes in data structures that enable fast, multi-attribute search and allow all metadata lookups, including directory searches, to be handled as queries. Third, a query routing technique helps to keeps the search space small, even at large-scales. Fourth, a new journaling mechanism enables efficient update performance and metadata reliability. An evaluation with realworld metadata from a file system shows that, by combining these techniques, Magellan is capable of searching millions of files in under a second, while providing metadata performance comparable to, and sometimes better than, other large-scale file systems...|$|R

To provide this, the MMVE must include a sophisticated <b>consistency</b> <b>management.</b> This management must adapt its behavior to different activities {{carried out in}} the MMVE as well as different system loads.

40|$|International audienceDuring interactions, system actors {{may face}} up misunderstandings when their local states contain {{inconsistent}} {{data about the}} same fact. Misunderstandings in interactions are likely to reduce interactivity performances (deviation or deadlock) or even affect overall system behavior. In this paper, we characterize misunderstandings in interactions between system actors (that may be human users or system agents) in interactive adaptive systems. To deal with such misunderstandings and ensure state consistency, we present an agent-based architecture and a scenario structuring approach. The system includes several agents devoted to scenario unfolding, plot adaptation and <b>consistency</b> <b>management.</b> Scenario structuring {{is based on the}} notion of a situation that is an elementary building block dividing the interactions between systems’ actors into contextual scenes. This pattern supports not only scenario execution but <b>consistency</b> <b>management</b> as well. In order to organize and control interactions, the situation contextualizes interactions and activity of the system’s actors. It also includes prevention and tolerance agent-based mechanisms to deal with the misunderstandings and their causes.
