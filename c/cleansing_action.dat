2500|$|The Nazis {{replaced}} Ukrainian policemen who deserted from German {{service with}} Polish policemen.

German policy called {{for the murder of}} the family of every Ukrainian police officer who deserted and the destruction of the village of any Ukrainian police officer deserting with his weapons. These retaliations were carried out using newly recruited Polish policemen. Though Volhynian Polish participation in the German Police followed UPA attacks on Polish settlements, it provided the Ukrainian Nationalists with useful sources of propaganda and was used as a justification for the <b>cleansing</b> <b>action.</b> OUN-B leader summarized the situation in August 1943 by saying that the German administration [...] "uses Polaks in its destructive actions.

50|$|The {{policies}} the Germans {{employed in}} the occupied Soviet territories were {{the extension of the}} brutal policies they had developed {{over the past two years}} in occupied Poland. At first, the Germans tried to cow the local populace with violence. The policies of 1941 were aimed more at a potential than a real threat, as the Soviet partisans were only just organizing in the aftermath of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was on the Eastern Front (including the Balkans) that German terror directed against the local populace was the greatest.

Sternhell's premises lead to the inexorable conclusion that the guiding ideology of Israel's founders forced an inhumane destiny on the Palestinian people, no less so in 1948 than in 1967. But rather than embrace this obvious conclusion, Sternhell shrinks from it in much the way that otherIsraeli [...] "post-Zionists" [...] have done." ...|$|R

A subsequent measurement of subjects 4 moral self-image supports our interpretation that the occurrence of moral cleansing crucially depends on the moral costs resulting from immoral actions directed at individuals in different roles.

Oat bath was a common treatment of insomnia, anxiety and skin diseases such as eczema and burns. In Roman times, its use as a medication for dermatological issues was reported by Pliny, Columella, and Theophrastus. In the 19th century, oatmeal baths were often used to treat many cutaneous conditions, especially pruritic inflammatory eruptions. In the 1930s, the literature provided further evidence about the <b>cleansing</b> <b>action</b> of oat along with its ability to relieve itching and protect skin.|$|E

50|$|Taylor's {{ground-breaking}} work on John the Baptist situated John {{within the}} context of Second Temple Judaism and argued that his baptism should be understood in line with forms of immersion for ritual purity known at the time. John's baptism rid the body of ritual impurity after the inner being had been <b>cleansed</b> by repentance, <b>action</b> and forgiveness, preparing people for the eschatological arrival of a coming figure. In her careful analysis of issues surrounding the traditions of the Baptist like purification, she showed that John's baptism should not be understood through the duality of outer symbolism and inner repentance, as John Dominic Crossan stated earlier, but outer and inner purity. The significance of the book, as Bruce Chilton puts it, is in treating the tradition of the Baptist in its own historical context, not under the shadow of New Testament Christology. Her analysis instilled scholarly debates of the relationship between Qumran and John the Baptist as well as formative Christianity with a spectrum of opinions over her findings.|$|R

50|$|Salt water {{mouth wash}} {{is made by}} {{dissolving}} 0.5-1 teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water, which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth. Saline has a mechanical <b>cleansing</b> <b>action</b> and an antiseptic action {{as it is a}} hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria, which undergo lysis. The heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow (hyperemia) to the surgical site, promoting healing. Hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses. Conversely, if heat is applied {{on the side of the}} face (e.g., hot water bottle) rather than inside the mouth, it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra-orally, which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face (see cutaneous sinus of dental origin). Gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat.|$|E

40|$|Shampoos are {{products}} which remove surface grease and dirt from the hair shaft and scalp. The <b>cleansing</b> or detergent <b>action</b> of a shampoo {{is a primary}} function. However, the foaming characteristic of a shampoo has {{an important role in}} its acceptability. Often alkanolamides are used for the formation of a stable foam; but because of producing nitrosamines, they are potentially carcinogenic compounds. Hence, the main goal of this study was the elimination of these materials from shampoo formulations. Acanthophyllum squarrosum is one of the 23 species of the genus Acanthophyllum endemic in Iran. Due to the presence of saponin in its root, chubak, has been used traditionally as a detergent. In this study, total saponins of Acanthophyllum squarrosum roots were extracted, using several solvents. A clear liquid shampoo base was formulated using Texapon as surfactant, sodium chloride as thickener, glycerin as viscosity modifier, methyl paraben as preservative and EDTA as sequestring agent. Then, a fixed amount of Texapon was substituted by 1, 2. 5 and 5 percent of total herbal saponins. Foaming ability of the shampoos prepared was evaluated by the Ross-Miles method and the cleansing power by Thompson test. The best result was found with the formula containing 20 % Texapon and 5 % total herbal saponins. Therefore, this formulation was selected as the best formula and evaluated for other characteristics. In addition to possessing the properties of a liquid shampoo, the unique characteristics of the formula containing 5 % total herbal saponins was that it produced a stable foam without the use of foam stabilizers. Evaluation of the cleansing power by Thompson test showed that the final formula is a shampoo for normal hair, with very good cleansing ability. Rheological studies showed that the final formula had a pseudoplastic behavior. Organoleptic and physicochemical characteristics of the final formula were all found to be acceptable...|$|R

40|$|Oral candidosis {{is by far}} the commonest human fungal {{infection}} and manifests in a variety of clinical guises. The main reason for its high incidence appears to be the multiplicity of predisposing factors, which facilitate the conversion of oral commensal Candida to a parasitic existence. Despite the availability of a number of effective antimycotics for the treatment of oral candidoses, failure of therapy is not uncommon owing to the unique environment of the oral cavity where the flushing effect of saliva and the <b>cleansing</b> <b>action</b> of the oral musculature tend to reduce the drug concentration to sub-therapeutic levels. For these and other reasons chlorhexidine is widely prescribed in dentistry both as an antiseptic mouthwash and a denture disinfectant in order to supplement other antifungals.
