40|$|Abstract. First {{results of}} a {{possible}} alternative route for plasma assisted processing of 410 LHC steel powder compacts are shown in present work. Carburizing treatment was performed simultaneously with the sintering of samples. The main motivation {{of this study was}} verifying the possibility to eliminate the manufacturing step of the carburizing thermochemical treatment, which is normally applied in the production of sintered steel parts subjected for extreme wear conditions. Treatment was carried out in pulsed DC abnormal glow discharge, using gas mixture (atmosphere) of 99 %(80 % Ar + 20 % H 2) + 1. 0 % CH 4, at 1100 °C, during 60 min, and 9 Torr, for two different conditions, termed: a) Sintering-Carburizing at high flow (for 480 sccm); and b) Sintering-Carburizing at low flow (for 120 sccm). Characterization of the treated samples was performed by Optical Microscopy, SEM, XRD, and microhardness measurements. The presence of CH 4 in the plasma atmosphere proved to be viable to <b>carburize</b> the sample surface while the sintering stage was carried out.

Fe 2 O 3 precursors reduce to Fe 3 O 4 and then <b>carburize</b> {{to form a}} mixture of Fe 2. 5 C and Fe 3 C in both CO and H 2 /CO mixtures at 540 - 720 K. Oxygen removal initially occurs without FTS reaction as Fe 2 O 3 forms inactive O-deficient Fe 2 O 3 species during initial contact with synthesis gas at 523 K. FTS reactions start to occur as Fe 3 O 4 forms and then rapidly converts to FeCx. The onset of FTS activity requires only the conversion of surface layers to an active structure, which consists of FeCx with steady-state surface coverages of oxygen and carbon vacancies formed in CO dissociation and O-removal steps during FTS. The gradual conversion of bulk Fe 3 O 4 to FeCx influences FTS rates and selectivity weakly, suggesting that the catalytic properties of these surface layers are largely independent {{of the presence of}} an oxide or carbide core.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of the {{projects}} "THTR" and "Process Heat Reactor" an experimental facility has been built up as a contribution for the development of high-temperature reactors. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed on boiler and heatexchanger materials. Special attention was given to the assessment of the hydrogen amount delivered into the primary helium coolant circuit. Hydrogen was set free by the oxidation of the metal by the secondary coolant at the inner surface of test tubes. In the next step it permeates the tube wall and reaches the outer surface of the tube which is in contact with the primary coolant. The specimens were capsules made out of tubes of different materials. Furthermore the carburization of boiler materials by low concentrations of carbon monoxide as impurity in the coolant gas was investigated. Supplementary some measurements on hydrogen permeation through such tubes were performed. A brief discussion for the coolant chemistry of helium and water as well as the discussion of some surface phenomena is included. A description of the apparatus and the experimental method follows. The results of hydrogen delivery measurements and of metallographic investigations are presented. lt is shown that under specific conditions the boiler tubes would not <b>carburize.</b> On the contrary, they might, however, be decarburized by hydrogen permeating through the tube wall.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} laser-beam, in order to <b>carburize</b> the surface of DIN 15 CrNi 6 low-alloy, case-hardening steel. The surface of the material was coated with graphite prior to laser irradiation. Two different kinds of coatings were used: (i) a dilute commercial graphite spray; and (ii) a slurry of graphite powder in ethanol. A CO, laser-beam was used as the heat source, in order to activate the introduction of carbon in the steel surface. Carburizing was achieved by two distinct mechanisms: (a) the surface alloying mechanism, which incorporates melting of the substrate and dissolution of the graphite in the liquid phase; and (b) the solid-state diffusion mechanism, which incorporates austenitization of the substrate and carbon diffusion in austenite. A variety of microstructures and microhardness profiles were produced, depending mainly on the type of graphite coating used, as well as on processing parameters. In general, the carburized layer was accompanied by a heat-affected zone, which was also significantly hardened, mainly due to secondary hardening. Cracking and porosity was observed in some specimens carburized by the surface alloying mechanism, as a result of carbon enrichment and high solidification rates. Finally, an effort was made to investigate the possibility for solid-state diffusion of carbon in austenite, under the short heating times imposed by laser treatment, with the use of computational kinetics simulation.

Before the experimental work the relationship between backscattered Rayleigh wave amplitude and carburized depth was investigated.

The amplitude of the backscattered Rayleigh wave was measured in four tests of different thicknesses of the carburized case. These measurements indicated that the amplitude of the wave decreases exponentially in accordance with the carburized case measured, as an expression which contracts with the theoretical investigation.

40|$|The {{structure}} and density of Mo species in Mo/H-ZSM 5 during catalytic CH 4 reactions was investigated using in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), temperature-programmed oxidation after reaction, and the isotopic exchange of D 2 with OH groups in H-ZSM 5 {{before and after}} CH 4 reactions. These methods reveal that CH 4 reactions cause exchanged Mo 2 O 52 + dimers, formed from physical mixtures of MoO 3 and H-ZSM 5, to reduce and <b>carburize</b> to form small (0. 6 - 1 nm) MoCx clusters with the concurrent regeneration of the bridging OH groups that were initially replaced by Mo oxo dimers during exchange. In this manner, catalytically inactive Mo oxo species activate in contact with CH 4 to form the two sites required for the conversion of CH 4 to aromatics: MoCx for C-H bond activation and initial C-C bond formation and acid sites for oligomerization and cyclization of C 2 + hydrocarbons to form stable aromatics. These MoCx clusters resist agglomeration during methane reactions at 950 K for> 10 h. The Brönsted acid sites formed during carburization and oligomerization of MoCx species ultimately become covered with hydrogen-deficient reaction intermediates (H/C 0. 2) or unreactive deposits. The highly dispersed nature of the MoCx clusters was confirmed by detailed simulations of the XAS radial structure function and by the low temperatures required for the complete oxidation of these MoCx species compared with bulk Mo 2 C. Initial CH 4 reactions with MoOx precursors are stoichiometric and lead first to the removal of oxygen as CO, CO 2, and H 2 O and {{to the introduction of}} carbidic carbons into the reduced structures.

It is generally concluded that the presence of rare earths is accelerating the kinetics of layer growth. The references on the {{influence of}} the rare earths additions in the <b>carburizing</b> solid media on the <b>carburizing</b> kinetics are rather sporadic, probably due to the low applicability for large series of components and poor interest related to this type of <b>carburizing.</b> The difficulties in preparation of homogenous powder mixtures requested for the thermochemical processing may also contribute to this observation.

The specific technical objective of the work was to demonstrate a <b>carburizing</b> steel composition capable of maintaining a prior austenite grain size no larger than ASTM grain size number 5 after exposure to simulated <b>carburizing</b> conditions of 1050 C for 8 hr. Such thermal exposure should be adequate for producing <b>carburized</b> case depths up to about 2 mm. Such <b>carburizing</b> steels are expected to be attractive for use across a wide range of industries, including the petroleum, chemical, forest products, automotive, mining and industrial equipment industries. They have potential for reducing energy usage during low pressure <b>carburizing</b> by more than 25 %, as well as reducing cycle times and process costs substantially. They also have potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing low pressure <b>carburizing</b> furnaces by more than 25 %. High temperature <b>carburizing</b> can be done in most modern low pressure <b>carburizing</b> systems with no additional capital investment. Accordingly, implementing this technology on <b>carburizing</b> furnaces will provide a return on investment significantly greater than 10 %. If disseminated throughout the domestic <b>carburizing</b> community, the technology has potential for saving on the order of 23 to 34 trillion BTU/year in industrial energy usage. Under the program, two compositions of microalloyed, coarsening-resistant low alloy <b>carburizing</b> steels were developed, produced and evaluated. After vacuum annealing at 1050 oC for 8 hrs and high pressure gas quenching, both steels exhibited a prior austenite ASTM grain size number of 5. 0 or finer. For comparison, a control alloy of similar composition but without the microalloy additions exhibited a duplex prior austenite grain size with grains ranging from ASTM grain size 3 down to ASTM grain size 1 after similar processing and thermal exposure. These results confirm the potential for using microalloy additions of Ti, B, Nb, Al, rare earths and/or N for austenite grain size control in Cr-Mo (i. e. 4000 -series) low alloy <b>carburizing</b> steels. They also demonstrate that these microalloy additions will not compromise the processability of the steel; all three materials produced under the program could be hot worked readily using normal steel processing protocols.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to study the effect of heat {{treatment}} of <b>carburizing</b> carbon steel by using three parameters (<b>carburizing</b> hour, <b>carburizing</b> temperature, and quenching medium). This study was conducted using a furnace. This process is carried out at temperatures from 850 °C to 950 °C (1123 – 1223 K) for three various duration time which are 8, 10 and 12 hours. From the experiment, the thickness of carbon layer varied according to the parameters that been used. For <b>carburizing</b> temperature at 950 °C, the thickness of carbon layer was between 40 μm to 80 μm for oil as quenching medium, 60 μm to 100 μm for water as quenching medium and 20 μm to 60 μm for air as quenching medium. This experiment also been conducted for different <b>carburizing</b> temperature but with one quenching medium which is oil. The thickness of carbon layer was between 20 μm to 60 μm for 850 °C, 30 μm to 70 μm for 900 °C and 40 μm to 80 μm for 950 °C. For <b>carburizing</b> temperature at 950 °C, surface hardness values of <b>carburized</b> specimens were between 185. 9 HV and 386. 2 HV for oil as quenching medium, 234. 7 HV and 398. 4 HV for water as quenching medium and 120. 7 HV and 241. 5 HV for air as quenching medium. For different <b>carburizing</b> temperature, surface hardness values of <b>carburized</b> specimens were between 149 HV and 323. 4 HV for 850 °C, 166. 4 HV and 345. 9 HV for 900 °C and 185. 9 HV and 368. 2 HV for 950 °C. Activation energy was determined by 47. 34 kJ/mol. The lower value of activation energy means less energy required for carbon atoms to diffuse into carbon steel, thus provide a more effective and efficient process...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the effects of energizer and <b>carburizing</b> temperature and time on the mechanical properties of hardened big knives in the pack <b>carburizing</b> process. The mechanical properties of <b>carburized</b> and hardened big knives were compared to those of commercial hardened big knives made from leaf-spring steel that were forged, ground and quenched following the traditional forging processes. The experiment was conducted by forging big knives made of low carbon steel (grade AISI 1010). The first group of them was then pack-carburized using 10 % by weight of calcium carbonate with 90 % by weight of eucalyptus charcoal. The second group used 10 % by weight of egg shell with 90 % by weight of eucalyptus charcoal. The <b>carburizing</b> temperatures were 900, 950 and 1, 000 °C, with <b>carburizing</b> times of 30, 60 and 90 minutes followed by air cooling. The austenitizing temperature was 780 °C with a holding time of 20 minutes, followed by quenching in water. Finally, the big knives were tempered at 180 °C for 1 hour. Micro-Vickers hardness testing, impact testing and microstructure inspection were carried out. The results of this experiment show that the hardness of hardened big knives increased with an increase in the <b>carburizing</b> temperature and time. In contrast, the impact value of <b>carburized</b> steel decreased with an increase in the <b>carburizing</b> temperature and time. The hardness derived from using CaCO 3 is slightly harder than that from using egg shell, however, the impact energy is higher when using egg shell, compared to using CaCO 3...|$|R
40|$|The <b>carburizing</b> time is {{expected}} to be short at high temperatures, wheregrains of the dual-phase steel are fine and hardly grow. If it can be used forthe elevated temperature case hardening steel,the processing time might becomeshort by reducing <b>carburizing</b> time and by skipping the first step quenching forgrain refinement of the un-carburized core. In the present study, the applicabilityof the dual-phase steel for the elevated temperature case hardening steelhas been investigated. The 2. 0 mass% Si- (0. 01 - 0. 08) mass% C- (0. 1 mass% V, 0. 05 mass% Nb and 0. 05 mass% Ti) steel were <b>carburized</b> at 1323 K for 10. 8 ks, quenched from varioustemperatures and then tempered at 423 K. The microstructural observation,hardness measurement and tensile test of the core were carried out. When themicrostructure was controlled to be dual-phase with a + r at the carburizingtemperature, the grains were fine and no grain growth was observed during thecarburizing process. Therefore, the first step quenching for grain refinementmight be skipped. The core showed the excellent strength-ductility combinationcompared with the conventional case hardening steel. The distribution of hardnessin the <b>carburized</b> layer showed a gentle gradient due to the elevated temperaturecarburizing. The <b>carburizing</b> time was reduced to be 1 / 3 compared withthe conventional <b>carburizing.</b> The grains in the <b>carburized</b> layer were also refinedby additions of V, Nb and Ti...|$|R
