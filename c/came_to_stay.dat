25|$|At {{the bottom}} of the scale were the {{ubiquitous}} discentes ("those learning") or medical apprentices. Roman doctors of any stature combed the population for persons in any social setting who had an interest in and ability for practicing medicine. On the one hand the doctor used their services unremittingly. On the other they were treated like members of the family; i.e., they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the doctor and when they left they were themselves doctors. The best doctors were the former apprentices of the Aesculapia, who, in effect, served residencies there.|$|E

Renoir often <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at Petit-Gennevilliers, and engaged in far-ranging discussions on art, politics, literature, and philosophy. Caillebotte was a model for Renoir's 1881 painting, Luncheon of the Boating Party.

There were approximately 53,500 public houses in 2009 in the United Kingdom. This number has been declining every year, so that {{nearly half of the}} smaller villages no longer have a local pub.|$|E

Margaret <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with him in Montreal and that is where his first two children, Harry, the future 3rd Viscount Gage, and Maria Theresa, were born.
