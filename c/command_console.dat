Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a <b>command</b> <b>console</b> at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{what was}} seen as a low budget for the pilot and series in general, the {{existing}} sets and equipment from the Star Trek movies were re-used in the new show. Milkis and Justman were given the task of reviewing the standing sets from the movies on the Paramount lot in order to see what they could use. The duo would later recall that one stage was so completely covered with cat feces due to the volume of cats living on the lot that the pair couldn't walk on the set. Certain sets were re-used, including a re-dress of the Enterprise bridge from [...] to act as the Enterprise battle bridge in the new series. The main engineering set from Star Trek III became the new main engineering set, albeit with a <b>command</b> <b>console</b> from Star Trek IV added as well as two walls from sickbay from Star Trek III. The rest of the sickbay set became the observation lounge during the first season. Some of the sets contained components from both Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the unfilmed [...]|$|E

The Tomahawk missiles are capable of hitting a target to within a few metres, {{to a range of}} 1000 mi. The Astute Combat Management System is {{a new version of the}} Submarine Command System used on other classes of British submarine. The system receives data from the boat's sensors and displays the results on <b>command</b> <b>consoles.</b> The submarines also have Atlas Hydrographic DESO 25 high-precision echosounders, two CM010 non-hull-penetrating optronic masts—in place of conventional periscopes—which carry thermal imaging and low-light TV and colour CCD TV sensors.

It is said to have 13,000 hydrophones, many times the number fitted in previous Royal Navy systems and more than any other submarine sonar in the world. A key development is the use of high performance and easily upgradeable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) processing systems, allowing the introduction of much more sophisticated algorithms compared to earlier sonars. The processing power of the system is said to be equivalent to 60,000 home PCs.|$|R

5000|$|Like {{most of the}} {{technologies}} Asimov describes in his fiction, Multivac's exact specifications vary among appearances. In all cases, it is a government-run computer that answers questions, and is usually buried deep underground for security purposes. However, Asimov never settles on a particular size for the computer (except for mentioning it is very large) or the supporting facilities around it. In the short story [...] "Franchise" [...] it is described as half a mile long (c. 800 meters) and three storeys high, {{at least as far}} as the general public knows, while [...] "All the Troubles of the World" [...] states it fills all of Washington D.C.. There are frequent mentions of corridors and people inside Multivac. Unlike the artificial intelligences portrayed in his Robot series, Multivac's interface is mechanized and impersonal, consisting of complex <b>command</b> <b>consoles</b> few humans can operate (with the exception of [...] "Key Item").|$|R

50|$|In 1975, {{the first}} general purpose home {{automation}} network technology, X10, was developed. It is a communication protocol for electronic devices. It primarily uses {{electric power transmission}} wiring for signalling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts of digital data, and remains the most widely available. By 1978, X10 products included a 16 channel <b>command</b> <b>console,</b> a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.|$|E
5000|$|Interfacing is {{the process}} of using [...] "layers" [...] to simplify the {{communications}} between technologies and between people and technologies. One example of layered interfacing is the buttons and menus used by home computer operating systems. These graphical objects exist as a link to the underlying [...] "buttons" [...] of the operating system. The <b>command</b> <b>console</b> is one level below these graphical objects as it gives you an even closer link to the underlying functions of the operating system.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} as a best practice that debugging code {{be removed from}} production versions of applications, as it can slow them down. However some games leave these commands and cheats available for the players {{to use as a}} way to enhance their play experience.

50|$|If one is {{referring}} to a container of documents, the term folder is more appropriate. The term directory refers to the way a structured list of document files and folders is stored on the computer.
