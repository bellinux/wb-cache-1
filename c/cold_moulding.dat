The {{prediction}} of flow pattern and volume fraction distribution in ceramic powder injection moulding (CIM) {{is very important}} because their characteristics affect the mechanical stiffness and the sintering shrinkage. The definition of feedstock behavior in the simulation of CIM depends on the various parameters such as temperature, strain rate and volume fraction. The {{aim of this study}} is to generate the governing equation based on non-newtonian flow model and predict the distribution of volume fraction from the result of CIM simulation using the subroutine of finite element package. Material parameters of governing equation are obtained from the compressive test of feedstock. Initial volume fraction is defined as the value of 0. 5 referred to experimental data. In the boundary condition, the velocity of injection is 3 mm/s and the frictional coefficient between the feedstock material and the die is assumed as the value of 0. 7 which means the value in the condition of <b>cold</b> <b>moulding.</b> The flow pattern of feedstock is very consistent with the experimental result. The result indicates that the range of volume fraction is from 0. 42 to 0. 58 depended on the pressure distribution.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel friction composite, the properties of its raw ingredients (including a CNSL-based resin and hemp fibre), the manufacturing process used to produce it, the tribological performance of the composite, and its incorporation into railway brake pads for passenger rolling stock. Currently, the production of most non-asbestos organic (NAO) friction materials depends on a long and energy intensive manufacturing process and an unsustainable supply of synthetic resins and fibres; it is both expensive and bad for the environment. In this research, a new, more energy efficient, manufacturing process was developed which makes use of a naturally derived resin and natural plant fibres. The new process is known as 'cold moulding' and is fundamentally different from the conventional method. It was used to develop a new brake pad for use in low temperature (< 400 °C) applications, such as rapid urban rail transit (RURT) trains. A commercially available resin based upon cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) was analysed and found to have properties suitable for <b>cold</b> <b>moulding.</b> In addition, hemp fibre was identified as a suitable composite reinforcement. This was processed to improve its morphology and blended with aramid to improve its thermal stability. Each stage of cold mould manufacture was thoroughly investigated and the critical process parameters were identified. The entire procedure was successfully scaled up to produce an industrially sized 250 kg batch of material and the resultant composites were found to have appropriate thermal and mechanical properties for use in a rail brake pad. The tribological performance of these composites was iteratively developed through a rigorous testing and evaluation procedure. This was performed on both sub- and full-scale dynamometers. By adding various abrasives, lubricants, and fillers to the formulation it was possible to produce a brake pad with similar friction characteristics to the current market material, but with a 60...|$|E

60|$|Most {{boys have}} {{observed}} an effect {{similar to this}} in casting lead. When you attempt to cast any thing of lead,--a cannon, for example, or anchor, or even a bullet,--you will observe that as the lead cools, the portion of it which comes {{at the top of}} the mould shrinks and falls in, forming a little pit or depression, which you have to fill up by pouring in a little more lead. The reason is, that lead, as well as most other melted substances, shrinks when it cools.

The effect of this would be to collapse the sides, were it not that the sides have already become solid by contact with the <b>cold</b> <b>mould.</b> But the lead at the top, having been poured in last, is still fluid; and so that settles down as the lead cools below, and forms the little pit or depression, which the boy presently fills up by pouring in a little more lead.|$|R

The analyses indicated that relatively small changes in melt temperature and injection pressure can substantially increase the flow conductance and dynamically control both the gate freezing and the onset of melt flow in the subsequent cycle. Therefore, simple gate thermal actuators were designed and numerically implemented to active control the plastic melt flow. This numerical approach can be used to design and optimize the active control of hot runners gate when the use of mechanical actuation (i. e. valve gates) is not suitable due to excessive cost, critical maintenance or miniaturization of the entire system...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{computer}} {{model of the}} evolution of columnar and equiaxed microstructure during alloy solidification has been developed. A control volume finite difference model of conduction heat transfer is applied to a two-dimensional domain bounded by a relatively <b>cold</b> <b>mould.</b> The initial condition is that of superheated liquid, and nucleation occurs either at the mould wall, leading to columnar dendritic growth, or within the bulk liquid, leading to the growth of equiaxed dendrites. The columnar front or the equiaxed grain boundaries are represented by computationally sharp interfaces, which separate liquid from partially solid alloy. Interpolation between discrete computational markers is employed to describe these interfaces, and a front-tracking technique is used to predict the evolution of the grain structure, via movement of the markers, across the fixed grid. The front velocity is determined via considerations of the kinetics of dendrite growth. The heat equation is fully coupled to the front-tracking algorithm by means of source terms which represent the evolution of latent heat due to the dendritic growth (advancing tips and thickening mushy zone). The model, applied to binary Al-Cu alloys, is computationally efficient. It predicts the variation of the extent of liquid undercooling ahead of the growing columnar front, and new metrics have been established to determine the likelihood of the formation of an equiaxed zone here. The employment of these metrics to establish the influence of heat extraction rate and alloy composition agrees with reports from the literature. The model does not distinguish between individual grains of the columnar zone, but it is shown that this is not an important limitation for most metal casting applications. Direct simulation of the nucleation and growth of multiple equiaxed crystals has been carried out, in which the nucleation and growth of individual grams can be observed via animation, and the influence of melt superheat and heat extraction rate on equiaxed solidification has been determined. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Functional surface {{effects on}} plastic {{components}} are {{a matter of}} current research activities. To make these surface effects usable on an industrial scale, new processes have to be developed. Forming processes such as injection moulding are currently used to produce functional surfaces, but machine and tool costs are considerably high. Therefore, it is of high importance to analyse {{to what extent the}} thermoforming process can be applied to manufacture micro-structures. The so called In-Mould-Graining (IMG) process is a promising variant of the thermoforming enabling the manufacture of micro-structures. The advantage of the IMG process is, that the structure is formed to the final shape of the part. If the structure on the film surface is set before the forming, the conversion may cause a deformation of the structure. However, the forming accuracy of the IMG process is limited by the rapid cooling of the film at the <b>cold</b> <b>mould</b> surface. A significant time interval between the heating and the forming leads to a cooling of the film, especially at its surface and thereby reduces the forming accuracy {{in the area of the}} grains. In this paper it is investigated to what extent the moulding accuracy of the IMG can be increased by the use of a variothermal mould heating. To achieve the required forming accuracy, only the surface layer of the micro-structured region of the cavity is heated by induction before the contact between film and cavity occurs. At the same time, the entire mould is cooled with a conventional water cooling system. The analysis of the process and formed parts shows, that especially the mould temperature during the forming process has a significant impact on the forming accuracy. A forming accuracy of a 50 µm high micro-structure of more than 95 % can be achieved. Furthermore, the contact of angle of a water droplet on a micro structured thermoformed surface can be increased up to + 145 °...|$|R

Porous, thermal responsive shape memory composites, PDLLA/nano-HAp, were prepared by a newly developed polymer coagulation, particulate leaching, and <b>cold</b> compression <b>moulding</b> technique. The inclusion of nano-HAp to PDLLA led to a higher shape memory transition temperature, improved mechanical strength and larger recovery force as compared with the neat PDLLA. The nanocomposite with 10 wt% of nano-HAp exhibited the best shape fixity and recoverability with the shortest recovery time. Further increase in the filler content of nano-HAp would reduce the recovery force and prolong the recovery time due to restriction in the movement of the amorphous PDLLA chain segments.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plastics fuel tanks have been used successfully abroad; metal counterparts are still predominant in this country plastics tanks have to satisfy stringent performance regulations : low temperature impact tests; permeability; and fire resistance. Blow moulded high density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks have superior strength to mass ratio compared with metal equivalents (the density of steel is about 8000 kg/m 3 compared with HDPE, which has a density of under 1000 kg/m 3). HDPE will tend to drip in a fire situation, thus reducing explosion risk. HDPE is the chosen material because it possesses inherent properties suitable for the blow moulding process : it has a high viscosity at low stresses; and is highly inert. Rotational moulded HDPE fuel tanks can also be considered. However, these are shown to have inferior properties when compared with blow moulded tanks; attraction of rotational moulding is the cheapness of equipment. Petrol immersion was found to enhance impact properties of HDPE, although yield stresses were lowered slightly. The thickness distributions of blow moulded fuel tanks were found to vary; {{this is because of}} the present difficulty of predicting parison behaviour with respect to time. Thickness is important because of impact strength and permeation considerations. Impact properties of fuel tanks were assessed; peak force of impact was found to be heavily dependent on thickness (raised to the power 1. 1) and temperature of mould in the blow moulding process (a low mould temperature led to inferior properties). Pinch-offs were found to be particularly detrimental to impact properties. Cooling behaviour was investigated. With the aid of a cooling model for blow mouldings, it was found that a warm mould (40 ·C) could be used with internal air circulation to obtain a cooling time the same as that with a <b>cold</b> <b>mould</b> and no air circulation.

Data and methods Data on housing conditions, respiratory health and relevant covariates were obtained from the second wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Multivariate regression methods were used to test the association between contemporary housing conditions and respiratory health while accounting for the potential effect of other factors; including social class, previous life-course housing conditions and childhood respiratory health. Results Older people who were in fuel poverty or who did not live in a home they owned had significantly worse respiratory health as measured by peak expiratory flow rates. After accounting for covariates, these factors had no effect on any other measures of respiratory health. Self-reported housing problems were not consistently associated with respiratory health.

An experimental apparatus using a cooling slope has been developed to mimic the UBE New RheoCasting (NRC) process. The microstructural characteristics of A 356 aluminium alloy processed by this route were characterised with this apparatus. The final microstructure is very sensitive to the superheat of the melt. Low pouring temperatures promote spheroidal morphology of the α-Al phase and longer holding times in the semisolid condition improve the spheroidicity of these particles. The microstructure is not completely homogeneous if the cooling slope product is cast in a <b>cold</b> chill <b>mould.</b> However, a great improvement in homogenisation and spheroidization of the α−Al phase is obtained if the mould is preheated and {{the duration of the}} holding time in the semisolid condition (at 580 oC) is increased.
