So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, {{so by the time}} I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats {{describing}} [...] "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, [...] "at last she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my thirtieth year.... and we had many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E
500|$|Despite Turtles failure, Washington called Bushnell “a Man {{of great}} Mechanical Powers, fertile of {{invention}} {{and a master}} in execution.” In retrospect, Washington observed {{in a letter to}} Thomas Jefferson, “ <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> 1776 recommended by Governor Trumbull (now dead) and other respectable characters…Although I wanted faith myself, I furnished him with money, and other aids to carry it into execution. He laboured for some time ineffectually, and though the advocates for his scheme continued sanguine he never did succeed. One accident or another was always intervening. I then thought, and still think, that it was an effort of genius; but that a combination of too many things were requisite…” ...|$|E

500|$|Beahan {{had been}} {{thinking}} of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a dream last fall, and I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E
500|$|Belgian {{director}} Jaco Van Dormael began {{seeking to}} film Mr. Nobody in 2001, an attempt that lasted {{six years before}} the director {{was able to make}} his English-language feature debut in 2007. Van Dormael's project differed from other Belgian productions in being filmed in English instead of in one of Belgium's main languages. The director explained, [...] "The story <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> English. It's a story set over very long distances and time frames. One of the strands of the plot is about a kid who must choose between living with his mother in Canada or his father in England. There are also some incredible English-speaking actors I wanted to work with." [...] Mr. Nobody is Van Dormael's first feature film since the Belgian film Le huitième jour (The Eighth Day) in 1996. Van Dormael began preparing production of Mr. Nobody in February 2007 with actress Sarah Polley the first to be cast in the film. Actor Jared Leto was later cast into the primary role of Nemo Nobody.|$|E

The budget was approved before casting was done, based on the prominence of the director's name and the strength of his script. The film utilizes nonlinear narrative and the many-worlds interpretation to tell the life story of the last mortal on Earth, Nemo Nobody, portrayed by Jared Leto.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her speech}} to the Academy, she took as her topic [...] "The Chinese Novel." [...] She explained, [...] "I am an American by birth and by ancestry", but [...] "my {{earliest}} knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> China." [...] After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially Romance of the Three Kingdoms, All Men Are Brothers, and Dream of the Red Chamber, she concluded that in China [...] "the novelist {{did not have the}} task of creating art but of speaking to the people." [...] Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward [...] "the beauty of letters or the grace of art." [...] In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: [...] "To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other." [...] And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, [...] "I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few." ...|$|E
