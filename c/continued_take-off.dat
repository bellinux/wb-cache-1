40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} our ongoing efforts towards the simulation of maneuvering flight at {{the boundaries of}} the flight envelope using high-fidelity multibody-based aero-servo-elastic vehicle models. We begin by formulating the maneuvering problem within the framework of optimal control theory. Next, because of the overwhelming computational costs implied by the solution of optimal control problems with detailed models of the vehicle, we describe a divide-and-conquer approach which approximates the solution by using alternating planning and tracking controllers. Both controllers are enabled by the predictive capabilities of a reduced model of the vehicle. A numerical example dealing with a helicopter performing a <b>continued</b> <b>take-off</b> after an engine failure demonstrates the current capabilities of the methodology...|$|E

50|$|In large {{airplanes}} e.g. commercial airliners, {{before the}} take-off is commenced, the highest speed {{from which a}} safe stop can be achieved on the remaining runway is calculated. This speed is called V1. If the pilot hasn´t initiated a stop when accelerating through V1 during the take-off run, the <b>take-off</b> must be <b>continued</b> even {{in the event of}} an engine failure. The take-off weight will have been limited to ensure it is safe to <b>continue</b> <b>take-off</b> with one engine inoperative after having accelerated to V1 with all engines operating.|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{changes are}} {{proposed}} for new engine certification for multi-engine helicopters {{to account for}} contingency operations when one engine goes out at take-off. The new rules are needed because current regulations define category A and B conditions as one-engine out, land immediately, or <b>continue</b> <b>take-off,</b> respectively. Category A is seldom feasible while Category B requires oversize engines, implying lowered fuel efficiencies. However, NASA {{studies have shown that}} engines with large contingency power can operate more efficiently in normal conditions due to decreased coolant flow. Techniques for realizing up to a 50 percent power augmentation with minor modifications of existing engines are described...|$|R
50|$|Though {{affecting}} millions, the blackouts {{were for}} the most part just an inconvenience, and not emergencies. On both occasions planes <b>continued</b> to <b>take-off</b> and land, and power was restored within a few minutes or hours.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a {{procedure}} {{for the global}} solution {{by the use of}} evolutionary algorithms of trajectory optimization and parameter estimation problems for rotorcraft vehicles. The proposed approach makes use of a novel repair heuristic based on a sequential quadratic programming method to handle problem constraints. The resulting formulation effectively deals with the complex, highly constrained, optimization and optimal control problems plagued by multiple local minima or maxima that are often encountered in practical rotorcraft flight mechanics applications. The performance of the proposed procedures is assessed with applications dealing with the design of optimal inputs for the estimation of model parameters, with the determination of the optimal way of flying <b>continued</b> <b>take-offs</b> under category A requirements, and with the determination of the most dangerous areas of the height-velocity (H-V) plane in terms of impact velocity with the ground...|$|R
50|$|As {{the plane}} {{accelerated}} on Runway 36, its starboard engine began to spool down. The pilots elected not to abort <b>take-off</b> and <b>continued</b> the <b>take-off</b> roll. Airborne, the plane veered {{to the right}} while flying at low altitude. The plane stalled, clipped trees, hit an electric power line and impacted the ground in an inverted attitude in a wheat field. It exploded and burst into flames. The plane lost contact with Multan International Airport control tower two minutes after takeoff. Everyone on board died instantly. It was reported that the post-impact fire was so intense that no-one on board could have survived.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primary cause}} of the {{accident}} was the flight crew's inappropriate response to the engine failure. The captain continued flight with the engine failure despite safely being able to abort takeoff, having not yet reached VR speed. The NTSB reported {{the causes of the}} accident as:"The loss of climb capability after the crew retracted the flaps at too low an altitude to clear the rising terrain. The flaps were retracted after the number 3 propeller feathered as the aircraft lifted off the runway. Contributing to the accident was the captain's decision to <b>continue</b> the <b>take-off</b> after an engine failed before reaching the rotation speed." ...|$|R
50|$|Following an {{investigation}} by the Nigerian Minister of Aviation, the cause of the crash was ruled to be pilot error. The findings of the investigation stated the engines failed following their intake of a large amount of dust. This occurred {{as a result of the}} pilot overshooting the runway and <b>continuing</b> the <b>take-off</b> through a grassy area at the end of the runway. Following the engine failure the plane rapidly descended into the neighbouring Gwammaja area of Kano ultimately destroying several structures on the ground. Its crash resulted in the deaths of all but six (five passengers and one crew member) of the plane's occupants in addition to 78 civilians on the ground.|$|R
