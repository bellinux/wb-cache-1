5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a <b>challenge</b> <b>test</b> of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin <b>Challenge</b> <b>Test</b> (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose {{is better than a}} standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bronchial <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} to {{evaluate}} bronchial responsiveness in diagnosis and follow-up of asthmatic patients. Challenge induced cough has increasingly been recognized as a valuable diagnostic tool. Various stimuli and protocols have been employed. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare cough and dyspnea intensity induced by different stimuli. Methods Twenty asthmatic patients underwent <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> with methacholine, bradykinin and exercise. Cough was counted during <b>challenge</b> <b>tests.</b> Dyspnea was assessed by modified Borg scale and visual analogue scale. Statistical comparisons were performed by linear mixed-effects model. Results For cough evaluation, bradykinin was the most potent trigger (p 0. 05). By visual analogue scale, bradykinin induced more dyspnea than other stimuli (p ≤ 0. 04). Conclusion Bradykinin seems to be the most suitable stimulus for bronchial <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> intended for measuring cough in association with bronchoconstriction. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundChallenge testing with wheat plus {{exercise}} and/or aspirin is a {{gold standard}} for the diagnosis of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA); however, the test may often yield false-negative results. Our previous study suggested that an increase in serum wheat gliadin levels is required to induce allergic symptoms in patients with WDEIA. Based on this knowledge, we sought to extract the patients with false negative results in the <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> of WDEIA. MethodsThirty-six patients with suspected WDEIA were enrolled. First, group categorizations—Group I, <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were positive; Group II, <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were negative and serum gliadin were undetectable; Group III, <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were negative and serum gliadin were detectable—were given according {{to the results of}} wheat plus exercise and/or aspirin <b>challenge</b> <b>testing</b> and serum gliadin levels. Second, diagnoses were made using retests and/or dietary management in Group II and III. ResultsPositive results for wheat plus exercise and/or aspirin <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> gave a diagnosis of definite WDEIA in 17 of 36 patients (Group I). Of the remaining 19 challenge negative patients, serum gliadin was undetectable in ten patients (Group II). Of the ten patients (Group II), three of them were diagnosed as definite WDEIA by retesting and six of them were diagnosed as probable WDEIA using a wheat elimination diet, whereas one patient was non-WDEIA. In the rest of the nine challenge negative patients, serum gliadin was detectable (Group III). No allergic episodes with a normal diet provided a diagnosis of non-WDEIA in seven of the nine patients, whereas the remaining two patients were probable WDEIA or had another food allergy because of repeated episodes. ConclusionsOur study revealed that serum gliadin monitoring during <b>challenge</b> <b>testing</b> is useful...|$|R

50|$|A {{bronchial}} <b>challenge</b> <b>test</b> is {{a medical}} test used {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of asthma. The patient breathes in nebulized methacholine or histamine. Thus the test may also be called a methacholine <b>challenge</b> <b>test</b> or histamine <b>challenge</b> <b>test</b> respectively. Both drugs provoke bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways. Whereas histamine causes nasal and bronchial mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction via the H1 receptor, methacholine utilizes the M3 receptor for bronchoconstriction. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by spirometry. People with pre-existing airway hyperreactivity, such as asthmatics, will react to lower doses of drug.|$|E

40|$|In this research, we {{question}} the straight-forward {{use of the}} classical sum of squared error criterion for identifying the typical parameters of a primary model (like growth rate mu(max) and lag time lambda) when applied to growth curves obtained in and on food products. Firstly, we base our reflections on 62 Listeria monocytogenes laboratory <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> collected in various environments (broth, crushed cold-smoked salmon, and surface of cold-smoked salmon slices). Whereas growth data in broth resulted in residual values consistent with a Gaussian distribution, growth data in the crushed product and even more {{on the surface of}} slices appeared different. Secondly, we propose the use of an alternative so-called robust non-linear regression method suitable when experimental error is non-normally distributed, which seems, according to this research, typical for microbial <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> in/on food products, and which lead to apparent outliers or leverage points in the experimental data. Properties of the robust regression procedure are illustrated on simulated data first, whereafter its use on the considered <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> is illustrated. To conclude, reflections on the assumptions and related realism underlying <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> and recommendations for fitting growth curves obtained in and on food products are presented.

40|$|Processed ready-to-eat (RTE) {{foods with}} a {{prolonged}} shelf-life under refrigeration {{are at risk}} products for listeriosis. This manuscript {{provides an overview of}} prevalence data (n = 1974) and <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> (n = 299) related to Listeria monocytogenes for three categories of RTE food i) mayonnaise-based deli-salads (1187 presence/absence <b>tests</b> and 182 <b>challenge</b> <b>tests),</b> ii) cooked meat products (639 presence/absence <b>tests</b> and 92 <b>challenge</b> <b>tests),</b> and iii) smoked fish (90 presence/absence <b>tests</b> and 25 <b>challenge</b> <b>tests),</b> based on data records obtained from various food business operators in Belgium in the frame of the validation and verification of their HACCP plans over the period 2005 – 2007. Overall, the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in these RTE foods {{in the present study was}} lower compared to former studies in Belgium. For mayonnaise-based deli-salads, in 80 out of 1187 samples (6. 7 %) the pathogen was detected in 25 g. L. monocytogenes positive samples were often associated with smoked fish deli-salads. Cooked meat products showed a 1. 1 % (n = 639) prevalence of the pathogen. For both food categories, numbers per gram never exceeded 100 CFU. L. monocytogenes was detected in 27. 8 % (25 / 90) smoked fish samples, while 4 / 25 positive samples failed to comply to the 100 CFU/g limit set out in EU Regulation 2073 / 2005. <b>Challenge</b> <b>testing</b> showed growth potential in 18 / 182 (9. 9 %) deli-salads and 61 / 92 (66 %) cooked meat products. Nevertheless, both for deli-salads and cooked meat products, appropriate product formulation and storage conditions based upon hurdle technology could guarantee no growth of L. monocytogenes throughout the shelf-life as specified by the food business operator. <b>Challenge</b> <b>testing</b> of smoked fish showed growth of L. monocytogenes in 12 / 25 samples stored for 3 – 4 weeks at 4 °C. Of 45 (non-inoculated) smoked fish samples (13 of which were initially positive in 25 g) which were subjected to shelf-life testing, numbers exceeded 100 CFU/g in only one sample after storage until the end of shelf-life. Predictive models, dedicated to and validated for a particular food category, taking into account the inhibitory effect of various factors in hurdle technology, provided predictions of growth potential of L. monocytogenes corresponding to observed growth in <b>challenge</b> <b>testing.</b> Based on the combined prevalence data and growth potential, mayonnaise-based deli-salads and cooked meat products can be classified as intermediate risk foods, smoked fish as a high risk food...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple-drug {{intolerance}} syndrome (MDIS) {{is characterized}} by adverse reactions to several classes of chemically unrelated drugs. OBJECTIVE: To analyze all patients {{with a history of}} adverse reactions to at least 3 drugs at the Allergy Unit of Policlinico Gemelli in a 6 -year period to better characterize patients with MDIS and to find safe alternative drugs. METHODS: We studied 480 patients (aged > 16 years) with a history of adverse reactions to at least 3 unrelated drugs and with negative allergy test results. Patients who had experienced mild adverse reactions that remitted spontaneously underwent <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> without any premedication (group A). Patients with a clinical history of moderate reactions received sodium cromolyn, 500 mg, before the challenge (group B). Patients with a clinical history of severe reactions or undergoing parenteral challenges were given an antihistamine 30 minutes before the challenge (group C). RESULTS: In group A, 491 tolerance <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were performed: 414 had negative results and 77 had positive results. In group B, 1, 077 tolerance <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were performed: 956 had negative results and 121 had positive results. In group C, 240 tolerance <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> were performed: 214 had negative results and 26 had positive results. Comparing the tolerance of alternative drugs in groups A and B, groups A and C, and groups B and C, no significant results were observed (P =. 24,. 14, and. 44, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDIS can tolerate alternative drugs. Premedication with sodium cromolyn or oral H 1 -antihistamines may be useful in preventing adverse reactions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} report hypersensitivity {{reactions to}} many drugs {{making it difficult}} to prescribe medications when they fall ill. Aim: To describe the clinical profile of multiple drug hypersensitivity and the results of <b>challenge</b> <b>testing</b> in a large teaching hospital. Methods: We performed a five-year retrospective review of the records of patients who complained of reactions to two or more unrelated drugs and avoided medication because of a fear of developing reactions. Oral <b>challenge</b> <b>testing</b> was carried out in hospital with drugs suspected by the patient to cause reactions and/or commonly prescribed medications. A positive reaction was diagnosed when symptoms and signs resembled previously experienced episodes and there was no such reaction with placebo. Results: Twenty three patients (aged 14 - 65 years; 19 females) underwent <b>challenge</b> <b>testing.</b> Their complaints had been present for 1 - 30 years, with 2 - 40 drug reaction episodes reported. Antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were most commonly implicated, and urticaria/angioedema were the most often reported manifestations. The patients underwent 3 - 27 challenges with 1 - 24 drugs. Three had positive challenge reactions with various NSAIDs, 13 developed symptoms and signs that were judged not to be true reactions, and 7 had no reactions. None of our patients qualified for a diagnosis of true multiple drug hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Patients who believe they are allergic to multiple, pharmacologically unrelated drugs are usually mistaken. <b>Challenge</b> <b>testing</b> is a reliable way of demonstrating this and providing patients with a list of safe drugs...|$|R
