5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin {{turned his attention to}} Tuscany, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> army increasingly began to manifest themselves.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> people worsened {{during the siege}} of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Beatty regained <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ships, after having boarded , the German ships had {{too great a}} lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase. Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the {{destruction}} of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz, and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign. He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl.|$|E
5|$|Regarded by {{many critics}} as Charles's best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music has been {{considered}} by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid {{the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence. The Committee also hoped {{to be able to}} prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labor and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.|$|E
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E

5000|$|Hayato Yaginuma was a Japanese {{baseball}} player that Goro first met in America {{when he was}} hitchhiking. Ginumachi and Goro, together, joined in a tryout {{in order to be}} Minor League players, later during the tryout, they battle against the Salmons and their task is to get back the Salmons' 10 runs. Although Goro and his friends (including Yaginuma) lost but they were accepted to be Minor League players but Goro was allowed to join theSalmons and met Sanchez, a pitcher with great <b>controls</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> ball; Bolton, a batter who hit Goro's pitch during a test; and Fox, a catcher (and/or batter) which Goro befriended. Ginumachi, later in the anime, went back to Japan but returned back in America to watch Goro's Memphis Bats team battling against Joe Gibson Junior's Oklahoma Falcons.|$|R
5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked {{enough troops}} to oppose Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised even more. In his message to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, but added a few conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E
5|$|At the castle, Charles {{has begun}} to regret Madeleine's {{transformation}} and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner stops her. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{with the}} first film, Coppola was given near-complete <b>control</b> <b>over</b> production. In <b>his</b> commentary, he said this {{resulted}} in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his great}} authority, Bardas's <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> nephew was not absolute: after {{he managed to}} persuade him to dismiss his old chamberlain (parakoimomenos), Damian, Michael {{appointed}} to the post not one of Bardas's own protégés, but his favourite companion, the ruthlessly ambitious Basil the Macedonian. Bardas's own position was further weakened in early 866, when Michael learned that Eudokia Ingerina was pregnant with the future Leo VI: hitherto Bardas stood to succeed to the throne if anything should happen to the emperor, but now Michael had a direct heir. Instead of divorcing his wife and marrying his long-time mistress, however, Michael married off Ingerina to Basil instead, who divorced his own wife first. In spring of the same year, Bardas began assembling a large-scale expedition against the Saracen stronghold of Crete. Accompanied by Michael, Basil and the court, Bardas made for Miletus, where the army was assembling. There, on 21 April 866, he was murdered by Basil, ostensibly for plotting against the emperor.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had no <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> Super-Adaptoid abilities; {{he would}} {{automatically}} absorb {{the powers of}} any superhuman he touched, {{even if he did}} not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, Queen Anne was {{succeeded by}} her second cousin, and Sophia's son, George I, Elector of Hanover, who {{consolidated}} his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government {{than many of}} his British predecessors, but retained <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union. Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir Robert Walpole, who is often considered the first British prime minister, although the title was not then in use. The next monarch, George II, witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, George III, Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the United States of America, but British influence {{elsewhere in the world}} continued to grow, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created by the Acts of Union 1800.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} taken away from Sturges by {{executive}} producer Buddy G. DeSylva, who never quite trusted him and resented the <b>control</b> Sturges had <b>over</b> <b>his</b> projects, and found the Morton story unsuitable for mainstream audiences.|$|R

5|$|In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the {{distribution}} company United Artists, {{which gave him}} complete <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> films. His first feature-length was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, The Great Dictator (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin {{was forced to leave}} the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
5|$|Ramza joins a {{mercenary}} group, led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia {{from being}} hunted by both sides. Delita joins Prince Goltana's forces {{to rise up}} through the ranks and gain <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own destiny. Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg, though this proves futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work in the shadows, working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions. Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.|$|E
