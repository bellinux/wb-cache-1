Some boards were prepared from the sapwood of poplar (P. nigra). They were dried based  on T 6 E 3 schedule and some specimens were cut according to EN 927 - 5 standard (20 × 70 × 150 mm).   They were coated and immersed with the nano particles and clear paints.   The clear paint- and nanoparticles-coated samples were dried in laboratory environment and in an oven at the temperatures of 1032 °c, respectively. After drying process, the water absorption of the samples was measured after 2, 24, 72, 168 h immersion. The contact angle of samples was measured after 1 and 10 seconds. The results revealed that the pattern of water absorption for the paints and nanoparticles is different. The samples coated with combined acid catalyzed lacquers and nitrocellulose lacquers and those coated with nanozycosil had the highest resistance to water absorption. The greatest contact angle was observed for the samples coated by nanozycosil...|$|E
