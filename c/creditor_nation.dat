25|$|The four {{pillars of}} Reagan's {{economic}} policy were {{to reduce the}} growth of government spending, reduce the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and tighten the money supply {{in order to reduce}} inflation. During Reagan's presidency, the national debt nearly tripled, and the U.S. went from being the world's largest <b>creditor</b> <b>nation</b> to the world's largest debtor nation in under eight years.|$|E

The debt relief will be implemented in three stages: two of 30% each and one of 20%.|$|R
25|$|According to a United States Department of the Treasury nonpartisan {{economic}} study, {{the major}} tax bills enacted under Reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1% of GDP. By {{the end of}} Reagan's second term, the national debt held by the public increased by almost 60%, and the total debt equalled $2.6 trillion. In fewer than eight years, the U.S. went from being the world's largest <b>creditor</b> <b>nation</b> to the world's largest debtor nation.|$|E
25|$|Money unions were {{operating}} which effectively allowed members to accept each other's currency as legal tender including the Latin Monetary Union (Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, France) and Scandinavian monetary union (Denmark, Norway and Sweden). In {{the absence of}} shared membership of a union, transactions were facilitated by widespread participation in the gold standard, by both independent nations and their colonies. Great Britain {{was at the time}} the world's pre-eminent financial, imperial, and industrial power, ruling more of the world and exporting more capital as a percentage of her national income than any other <b>creditor</b> <b>nation</b> has since.|$|E
25|$|The 1956 Suez Crisis {{suggested}} that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue {{its foreign policy}} objectives {{on an equal footing}} with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term <b>creditor</b> <b>nation</b> and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the latter}} part of the Ceauşescu period, Romania earned {{significant}} credits from several Arab countries, notably Iraq, for work related to the oil industry. In August 2005, Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1.7 billion debt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the U.S.-led [...] "Coalition of the Willing", making Romania the first country outside of the Paris Club of wealthy <b>creditor</b> <b>nations</b> to forgive Iraqi debts.|$|R
25|$|The {{interconnection}} in {{the global}} financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of <b>creditor</b> <b>nations</b> face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on.|$|R
50|$|Hosting the Youth Festival {{had long}} lasting {{consequences}} for the North Korean government and its worldwide standing. After funneling billions of dollars into the festival’s production, North Korea ended up owing five billion dollars in foreign debt and was considered bankrupt by <b>creditor</b> <b>nations.</b> This damaged the country’s economy and external status. The extravagant expenditures put North Korea into a hole it could not get out of, exacerbated by unfavorable economic conditions {{in the next decade}} with the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent famine.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the late}} 18th century, mercantilism was {{challenged}} by the ideas of Adam Smith and other economic thinkers favouring free trade. After victory in the Napoleonic wars Great Britain began promoting free trade, unilaterally reducing her trade tariffs. [...] Hoarding of gold was no longer encouraged, and in fact Britain exported more capital {{as a percentage of}} her national income than any other <b>creditor</b> <b>nation</b> has since. Great Britain's capital exports further helped to correct global imbalances as they tended to be counter cyclical, rising when Britain's economy went into recession, thus compensating other states for income lost from export of goods.|$|E

5000|$|The Tax Justice Network {{estimated}} that global tax revenue lost in 2012 to tax havens is between US$190 billion and $255 billion per year, assuming a 3% capital gains rate, a 30% {{capital gains tax}} rate, and $21 trillion to $32 trillion hidden in tax havens worldwide. The Zucman study uses different methodology, and estimates lost global tax revenue at US$190 billion. [...] If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt are shown to be net <b>creditor</b> <b>nations.</b>|$|R
25|$|A 2012 {{report from}} the Tax Justice Network {{estimated}} that between USD $21 trillion and $32 trillion is sheltered from taxes in tax havens worldwide. If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt would be net <b>creditor</b> <b>nations.</b> However, the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over {{the accuracy of the}} figures. Daniel J.

50|$|Fourth, {{foreign trade}} imbalances. During World War I, the US became a <b>creditor</b> <b>nation,</b> {{exporting}} {{more than it}} imported.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between a country's external financial assets and liabilities is its {{net international investment position}} (NIIP). A country's external debt includes both its government debt and private debt, and similarly its public and privately held (by its legal residents) external assets are also taken into account when calculating its NIIP. [...] Note that commodities, as well as currencies tend to follow cyclical patterns, whereby they undergo significant valuation changes, of which is reflected in NIIP. [...] A country's international investment position (IIP) is a financial statement setting out the value and composition of that country's external financial assets and liabilities. A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a <b>creditor</b> <b>nation,</b> while a negative value indicates it is a debtor nation. The USA, as recently as 1960 the world's largest creditor, has now become the world's largest debtor, and since the 1980s, Japan has replaced USA as the world's largest <b>creditor</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{existence}} of the great war debts is a menace to financial stability everywhere. There is no European country in which repudiation may not soon become an important political issue.
