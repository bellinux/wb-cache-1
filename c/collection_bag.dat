50|$|Other {{benefits}} of an eco-house, {{aside from the}} obvious one of having minimal heating costs, are a healthy living environment. The heat recovery system can eliminate dampness and the moulds that are so often a health hazard. The air intake filters prevent dust coming in with the incoming fresh air and the internal vacuum cleaner system extracts dust {{from the house and}} vents it (via the dust <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> and filter) to the outside, thus no microscopic particles of dust remain in the house.|$|E
50|$|The tube has two {{separated}} channels or lumens {{running down}} its length. One is open {{at both ends}} and drains urine into a <b>collection</b> <b>bag.</b> The other has a valve on the outside end and connects to a balloon at the tip. The balloon is inflated with sterile water when it lies inside the bladder to stop it from slipping out. Foley catheters are commonly made from silicone rubber or natural rubber.Foley catheters should be used only when indicated, as use {{increases the risk of}} catheter-associated urinary tract infection and other adverse effects.|$|E

50|$|Such {{devices are}} still {{sometimes}} fitted to modern military aircraft and small, private aircraft {{although they are}} difficult for women to use. Male glider pilots undertaking extended soaring flights may wear an external catheter that either drains into a <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> or is connected to tubing that dumps the urine to the outside. If the latter approach is used, {{care must be taken}} when designing the system so that the stream of urine does not make contact with other parts of the aircraft, where it may eventually cause corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century at Oxford University, {{physiology}} researcher Claude Gordon Douglas developed an inexpensive and mobile method of collecting exhaled breath (partly {{in preparation for}} experiments to be conducted on Pike's Peak, Colorado). In this method, the subject exhales into a nearly impermeable and large volume <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> over a recorded period of time. The entire volume is measured, the oxygen and carbon dioxide content are analyzed, and the differences from inspired [...] "ambient" [...] air are calculated to determine the rates of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output.|$|E
50|$|Trabectome is a {{surgical}} device {{that can be}} used for Ab interno trabeculotomy, a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery for the surgical management of adult, juvenile and infantile glaucoma. Unlike trabeculectomy, the surgery does not create an external filtering bleb. Instead, the Trabectome handpiece opens access to Schlemm's canal by ablating the trabecular meshwork of the eye, therefore reducing intraocular pressure which is major risk factor for glaucomatous vision loss. The irrigation/aspiration device provides irrigation during surgery and collection of residual fluid and ablated tissue in a <b>collection</b> <b>bag.</b> This procedure is performed through a small incision and can be done on an outpatient basis.|$|E

50|$|Adult {{mosquito}} populations may {{be monitored}} by landing rate counts, or by mechanical traps. For landing rate counts, an inspector visits a set number of sites every day, counting {{the number of}} adult female mosquitoes that land on a part of the body, such as an arm or both legs, within a given time interval. Mechanical traps use a fan to blow adult mosquitoes into a <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> that is taken back to the laboratory for analysis of catch. The mechanical traps use visual cues (light, black/white contrasts) or chemical attractants that are normally given off by mosquito hosts (e.g., carbon dioxide, ammonia, lactic acid, octenol) to attract adult female mosquitoes. These cues are often used in combination.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{water system}} fed to a {{centrifugal}} separator, filter, and <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> {{to allow the}} system to vacuum up the fluids. Waste water would be injected into a disposal bag which would in turn {{be put in the}} waste tank. The fabric material for the shower enclosure was fire-proof beta cloth. The fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter, the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. One of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible, increasing its utitlity. The hose for the spray head connected {{at the top of the}} shower. The shower could be collapsed down to the ground when not in use.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, photopheresis (aka extracorporeal photopheresis or ECP) {{is a form}} of apheresis and {{photodynamic}} therapy in which blood is treated with a photosensitizing agent and subsequently irradiated with specified wavelengths of light to achieve an effect. Specifically, buffy coat (WBC + platelets) is separated from whole blood, chemically treated with 8-methoxypsoralen (instilled into <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> or given per os in advance), exposed to ultraviolet light (UVA), and returned to the patient. [...] Activated 8-methoxypsoralen crosslinks DNA in exposed cells, ultimately resulting apoptosis of nucleated cells. The photochemically damaged T-cells returned to the patient appear to induce cytotoxic effects on T-cell formation. The mechanism of such “antitumor” action has not been elucidated.|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{long-term}} indwelling urinary catheters {{are at an}} increased risk for urinary tract infection due to bacteriuria. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are {{a significant source of}} morbidity and mortality in long-term care facilities as well as in ambulatory patients requiring long-term catheterization. There is increased interest in the financial impact of CAUTI as Medicare no longer provides reimbursement for nosocomial CAUTIs. Ascending bacteria may in part enter the closed drainage system when the patient switches between leg and night <b>collection</b> <b>bags.</b> In an attempt to reduce this ascent, a double valve lock-out system was devised that maintains a closed system during bag exchange. The concept is introduced and CAUTIs are reviewed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concentration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO2) in healthy alveoli is known. It is equal to its concentration in arterial blood since CO2 rapidly equilibrates across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The quantity of CO2 exhaled from the healthy alveoli will be diluted by {{the air in the}} conducting airways and by air from alveoli that are poorly perfused. This dilution factor can be calculated once the CO2 in the exhaled breath is determined (either by electronically monitoring the exhaled breath or by collecting the exhaled breath in a gas impermeant bag (a Douglas bag) and then measuring the mixed gas in the <b>collection</b> <b>bag).</b> Algebraically, this dilution factor will give us the physiological dead space as calculated by the Bohr equation: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of larger aircraft and advances in design {{have reduced the}} occurrence of air sickness. This has led to bags being given a secondary use as general purpose waterproof waste containers which is often reflected in the labelling of the bag and instructional diagrams. Another common use {{is that of a}} photographic mailing envelope (especially Australia). Airlines have also printed bags to serve as card game scoresheets and Continental Airlines once suggested that they be used as doggy bags for airline food. Non-airline aircrew have occasionally used these bags as improvised urinals or fecal collection devices aboard aircraft lacking on-board toilets. A specialized urine <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> known colloquially as the [...] "piddle pack" [...] developed as an improvement from this practice. In 2010, Spirit Airlines began selling advertising space on its air sickness bags.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Miripolsky was {{approached}} by a Japanese art patron, Osamu Horiba, who admired his work and invited him to exhibit his work in Japan. The resulting major shows were backed by Horiba {{at the cost of}} half a million dollars, according to the New York Times. Miripolsky thinks his work resonates so strongly with the Japanese because of its wildness and freedom. [...] "They want to grasp that, to grab it," [...] he said. Miripolsky departed from his usual pop art theme to design a blood <b>collection</b> <b>bag</b> for a Japanese blood products company, Terumo Medical corporation. He returned to album covers for Tatsuro Yamashita's Artisan (album), which debuted at #1 on the Oricon charts and spent 20 weeks on the charts. Miripolsky later went to design the set for the Japan Gold Disc Awards for four consecutive years.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} basic parts {{in a space}} toilet: the liquid waste vacuum tube, the vacuum chamber, the waste storage drawers, and the solid waste <b>collection</b> <b>bags.</b> The liquid waste vacuum tube is a 2 to 3 ft long rubber or plastic hose that is {{attached}} to the vacuum chamber and connected to a fan that provides suction. At the end of the tube there is a detachable urine receptacle, which come in different versions for male and female astronauts. The male urine receptacle is a plastic funnel two to three inches in width and about four inches deep. A male astronaut urinates directly into the funnel from a distance of two or three inches away. The female funnel is oval and is two inches by four inches wide at the rim. Near the funnel's rim are small holes or slits that allow air movement to prevent excessive suction. The vacuum chamber is a cylinder about 1 ft deep and six inches wide with clips on the rim where waste <b>collection</b> <b>bags</b> may be attached and a fan that provides suction. Urine is pumped into and stored in waste storage drawers. Solid waste is stored in a detachable bag made of a special fabric that lets gas (but not liquid or solid) escape, a feature that allows the fan {{at the back of the}} vacuum chamber to pull the waste into the bag. When the astronaut is finished, he or she then twists the bag and places it in a waste storage drawer. Samples of urine and solid waste are frozen and taken to Earth for testing.|$|R
