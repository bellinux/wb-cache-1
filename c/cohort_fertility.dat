5000|$|As for {{lifecycle}} TFR statistics, {{they are}} lagging. This is because life cycle TFR measures require {{women to be}} completely done having children {{before they can be}} [...] "counted" [...] as data. As women continue to delay the onset of their childbearing years, {{it is difficult to determine}} when women will conclude childbearing. Because of this difficulty in collecting data, adjusted measures of TFR are suggested to give more accurate measures of life cycle fertility. It is additionally suggested that greater value should be placed upon <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> measures, which instead estimate the average number of children that women have over their lifetime. <b>Cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> measures, therefore, account for all children born to a woman throughout her lifetime as opposed to total fertility rates, which only account for children born to women of [...] "child-bearing" [...] ages.|$|E

It can be calculated as the sum of the cohort's age-specific fertility rates that obtain as it ages through time. In contrast, the total period fertility rate uses current age-specific fertility rates to calculate the completed family size for a notional woman were she to experience these fertility rates through her life.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is a cohort analysis of postponement and recuperation of fertility in the Czech Republic after 1960. Two methods were {{used for this purpose}} - basic benchmark model and relational model. The essence of the basic benchmark model is comparison of <b>cohort</b> cumulative <b>fertility</b> deviations between chosen benchmark cohort of women and other cohorts. The relational model is based on the <b>cohort</b> cumulative <b>fertility</b> deviations of <b>cohorts</b> from the chosen cohort related to the schedule of national standard deviations. The significant shifts in the timing of childbearing were revealed. While the first order is characterized by early fertility decline and subsequent significant fertility recuperation, the second order is characterized by a further decrease in fertility with slight recuperation. However, fertility of third and higher order continues to decline and has been found out. practically no recuperation. The second part of this work describes the respondents' answers to questions about timing of parenting. The main findings are that decisions about parenting is most influenced by whether respondents have a suitable partner, private housing and are financially secure.

40|$|The 1970 s worries of the "population bomb" were {{replaced}} in the 1990 s with concerns of population aging driven by falling birth rates. Across the developed world, the nearly universally-used fertility indicator, the period total fertility rate, fell well below two children per woman. However, declines in period fertility {{have largely been}} an artifact of later – but not necessarily less – childbearing. We produce new estimates of {{the actual number of}} children women have over their lifetimes – <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> – for 37 developed countries. Our results suggest that family size has remained high in many "low fertility" countries. For example, <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> averages 1. 8 for the 1975 birth cohort in the 37 countries for which average period total fertility rate was only 1. 5 in 2000. Moreover, we find that the long-term decline in <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> has flattened or reversed in all world regions previously characterized by low fertility. These results are robust to statistical forecast uncertainty and the impact of the late 2000 s recession. An application of the new forecasts analyzing the determinants of <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> finds that the key dimensions of development that have been hypothesized to be important for fertility – general socioeconomic development, per capita income, and gender equality – are all positively correlated with fertility for the 1970 s cohorts.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent fertility {{trends in}} European and/or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] countries and surveys {{the effects of}} family-friendly policies on fertility.

Financial benefits, whether conditional on employment status or not, have an undeniable impact on the timing of births, but their impact on the <b>cohort</b> overall <b>fertility</b> is less certain. Conversely, policies that facilitate the work-family balance seem to have a strong influence on the decision to have children or not. However, they do not always help reduce differences in behaviour between social classes. The impact of family-friendly policies is probably underestimated because of the difficulty of assessing their coherence and long-term effects. Moreover, policies do not always have proven effect because their impact is often temporary in the absence of a complete set of support that accompany families all along the childhood. The effectiveness of policies also depends on their permanency and the stability of economic environment. Stable policies can mitigate the impact of economic recession on fertility as well. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fertility and}} family policies in 15 Central and East European (CEE) countries to establish firstly, likely directions of <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> trends {{for the coming}} decade; and secondly, to provide an overview and analysis of family policies in CEE countries, and to assess their impact on <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> trends. Demographic analysis suggests that the <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> decline of the 1960 s cohorts {{is likely to continue}} at least among the 1970 s birth cohorts; stagnation cannot be ruled out. Births that were postponed by women born in the 1970 s were not being replaced in sufficient numbers for <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> to increase in the foreseeable future, and shares of low parity women (childless and one child) were larger than shares of high parity women among the late 1960 s cohorts than in older cohorts. Also, childbearing postponement which started in the 1990 s is reflected in dramatic changes of childbearing age patterns. As period fertility rates have been increasing in the late 2000 s throughout the region an impression of a fertility recovery has been created, however the findings of this project indicate that no such widespread childbearing recovery is underway. For the first time ever an overview and analysis of CEE family policies is conceptualized in this paper. It demonstrates that fertility trends and family policies are a matter of serious concern throughout the region. The following family policy types have been identified: comprehensive family policy model; pro-natalist policies model; temporary male bread-winner model; and conventional family policies model. The majority of family policies in CEE countries suffer from a variety of shortcomings that impede them from generating enhanced family welfare and from providing conditions for <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> to increase. The likely further decline of <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility,</b> or its stagnation, may entail long-term demographic as well as other societal consequences, such as continuous declines in total population numbers, changes in age structures, as well as implications for health and social security costs.

Previously, only the ongoing birth statistics provided information on <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> as a total fertility rate of the synthetic female cohorts. Since both benchmarks bear different types of insecurity, a comparison is to provide important information on the quality of these indicators. This article shows that the average number of children per woman in the dataset of the Microcensus 2008 and the <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> rate in the birth statistics show a highly similar course of <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility.</b> Whilst the agreement for the female cohorts in the new Länder (former GDR without Berlin East) and in Germany as a whole is almost complete, the values in the old Länder (Western Germany without Berlin West) are further apart. A major cause of this evidently lies in the high proportion of female immigrants in the old Länder. Some of the women who immigrated into the former territory of Federal Republic already gave birth to their children before entering Germany. These births could not be taken into account in the ongoing birth statistics, whilst the Microcensus provided information on all children born, regardless of where they were born. These survey-related deviations can be largely reduced if the comparison with the <b>cohort</b> <b>fertility</b> rate of the birth statistics is based not on the average number of children of all women, but only on the number of children of women who were born in Germany or who immigrated below the age of 26.

First, we estimate the CTFR for the 1969 - 72 cohorts in all 402 German districts. The estimated CTFR differ strongly across German districts ranging between 1. 05 and 2. 01. Further, the estimated CTFR differ substantially from the known TFR values. This is mainly due to biases in the tempo component of the TFR, which are crucial in East German districts, university cities and in urban-rural comparisons. Therefore, the estimated CTFR allow for a better assessment of fertility differences across districts. Second, we analyse {{the differences in the}} newly estimated CTFR employing regression models. Composition effects such as a low proportion of highly educated women, a high share of Catholics or immigrants are significantly associated with higher CTFR in West German districts. However, regional opportunities are also important: A low population density, the availability of relatively spacious dwellings, a surplus of males, a small service sector and low unemployment rates are associated with higher fertility. Overall the analyses show regional factors are highly relevant for fertility. " (author's abstract). This article contains supplementary material {{in the form of an}} online appendix: [URL]...|$|R
