40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement of sands and gravels by action of fljw, theso-called <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> ofgraded sand gravels. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of graded sand gravels, especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of sand gravels proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels, and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels. In the second part, a theory for the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion for movement of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind sand gravels. It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two. Based on the above consideration,an empirical formula for the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels is proposedand compared with some other formulas proposed by authorities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> for gravels in a mud stream. Whether thestream is a mu& or clear flow, the {{mechanism}} of initial movement of gravels is similar. But,it is hard to analyze theoretically the mechanism in a mudstream because the fluid characteristicsare not clarified yet. In this paper the author presents an arrangement of the experimental results on the criticaltractive force in a mud stream using a Reynolds number derived from the kinetic similitude ofmovement of gravels. The Reynolds number is expressed {{as a function of}} the Reynolds numberof <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> proposed by Shields and the ratio of yield stresses of fluid to boundaryshear. It was concluded from the treatment that the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> for gravels in amud stream is expressed by the same relation as that in a clear stream, and that the relationshipis in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Wave {{propagation}} in one-dimensional erodible bed channels {{is discussed}} by using thequari-steady approximation for shallow-water equation. This analysis starts from theasumption that sand waves of propagating without the {{variation of the}} from may exist. As {{the result of this}} analysis, an equation which decides the wave height of sand wavesfor low flow regime is obtained. This expression well explains qualitatively the actual phenomena as follows. In thecase of initiation of ripples with low Froude number, the wave height is very sinally bythe effect of the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force.</b> In duine regime, that develops suitable scaleaccording to the flow condition. And in the case of transition, the wave height againdecreases by the effect of the critical Froude number. Numerical comparison of computed wave height and measured one shows goodagreement in dume regime. But in ripples, the former is larger than the later. Thiscause must be discussed by further studies...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} difficult to analyze hydraulically {{the mechanism of}} water erosion ofland surfaces because of the greatly complicated phenomena. With the developmentof erosion process, characters of sands on the land surface change and especially themedian diameters of sands become large. It {{is necessary for the}} considerations on theconservation of land surface to disclose the erosion process and the final stage of landsurfaces. In this paper, changes of size distribution of sands, especially the final size distri-bution, and resistance law of thin sheet flow on land surfaces, which are both signifi-cant problems in solving the phenomena of water erosion, are considered experimentally. The author proposes a rough treatment to estimate the final size distributions, basedon the study of <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>forces.</b> It is assumed in the treatment that all of finesand grains less than the critical size calculated by applying the relation of criticaltractive force to the rain water flow, will be transported downstream if sufficient yearsis taken in the erosion process. The treatment is applied to the both experimental andfield data, and it is cleared that the calculated size distributions for final stage agreewell with the observed data and, conclusively speaking, results obtained in the studyof <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> can approximately be used to such problems for practical use...|$|R

40|$|Soil erosion {{is caused}} by the {{interaction}} between rainfall and soil factors. Despite the considerable complexity of interaction between these factors, {{there is a need to}} reveal their mechanisms, and to quantitatively predict the rate of soil loss. In this study, the relationship between the rate of soil loss and factors upon which this loss depends was investigated using dimensional analysis. Erosion processes caused by the effects of raindrop impact were represented by a simple mathematical model which has been used in bed-load studies in the open channel. This model contains two parameters ξ_h, η_F, the first represents the effect on the detachability of soil by raindrops, the second represents the effect on soil transport by surface flow. Regarding to the simulated laboratory experimental data, it was found that the raindrop impact causes the transportation of soil by surface flow even if the flow is below the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and the value for ξ_h increased in the begining and then decreased with increasing depth of water flow. The value for η_F increased linearly with increasing the water depth...|$|E
40|$|In {{sediment}} transport of sand mixture, the characteristic quantities of sand motion are different for each grain size, and {{it follows that}} temporal and spatial changes of bed constitution must be caused thereby. Therefore, the characteristic quantities of sand motion for each grain size should be clarified in relation to bed constitution to describe {{sediment transport}} process and subsequent phenomena in alluvial beds composed of sand mixtures. At first, mechanical properties of rough bed composed of sand mixture are investigated in relation to grain size distribution, and particularly the statistical properties of relative height and angle of escape of exposed particles are inspected by a simulation method. Next, the so-called <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> for each grain size, {{which is one of}} the most fundamental quantities, is here theoretically investigated. On its estimation, the equivalent sand roughness of mixed sand bed is necessary and a new model using the concept of equivalent size of non-uniform particulate materials is proposed. Moreover, the other characteristic quantities of sediment motion for each grain size are inspected based on a film analyzing method. These research projects must give important informa-tion to describe various kinds of alluvial phenomena observed in natural rivers of which beds are composed of widely distributed sands and gravels. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the local scour from flows at {{downstream}} of an outlet and such constructions, frequently one build up an apron to protect the erosive bottom of river. Although for that reason of the complicated flow condition neighbouring there, it is usually to design and planning {{of the length of}} an apron in conformity with the experimental results used the model and the practical measurement about the similar construction. In previous report where the development of the boundary layer in the wall-jet flows has become a theme of research, the author suggested the velocity distribution law, in which the influence of the turbulence in jet-like main flows to the boundary layer has been taken into consideration, and explained excellently the boundary layer growth in wall jet due to several jets by the proposed resistant law. In this paper, concentrating on the standpoint of engineers, the author shall try to explaine the criterion that the sedimentary bed at downstream of an apron is not absolutely scoured by the action of flows, by means of the easy correction about the criterion for movement of sand grain in open channel flows with the velocity distribution of the boundary layer in wall jet, furthermore, in order to alleviate the labour on the trial and error calculation regard to the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and the boundary layer growth, presented the graphycal solution about these calculation...|$|E

40|$|The scour {{experiments}} {{on the bare}} root-free and root-permeated soils indicated that for each soil, <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> (CTF) linearly increases with both root density and vane shear strength. However, for both soilsq CTF was mainly related to vaneýshear strengthp indicating the potential importance of soil shear strength as an index of scour erodibility of cohesive channel bank materials. The analysis of the relative effects of the grass vegetation parameters on scour resistance confirmed the dominance of vegetation shoots relative to the roots in resisting scour in-non-bending vege- tation. The results showed {{that it is the}} initial introduction of vegetation into bare (root-free) bank conditions that produces the greatest increase in scour resistance and that subsequent increases in vegetation density bring about relatively lower increases in scour resistance. However, in all the vegetation densities studied, root- permeated so-ils contributed significantly to scour resistance in low flows especially through low vegetation densities. Compared to root- free soil conditions, sandy clay loam soils permeated with 1. 8 g/CM 3 of roots increased their scour resistance by more than 400 %. Althgouh these results may only be indicative of the low flow depths as would exist in shallow grassed channels commonly used for agricultural run- off drainage, they nevertheless highlight the importance of root density in contributing to the total flow resistance of grassed channel banks. The bank stability analysis indicated that for low channel banks (1. 5 m high), grass roots can stabilise banks with even vertical slopes against toe and slope vailures. For high (2. 25 m) and vertical bank conditions, the results indi- cate that the effects of increases in root density may need to be com- plemented by bank shaping in order to achieve stability. The scour and bank stability findings indicate that the three most important charac- teristics for the selection of grass vegetation for bank protection are quick establishmentg the development of a stiff shoot system and a strong root mat...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of stream channels in western Iowa {{has resulted in}} scour and erosion problems at most of the bridge crossings of these streams. As a result, frequent maintenance, extension of spans, and reinforcement of bridge piers have been required. The cost has been a burden to the counties and the state. The critical streams are those which have been straightened {{in the past for}} flood control and land reclamation purposes. Willow Creek, the study watershed, is typical of these straightened streams;Grade stabilization structures have been designed to control the degradation at great cost. However, the optimal engineering solution to the problem depends highly on an adequate understanding of the mechanics of erosion and sediment transport, and of the upstream progression of degradation;The ultimate, future equilibrium profile is the fundamental and determinng factor when designing grade stabilization structures for controlling degradation. A channel equilibrium profile model to estimate the final equilibrium profile of Willow Creek, a stream with a drainage area of 130 square miles (337 sq. km) is presented;The computer model components are based on the hydraulic and hydrological characteristics of the stream. The deepening and the widening of the stream cross section were included in the formulation of the model, and these results and the equilibrium profile constitute the computer output;The model was applied to Willow Creek, and the final equilibrium profile of the stream was estimated for three trial 2 ̆ 2 dominant discharge 2 ̆ 2 values and for one value of the <b>critical</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>force.</b> The 2 ̆ 2 dominant discharge 2 ̆ 2 for Willow Creek was determined to be the magnitude of the 5 -year frequency flood;The simplicity and flexibility of the methods used make them applicable to other streams in western Iowa.

Sufficient <b>tractive</b> coupling <b>force</b> allows organizing translational displacement of the machine under above-medium load modes during operation of overburden chain excavators, tower cranes and gantry cranes in outdoors environments. A mechanism is examined to convert rotary motion into rectilinear motion using {{the example of a}} gear and rail, with kinematic calculations quoted. Analysis of the “force couple” system is proposed to identify free traction forces. Factors are established that influence the machine’s working movements. Equations to calculate <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> in track-wheel locomotion are described. A laboratory complex is presented where students of mechanical engineering gain practical skills in mastering the production process of soil excavation and the influence of the coupling <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> during the machine’s operation. As practical recommendation, the paper describes a device made of a balancing lever, drive cogwheel and tractive chain to implement the required <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of the trolley in coupling; this solution’s efficiency is demonstrated for experimental works on hard soils with high coefficient of difficulty...|$|R

50|$|In railway engineering, {{the term}} {{tractive}} effort {{is often used}} synonymously with <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> to describe the pulling or pushing capability of a locomotive. In automotive engineering, the terms are distinctive: tractive effort is generally higher than <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> {{by the amount of}} rolling resistance present, and both terms are higher than the amount of drawbar pull by the total resistance present (including air resistance and grade). The published <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> value for any vehicle may be theoretical - that is, calculated from known or implied mechanical properties - or obtained via testing under controlled conditions. The discussion herein covers the term's usage in mechanical applications in which the final stage of the power transmission system is one or more wheels in frictional contact with a roadway or railroad track.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} study, disc harrowing operations in a loamy sand soil, on an experimental plot of twenty different soil moisture levels at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were conducted, using trace tractor techniques. The independent variables: drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, speed, width of harrow, depth of harrow, and dependent variable (<b>Tractive</b> <b>force)</b> were measured. Mathematical models using dimensional analysis, describing the tractor tyre-soil interaction were developed and validated. Regression analysis, {{was used to}} depict the relationships between independent variables and dependent variable. Analysis of variance using Randomized Complete Block Design in two way analysis was also used to study the effects and interactions of variables on <b>tractive</b> <b>forces.</b> Validation results of the developed <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> models conducted, revealed that harrowing operations recorded the highest coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 995 at 2. 5 m/s tillage speed, while R 2 = 0. 990 and 0. 9 were obtained at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s and 2, 22 m/s respectively. Analysis of variance between measured and predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> showed correlation coefficients, R 2 = 0. 9308, 0. 8999, 0. 9958 and standard errors of 0. 5844, 0. 8628 and 0. 78476 for harrowing at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s, and 2. 5 m/s respectively. The residuals analysis ranged from between – 138. 95 and 48. 7117, - 98. 6106 and 451. 474, - 33. 3709 and 32. 5384,and percentage (%) errors from - 0. 83458466 and 0. 27430385, - 0. 396874637 and 2. 546385 and - 0. 191731686 and 0. 189232 respectively. These indicate {{that there are no}} significant difference (P > 0. 05) between the measured and predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>forces,</b> which are clear evidences of the test of goodness of fits of the models Tillage speed of 2. 5 m/s illustrated the highest correlation coefficient of 0. 9958 in this tillage operation. The <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> models developed showed a good agreement between the measured and predicted results.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} a soil can transmit energy from a traction device on a tractor to the drawbar {{has been called}} the tractive efficiency of soil. Experiments were conducted for disc ridging operations in a loamy sand soil, at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s, using trace tractor techniques. <b>Tractive</b> <b>force</b> models at different tillage speeds were developed using dimensional analysis, describing the tractors tyre - soil interaction. The measured independent variables such as drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, speed, width of ridge and height of ridge were used in the developed models. Values of the measured dependent variable (<b>Tractive</b> <b>force)</b> were compared with computed values. High coefficients of determination R 2 = 0. 996, 0. 996 and 0. 986, percentage (%) errors of - 0. 122620038 and 0. 11606597,- 0. 126307491 and 0. 215127604,- 0. 603425382 and 0. 372951166 at minimum and maximum values, for disc ridging at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were obtained respectively. Analysis of variance between measured and predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> values indicated standard errors of 11. 15346, 10. 15346 and 8. 24219, while correlation coefficients of R 2 = 0. 996, 0. 768 and 0. 9674 were obtained for disc ridging at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s, and 2. 5 m/s respectively. These results are clear evidence of the test of goodness of fit of the models between the measured and predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> for disc ridging at the various tillage speeds.

30|$|The femoral condyles of a knee {{prosthesis}} articulate with {{a combination}} of rolling and sliding on the tibial polyethylene plateau. Little is known about potential polyethylene damage due to rolling motion. Since rolling does not exclude the presence of tangential surface loads, this study sought to investigate the influence of tractive rolling on the wear of polyethylene. A “wheel-on-flat” apparatus, consisting of a metal wheel and a polyethylene flat, mimicked contact conditions present in total knee replacement. An increasingly <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> under conditions of pure rolling was applied. It was found that under rolling kinematics a tangential surface load of up to 17 % of the normal load could be transferred through the contact. Surface damage was dependent on the amount of <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and appeared more severe with higher forces. In the region of highest <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> wear features were identified that resembled perpendicular ridges on surfaces of retrieved tibial polyethylene devices. This suggests that tractive rolling may be a relevant wear mode in total knee replacement.|$|R
