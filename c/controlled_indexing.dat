5000|$|One {{application}} of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors: the film does not run continuously through the projector. Instead, the film is advanced frame by frame, each frame standing still {{in front of the}} lens for 1/24 of a second (and being exposed twice in that time, resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz). This intermittent motion is achieved using a Geneva drive. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>indexing</b> mechanism or stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including Thomas Armat's projector, marketed by Edison as the Vitascope, had used a [...] "beater mechanism", invented by Georges Demenÿ in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.|$|E

Existing recognition methods suffer, in our opinion, from two shortcomings: either much expensive computation or poor identification effect; thus a new method is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. Firstly, we detect the binary silhouette of a walking person in each of the monocular image sequences. Then, we extract the pixel values at the same pixel position over one gait cycle to form a dynamic variation signal (DVS). Next, the variance features of all the DVS are computed respectively and a matrix is constructed to describe the dynamic gait signature of individual. Finally, the correlation coefficient measure based on the gait cycles and two different classification methods (NN and KNN) are used to recognize different subjects. Experimental results show that our method is not only computing efficient, but also very effective of correct recognition rates over 90 % on both UCSD and CMU databases Index Terms * INSPEC o <b>Controlled</b> <b>Indexing</b> computer vision, feature extraction, gait analysis, image classification, image resolution, image sequences, video databases o Non <b>Controlled</b> <b>Indexing</b> automatic gait recognition, computer vision, dynamic gait signature, dynamic variation signal, feature extraction, human gait recognition, image classification methods, image resolution, monocular image sequences, walking person binary silhouette ON THIS PAGE * Abstract * Index Terms Brought to you by STRATHCLYDE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY * Your institute subscribes to: * IEEE-Wiley eBooks Library, IEEE/IET Electronic Library (IEL) * What can I access?

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the status}} quo of carbon {{emissions}} in USA and the international crude oil price fluctuations, this paper introduces <b>control</b> <b>index</b> and critical time of carbon emissions {{to find a new}} dynamic evolutionary model of carbon emissions of the States, deducing relative theories, such as Change Trends Theorem and Evolutionary Theorem. The critical time in the economic period is determined based on the evolutionary situation of the international crude oil price peaks, and it can be divided into four time intervals. Least-square method is used to analyze the dynamic evolutionary system of carbon emissions in the four time intervals with data provided by the international energy agency (IEA). Based on the nonlinear dynamic evolutionary model, the paper predicts carbon emissions by means of <b>control</b> <b>index</b> and <b>control</b> function, which facilitates carbon policy regulation and the system's external influence, and creates unique dynamic evolutionary factors of carbon emissions corresponding with the real situation of the United States. The financial crisis and shale gas large-scale mining have significantly changed America's energy supply structure. With the economy running upward, carbon emissions have a tendency to increase again. To achieve the goal of its reduction, different policies should be adopted by the US government. In this essay, the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>index</b> and the effect of critical time of carbon emissions to control function are analyzed. In addition, the dynamic evolutionary model is introduced and evolutionary scenario analysis is also conducted by modulating evolutionary coefficient and critical time...|$|R

40|$|Information {{retrieval}} on the Web is {{very different}} from retrieval in traditional indexed databases. This difference arises from: the high degree of dynamism of the Web; its hyper-linked character; the absence of a <b>controlled</b> <b>indexing</b> vocabulary; the heterogeneity of document types and authoring styles; the easy access that different types of users may have to it. Thus, since Web retrieval is substantially different from information retrieval, new or revised evaluative measures are required to assess retrieval performance using Web search engines.
