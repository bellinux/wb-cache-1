40|$|Importance of problem: The {{ice cream}} {{industry}} continually faces {{the problem of}} improving its frozen desserts. At the present time <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> {{are being used to}} supplement milk serum solids to improve the body and texture of these products. One of the problems is to increase the total solids content of frozen desserts without increasing sweetness or developing sandiness in the finished product. There is a limit to the amount of milk serum solids that can be used because of the danger of sandiness and the cost. The use of <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> helps to overcome these limiting factors. The <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> product now used contains a dextrose equivalent of 42. The corn products manufacturers are beginning to make a product with different dextrose equivalents with different degrees of sweetness. Modifications of DE 42 contain dextrose equivalents of 24 and 31 and will add <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> of different dextrose equivalents or degrees of sweetness to these frozen desserts. Robert L. Lloyd defines dextrose equivalent as follows: The percentage of reducing sugars present on a dry basis indicates the degree to which conversion has been carried in the hydrolysis of starch. Dextrose has a DE of 100 and is used as the standard. The lower the dextrose equivalent of a product the less the sweetening power. Purpose of problem: 1. To determine the optimun amounts of <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> to use in building body and texture in frozen desserts without impairing flavor. 2.

40|$|Hydrocolloids {{function}} as water binders and texture modifying agents in meat products. They {{may also be}} have potential as cryoprotectants to ensure long term stability of proteins during frozen storage. The three primary objectives of this research were: first, to evaluate the effects of hydrocolloids such as starch and carrageenan on the quality characteristics of hams containing high levels of added water. Second, to investigate the cryoprotectant effects of hydrocolloids such as maltodextrins and <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> for freeze-thaw stability in mechanically deboned pork. Finally, to study the quality and sensory characteristics of pork sausage made from mechanically deboned pork containing these cryoprotectants;The {{first part of the}} study evaluated the functionality of starch and carrageenan in hams containing 55 % added water. Starch and carrageenan had opposite effects: increasing the level of starch increased perception of juiciness and purge was increased. Addition of carrageenan increased cooking yields, but decreased purge and resulted in a sensory perception of reduced juiciness;The second part of the study examined the changes in functional properties (protein solubility, gel-forming ability and emulsifying capacity) of mechanically deboned pork over 120 days frozen storage, as affected by addition of cryoprotectants (5 DE, 10 DE maltodextrins and 20 DE <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids).</b> Proteins were destabilized during frozen storage as reflected by decreases in protein solubility, gel strength and emulsifying capacity. Freeze-induced protein denaturation was reduced effectively by 10 DE maltodextrins and 20 DE <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> used at the 8 % level, and, less effectively when used at the 4 % level.

40|$|Encapsulation of lipids {{and other}} {{oxidizable}} compounds {{provides a means}} of protecting these compounds against their environment, including such factors as oxygen and humidity. The physical properties of wall matrices have {{a major influence on}} the oxidative stability of encapsulated lipids. This study investigated the effects of composition and processing conditions on physical and chemical stability of encapsulated milk fat powder (dairy creamer). Achieving a stable liquid emulsion is a necessary first step. Emulsifier type and concentration as well as processing conditions affected oil droplet size distribution. Larger oil droplet size led to an unstable emulsion and a consequential increase in surface fat of spray dried powder. At best, about 98 % of the milk fat was encapsulated (average oil droplet size ∼ 0. 5 μm, 2. 0 % lecithin, 36 DE <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids).</b> The physical properties of spray dried powders that were studied include internal and external morphology, water sorption isotherm, surface fat, true density, and melting and crystallization. Upon storage, physical changes led to a complex change in surface fat with storage humidity, crystallization of carbohydrates (at higher %RH), and caking. These were dependent on maltodextrin dextrose equivalent (DE) and storage humidity. ^ Oxidative stability of milk fat encapsulated in powder with DE- 36 <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>solids</b> was studied at 14 – 52 %RH and 25 °C (Collaborative work with two other investigators; Dr. Nitin Hardas and John L.

Under UV light, the encapsulated fat significantly increased in peroxide value (PV) and decreased in 18 : 2 and 18 : 3 fatty acids over time. The highest rate of oxidation was found at 52 % RH, indicating increased diffusivity of oxygen and other components under this condition. In contrast, surface fat oxidative rate was slower at 52 % than at 14 % and 44 % RH. Overall oxidative stability was dominated by the encapsulated fraction although in general the surface fat fraction was oxidized more rapidly. ...|$|E
