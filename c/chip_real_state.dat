Research advocates asymmetric multi-core processor system for better utilization of <b>chip</b> <b>real</b> <b>state.</b> However, asymmetric multi core architecture poses a new challenge to operating system scheduler, which traditionally assumes homogeneous hardware. So, scheduling threads to core {{has become a major}} issue to operating system kernel. In this paper, proposed scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore processors have been categorized. This paper explores some representative algorithms of these classes to get an overview of scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore system...|$|E

The hardware implemented Haar Wavelet Transform is used to transform the input data for significant compression while using very little power or <b>chip</b> <b>real</b> estate. The design also contains a dynamic body biasing scheme to improve {{the efficiency of the}} individual pmos and nmos transistors within the separate sections. Using the a very simple but effective transform is hoped to be more efficient than a normal software solution. It is also hoped that the body biasing technique will control correctly pwells so that it may be implemented in the future with autonomous control over larger circuit structures...|$|R

In a world where minimizing <b>chip</b> <b>real</b> estate while increasing functionality is the goal for further miniaturization of electronics, TWIs hold a key role as new packaging schemes become critical for overall higher density. Little is known, however, about the impacts of mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) inherent to the materials used in their construction. CTE differences, if left unresolved, can pose reliability issues during TWI operation. This research focuses on providing insight into the stress levels experienced by TWI materials through finite element analysis {{to gain a better}} understanding of the possible failure mechanisms associated with the CTE differences...|$|R

The support of these agriculturists is one of the priority concerns {{of the fact that the}} performance of family <b>real</b> <b>states</b> varies significantly. This article searches to contribute for the explanation of the reason of this variation in performance, through the Theory Based on Resources (RBV). In this sense, an explanatory study was carried out on 12 family farming <b>real</b> <b>states</b> which had their economical results followed in the last 06 years by EPAGRI â Company of Agriculture and Cattle Breeding Research.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{observation}} by a principal {{of the effectiveness of}} an expert‘s action could induce the expert to lie, damaging the principal. A career-minded expert receives a private-informative signal about the <b>real</b> <b>state</b> of the world, and then he takes an action that can match or not the <b>real</b> <b>state.</b> If a principal observes the consequences of this expert’s action, i. e., if the action matches or not the <b>real</b> <b>state,</b> this expert could disregard his valuable information damaging the principal: the expert plays the opposite action to that recommended by his signal and consequently decreases the probability of matching the <b>real</b> <b>state.</b> However, this expert could play the "recommended" action with positive probability if consequences are not observed. The previous literature has found that "transparency of consequence" can only improves the incentives of the expert to reveal his valuable information. The paradoxical behavior we have found can appear when the expert needs to signal with one action two different kinds of information, and there is a particular "trade-off" in the way of signaling; this "trade-off" can be affected in an unexpected way by the observation of the expert’s action consequences. In this paper, we present a simple model to capture this idea, and characterize the range of the parameters where that occurs. ...|$|R

But before Chip can enjoy being the King of England, they discover that they are virtually prisoners—and that the boys' uncle, King Richard III, wants them dead.

However, during recessions and times of economic slowdowns, media have a more powerful effect on consumer sentiment though its impact is still smaller than the <b>real</b> <b>state</b> of the economy...|$|R
