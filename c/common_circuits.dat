40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} effects of {{conducted}} and radiated EMI due to improperly designed circuits or printed circuit board (PCB) layouts. <b>Common</b> <b>circuits</b> used {{in a wide range}} of electronic devices are evaluated using both good and poor design techniques. Additional evaluations are performed to measure {{the effects of}} EMI on cabling used for digital communication or RF purposes. Finally, a consumer product is evaluated which must pass regulatory agency requirements in order to be sold in the consumer market. Potential solutions to common EMI problems are then implemented and discussed. This work will look at individual circuits and evaluate design flaws that contribute the largest amount of radiated emissions. Avoiding poor circuit designs and PCB layout mistakes reduces the amount of radiated emissions from any product. This work discusses the theory of electromagnetics and how it pertains to EMI events, then addresses the practical problems associated with EMI using <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> to illustrate EMI effects. It is important to understand why EMI related effects are becoming more critical, and to show why EMI problems should be corrected within the design phase. ...|$|E

In cooperation with the German Primate Center Göttingen the Institute of Electromechanical Design develops a wireless recording system which can be carried by animals. Since <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> and electrical parts for noise reduction used in stationary on-the-shelf systems are too space demanding for our device, we designed a simple input stage with an instrumental amplifier followed by cascade of programmable gain amplifiers. The widespread approach of dimensioning the amplifier's input resistance as high as possible has appreciable disadvantages in design of compact mobile recording systems, such as leakage currents and parasitic resistances. Furthermore thermal noise increases significantly for broadband recordings. We could show, that accepting lower input impedance leads to an almost optimal signal to noise ratio and reduces design troubles for mobile devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} perform linear AC analysis on mixed-signal systems which appear strongly nonlinear in the voltage domain but are linear in other variable domains. <b>Common</b> <b>circuits</b> like phase/delay-locked loops and duty-cycle correctors fall into this category, since {{they are designed to}} be linear with respect to phases, delays, and duty-cycles of the input and output clocks, respectively. The method uses variable domain translators to change the variables to which the AC perturbation is applied and from which the AC response is measured. By utilizing the efficient periodic AC (PAC) analysis available in commercial RF simulators, the circuit’s linear transfer function in the desired variable domain can be characterized without relying on extensive transient simulations. Furthermore, the variable domain translators enable the circuits to be macromodeled as weakly-nonlinear systems in the chosen domain and then converted to voltage-domain models, instead of being modeled as strongly-nonlinear systems directly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Quantum {{circuits}} are time-dependent diagrams {{describing the}} process of quantum computation. Usually, a quantum algorithm must be mapped into a quantum circuit. Optimal synthesis of quantum circuits is intractable, and heuristic methods must be employed. With the use of heuristics, the optimality of circuits is no longer guaranteed. In this paper, we consider a local optimization technique based on templates to simplify and reduce the depth of nonoptimal quantum circuits. We present and analyze templates in the general case and provide particular details for the circuits composed of NOT, CNOT, and controlled-sqrt-of-NOT gates. We apply templates to optimize various <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> implementing multiple control Toffoli gates and quantum Boolean arithmetic circuits.

40|$|The {{topic of}} deep {{learning}} systems has received significant attention {{during the past}} few years, particularly as a biologically-inspired approach to processing highdimensional signals. The latter often involve spatiotemporal information that may span large scales, rendering its representation in the general case highly challenging. Deep learning networks attempt to overcome this challenge by means of a hierarchical architecture that is comprised of <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> with similar (and often cortically influenced) functionality. The goal of such systems is to represent sensory observations in a manner that will later facilitate robust pattern classification, mimicking a key attribute of the mammal brain. This stands in contrast with the mainstream approach of pre-processing the data so as to reduce its dimensionality- a paradigm that often results in sub-optimal performance. This paper presents a Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network (DeSTIN) - a scalable deep learning architecture that relies on a combination of unsupervised learning and Bayesian inference. Dynamic pattern learning forms an inherent way of capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Simulation results demonstrate the core capabilities of the proposed framework, particularly in the context of high-dimensional signal classification...|$|E

40|$|Innate {{behaviours}} are flexible: {{they change}} rapidly {{in response to}} transient environmental conditions, and are modified slowly by changes in the genome. A classical flexible behaviour is the exploration-exploitation decision, which describes the time at which foraging animals choose to abandon a depleting food supply. Here we use quantitative genetic analysis to examine the decision to leave a food patch in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that patch-leaving is a multigenic trait regulated in part by naturally-occurring noncoding polymorphisms in tyra- 3, which encodes a G protein-coupled catecholamine receptor related to vertebrate adrenergic receptors. tyra- 3 acts in sensory neurons that detect food-related cues, suggesting that the internal catecholamines detected by tyra- 3 regulate responses to external conditions. These results indicate that genetic variation and environmental cues can converge on <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> to regulate behaviour, and suggest that catecholamines have an ancient role in regulating behavioural decisions. Despite abundant evidence for heritability of behavioural traits within and between species, only a few naturally varying traits {{have been associated with}} polymorphisms in specific genes 1.

Designed primarily for power-supply control, this device offers the flexibility to tailor the power-supply control circuitry to a specific application. The TL 494 PWM Controller contains two error amplifiers, an on-chip adjustable oscillator, a dead-time control (DTC) comparator, a pulse-steering control flip-flop, a 5 -V, 5 %-precision regulator, and output-control circuits. The error amplifiers exhibit a common-mode voltage range from- 0. 3 V to VCC- 2 V. The dead-time control comparator has a fixed offset that provides approximately 5 % dead time. The on-chip oscillator can be bypassed by terminating RT to the reference output and providing a sawtooth input to CT, or it can drive the <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> in synchronous multiple-rail power supplies. The uncommitted output transistors provide either common-emitter or emitter-follower output capability. This PWM Controller provides for push-pull or single-ended output operation, which can be selected through the output-control function. The architecture of this device prohibits the possibility of either output being pulsed twice during push-pull operation. The TL 494 C PWM Controller is characterized for operation from 0 C to 70 C.

40|$|Spin Torque Oscillator (STO) is a {{promising}} technology for microwave and radar applications {{due to its}} large tunability, miniature size, high operation frequency, high integration level, etc. However, the technology comes also with issues and challenges,such as low output power and spectrum impurity. For instance, in order to apply the STO technology into communication systems, an amplifier is required to compensate the STO’s low output power.     This thesis presents an amplifier for promising Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) STO devices. The motional resistance of different MTJ STO devices varies from several Ohms to hundreds Ohms, which makes the design challenging. This thesis focuses first on extracting the amplifier requirements using the state-of-the-art MTJ STO devices. The operation frequency of MTJ STO is {{in the range of}} 4 - 8 GHzwith a - 40 ～- 60 dBm output power. Therefore, a wideband amplifier with 45 - 65 dB gain is required. Then based on the amplifier requirements, an amplifier topology is proposed, which is composed of two types of input balun-LNA stages depending onthe motional resistance of the STO, a broadband limiting amplifier and an outputbuffer. CG-CS architecture is suitable for the input balun-LNA in the small motional resistance case and cascoded-CS architecture is suitable for the large motional resistance case. The limiting amplifier and the output buffer are the <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> shared by two cases via switches.     The wideband amplifier for STO is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS process with 1. 2 V supply and it exhibits 52. 36 dB gain with 1. 34 - 11. 8 GHz bandwidth insmall motional resistance case and 59. 29 dB gain with 1. 171 - 8. 178 GHz bandwidth in large motional resistance case.
