It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.|$|E
25|$|A broad {{distinction}} is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, {{rather than a}} <b>complete</b> <b>range</b> of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, {{although there is no}} consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.|$|E
25|$|May {{enjoyed a}} largely {{successful}} captaincy of both his county and country. Surrey had been County Champions {{for seven years}} running, with May the captain {{for the last two}} seasons, and until 1958 England was never defeated under his leadership. He had beaten South Africa 3–2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2–1 in 1956, the West Indies 3–0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4–0 in 1958. He was widely regarded as the best post-war batsman England produced, tall, strong and disciplined with a near-perfect technique, a straight bat and a <b>complete</b> <b>range</b> of strokes. His standards improved with the responsibilities of captaincy and his Test average as captain was 54.03. His highest score was at Edgbaston in 1957 when England trailed West Indies by 288 runs in the first innings; he made 285 not out, the highest score by an England captain until Graham Gooch's 333 in 1990, adding 411 with Colin Cowdrey (154) – still an England record for any wicket – and destroyed the mesmerising hold the spinner Sonny Ramadhin had over English batsmen. In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers. As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader. In 1958–59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative too readily to Richie Benaud and he concentrated on saving runs instead of trying to get batsmen out. Faced with Ian Meckiff's questionable bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1–0, India 5–0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1–0. He lost 2–1 to the 1961 Australians and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests (20 wins, 10 defeats and 11 draws), Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series. He retired entirely from first-class cricket in 1963, taking up a post in the City. with the insurance brokerage Willis Faber Dumas -now Willis Group.|$|E
40|$|With {{a plethora}} of {{available}} classification performance measures, choosing the right metric for the right task requires careful thought. To make this decision in an informed manner, one should study and compare general properties of candidate measures. However, analysing measures with respect to <b>complete</b> <b>ranges</b> of their domain values is a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we attempt to support such analyses with a specialized visualization technique, which operates in a barycentric coordinate system using a 3 D tetrahedron. Additionally, we adapt this technique to the context of imbalanced data and put forward a set of properties which {{should be taken into}} account when selecting a classification performance measure. As a result, we compare 22 popular measures and show important differences in their behaviour. Moreover, for parametric measures such as the F_β and IBA_α(G-mean), we analytically derive parameter thresholds that change measure properties. Finally, we provide an online visualization tool that can aid the analysis of <b>complete</b> domain <b>ranges</b> of performance measures...|$|R

500|$|American {{music critic}} and {{journalist}} Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Tchaikovsky's [...] "sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of melody," [...] {{a feature that}} has ensured his music's continued success with audiences. Tchaikovsky's <b>complete</b> <b>range</b> of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written {{in the style of}} Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs. According to The New Grove, Tchaikovsky's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways. The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made modulating to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music. The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form, such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, but were complete and independent in themselves. This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics [...] "were never natural symphonists.". All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest and satisfy listeners.|$|E
