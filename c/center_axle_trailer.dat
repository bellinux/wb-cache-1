40|$|AbstractTo {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of structure type on passing ability of car transport vehicle combination, the four basic vehicle combination models of two typical structure types, such as car transport semi-trailer road train and car transport vehicle combination with <b>center</b> <b>axle</b> <b>trailer,</b> have been built by using TruckSim. The turning circle test and the adaptability test on highway have been simulated on dry pavement to analyze {{the relationship between the}} structure type and the turning passing ability. The results show that the structure parameters have significant influence on the passing ability of car transport vehicle combination; three of the vehicle combination models can meet the requirements of GB 1589 - 2004 “Limits of dimensions, axle load and masses for road vehicles”; all the four basic vehicle combination models will take up the lane beside itself when running on the up to and including third-grade highway/ramp...|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, some {{semi-trailer}} trucks {{have eight}} tires on three axles on the tractor; these {{are known as}} six-wheelers or [...] "six leggers", with either the <b>center</b> or rear <b>axle</b> having single wheels which normally steer {{as well as the}} front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the <b>center</b> <b>axle).</b> Some <b>trailers</b> have two <b>axles</b> which have twin tires on each axle; other <b>trailers</b> have three <b>axles,</b> of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.|$|R

50|$|E.550 {{had five}} axles {{connected}} to the two electric motors through an articulated coupling rod. The three <b>center</b> <b>axles</b> were rigidly mounted to the frame and the <b>center</b> <b>axle's</b> wheels were without flanges. The outer axles were mounted {{in a manner that}} allowed them to turn into curves. The wheels were small, and thus adapted to heavy freight or slow passenger services at low speed. The locomotive had two cabs, one {{at each end of the}} central compartment. The motors were asynchronous three-phase, which could be connected in series at low speed and in parallel at higher speeds. The connections were enabled through a tambour connector using a liquid-cooled rheostat. Feeding was provided by paired trolley poles at each end, each pair carrying two bow collectors for the two wires of the three phase system.|$|R
