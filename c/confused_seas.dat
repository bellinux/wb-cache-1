However, the theoretical analysis carried out for <b>confused</b> <b>seas</b> is in general limited to linear model predictions, missing in this way many important features.

For example, the motion instability related to jump phenomena between different steady-state oscillations or the onset of subharmonic oscillations, are not considered. In this paper, the rolling motion has been described by a differential equation nonlinear both in damping and restoring. An approximate analytical solution valid in the regions of nonlinear resonance relevant to ship stability is obtained by means of a perturbation method. The transient nonlinear rolling oscillations due to a deterministic excitation are studied in detail. Such an approach is relevant insofar as the behavior of a system under stochastic excitation {{can be seen as a}} continuously changing initial conditions. The importance of initial conditions on the subsequent motion is illustrated through the construction of the domains of attraction. These are the regions of the initial conditions leading to a certain steady-state solution rather than another, when more than one are coexisting. In this way, the probability of the different oscillatory states can be roughly estimated. The employed procedure allows a better understanding of the time evolution of the oscillation and allows a time saving with respect to the application of the Monte Carlo method...|$|E

Ever since {{the launch of the}} European Remote Sensing (ERS‐ 1) satellite in 1991, the scientific and operational communities have a continuous record of scatterometer wind field observations through a variety of instruments/missions, namely ERS‐ 1 and ERS‐ 2 scatterometers, the NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) onboard ADEOS‐ 1, SeaWinds on QuikSCAT and ADEOS‐II, and the Advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp‐A. Moreover, scatterometer data continuity is guaranteed beyond 2020 by the scatterometer on Oceansat‐ 2 (currently in commissioning phase) and several other upcoming missions, showing the importance of these radar systems {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data assimilation, nowcasting, oceanography, and climate studies. Scatterometers are also successfully used to estimate soil moisture, sea ice extent, drift and type. They typically operate at Ku (~ 2 cm) or C (~ 5 cm) band, at vertical and/or horizontal polarization, at a range of incidence angles within [20 °, 65 °], and are able to observe the same ocean scene from several viewing (azimuth) angles. The radar antenna geometry, the measurement noise, as well as non‐linearities in the relationship between the backscatter measurements and the wind vector complicate the wind retrieval process. In addition, scatterometers are sensitive to geophysical phenomena other than wind, such as <b>confused</b> <b>sea</b> state, rain, land & ice contamination of the radar footprint. These phenomena can distort the wind signal, leading to poor quality retrieved winds. As such, elimination of poor quality data is a prerequisite for the successful use of scatterometer winds.

One of Tony's fondest childhood memories during the holidays is watching the movie [...] "It's A Wonderful Life", and he later tells Ziva that his mother had taken him to the movies frequently before her death, resulting in his love of film.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{observations}} {{are essential for}} determining the atmospheric flow. In particular, sea-surface wind {{observations are}} very useful for many meteorological and oceanographic applications. In this respect, most of the satellite remote-sensing radar systems can provide sea-surface wind information. This thesis reviews the current wind retrieval procedures for such systems, identifies the most significant unresolved problems, and proposes new methods to overcome such problems. In order to invert the geophysical model function (GMF), which relates the radar backscatter measurement with the wind speed and direction (unknowns), two independent measurements over the same scene (wind cell) are at least needed. The degree of independence of such measurements is given by the azimuth (view) angle separation among them. This thesis is focused on improving the wind retrieval for determined systems (two or more measurements) with poor azimuth diversity and for underdetermined systems (one single measurement). For such purpose, observations from two different radar systems, i. e., SeaWinds and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), are used. The wind retrieval methods proposed in this book for determined (Multiple Solution Scheme, denoted MSS) and underdetermined (SAR Wind Retrieval Algorithm, denoted SWRA) systems are based on Bayesian methodology, that is, on maximizing the probability of obtaining the "true" wind given the radar measurements and the a priori wind information (often provided by numerical weather prediction models), assuming that all wind information sources contain errors. In contrast with the standard procedure for determined systems, the MSS fully uses the information obtained from inversion, {{which turns out to}} positively impact the wind retrieval when poor azimuth diversity. On the other hand, in contrast with the various algorithms used nowadays to resolve the wind vector for underdetermined systems, the SWRA assumes not only that the system can not be solved without additional information (underdetermination assumption) but also that both the algorithms and the additional information (which are combined to retrieved the wind vector) contain errors and these should be well characterized. The MSS and the SWRA give promising results, improving the wind retrieval quality as compared to the methods used up to now. Finally, a generic quality control is proposed for determined systems. In general, high-quality retrieved wind fields can be obtained from scatterometer (determined systems) measurements. However, geophysical conditions other than wind (e. g., rain, <b>confused</b> <b>sea</b> state or sea ice) can distort the radar signal and, in turn, substantially decrease the wind retrieval quality. The quality control method uses the inversion residual (which is sensitive to inconsistencies between observations and the geophysical model function that are mainly produced when conditions other than wind dominate the radar backscatter signal) to detect and reject the poor-quality retrievals. The method gives good results, minimizing the rejection of good-quality data and maximizing the rejection of poor-quality data, including rain contamination...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sea turtle}} is another {{endangered}} visitor to Perdido Key. Loggerhead, leatherback, ridley, and green sea turtles arrive between May and September to dig nest cavities {{in the sand}} into which 100 or more eggs are laid. About two months later, provided the nest has not been washed away, uncovered by high winds, or disturbed by predators or beach visitors, turtle hatchlings emerge. Following the brightest spot in the sky, which is usually the horizon over the water, hatchlings scramble for the sea. With development on barrier islands, lights of convenience stores, hotels and businesses (see Light pollution [...] ) have made the trek to the <b>sea</b> <b>confusing</b> and dangerous. Few hatchlings are successful in their first adventure. Less than 1% of hatchlings survive their first year and grow old enough to return to Perdido Key to resume the cycle.|$|R
50|$|Eisenia arborea, or the {{southern}} sea palm (not to be <b>confused</b> with the <b>sea</b> palm), is a dominant species of kelp that {{is found in}} the Northern and Eastern Pacific from Vancouver Island, Canada south to Isla Magdalena, Mexico, and along the coast of Baja California. They are commonly found from the midtidal areas stretching to the subtidal areas. It is an edible seaweed, a source of nutrients for grazing marine invertebrates and a source of alginic acid, a food thickener. Some of the algas have a hollow stripe above its holdfast with two branches terminating in multiple blades. Eisenia arborea is studied in order to predict environmental stress in oceans intertidal zones. Hollow stripes where present when the Eisenia arborea did not receive essential nutrients for its thalli development. Eisenia arborea with hollow stripes are believed to be evolved algae in order to increase their survival in harsh living conditions. They play a huge role in determining environmental stress.|$|R
