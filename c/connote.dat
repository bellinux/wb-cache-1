5|$|Other divine {{groups were}} {{composed}} of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented {{a region of}} the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the {{hours of the day}} and night and for each nome (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four <b>connote</b> completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon.|$|E
5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to <b>connote...</b> the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E

25|$|Some grammarians, however, {{say that}} it is only the past that can be <b>connoted</b> in this construction; the option of <b>connoting</b> the present and future is no longer available. And others say that no tense at all can be <b>connoted.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moksha - signifies emancipation, liberation or release. In {{some schools}} of Hinduism, moksha <b>connotes</b> freedom from saṃsāra, {{the cycle of}} death and rebirth, in other schools moksha <b>connotes</b> freedom, self-knowledge, self-realization and liberation in this life.|$|R
5000|$|An epiphenomenon (plural: epiphenomena) is a {{secondary}} phenomenon that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two senses, one that <b>connotes</b> known causation {{and one that}} <b>connotes</b> absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.|$|R
25|$|Art can <b>connote</b> a {{sense of}} trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also simply refer to the {{developed}} and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art {{can be defined as}} an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.|$|E
25|$|The work of Raymond Williams {{and other}} members of the Birmingham Center for British Cultural Studies would further extend the notion of {{mediation}} in cultural materialism. For Williams, this notion should <b>connote</b> a social actor’s position in relation to co-determining aspects of a social formation, or a multitude of pressures and limits that are always changing and being changed by the social actor.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{succession}} in {{its traditional}} sense implies two important features that resist direct examination (Solomon et al. 1981). First, classical definitions generally <b>connote</b> directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet {{the time frame}} needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981). The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.|$|E
25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{iconography}} {{which seeks to}} identify meaning, semiotics is concerned with how meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s <b>connoted</b> and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the <b>connoted</b> meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is {{to come up with}} ways to navigate and interpret <b>connoted</b> meaning.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} humanities scholars' {{conceptions of}} research and subjective notions of quality in the three disciplines German literature studies, English literature studies, and art history, captured using 21 Repertory Grid interviews. We identified three dimensions that structure the scholars' conceptions of research: quality, time, and success. Further, the results revealed four types {{of research in the}} humanities: positively <b>connoted</b> ‘traditional' research (characterized as individual, discipline-oriented, and ground-breaking research), positively <b>connoted</b> ‘modern' research (cooperative, interdisciplinary, and socially relevant), negatively <b>connoted</b> ‘traditional' research (isolated, reproductive, and conservative), and negatively <b>connoted</b> ‘modern' research (career oriented, epigonal, calculated). In addition, 15 quality criteria for research in the three disciplines German literature studies, English literature studies, and art history were derived from the Repertory Grid interview...|$|R

25|$|Certain {{applications}} of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although strictly speaking {{would seem to}} refer to a broad application, in practice have come instead to <b>connote</b> a specific or a limited number of instrument configurations. An example of this is isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the instrument used for the application.|$|E
25|$|By common usage, {{the term}} {{chemotherapy}} {{has come to}} <b>connote</b> the use of rather non-specific intracellular poisons, especially related to inhibiting the process of cell division known as mitosis, and generally excludes agents that more selectively block extracellular growth signals (i.e. blockers of signal transduction). To avoid these connotations, recently developed therapies (against specific molecular or genetic targets) which inhibit growth-promoting signals coming from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer) are called hormonal therapies, while the inhibition of other growth-promoting influences (especially those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases) is known as targeted therapy.|$|E
25|$|The Sanskrit {{version of}} the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are {{creative}} with double meanings. The names <b>connote</b> the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented {{as a metaphor for}} charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while crocodiles are presented as a symbolism for those with dangerous intent hiding beneath welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.|$|E

500|$|According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context syadvada {{does not}} mean a {{doctrine}} of doubt or skepticism, rather it means [...] "multiplicity or multiple possibilities". Syat in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not <b>connote</b> an answer that is [...] "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a [...] "many sidedness" [...] to any proposition with a seven fold predication.|$|E

Ashby and Schofield agree with Mulvany that musically, Viking metal bands generally are unconnected with a real Viking past, but instead <b>connote</b> a broader sense of the maritime, presuming that [...] "this conflation of maritime contexts is a knowing one, but one nonetheless felt to be somehow evocative." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of Angelou's poems {{focus on}} racial {{subjects}} and themes. They continue {{the themes of}} mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. In [...] "Ain't That Bad?", she uses the Black English vernacular word [...] "bad" [...] to <b>connote</b> positive connections with Black culture, mores, customs, and leaders, and to help build Black pride. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen calls it a [...] "shouting poem" [...] due to its short lines and repetition. [...] In [...] "Lady Luncheon Club", Angelou humorously describes an overly intellectual speaker at a woman's club.|$|E
500|$|George Rousseau, similarly, {{cites the}} {{pamphlet}} {{as part of}} a body of 1740s [...] "sodomy" [...] literature so wide-ranging as to suggest that the term's meaning might have been mutable, broad, and vague. He argues specifically that, in the 1740s, the term had a strong connotation of an imported vice; it was often used in the 1740s to <b>connote</b> suspicion against foreigners. The pamphlet's text, on page 50, includes the strident claim [...] "Damn'd Fashion! Imported from Italy amid'st a Train of other unnatural Vices. Have we not Sins enough of our own, but we must eke 'em out with those of Foreign Nations, to fill up the Cup of our Abominations, and make us yet more ripe for Divine Vengeance?" [...] The plausibility of the theory that [...] "sodomy", however understood, was particularly prevalent in Italy is difficult to assess, though Trevor Dean notes that, earlier, seventeenth-century Italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|Pickett's {{official}} {{report to}} Taylor was signed [...] "G.E. Pickett, Major-Gen., Commd'g." [...] This is the April 11 report mentioned by Freeman above. Thus in Pickett's official report to Taylor {{he speaks of}} commanding his men and interacting with his superior officer {{right up until the}} surrender at Appomattox. Taylor attempted to explain the apparent contradiction by telling Fitzhugh Lee that he addressed his request in the manner he did because Pickett was not dismissed from the Army, and for the period in question, Pickett was initially in command. This explanation, however, leaves unanswered the question of how Taylor expected Pickett to answer for the period of time Pickett purportedly was not in command. The explanation does not explain Pickett's report which covered the entire period, nor the fact that Pickett signed the report as the acting commander, nor did it explain Longstreet's interactions with Pickett over this period of time. Furthermore, there is no record of Taylor requesting reports from any other officers dismissed from the service on the movements of their former troops, nor of his referring to such officers in a manner which would <b>connote</b> active command.|$|E

500|$|The {{extent to}} which New Age spokespeople mix {{religion}} and politics varies. New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as [...] "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete". The New Ager Mark Satin for instance spoke of [...] "New Age politics" [...] as a politically radical [...] "third force" [...] that was [...] "neither left nor right". He believed that {{in contrast to the}} conventional political focus on the [...] "institutional and economic symptoms" [...] of society's problems, his [...] "New Age politics" [...] would focus on [...] "psychocultural roots" [...] of these issues. Ferguson regarded New Age politics as [...] "a kind of Radical Centre", one which was [...] "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road". Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the [...] "Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm". [...] In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological [...] "systems view" [...] of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues. Corinne McLaughlin argued that politics need not <b>connote</b> endless power struggles, that a new [...] "spiritual politics" [...] could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.|$|E
