50|$|Binary {{economics}} is not mainstream {{and does not}} fit easy into the left-right spectrum. It has variously been characterized as an extreme right-wing ideology and as extremely left-wing by its critics. The '' (in 'binary economics') means 'composed of two'’ because it suffices to view the physical factors of production as being but two (labour and capital (which includes land). It recognises only two ways of genuinely earning a living − by labour and by productive <b>capital</b> <b>ownership.</b> In its theory humans own their labour, but also productive capital.|$|E

Milton Friedman said of The Capitalist Manifesto [...] "the book's economics was bad...the interpretation of history, ludicrous; {{and the policy}} recommended, dangerous" [...] and recalls a debate where even the moderator Clark Kerr [...] "lost his cool as a moderator and attacked arguments vigorously". Paul Samuelson, another Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winner, told the U.S. Congress that Kelso's theories were a [...] "cranky fad" [...] not accepted by mainstream economists, but Kelso's ideas on promoting wider <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> nevertheless significantly influenced the passing of legislation promoting employee ownership.|$|E

Radia increased the paid-up capital from just ₹1 lakh (₹1,00,000) to ₹30 crore (₹30 million); clarified that she and her sister, Karuna Menon, were the promoters; obtained approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and the Home ministry to raise equity abroad; and started negotiations with International Lease Finance Corporation to obtain aircraft. However, her application was declined again for lack of transparency in funding.|$|E
5000|$|Kelso {{elaborated}} on {{his proposals}} in The New Capitalists in 1961. He worked with political scientist Patricia Hetter Kelso to further explain how capital instruments provide an increasing {{percentage of the}} wealth and why capital is narrowly owned in the modern industrial economy. Their analysis predicted that widely distributed <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> will create a more balanced economy. Kelso and Hetter proposed new [...] "binary" [...] share holdings which would pay out full net earnings as dividends (with exceptions for research, maintenance and depreciation).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between <b>capital</b> structure, <b>ownership</b> structure, and corporate value for a sample of 1, 216 firms from 15 European countries. Our results stress two different conflicts of interest and show the differential {{role played by the}} mechanisms of corporate control depending on the legal and institutional environment. In common law countries, {{as a consequence of the}} relationships between managers and shareholders, capital structure and managerial ownership are the most effective mechanisms of control. In civil law countries, however, as a consequence of the conflicts between majority and minority shareholders, the ownership concentration and the sharing of control within the firm become crucial. In this scenario, the second reference shareholder plays a critical role in contesting the control of the dominant largest shareholder in order to reduce the extraction of private benefits and improve the firm?s performanceLaw and finance approach, <b>capital</b> structure, <b>ownership</b> structure, corporate governance. ...|$|R
50|$|CESJ defines “capitalism” as {{a system}} in which {{proprietary}} rights to profits and control over capital assets is concentrated in a small private elite, and “socialism” {{as a system}} in which <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> or control is vested in the State. In both systems most people are dependent on wages and welfare for subsistence. CESJ prefers the term “Just Third Way” to describe the Kelsonian alternative. According to CESJ, the Just Third Way is a system based on equality in which capital is broadly owned instead of concentrated, and everyone has equality of opportunity to gain personal income from private property rights both from one’s human (or labor) contributions and one’s non-human (or capital) contributions to the productive process.|$|E
5000|$|Cooperatives {{traditionally}} combine {{social benefit}} interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Cooperatives achieve {{a mix of}} social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal by not controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization. External societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives. In {{the final year of}} the 20th century, cooperatives banded together to establish a number of social enterprise agencies which have moved to adopt the multi-stakeholder cooperative model. In the years 1994-2009 the EU and its member nations gradually revised national accounting systems to [...] "make visible" [...] the increasing contribution of social economy organizations.|$|E
50|$|Kelso {{created the}} ESOP in 1956 {{to enable the}} {{employees}} of a closely held newspaper chain to buy out its retiring owners. Two years later Kelso and his co-author, the philosopher Mortimer J. Adler, explained the macro-economic theory on which the ESOP is based in The Capitalist Manifesto (Random House, 1958). In The New Capitalists (Random House, 1961), the two authors present Kelso's financial tools for democratizing <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> in a private property, market economy. These ideas were further elaborated and refined in Two-Factor Theory: The Economics of Reality (Random House, 1967) and Democracy and Economic Power: Extending the ESOP Revolution Through Binary Economics (1986, Ballinger Publishing Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts; reprinted 1991, University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland), both co-authored by Patricia Hetter Kelso, his collaborator since 1963.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, recent {{developments}} in the co-operative movement have started to shift thinking more clearly towards multi-stakeholder perspectives. This has resulted in repeated attempts to develop model rules that differentiate control rights from investment and profit-sharing rights. Workers' co-operatives have often been seen as an alternative or [...] "third way" [...] to the domination of labour by either capital or the state (see below for a comparison). Co-operatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Co-operatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means <b>capital</b> <b>ownership</b> is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization.

50|$|The {{majority}} of Burger King restaurants, approximately 90%, are privately held franchises. In North America, Burger King Corporation {{is responsible for}} licensing operators and administering of stores. Internationally, the company often pairs with other parties to operate locations or it will outright sell the operational and administrative rights to a franchisee which is given the designation of master franchise for the territory. The master franchise will then be expected to sub-license new stores, provide training support, and ensure operational standards are maintained. In exchange for the oversight responsibilities, the master franchise will receive administrative and advertising support from Burger King Corporation to ensure a common marketing scheme. The 3G <b>Capital</b> <b>ownership</b> group announced in April 2011 that it would begin divesting itself of many corporate owned locations {{with the intent to}} increase the number of privately held restaurants to 95%.|$|E
5000|$|Many CESJ {{members and}} {{supporters}} {{do not agree}} that the terms “capitalist” and “capitalism” accurately describe the system Kelso and Adler framed. Karl Marx and the socialists, they claim, invented these terms to condemn {{what they saw as}} the inherent greed, exploitation, and injustices inherent in a system where the powers and profits of land and productive assets became concentrated within a tiny elite of private owners. To remedy the abuses of concentrated <b>capital</b> <b>ownership,</b> Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto (1848) declared, “The theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: the abolition of private property.” [...] In contrast, Kelso turned the socialist’s central assumption around by asserting that private property, far from being the problem, is essential for creating a truly just free market global economy. An economically just economy is one in which every citizen can be a capital owner without taking property away from the currently wealthy (whom the system allowed to monopolize ownership of increasingly productive labor displacing-technologies).|$|E
