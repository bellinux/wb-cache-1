50|$|The call {{backspread}} (reverse <b>call</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bullish {{strategy in}} options trading whereby the options trader writes {{a number of}} call options and buys more call options of the same underlying stock and expiration date but at a higher strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk strategy that is used when the trader thinks {{that the price of}} the underlying stock will rise sharply in the near future.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} {{were introduced}} in 1981 when the European Option Exchange in Amster- dam was introduced. Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury in- struments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit investments certificates. Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk. The investments certificates are one of favourite instruments used. The paper deals with option strategy and its usage in creating the treasury products in banks. We focus on Inverse Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> Back <b>Spread</b> strategy as the one, {{which can be used}} for specific investment certificates creation. The aim of the paper is to find the way of creation of Spe- ed certificates, so called Sprint certificates, Double Chance certificates or Double-up certificates. We analyze this type of certificates, derive the profit function in analytical form and we propose the way of its creation through Inverse Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Call</b> Back <b>Spread</b> option strategy...|$|R
50|$|The {{backspread}} is {{the converse}} strategy to the <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> {{and is also}} known as reverse <b>ratio</b> <b>spread.</b> Using <b>calls,</b> a bullish strategy known as the call backspread can be constructed and with puts, a strategy known as the put backspread can be constructed.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a vertical spread. Like a vertical, the <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> involves buying and selling options on the same underlying security with different strike prices and the same expiration date. Unlike a vertical spread, a number of option contracts sold is not equal {{to a number of}} contracts bought. An unequal number of options contracts gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular vertical <b>spread.</b> A typical <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> would be where twice as much option contracts are sold, thus forming a 1:2 ratio.|$|R

40|$|Three {{government}} bond futures contracts {{and their respective}} 3 -month interest rate futures contracts traded on LIFFE are examined. The data period covers three years of observations, January 1994 -December 1996, sampled at half-hourly intervals. Borrowing from the calculation of minimum variance hedge ratios, half-hourly minimum variance <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> (the ratio of one contract to another, which provides the minimum variance) are estimated for the above contracts. The hypothesis under examination is whether there is any value-added in estimating minimum <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> based on intraday data. Three <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> are defined: two ratios calculated from daily data and a third one based on intraday data. Evidence tends to indicate that <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> calculated from intraday data exhibit a substantially lower variance {{than the other two}} <b>spread</b> <b>ratio</b> speciications. Thus, it is shown that intraday data, in comparison with daily data, allow for lower hedging costs.

40|$|The maximum {{spreading}} of drops impacting on {{smooth and}} rough surfaces is measured from low to high impact velocity for liquids with different surface tensions and viscosities. We demonstrate that dynamic wetting {{plays an important}} role in the spreading at low velocity, characterized by the dynamic contact angle at maximum spreading. In the energy balance, we account for the dynamic wettability by introducing the capillary energy at zero impact velocity, which relates to the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero impact velocity. Correcting the measured <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> by the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero velocity, we find a correct scaling behaviour for low and high impact velocity and, by interpolation between the two, we find a universal scaling curve.

As communities age, the optimal nucleus-to-periphery <b>ratio</b> <b>spreads</b> out and then for communities of 2 Â years and older, it narrows again at a lower value. In other words, as communities reach very old ages, a small nucleus is associated with more activity (even though, in general, future activity wanes as communities mature).|$|R

INTRODUCTION There is an increasing emphasis on the provision of meaningful warranty conditions and reliability predictions for software 1. This has been parallelled by greater emphasis on statistical control of the software process 2.

50|$|In {{order to}} inject ions from an {{external}} ion source, the field between the electrodes is first reduced. As ion packets are injected tangentially into the field, the electric field is increased by ramping the voltage {{on the inner}} electrode. Ions get squeezed towards the inner electrode until they reach the desired orbit inside the trap. At that moment ramping is stopped, the field becomes static, and detection can start. Each packet contains a multitude of ions of different velocities spread over a certain volume. These ions move with different rotational frequencies but with the same axial frequency. This means that ions of a specific mass-to-charge <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> into rings which oscillate along the inner spindle.|$|R
