25|$|Tide tables list each day's {{high and}} low water heights and times. To {{calculate}} the actual water depth, add the <b>charted</b> <b>depth</b> to the published tide height. Depth for other times {{can be derived from}} tidal curves published for major ports. The rule of twelfths can suffice if an accurate curve is not available. This approximation presumes that the increase in depth in the six hours between low and high water is: first hour — 1/12, second — 2/12, third — 3/12, fourth — 3/12, fifth — 2/12, sixth — 1/12.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Charted</b> <b>depths</b> {{and drying}} heights on {{nautical}} charts are given relative to chart datum.

5000|$|A {{chart datum}} {{is the level}} of water that <b>charted</b> <b>depths</b> {{displayed}} on a nautical chart are measured from. A chart datum is generally a tidal datum; that is, a datum derived from some phase of the tide. [...] Common chart datums are lowest astronomical tide and mean lower low water. In non-tidal areas, e.g., the Baltic sea, Mean Sea Level (MSL) is used.|$|R

5000|$|Owen Island {{was formed}} about 6000 {{years ago when}} sea levels rose {{at the start of}} the Holocene. [...] The island is a granite outcrop capped with a {{residual}} layer of calcarenite. [...] The island rises from the seabed at 10 m within 100 m to 300 m on its east side while on its west and south side while the same transition occurs over a distance of approximately 850 m. The passage between the island’s south coast and Taylor Island is relatively shallow with a maximum <b>charted</b> <b>depth</b> of 5.2 m due to both islands sharing the same geological base strata.|$|E
5000|$|The Bay of Shoals {{is a body}} {{of water}} which is located {{immediately}} north of the settlement of Kingscote and whose mouth is located between Cape Rouge in the north and Beatrice Point in the south over a distance of about 5 km. The bay has a maximum <b>charted</b> <b>depth</b> of 2.7 m. Its mouth is bounded by a spit known as 'The Spit' which extends from Cape Rouge to within [...] of Beatrice Point, includes the islets of Busby and Beatrice and is reported as being exposed during local tides, i.e. ‘drying.’ Access for watercraft into the bay is via a natural channel at its southern end near Beatrice Point.|$|E
5000|$|Hopkins Island {{was formed}} about 7000 {{years ago after}} sea levels rose {{at the start of}} the Holocene. [...] The island has a {{perimeter}} consisting of granite over which ‘a flat upper plateau’ of calcarenite sits and which supports ‘a thick soil bed’. [...] The island rises from the seabed at 30 m from within 200 m of its north west coast while the same transition occurs over a distance of almost 600 m on its south coast. On its north east coast, the passage between the island and Thistle Island is relatively shallow with a maximum <b>charted</b> <b>depth</b> of 11 m due to both islands sharing the same geological base strata.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of sound refraction {{in the water column}} on the accuracy of depths calculated from oblique swath angles of Multibeam Echosounders. This was accomplished by analysing data collected from the Tamar Estuary, Plymouth Sound and the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Sound speed was computed from this data using the Chen & Millero, MacKenzie and Medwin formulae for the estimation of sound speed in sea water. Resulting values were graphed as sound velocity profiles and barographs thus visually illustrating discrepancies in sound speed estimation between the three sound speed formulae, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} sound speed formula used for the calculation of sound speed in the water column is a source of error related to the horizontal position in a <b>charted</b> <b>depth.</b> The last phase of analysis utilised ray tracing to compare the horizontal distance a sound ray refracted in the water column from sound pulses emitted at near vertical and oblique angles. In all analysis, the extent of refraction increased as the swath angle increased as did the error between the estimated sound speeds from the Chen & Millero, MacKenzie and Medwin formulae. This study establishes the sound velocity formula used to compute sound speed in the water column and refraction at large oblique angles of Multibearn sonars contribute to errors associated with outer swaths of Multibeam sonars, thus contributing error to the horizontal position of chart depths...|$|E
