Article 6 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) – being the only provision in the various international agreements on intellectual property rights that deals with the treatment of parallel trade – preserves the territorial privilege for regulating parallel trade. In a parallel trade model with two heterogeneous <b>countries</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>market</b> size, we address {{the question as to}} whether parallel trade freedom is beneficial or detrimental from a consumer’s perspective. In particular, the model suggests that parallel trade freedom is detrimental to consumers in the country with the smaller <b>market</b> as less <b>of</b> a certain product is sold at a higher price. However, parallel trade freedom is likely to be beneficial to consumers in the country with the larger market.

For this purpose, we develop a simple model of international trade with three <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> unequal <b>market</b> size.

To capture efficiency gains from coordinating policies, countries can participate to an international environmental agreement, which is modeled as a simple coalition formation game. We show that a global agreement is less likely to form if a sub-global agreement between two countries is already in place. Interestingly, the global agreement may be blocked by either the outsider or by the participants to the sub-global agreement...|$|R
