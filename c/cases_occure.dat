40|$|ABSTRACT Humidifier fever (Monday sickness) {{occuring}} {{in office}} staff {{in a factory}} processing rayon presented as pyrexia with a polyuria and leucocytosis {{on the first day}} back to work after a break during the winter half of the year. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities but pulmonary function tests indicated mild airways obstruction in the affected group as a whole. Respirable dust samples taken on a Monday when 11 <b>cases</b> <b>occured</b> were not pyrogenic, indicating that a mechanism other than direct pyrogen activity produced the pyrexia. Efforts were then directed to determining an immunological basis for the episodes. In particular, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, previously held responsible for humidifier fever, was studied. During the episode of 11 cases, the number of viable airborne spores of this organism was far higher than on Mondays when no <b>cases</b> <b>occured.</b> In a second episode of nine cases, however, the airborne viable count was of the same order as non-episode Mondays...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparison}} of cancer prevalence with cancer mortality can lead under some hypotheses to {{an estimate of}} registration rate. A method is proposed, where the cases with cancer {{as a cause of}} death are divided into 3 categories: (1) cases already known by the registry (2) unknown <b>cases</b> having <b>occured</b> before the registry creation date (3) unknown <b>cases</b> <b>occuring</b> during the registry operates. The estimate is then the number of cases in the first category divided by the total of those in categories 1 and 3 (these only are to be registered). An application is performed on the data of the Canton de Vaud. Survival rates of the Norvegian Cancer Registry are used for computing the number of unknown cases to be included in second and third category, respectively.

40|$|Background: Henoch-Schönlein purpura is {{the most}} common form of {{systemic}} vasculitis in the paediatric setting with 90 % of <b>cases</b> <b>occuring</b> in childhood. Although diagnosis in the primary care setting may be difficult, it is vital in order to avoid significant complications. Objective: This article outlines the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and classification of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and details evidence based investigations and management. Discussion: Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a self limiting disease characterised by a tetrad of clinical manifestations that vary in occurrence and order of presentation. There is no single diagnostic test to confirm Henoch- Schönlein purpura; diagnosis depends on recognition of clinical manifestations. Management usually occurs in the ambulatory setting and is mainly supportive. Priorities include symptom relief and preventive therapy to reduce the risk of complications. Further trials to clarify the role of glucocorticosteroids are needed before a definitive role for steroids in the management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura can be established...|$|R

40|$|Background: Brucellosis is {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} zoonosis worldwide. Greece has the highest reported incidence among EU countries. However, occupational risk factors have not been well described. Objective: To determine the incidence patterns and exposure risk factors of brucellosis in Greece. Methods: We used national-level surveillance and occupational denominator data to estimate the incidence patterns and exposure risk factors of brucellosis in Greece, with particular emphasis on occupation. Results: Between November 2003 and December 2015 a total of 2159 human brucellosis cases was reported. The mean incidence rate was 1. 62 per 100 000 population per year.  A large majority of cases (77. 1 %) reported consumption of unpasteurized milk or contact with livestock animals. Most <b>cases</b> <b>occured</b> in farmers and livestock breeders (1079 [87. 7 %] of 1231 cases reporting their occupation), corresponding to an annual incidence of 7. 1 per  100 000. However, there were other occupations with a similar or higher risk: butchers and abattoir workers (12. 7 per 100 000), laboratory personnel (3. 1 per 100 000), while the highest risk was for veterinarians (53. 2 per 100 000). Conclusion: Brucellosis incidence in specific occupational groups was much higher than in the general population. These results underline the importance of collecting information on occupation, both during the diagnostic process and in the surveillance system. Besides efforts to control brucellosis in animals, organized prevention efforts are needed within an occupational health framework, especially for the most vulnerable workers...|$|R

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate knowledge and attitude of patients with periodontitis concerning effects of smoking on periodontal health. Method: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 300 patients with periodontitis, aged between 18 - 74 years, were selected via convenience sampling out of patients referred to Periodontology Department of Shahid Sadoughi Dental Faculty and Khatam Alanbia professional clinic of Yazd. The study data were collected using a questionnaire, which were then analyzed by SPSS software (ver. 17) applying Chi-square, T-test and ANOVA statistical tests. Results: The mean total scores of patients' knowledge and attitude in regard with smoking effect on periodontal health were reported 86. 7 ± 18. 4 and 48. 1 ± 7. 3, respectively. A significant relationship was observed between knowledge and attitude with students' educational level. In the present study, 42 % of smokers tried to quit smoking at least once, among which 14. 3 % of <b>cases</b> <b>occured</b> due to oral and dental health as well as consultation with dentists. Conclusion: The study findings showed despite patients' good knowledge concerning the effect of smoking on periodontal health, their attitude was reported moderate.

40|$|Malaria affects {{about half}} of the world’s population, with the vast {{majority}} of <b>cases</b> <b>occuring</b> in Africa. National malaria control programmes aim to reduce the burden of malaria and its negative, socioeconomic effects by using various control strategies (e. g. vector control, environmental management and case tracking). Vector control is the most effective transmission prevention strategy, while environmental factors are the key parameters affecting transmission. Geographic information systems (GIS), earth observation (EO) and spatial modelling are increasingly being recognised as valuable tools for effective management and malaria vector control. Issues previously inhibiting the use of EO in epidemiology and malaria control such as poor satellite sensor performance, high costs and long turnaround times, have since been resolved through modern technology. The core goal {{of this study was to}} develop and implement the capabilities of EO data for national malaria control programmes in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. High- and very high resolution (HR and VHR) land cover and wetland maps were generated for the identification of potential vector habitats and human activities, as well as geoinformation on distance to wetlands for malaria risk modelling, population density maps, habitat foci maps and VHR household maps. These products were further used for modelling malaria incidence and the analysis of environmental factors that favour vector breeding. Geoproducts were also transferred to the staff of national malaria control programmes in seven African countries to demonstrate how EO data and GIS can support vector control strategy planning and monitoring. The transferred EO products support better epidemiological understanding of environmental factors related to malaria transmission, and allow for spatio-temporal targeting of malaria control interventions, thereby improving the cost-effectiveness of interventions...|$|R

Recently, particular {{attention has been paid to}} sensitive/rapid and cheap laboratory methods for diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of serum tumor markers including CEA and CA 15 - 3 is one of these methods. Materials and Methods: The study was performed on 150 patients with breast cancer in Imam Khomeini and Shafa hospitals-Sari, Iran(2004 - 2005). Before modified radical mastectomy procedure, blood level of CEA and CA 15 - 3 was measured with an ELISA method using CANAg kit, then mastectomy and axillary lymph node specimens were evaluated. The information was analyzed using SPSS 11 statistical software. Results: In our study, the patients were between 32 - 75 yrs (mean: 51. 6 yrs). The patients were divided into two groups: I (89 cases) : Breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastases. II (61 cases) : Breast cancer without axillary lymph node metastases. Statistical differences was observed between the amount of CEA and CA 15 - 3 in the two groups (P< 5 %). CA 15 - 3 and CEA showed the best efficiency in the level of 35 u/ml and 2. 5 u/ml, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of CA 15 - 3 are 78 % and 88 %, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of CEA are 48 % and 83 %, respectively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine a {{grammatical}} construction known as Right-Dislocation (for exemple: c'est nul ce carnaval) in a corpus of conversational French data. It {{has often been}} argued that RD presupposes that the referent be discourse-active or highly accessible (Givón 1983; Lambrecht 1981). Moreover, it has been widely claimed that in RDs, the dislocated element offers an informational completion of a potentially unclear reference (Chafe 1976; Dik 1978; Geluykens 1987, 1994; Fradin 1988 – hence the notion of ‘afterthought’). However, in most <b>cases</b> <b>occuring</b> in our data, the RDs {{do not seem to}} be used in a context of topic continuation nor for correcting a possible referential failure. In this study we will therefore present alternative explanations – mostly interactional – for the use of RD. On the one hand, we will see that RD has a topic-shifting and a topic-creating function. This point has been previously discussed by Lambrecht (1981), Givón (1983) and Ashby (1988) but still remains very controversial in the literature about RDs. On the other hand, we will examine types of RDs that contain a term expressing evaluation – an adjective or an adverb – before the detached element (like in the above example). It will be shown that this type of RDs is regularly used by the speakers to manage a disagreement. We will conclude by arguing that RD functions as a resource for interaction – involved in topical organization as well as in the management of disagreement – rather than as a completion device. In this sense, this investigation helps to uncover the ways in which a grammatical resource and interactional patterns work together to allow speakers to accomplish their communicative goals...|$|R

40|$|Background : Pesticide {{exposure}} {{on women}} {{who live in}} agricultural areas can cause health problems such as disruption of thyroid function. Pesticides can inhibit the binding of iodine by the body. Hypothyroidism can cause disturbances in female reproductive system, including disorders of puberty and menstruation, pre menstrual syndrome, sexual disfunction, birth defects and low birth weight infant. Goiter are usually be found in mountainous or highland areas but now mostly found in the lowlands. This is {{probably due to the}} exposure to heavy metals such as Pb, the use of hormonal contraceptives, and consumption of thiocyanate. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify some factors associated with thyroid function on child bearing age woman in Kersana Subdistrict, district of Brebes Method : It was an observational research using cross-sectional design. Research was conducted in 4 villages namely Kemukten, Limbangan, Sutamaja and Kubangpari Kersana Brebes District. The subjects were 87 women. Data obtained from TSH, FT 4 serum, Pb in blood, kholinesterase in blood, urinary iodine excretion, thiocyanate, measurement of nutritional status, the interview to find out the type of contraception used by couples. Data were analyzed using chi square test. Result : The results showed that there was no correlation between levels of kholinesterase, Pb in blood, urinary iodine excretion, urinary thiocyanate, the type of contraception, age and BMI with thyroid function on child bearing age woman in Sub district of Kersana.

40|$|The {{monetary}} {{crisis that}} happened in Indonesia since 1997 {{have not had a}} significant impact to Indonesia entrepreneurs especially the furniture exporters since the price of their products have become much higher even though the raw materials have been also very expensive. In order to survive and compete with other exporters which also running furniture business. It was needed to do analysis and improvement in the working processes. This paper is taking a case study in PT Hakaya Indomas II which is one of furniture-base companies that producing bedroom set: one of their family products is dresser. The company had a problem of inconvenient working condition such as hot temperature, dusty, noisy and dirty. It has been found that many workers unwilling to wear working costume and safety guard that have been prepared by the company. There was also another <b>case</b> <b>occured,</b> such as lack of danger warning sign and unbalanced workers allocation which caused a bottle neck. Based on the problems, it has been done some proposed improvements and some of them have been successfully implemented. Some of the the suggested improvements were that attaching the danger warning signs in some risky working areas, intensive usage of safety guard stuffs and intensively supervising the worker performance. To solve the unbalanced workers allocation in certain working elements and to reduce bottle neck, it has been proposed a new worker allocation and arrangement by using Line Balancing Method supported by Quantitative Systems Software. As a result, there was an arrangement of 32 working elements into 14 workstations and 6 doubled workstations. In addition the amount of workers needed also has been reduced from 34 to 24 so that there was an efficiency of 10 persons. Finally the balanced delay has also been reduced from 85. 27802 % to 16. 74349 % in the daily capacity of 40 set...|$|R
40|$|Hughes-Stovin {{syndrome}} {{is a very}} rare disease with fewer than 30 cases reported in the literature. This disease {{is characterized by the}} presence of pulmonary artery aneurysms in association with peripheral venous thrombosis. We report the case of a 29 -year-old woman who initially presented with a deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with subsequent pulmonary artery aneurysms. The patient developed hemoptysis and was managed with arterial embolization, lobectomy, steroids and cyclophosphamide. Hughes Stovin syndrome should be considered in the diagnosis in {{young men and women who}} present with a peripheral venous thrombosis and pulmonary artery aneurysms. The majority of cases are reported in young men, unlike our <b>case</b> which <b>occured</b> in a young woman. Anticoagulation should be avoided due to the high risk of fatality in the setting of aneurysmal rupture...|$|R
