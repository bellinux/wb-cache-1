5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like <b>Chlorella</b> and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorella,</b> {{another popular}} microalgae, has similar {{nutrition}} to spirulina. <b>Chlorella</b> {{is very popular}} in Japan. It is also used as a nutritional supplement with possible effects on metabolic rate. Some allege that <b>Chlorella</b> can reduce mercury levels in humans (supposedly by chelation of the mercury to the cell wall of the organism).|$|E
25|$|This theory postulates that {{multicellularity}} arose as a {{means for}} prey to escape predation. Larger prey {{are less likely to be}} preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of <b>Chlorella</b> vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the population of <b>Chlorella</b> vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.|$|E
25|$|In earlier travels from Jamaica to Japan, Hills {{had formed}} an {{aquaculture}} research company {{with his friend}} and colleague, biologist Dr Hiroshi Nakamura, Dean of Tokyo Women's University. Dr Nakamura was a noted scientist and a colleague of Emperor Hirohito (himself a marine biologist) who asked Nakamura to research alternative food sources for Japan after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had devastated food supplies. The goal of Hills and Nakmura's organization Microalgae International Union, was to develop strains of algae {{as a way of}} harnessing the sun's energy for biofuels and human nutrition and as a solution to World Hunger. Presented with M.I.U.'s feasibility studies, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed Hills' proposal for bringing the cultivation of protein-rich <b>Chlorella</b> algae to the villages of India.|$|E
25|$|In land plants, chloroplasts are {{generally}} lens-shaped, 3–10 μm {{in diameter and}} 1–3 μm thick. Corn seedling chloroplasts are ≈20 µm3 in volume. Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae, which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net (e.g., Oedogonium), a cup (e.g., Chlamydomonas), a ribbon-like spiral {{around the edges of}} the cell (e.g., Spirogyra), or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges (e.g., Sirogonium). Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell; they are star-shaped in Zygnema, or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales. In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles, for example, some species of <b>Chlorella</b> have a cup-shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell.|$|E
25|$|With India's Home Minister, Gulzari Lal Nanda, Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social {{upheaval}} {{and possible}} communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so {{he threw his}} support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via small footprint aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the Rann of Kutch {{was approved by the}} Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the <b>chlorella</b> algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death at the 1966 India-Pakistan peace conference in Tashkent, the project lost its key sponsor.|$|E
25|$|Hills and Nakamura had {{a vision}} of feeding the world from lakes, seas and {{backyard}} aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, Food from Sunlight which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on <b>chlorella</b> but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at Lake Chad were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called spirulina that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in Ethiopia. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.|$|E
500|$|Pioneering {{efforts in}} biofuel {{research}} {{have been conducted}} at the university. Studies conducted in the 1930s found that gasoline with 15-20 percent ethanol, dubbed [...] "gasanol", was more efficient than pure gasoline. Biofuel research in 2007 under the National Biofuel Program has considered new sources of biofuel, such as coconuts, Moringa oleifera, and sunflower seeds. Efforts have been concentrated on the Jatropha curcas due to its low maintenance and fast yield. Other fuel, such as coconut biofuel, {{were found to be}} too costly. Biofuel from Sorghum bicolor, Manihot esculenta crantz and <b>Chlorella</b> vulgaris are also being studied.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Chlorella,</b> {{particularly}} a transgenic strain which carries an extra mercury reductase gene, {{has been studied}} as an agent for environmental remediation due to its ability to reduce [...] to the less toxic elemental mercury.|$|E
2500|$|Open pond {{systems are}} cheaper to construct, at the minimum {{requiring}} only a trench or pond. Large ponds {{have the largest}} production capacities relative to other systems of comparable cost. Also, open pond cultivation can exploit unusual conditions that suit only specific algae. For instance, Dunaliella salina grow in extremely salty water; these unusual media exclude other types of organisms, allowing the growth of pure cultures in open ponds. Open culture can also work {{if there is a}} system of harvesting only the desired algae, or if the ponds are frequently re-inoculated before invasive organisms can multiply significantly. [...] The latter approach is frequently employed by <b>Chlorella</b> farmers, as the growth conditions for <b>Chlorella</b> do not exclude competing algae.|$|E

[...] In 2016, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established that nori, fermented foods (such as tempeh), spirulina, <b>chlorella</b> algae, and unfortified nutritional yeast are not adequate sources of vitamin B12 and that vegans need to consume regularly fortified foods or supplements containing B12. Otherwise, vitamin B12 deficiency may develop, as has been demonstrated in case studies of vegan infants, children, and adults.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Solazyme {{launched}} its first products, the Golden <b>Chlorella</b> line of dietary supplements, {{as part of}} a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden <b>Chlorella</b> can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.|$|E
50|$|Prototheca {{has been}} {{thought to be}} a mutant of <b>Chlorella,</b> a type of {{single-celled}} green alga. However, while <b>Chlorella</b> contains galactose and galactosamine in the cell wall, Prototheca lacks these. Also, <b>Chlorella</b> obtains its energy through photosynthesis, while Prototheca is saprotrophic, feeding on dead and decaying organic matter.

50|$|The food {{problem is}} being studied by Dr. Hiroshi Tamiya of the Tokugawa Biological Institute in his {{research}} on <b>chlorella,</b> an algae consisting of carbohydrates, fats and 50% protein. <b>Chlorella</b> can produce about 10 times the edible material, per unit area, as a typical crop.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{production}} of <b>Chlorella</b> looked promising and involved creative technology, it has not to date been cultivated on the scale some had predicted. It has not been sold {{on the scale of}} Spirulina, soybean products, or whole-grains. Costs have remained high, and <b>Chlorella</b> has for the most part been sold as a health food, for cosmetics, or as animal feed. After a decade of experimentation, studies showed that, following exposure to sunlight, <b>Chlorella</b> captured just 2.5% of the solar energy, not much better than conventional crops. <b>Chlorella,</b> too, was found by scientists in the 1960s to be impossible for humans and other animals to digest in its natural state due to the tough cell walls encapsulating the nutrients, which presented further problems for its use in American food production.|$|E
50|$|The {{experimental}} research {{was carried out}} in laboratories, rather than in the field, andscientists discovered that <b>Chlorella</b> would be much more difficult to produce than previously thought. To be practical, the algae grown would have to be placed either in artificial light or in shade to produce at its maximum photosynthetic efficiency. Also, for the <b>Chlorella</b> to be as productive as the world would require, {{it would have to be}} grown in carbonated water, which would have added millions to the production cost. A sophisticated process, and additional cost, was required to harvest the crop, and, for <b>Chlorella</b> to be a viable food source, its cell walls would have to be pulverized. The plant could reach its nutritional potential only in highly modified artificial situations. Another problem was developing sufficiently palatable food products from <b>Chlorella.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} the {{upcoming}} post-war population boom in the United States and elsewhere, researchers decided {{to tap into the}} unexploited sea resources. Initial testing by the Stanford Research Institute showed <b>Chlorella</b> (when growing in warm, sunny, shallow conditions) could convert 20% of solar energy into a plant that, when dried, contains 50% protein. In addition, <b>Chlorella</b> contains fat and vitamins. The plant's photosynthetic efficiency allows it to yield more protein per unit area than any plant—one scientist predicted 10,000 tons of protein a year could be produced with just 20 workers staffing a one-thousand-acre (4-square kilometer) <b>Chlorella</b> farm. The pilot research performed at Stanford and elsewhere led to immense press from journalists and newspapers, yet did not lead to large-scale algae production. <b>Chlorella</b> seemed like a viable option because of the technological advances in agriculture at the time and the widespread acclaim it got from experts and scientists who studied it. Algae researchers had even hoped to add a neutralized <b>Chlorella</b> powder to conventional food products, as a way to fortify them with vitamins and minerals.|$|E
