Abstract Morphine {{belongs to}} the class of {{compounds}} known as 4, 5 -epoxymorphinans, which can alter immune function directly via receptors expressed by immune cells.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the in vitro immunomodulatory effects of 24 structurally related 4, 5 -epoxymorphinans to allow further characterisation of the receptor that mediates the immunomodulation and to ascertain if there is any structure-effect relationship. The immunomodulation of 4, 5 -epoxymorphinans using isolated mouse splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin A resulted in five types of responses: an inverted bell shaped curve (oxycodone, inhibitory EC 50 = 1. 6 nM), an inhibitory <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> (buprenorphine, inhibitory EC 50 = 12. 6 μM), an inverted bell-shaped curve with induction (morphine, induction EC 50 = 1. 7 μM), an induction <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> (oxymorphone, induction EC 50 = 20 nM), and the lack of any response (e. g. noroxycodone).

40|$|Objective: Recently, we {{have shown}} {{augmented}} contractile responses of skeletal muscle resistance arteries to noradrenaline in patients with critical limb ischemia. We investigated whether this increased sensitivity in skeletal muscle resistance arteries is due to either α 1 - or α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated responses or both. Methods: Skeletal muscle resistance arteries were isolated from the proximal (non-ischemic) and distal (ischemic) parts of limbs amputated for critical limb ischemia and mounted on a small vessel wire myograph. Cumulative <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> of the vessel segments to noradrenaline, phenylephrine and brimonidine were obtained in the presence or {{the absence of the}} selective antagonists, prazosin and RS 79948. Results: Noradrenaline and phenylephrine produced almost equal maximal contractile responses. Brimonidine responses were smaller and were almost abolished by 0. 1 μM RS 79948 while those of phenylephrine and noradrenaline were not affected. Prazosin reduced the maximum responses to brimonidine, shifted the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> of noradrenaline and phenylephrine rightwards giving pKB values of 9. 86 and 9. 33, respectively. Maximum responses produced by all three agonists in distal vessels were significantly higher than those obtained in proximal vessels. Conclusions: Noradrenaline contractile responses in skeletal muscle resistance arteries are predominantly mediated by α 1 -adrenoceptors. Both α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated responses are increased in the arteries from ischemic regions that may aggravate the decreased blood flow to the limbs due to arterial occlusion...|$|R

Calcium antagonists also inhibit catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. Experiments {{were designed to}} determine the effect of calcium antagonists in the presence and absence of the endothelium on the responsiveness of the isolated rat aorta to norepinephrine. Rings of the thoracic aorta of Wistar Kyoto rats were suspended in organ chambers (in the {{presence of}} indomethacin) for isometric measurement of force. Mechanical removal of the endothelium shifted the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> to norepinephrine to the left and augmented the maximal response to the catecholamine. Diltiazem and verapamil shifted the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> to norepinephrine to the right only in rings without endothelium; they abolished the difference in sensitivites to norepinephrine caused by removal of the endothelium. Diltiazem, but not verapamil, also reduced the difference in the maximal response to norepinephrine. In the presence of oxyhemoglobin, diltiazem had similar effects on rings with and without endothelium. Sodium nitroprusside also abolished the hypersensitivity to norepinephrine caused by removal of the endothelium. These data suggest that calcium antagonists can prevent the hypersensitivity to norepinephrine in arteries in which the endothelium has been removed.

For the teaching purposes to use isolated strip preparations from various organs, the laboratory animal species has to be sacrificed just {{for a piece of}} tissue. The present study was aimed to develop ex vivo model for pharmacological experimentation, which will mimic the actual laboratory condition without sacrificing the experimental animals. Dose response curve of acetylcholine alone and in presence of different concentrations of atropine was plotted using isolated chicken ileum, chicken duodenum, rat ileum, and rat duodenum and their EC 50 values were compared. The effect of atropine in terms of its type of antagonism was predicted based on Schild plot and pA 2 values were obtained. The chicken ileum and duodenum were also evaluated for four- and three-point bioassay, respectively. The results suggested that acetylcholine produced a dose-dependent increase in contraction in both chicken and rat ileum and duodenum preparation. The <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> of acetylcholine in chicken ileum shifted toward left side of rat ileum with a higher EC 50 value. Atropine shifted the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> of acetylcholine toward right with a change in EC 50 value. Schild plots indicated that antagonism produced by atropine was found to be competitive in nature. The pA 2 values of atropine were found significantly high with isolated chicken ileum as compared to rat ileum preparation. It is concluded that isolated chicken ileum and duodenum preparation can be employed for routine experiments of pharmacology subject and the use of these isolated preparations is a novel approach for managing pharmacological experiments and importantly, without sacrificing the experimental animals...|$|E

The endogenous noradrenaline released by normal preparations (without reserpine) was measured in the perfusion fluid of preparations stimulated with phenylephrine, in the absence and presence of L-NMMA, L-NMMA + the nitric oxide donor 3 -morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN- 1), the alpha(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and the blocker of noradrenaline carrier desipramine. The phenylephrine-induced noradrenaline release in a calcium-free medium was also measured. L-NMMA decreased the E-max of phenylephrine <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> obtained in preparations from normal (reserpine-untreated) but not from reserpine-treated rats. In the perfusion fluid of preparations incubated with phenylephrine, a concentration-dependent increase of noradrenaline was observed which was reversed by L-NMMA and restored when SIN- 1 was added together with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The concentration-dependent phenylephrine-induced noradrenaline increase was not modified by desipramine but was abolished by 10 muM prazosin. In calcium-free medium, phenylephrine failed to increase the noradrenaline concentration. These results suggest that in the rat vas deferens, nitric oxide pathway potentiates the phenylephrine-induced contractility through a mechanism which involves calcium-dependent release of endogenous noradrenaline and seems to depend, at least partially on the activation of alpha(1) -adrenoceptors...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the relative contribution of prostanoids, nitric oxide and K+ channels in the bradykinin-induced relaxation of bovine pulmonary supernumerary arteries. In endothelium-intact, but not denuded rings, bradykinin produced a concentration-dependent relaxation (pEC 50, 9. 6 ± 0. 1), which was unaffected by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. The nitric oxide scavenger hydroxocobalamin (200 μM, pEC 50, 8. 5 ± 0. 2) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 μM, pEC 50, 8. 9 ± 0. 1) and the combination of L-NAME and hydroxocobalamin (pEC 50, 8. 1 ± 0. 2) produced rightward shifts in the bradykinin <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve.</b> The guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10 μM, pEC 50, 9. 6 ± 0. 4) did not affect the response to bradykinin. Elevating the extracellular [K+] to 30 mM did not affect the response to bradykinin but abolished the response when ODQ or L-NAME was present. The K+ channel blocker apamin (100 nM), combined with charybdotoxin (100 nM), produced a small reduction in the maximum response to bradykinin but they abolished the response to bradykinin when ODQ, L-NAME or hydroxocobalamin were present. Apamin (100 nM) combined with iberiotoxin (100 nM) also reduced the response to bradykinin in the presence of hydroxocobalamin or L-NAME. The <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> for sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was abolished by ODQ (10 μM) and shifted to the right by apamin and charybdotoxin. These studies suggest that in bovine pulmonary supernumerary arteries bradykinin can stimulate the formation of nitric oxide and activate an EDHF-like mechanism and that either of these pathways alone can mediate the bradykinin-induced relaxation. In addition nitric oxide, acting through guanylyl cyclase, can activate an apamin/charbydotoxin-sensitive K+ channel in this tissue...|$|E

40|$|Upregulation of {{xanthine}} oxidoreductase (XOR) increases vascular reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) levels and contributes to nitroso-redox imbalance. However, XOR can generate nitric oxide (NO) from nitrite, and increased superoxide could inactivate NO formed from nitrite. This study tested the hypothesis that XOR contributes to the cardiovascular effects of nitrite in renovascular hypertension, and that treatment with the antioxidant tempol (4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) improves XOR-mediated effects of nitrite. Blood pressure was assessed weekly in two-kidney one-clip (2 K 1 C) and control rats. After six weeks of hypertension, the relaxing responses to nitrite were assessed in aortic rings {{in the presence of}} the XOR inhibitor oxypurinol (or vehicle), either in the absence or in the presence of tempol. Moreover, in vivo hypotensive responses to nitrite were also examined in the presence of oxypurinol (or vehicle) and tempol (or vehicle). Aortic XOR activity and expression were evaluated by fluorescence and Western blot, respectively. Vascular ROS production was assessed by the dihydroethidium assay. 2 K 1 C hypertensive rats showed increased aortic XOR activity and vascular ROS production compared with control rats. Oxypurinol shifted the nitrite <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> to the right in aortic rings from 2 K 1 C rats (but not in controls). Oxypurinol also attenuated the hypotensive responses to nitrite in 2 K 1 C rats (but not in controls). These functional findings agree with increased aortic and plasma XOR activity found in 2 K 1 C rats. Tempol treatment enhanced oxypurinol-induced shift of the nitrite <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> to the right. However, antioxidant treatment did not affect XOR-mediated hypotensive effects of nitrite. Our results show that XOR is important to the cardiovascular responses to nitrite in 2 K 1 C hypertension, and XOR inhibitors commonly used by patients may cancel this effect. This finding suggests that nitrite treatment may not be effective in patients being treated with XOR inhibitors. Moreover, while tempol may improve the vascular responses to nitrite, antihypertensive responses are not affected. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

The application of V. odorata to spontaneous contractions in isolated rabbit jejunum preparation exerted relaxant effect through decrease in magnitude and frequency of contractions. Moreover, it also caused relaxation of K+ (80 mM) -induced contractions and shifted the Ca 2 + <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> toward right in isolated jejunum similar to verapamil (standard Ca 2 + channel blocker), confirming Ca 2 + channel blocking activity. V. odorata also caused relaxation of carbachol (1 µM) - and K+ (80 mM) -induced contractions in isolated rabbit tracheal preparations comparable to verapamil, reflecting that observed relaxant effect may be the outcome of anti-muscarinic and/or Ca 2 + channel blocking activities. It also exerted relaxant effect on phenylephrine (1 µM) - and K+ (80 mM) -induced contractions in isolated rabbit aortic preparations thus providing rationale for its folkloric uses to treat diarrhea, asthma and hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{molecules}} {{combining the}} crucial structural features of both pheniramine-type histamine H 1 receptor antagonists and guanidinothiazole-type H 2 receptor antagonists have been synthesized and tested for in vitro pharmacological {{activity at the}} isolated ileum and the spontaneously beating right atrium of the guinea-pig. In the title compounds the basic side chain nitrogen of the H 1 antagonist and the so-called ‘polar group' (cyanoguanidine, urea, or nitroethenediamine) of the H 2 antagonist moiety have been linked by a polymethylene spacer. The new substances displayed high affinities to both histamine receptor subtypes and a dual type of antagonism (surmountable/insurmountable) characterized by a shift of the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> to the right accompanied by a depression of the maximal response to the agonist if the antagonist concentration was ≥ 100 nM. Highest combined histamine antagonist activities {{were found in the}} nitroethenediamine series with pKB values ranging from 8. 16 to 9. 04 in the ileum (H 1) and 7. 0 – 8. 08 in the atrium (H 2...|$|R
40|$|Crude extract of Morus alba at 100 mg/kg {{exhibited}} {{protective effect}} against castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice. In isolated rabbit jejunum, M. alba (0. 3 - 10 mg/mL) inhibited the spontaneous contractions and caused glibenclamide-sensitive inhibition of low K+ (20 mM) -induced contractions, with mild effect on high K+ (80 mM). Similarly, cromakalim caused inhibition of low K+, {{but not of}} high K+, while verapamil did not differentiate in its inhibitory effect on two concentrations of K+. M. alba (3. 0 - 30 mg/kg) caused suppression of carbachol (100 µg/kg) -induced increase in inspiratory pressure of anaesthetized rats. In guinea-pig trachea, M. alba completely inhibited low K+ contractions, with partial effect on high K+. M. alba (0. 3 - 1. 0 mg/mL) caused leftward shift of isoprenaline-induced inhibitory <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves,</b> like papaverine. These results indicate that M. alba possesses a combination of KATP channel opening, weak Ca++-antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanisms, which explain its medicinal use in hyperactive gut and airways disorders...|$|R
30|$|The {{in vitro}} {{cytotoxic}} effect of scorpion venom was conducted using MCF- 7 cell line. Cell survival was determined using sulphorhodamine B (SRB, Biotium, USA) method as previously described (Skehan et al. 1990). Cells were seeded in 96 well microtiter plates at {{a concentration of}} 1000 – 2000 cells/well, 100  μl/well. After 24  h, cells were incubated for 24, 48 and 72  h with various concentrations of A. amoreuxi venom (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100  μg/ml). After 72  h from venom application, cells were fixed with 10  % trichloroacetic acid (150  μl/well for 1  h at 4  °C). Cells washed three times using water and stained for 10 – 30  min at room temperature with 0.4  % SRB dissolved in 1  % acetic acid (70  μl/well). The unbounded dye was removed with 1  % acetic acid. The plates were air dried for 24  h, the dye was solubilized with 10  mM tris base of (pH 7.4, 150  μl/well) for 5  min on a shaker at 1600  rpm. The optical density (OD) was measured spectrophotometrically at 540  nm using the Bio-Rad ELISA microplate reader (Model 550, Japan).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of age, ovariectomy and dietary phytoestrogen ingestion on 17 -߭estradiol-mediated relaxant responses and messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of oestrogen receptor subtypes in the rat isolated bladder. Female Wistar rats (8 weeks) were anaesthetised, and the ovaries were removed (ovx) or left intact (sham). Rats were fed either normal rat chow (soy, phytoestrogens) or a non-soy (phytoestrogen free) diet. Isolated bladder from rats aged 12, 24 or 52 weeks were pre-contracted with 3 占carbachol prior to obtaining a <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> to 17 -߭estradiol. Protein and mRNA expression of the oestrogen receptor subtypes was completed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, respectively. Relatively moderate relaxant responses to 17 -߭estradiol were observed in bladders from all age and treatment groups. However, in soy-fed sham 52 -week-old rats, the bladder exhibited enhanced relaxant responses to 17 -߭estradiol when compared to tissues from other age-matched rat treatment groups (P? ? 0. 05). Diet, overiectomy or age did not alter the protein expression of either oestrogen receptor subtype in the bladder (P?>? 0. 05). While a soy diet improved relaxant effects to the 17 -߭estradiol with age, it did not alter relaxant responses in bladders from ovariectomised rats.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the relaxant effect of MgSO 4 and diphenylhydantoin on isolated canine middle cerebral artery (MCA) rings contracted with the thromboxane-A 2 analogue U 46619. Methods: Canine MCA rings, {{with and without}} endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording, they were contracted with U 46619 {{in the presence of}} indomethacin, with and without nitro-L-arginine (NLA). Cumulative dose-response curves were performed using MgSO 4 (10 - 8 M to 10 - 2 M) and diphenylhydantoin (10 - 9 M to 10 - 3 M). Main Outcome Measures: Tension at each concentration of the study drug expressed {{as a percentage of the}} maximum tension developed with U 46619; area under the <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve.</b> Results: Both MgSO 4 and diphenylhydantoin relaxed the MCA rings irrespective of the presence of endothelium. Diphenylhydantoin caused an endothelium-dependent relaxation at concentrations above 3 x 10 - 5 M, unaffected by NLA. Conclusions: MgSO 4 relaxes canine MCA by a direct smooth muscle effect independent of the endothelium. Diphenylhydantoin causes an endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine MCA at concentrations above 3 x 10 - 5 M, unrelated to nitric oxide. MgSO 4 and diphenylhydantoin may both help to prevent seizures in patients with eclampsia by reducing the potential for cerebral vasospasm. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{pharmacologically}} characterized pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptides (PACAPs), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the VPAC 1, VPAC 2 and PAC 1 receptors {{in human}} meningeal (for {{their role in}} migraine) and coronary (for potential side effects) arteries. Methods: <b>Concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> to PACAP 38, PACAP 27, VIP and the VPAC 1 receptor agonist ([Lys 15,Arg 16,Leu 27]-VIP[1 - 7]-GRF[8 - 27]) were constructed in the absence or presence of the PAC 1 receptor antag-onist PACAP 6 - 38 or the VPAC 1 receptor antagonist, PG 97269. mRNA expression was measured using qPCR. Results: PACAP 38 was less potent than VIP in both arteries. Both peptides had lower potency and efficacy in meningeal than in coronary arteries, while mRNA expression of VPAC 1 receptor was more pronounced in meningeal arteries. PACAP 6 - 38 reduced the Emax of PACAP 27, while PG 97269 right-shifted the VIP-induced relaxation curve only in the coronary arteries. Conclusion: The direct vasodilatory effect of VIP and PACAP might be less relevant than the central effect of this compound in migraine pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophils {{have been}} implicated in {{exacerbating}} ischemia/reperfusion injury in hearts. This study was undertaken to compare the adhesion of isolated rabbit neutrophils to rabbit coronary endothelial cells grown in culture under static and flow conditions. Also, {{the effects of a}} platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist (SDZ 64 - 412) were evaluated in both systems along with monoclonal antibodies (mab) against specific adhesion proteins in the static system. Comparable <b>concentration</b> <b>response</b> <b>curves</b> for SDZ 64 - 412 were obtained in both systems with a greater decrease in adhesion seen in the flow system versus the static system. Both systems showed a significant inhibition of adhesion with increased concentration. The mabs against CD 11 a, CD 11 b, CD 18, and ICAM reduced adhesion to 94. 8 %, 76. 5 %, 72. 6 %, and 26. 7 %, respectively. In conclusion, neutrophil/coronary endothelial cell adhesion can be quantified in both static and flow systems. Also, SDZ 64 - 412 effectively inhibits the adhesion of these two cell types to an even greater extent than certain adhesion protein mabs...|$|R
