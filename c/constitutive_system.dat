For this purpose, trademark has been regulated in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 15 of 2001 regarding Trademark (referred herewith as Trademark Law). The role of trademark becomes significantly important in protecting industrial rights in intellectual works, maintaining fair competition, and encouraging fair and free trade.

40|$|The {{attraction}} of employing thermal induction {{system in the}} production of heterologous protein is mainly due to 1) a higher expressed protein titer in comparison to <b>constitutive</b> <b>system,</b> and 2) a cleaner process since no chemical inducing agent is added. However, problems pertaining to high temperature and protein overexpression such as inclusion bodies formations, metabolic overload on the host, stress-related proteolysis on the expressed protein, and enhanced acetic acid secretion are commonly encountered. Several bioprocess approaches that include temperature upshift schemes, feeding strategies, timing of induction, two-stage culture mode, and stabilization of plasmid had been implemented to minimize some of these problems. The approaches are reviewed in this article. ...|$|E

40|$|Published in the Journal of Nutrition 133 (Supplement: 11 th International Symposium on Trace Elements in Man and Animals) There are {{similarities}} between mammals and {{plants in the}} absorption and transport of trace elements. The chemistry of trace element uptake from food sources in both cases {{is based on the}} thermodynamics of adsorption on charged solid surfaces embedded in a solution phase of charged ions and metal-binding ligands together with redox systems in the case of iron and some other elements. Constitutive absorption systems function in nutrient uptake during normal conditions, and inducible "turbo" systems increase the supply of a particular nutrient during deficiency. Iron uptake is the most studied of the micronutrients, and divides the plant kingdom into two groups: dicotyledonous plants have a turbo system that is an upregulated version of the <b>constitutive</b> <b>system,</b> which consists of a membrane-bound reductase and an ATP-driven hydrogen ion extrusion pump; and monocotyledonous plants have a <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to that of the}} dicots, but with an inducible system remarkably different that uses the mugeneic acid class of phytosiderophores (PS). The PS system may in fact be an important port of entry for iron from an iron-rich but exceedingly iron-insoluble lithosphere into the iron-starved biosphere. Absorption of trace metals in these graminaceous plants is normally via divalent ion channels after reduction in the plasma membrane. Once absorbed, iron can be stored in plants as phytoferritin or transported to active sites by transport-specific ligands. The transport of iron and zinc into seeds is dominated by the phloem sap system, which has a high pH that requires chelation of heavy metals. Loading into grains involves three or four genes each that control chelation, membrane transport and deposition as phytate...|$|E
40|$|The {{registration}} of trademark {{done by the}} Directorate General of Intellectual PropertyRights was intended to obtaine legal certainty and legal protection {{for the right to}} trademark in accordance with Law No. 15 / 2001. The {{registration of}} trademark through <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> (First to File) more guarantees the existence of legal certainty for the holder of right to trademark because the one who registered the trademark was given a certificate as a proof of registration and a proof of right to trademark, and at the same time, the registrant is reagarded as the first user of the trademark. The settlement of dispute on Foreign Trademark which is principally or wholly similar to the registered trademark can be carried out based on the civil, criminal and administrative approach. In terms of legal protection, in relation to the existing cases of trademark, legal protection that can be given to the owner of the registered trademark is to file a lawsuit on the cancellation of brand (trademark) considering the <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> followed by the Indonesian Law on Brand (Trademark) saying that legal protection is given to the first registrant of trademark. It is expected that the process of trademark registration can be simplified and shortened and the data system and publication of the Directorate General of Intellectual PropertyRights should be improved that the business practitioners will be not in doubt to register their trademarks. To give more legal protection to the holders of foreign trademarks, harmonious cooperation is needed between the government accompanied with adequate regulations of legislation, brand (trademark) inspection apparatuses (the Directorate General of Intellectual PropertyRights), law enforcement officers, community members at large in announcing the information about violation brands and entrepreneurs who will use a particular brand for their products.

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, the {{step-wise}} {{integration of}} tet-dependent transactivator and tet-responsive expression unit {{is considered to}} be the most promising tool to achieve stable tet-controlled gene expression in cell populations. However, disadvantages of this strategy for integration into primary cells led us to develop an “All-In-One” vector system, enabling simultaneous integration of both components. The effect on tet-controlled gene expression was analyzed for retroviral “All-In-One” vectors expressing the M 2 -transactivator either under control of a constitutive or a new type of autoregulated promoter. Results Determination of luciferase activity in transduced cell populations indicated improvement of the dynamic range of gene expression for the autoregulated system. Further differences were observed regarding induction kinetics and dose–response. Most notably, introduction of the autoregulated system resulted in a threshold mode of induction, whereas the <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> exhibited pronounced effector-dose dependence. Conclusion Tet-regulated gene expression in the applied autoregulated system resembles a threshold mode, whereby full induction of the tet-unit can be achieved at otherwise limiting doxycycline concentrations. </p...|$|E

As physiological expression patterns {{are more complex}} than high-level expression of a singular therapeutic gene, we aimed at constitutive or inducible co-expression of 2 transgenes simultaneously. Co-expression of human bone morphogenetic protein 2 and 7 (BMP 2 / 7) from constitutively expressing and doxycycline inducible plasmids was evaluated in vitro in C 2 C 12 cells with osteocalcin reporter gene assays and standard assays for osteogenic differentiation. The <b>constitutive</b> <b>systems</b> were additionally tested in an in vivo pilot for ectopic bone formation after repeated naked DNA injection to murine muscle tissue. Inductor controlled differentiation was demonstrated in vitro for inducible co-expression. Both co-expression <b>systems,</b> inducible and <b>constitutive,</b> achieved significantly better osteogenic differentiation than single factor expression. The potency of the <b>constitutive</b> co-expression <b>systems</b> was dependent on relative expression cassette topology. In vivo, ectopic bone formation was demonstrated in 6 / 13 animals (46 % bone formation efficacy) at days 14 and 28 in hind limb muscles as proven by in vivo μCT and histological evaluation. In vitro findings demonstrated that the devised single vector BMP 2 / 7 co-expression strategy mediates superior osteoinduction, can be applied in an inductor controlled fashion and that its efficiency is dependent on expression cassette topology. In vivo results indicate that co-expression of BMP 2 / 7 applied by non-viral naked DNA gene transfer effectively mediates bone formation without the application of biomaterials, cells or recombinant growth factors, offering a promising alternative to current treatment strategies with potential for clinical translation in the future...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} spatial {{dynamics}} of noise-induced waves in two-dimensional excitable media in {{dependence on the}} duration of the artificially imposed refractory time that is introduced to each <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> unit after an excitation.

Thus, once the wave leaves the absorbing boundaries of the spatial grid the system has little or no recollection, depending on {{the duration of the}} refractory time, of its existence. We show that even in the presence of such memory loss, self-organization of excitatory events leads to noise-induced spatial periodicity in the media. We present a simple analytical treatment of a two-unit system to capture and explain the essence of the observed phenomenon.

Simulated uptake correlated well with measured values of nitrogen (N) uptake under field conditions for all N fertilization rates tested. Model outputs showed that the high-affinity transport system accounted for about 89 % of total NO 3 - uptake (18 % and 71 % for <b>constitutive</b> high-affinity transport <b>systems</b> and inducible high-affinity transport systems, respectively) when no fertilizer was applied. The low-affinity transport system accounted for a minor proportion of total N uptake, and its activity was restricted to the early phase of the growth cycle. However, N fertilization in spring increased the duration of its contribution to total N uptake. Overall, data show that this mechanistic and environmentally regulated approach is a powerful means to simulate total N uptake in the field with the advantage of taking both physiologically regulated processes at the overall plant level and specific nitrate transport system characteristics into account...|$|R

In this study, the use of an inducible or a <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> to produce the HPV- 16 E 7 protein in Lactococcus lactis, a non-pathogenic and non-invasive Gram-positive bacterium, was compared. The highest E 7 production was obtained with the inducible system.

As bacterial antigen location may influence the immune response, recombinant L. lactis strains that produced E 7 in three cellular locations, intracellular, secreted or cell-wall-anchored were evaluated. The highest immune response was elicited by administration of L. lactis producing an inducible cell-wall-anchored form of E 7 protein.

In glucose-grown mycelia, galactose was transported by a low-affinity (Km = 400 mM) <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> which was distinct from the previously described glucose transport system I (R. P. Schneider and W. R. Wiley, J. Bacteriol. 106 : 479 [...] 486, 1971).

System II also transported mannose, 2 -deoxyglucose, xylose, and talose and is therefore a general monosaccharide transport system. System II was derepressed by carbon starvation, completely repressed by glucose, mannose, and 2 -deoxyglucose, and partially repressed by fructose and xylose. Incubation with galactose yielded twice as much activity as starvation. This extra induction by galactose required protein synthesis, and represented an increase in activity of system II rather than the induction of another transport system.

40|$|Mutagenesis {{by simple}} alkylating agents {{is thought to}} occur by either a lexA+-dependent process called {{error-prone}} repair or a lex-independent process often attributed to mispairing during replication. We show here that error-prone repair {{is responsible for the}} majority of mutants formed after a large dose of alkylating agent, but it is unlikely that it contributes significantly to mutagenesis during exposure to low concentrations of these chemicals. The mutagenicity of these low doses of alkylating agent is reduced by a repair system constitutively present in lexA+ cells but absent in lexA mutants. This system reduces mutagenesis until a second error-free system, called the adaptive responses, can be induced [P. Jeggo, M. Defais, L. Samson, and P. Schendel, Mol. Gen.

40|$|A {{system for}} tetracycline-regulated {{inducible}} gene expression was described recently which relies on constitutive {{expression of a}} tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) fusion protein combining the tetracycline repressor and the transcriptional activation domain of VP 16 [Gossen, M. & Bujard, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5547 - 5551]. This system yielded only low levels of transactivator protein, probably because tTA is toxic. To avoid this difficulty, we placed the tTA gene {{under the control of}} the inducible promoter to which tTA binds, making expression of tTA itself inducible and autoregulatory. When used to drive expression of the recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG- 1 and RAG- 2), the autoregulatory system yielded both substantially higher levels of variable (diversity) joining [V(D) J] recombination activity (70 -fold on average) and inducible expression in a much larger fraction of transfected cells (autoregulatory, 90 %, vs. constitutive, 18 %). In addition, this system allowed the creation of transgenic mice in which expression of a luciferase transgene was inducible tens to hundreds of times the basal levels in most tissues examined. Induced levels of expression were highest in thymus and lung and appear to be substantially higher than in previously reported inducible luciferase transgenic mice created with the <b>constitutive</b> <b>system.</b> With the modified system, inducible transactivator mRNA and protein were easily detected in cell lines by RNA and Western blotting, and transactivator mRNA was detected by RNA blotting in some tissues of transgenic mice.

By precursor addition of cinnamic acid analogues to the engineered yeast, numerous non-natural flavanones and dihydrochalcones were formed. ^ In a second study, S. cerevisiae expressing a flavonoid glucosyltransferase (GT) from Dianthus caryophyllus (carnation flower) was investigated as a whole-cell biocatalyst. GTs are promising biocatalysts for the synthesis of small molecule glycosides. Two yeast expression systems were compared using the flavonoid naringenin as a model substrate. Under in vitro conditions, naringenin 7 -O-glucoside was formed and a higher specific GT activity was found using a galactose inducible expression system compared to a <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>system.</b> The <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>system</b> was significantly more productive than the galactose inducible system under in vivo conditions.

40|$|Published online: 11 June 2014 The article {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that led to}} the current crisis of copyright law in the digital environment (understood as its inability to regulate social dynamics as regards the production, dissemination and access to creative works) by applying the concept of law as an autopoietic system. It analyses how the copyright regime (a subsystem of the legal system) evolved over time, by scrutinizing the interdependencies between copyright law and the other <b>constitutive</b> <b>systems</b> of its environment: the creative system (concerned with the creation, reproduction, distribution and access to creative works), the political system (comprising both the State and the Church), the economic system (ruled by right holders and intermediaries on the market for creative works) and the technological system. It will be shown that every new development in the technological system irritated the remaining systems, thereby stimulating the evolution of the overall ecosystem. For a long time, copyright law managed to properly adjust to the environmental changes brought by technological developments, so as to successfully regulate the production, dissemination and access to creative works. It is only with the advent of Internet and digital technologies that copyright law’s selective response to environmental stimuli resulted in its failure to adapt to the new reality and, consequently, in the loss of its regulative power. Reacting mostly to the pressures of the economic and political systems (ie the lobbying of right holders and intermediaries), while neglecting the needs of the creative system, and even failing to adjust to the specificities of the changing technological system, copyright law eventually disrupted the balance of the surrounding environment.

40|$|Abstract Background Deschampsia {{antarctica}} shows {{tolerance to}} extreme environmental {{factors such as}} low temperature, high light intensity and an increasing UV radiation as result of the Antarctic ozone layer thinning. It is very likely that the survival of this species {{is due to the}} expression of genes that enable it to tolerate high levels of oxidative stress. On that account, we planned to clone the D. antarctica Cu/ZnSOD gene into Pichia pastoris and to characterize the heterologous protein. Findings The Copper/Zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD) gene, SOD gene, was isolated from a D. antarctica by cDNA library screening. This SOD gene was cloned in the expression vector pGAPZαA and successfully integrated into the genome of the yeast P. pastoris SMD 1168 H. A constitutive expression system for the expression of the recombinant SOD protein was used. The recombinant protein was secreted into the YPD culture medium as a glycosylated protein with a 32 mg/l expression yield. The purified recombinant protein possesses a specific activity of 440 U/mg. Conclusion D. antarctica Cu/ZnSOD recombinant protein was expressed in a <b>constitutive</b> <b>system,</b> and purified in a single step by means of an affinity column. The recombinant SOD was secreted to the culture medium as a glycoprotein, corresponding to approximately 13 % of the total secreted protein. The recombinant protein Cu/ZnSOD maintains 60 % of its activity after incubation at 40 °C for 30 minutes and it is stable (80 % of activity) between - 20 °C and 20 °C. The recombinant SOD described in this study can be used in various biotechnological applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria use three {{distinct}} systems for iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster biogenesis: the ISC, SUF, and NIF machineries. The ISC and SUF systems are widely distributed, and many bacteria possess both of them. In Escherichia coli, ISC {{is the major}} and <b>constitutive</b> <b>system,</b> whereas SUF is induced under iron starvation and/or oxidative stress. Genomic analysis of the Fe/S cluster biosynthesis genes in Bacillus subtilis suggests that this bacterium’s genome encodes only a SUF system consisting of a sufCDSUB gene cluster and a distant sufA gene. Mutant analysis of the putative Fe/S scaffold genes sufU and sufA revealed that sufU is essential for growth under minimal standard conditions, but not sufA. The drastic growth retardation of a conditional mutant depleted of SufU was coupled with a severe reduction of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase activities in total-cell lysates, suggesting a crucial function of SufU in Fe/S protein biogenesis. Recombinant SufU was devoid of Fe/S clusters after aerobic purification. Upon in vitro reconstitution, SufU bound an Fe/S cluster with up to 1. 5 Fe and S per monomer. The assembled Fe/S cluster could be transferred from SufU to the apo form of isopropylmalate isomerase Leu 1, rapidly forming catalytically active [4 Fe- 4 S]-containing holo-enzyme. In contrast to native SufU, its D 43 A variant carried a Fe/S cluster after aerobic purification, indicating that the cluster is stabilized by this mutation. Further, we show that apo-SufU is an activator of the cysteine desulfurase SufS by enhancing its activity about 40 -fold in vitro. SufS-dependent formation of holo-SufU suggests that Suf...|$|E
40|$|Trehalose {{is absorbed}} by two {{distinct}} systems—one constitutive, the other induced by turanose {{and to a}} lesser extent by nigerose but not by trehalose. The <b>constitutive</b> <b>system</b> is apparently mediated by a surface trehalase; the induced system has the characteristics of a permease. The specificity of the induced system is apparently limited to the α glucosyl-glucose or glucosyl-fructose linkage, because absorption of kojibiose, nigerose, maltose, isomaltose, turanose, sucrose, and melezitose, in addition to that of trehalose, was increased. Absorption of β-linked or of galactose-containing disaccharides was not increased. The constitutive and induced trehalose-absorbing systems differ in their activity, specificity, lability to acid treatment, effects of substrate concentration, and pH optima. Both systems require oxygen, and no marked differential effects of inhibitors were observed. The activity of the induced system is proportional to log turanose concentration (from about 1 to 300 μg/ml), and is an approximate linear function of time of exposure (from about 1 to 50 min). Accumulation of trehalose occurred against a concentration gradient in both systems but particularly in the induced. No leakage was observed. The activity of the induced system declined slowly upon removal of the inducer. Accumulated trehalose is metabolized after activation by azide as are the endogenous trehalose reserves. The accumulated trehalose appears to enter the endogenous trehalose pool found in these spores, although some data suggest it may be more accessible. Respiratory data indicate that absorbed trehalose is available for metabolism while in transit from the external membrane to the internal pool...|$|E
40|$|URL] audienceThe paper {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that led to}} the current crisis of copyright law in the digital environment (understood as its inability to regulate social dynamics as regards the production, dissemination and access to creative works) by applying the concept of law as an autopoietic system. It analyses how the copyright regime (a subsystem of the legal system) evolved over time, by scrutinizing the interdependencies between copyright law and the other <b>constitutive</b> <b>systems</b> of its environment: the creative system (concerned with the creation, reproduction, distribution, and access to creative works) the political system (comprising both the State and the Church), the economic system (ruled by right holders and intermediaries on the market for creative works), and the technological system. It will be shown that every new development in the technological system irritated the remaining systems, thereby stimulating the evolution of the overall ecosystem. For a long time, copyright law managed to properly adjust to the environmental changes brought by technological developments, so as to successfully regulate the production, dissemination and access to creative works. It is only with the advent of Internet and digital technologies that copyright law's selective response to environmental stimuli resulted in its failure to adapt to the new reality and, consequently, in the loss of its regulative power. Reacting mostly to the pressures of the economic and political systems (i. e. the lobbying of right holders and intermediaries), while neglecting the needs of the creative system, and even failing to adjust to the specificities of the changing technological system, copyright law eventually disrupted the balance of the surrounding environment. Furthering the economic interests of intermediaries (often {{at the expense of the}} public and in certain cases of the authors) created a series of divergences between legal norms - increasingly restricting the access, use and reuse of creative works - and social norms (produced within the creative system, and supported by the new opportunities of digital technologies), which advocate for the free use and reuse of digital works. Over the years, copyright law distanciated itself so much from the social reality in which it operates that it has lost most of its credibility and applicability in the digital world.

40|$|ABSTRACT Analysis of K {{transport}} mutants {{indicates the}} existence of four separate K uptake systems in Escherichia coli K- 12. A high affinity system called Kdp has a Km of 2 p. M, and Vmax at 37 °C of 150 /zmol/g min. This system is repressed by growth in high concentrations of K. Two <b>constitutive</b> <b>systems,</b> TrkA and TrkD, have K,,'s of 1. 5 and 0. 5 mM and Vm~x's of 550 and 40 at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. Mutants lacking {{all three of these}} saturable systems take up K slowly by a process, called TrkF, whose rate of transport is linearly dependent on K concentration up to 105 raM. On the whole, each of these systems appears to function as an independent path for K uptake since the kinetics of uptake when two are present is the sum of each operating alone. This is not true for strains having both the TrkD and Kdp systems, where presence of the latter results in K uptake which saturates at a K concentration well below 0. 1 mM. This result indicates some interaction between these systems so that uptake now has the affinity characteristic of the Kdp system. All transport systems are able to extrude Na during K uptake. The measurements of cell Na suggest that growing cells ofE. coli have very low concentrations of Na...|$|R
40|$|Freshly harvested, nongrowing {{mycelium}} of Neocosmospora vasinfecta E. F. Smith rapidly absorbed exogenous glucose but converted {{a greater}} proportion to trehalose and glucan than to respiratory CO 2. This effect was accentuated in mycelium preincubated for 3. 5 hours in water before exposure to glucose. Glucose was absorbed via two uptake <b>systems,</b> both apparently <b>constitutive,</b> with apparent Km values for glucose of 0. 02 mm (high affinity) and 2 mm (low affinity). The glucose derivative 3 -O-methylglucose (3 -O-MG) was also absorbed by two apparently <b>constitutive</b> <b>systems</b> with apparent Km values for 3 -O-MG of 0. 065 mm and 1. 9 mm. Absorption of 3 -O-MG by both freshly harvested and preincubated mycelium led to its accumulation. Freshly harvested mycelium lost accumulated 3 -O-MG rapidly to water, whereas preincubated mycelium showed reduced or no leakage. The reduction in leakage due to preincubation was prevented by 5 μg/ml cycloheximide in the preincubation medium. Glucose competitively inhibited 3 -O-MG uptake via the high affinity system and induced loss of previously accumulated 3 -O-MG from preincubated mycelium. The uptake of both glucose and 3 -O-MG {{was associated with a}} transient alkalinization of the uptake medium. It is concluded that uptake of both glucose and 3 -O-MG by at least the high affinity system is energy-linked and probably mediated by proton cotransport...|$|R
