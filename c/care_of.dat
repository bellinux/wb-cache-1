40|$|Systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{should be}} defined {{in a manner that}} {{includes}} primary care. The current definition <b>of</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> shares several attributes with the definition of primary care: both are defined as community-based services that are accessible, accountable, comprehensive, coordinated, culturally competent, and family focused. However, systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> is defined as serving only children and youth with serious emotional disturbance and their families and does not fully embrace the concept of primary prevention. Although similarities in the definitions <b>of</b> primary <b>care</b> and systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> may provide a theoretical foundation for including primary care within the systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> framework, a definition <b>of</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>care</b> that incorporates the idea of prevention and takes into account the broad population served in primary care would provide communities with a definition {{that can be used to}} further the work <b>of</b> integrating primary <b>care</b> into systems <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> System <b>of</b> <b>care</b> Primary care Collaboration Integration Child mental health services...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, the system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{philosophy}} has comprised a central strategy of service reform in children's mental {{health at the}} federal, state, tribal, and local levels. System <b>of</b> <b>care</b> terminology has become widely used in many different service sectors but often without a shared understanding of what a system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> is. This manuscript, the feature article for this special issue of Evaluation and Program Planning, briefly traces {{the history of the}} system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> movement, discusses the more widely used definitions in the field of children's mental health, and offers an expanded version of the definition that takes into account the complex nature <b>of</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> This manuscript was the product of a process used by the Case Studies of System Implementation research team to identify established system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> communities for inclusion in the research study. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the process the research team engaged in while developing the revised definition and to open a public dialogue about how to characterize the essential properties of a system <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> System <b>of</b> <b>care</b> System <b>of</b> <b>care</b> definition Values and principles Children's mental health...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} definition <b>of</b> system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{was developed}} 20 years ago largely {{in response to}} the fragmented services experienced by children with serious emotional disorders and their families, who, typically, were involved in multiple systems and/or receiving services from different providers. Over time, in response to national funders' pursuing system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for different populations and their own experience, states, tribes and localities have applied system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> principles, values and operational characteristics to other populations (children and adults). The definition offered by Hodges et al., has an unintended effect of constraining the properties (and potential) <b>of</b> system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in its limitation to a single population. This paper argues that the adaptations made to the original Stroul and Friedman definition in the training curriculum Building Systems of Care: A Primer adequately encompass properties that reflect state, tribal and local implementation experience and are specific to planning, implementing and evaluating a system <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> without limiting system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> to any one population.
