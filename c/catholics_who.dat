5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|The Christians were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested {{the death penalty for}} those <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> helped the British, because it was a fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned the Christians, rather than killing them.|$|E
5|$|Two {{groups were}} excluded. Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Pope would not be tolerated. They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E

5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} Goan <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> {{migrated}} to South Canara between 1560 and 1763, {{throughout the course}} of the Goa Inquisition, Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars, and the Portuguese–Maratha wars. They learned the languages of South Canara, Tulu, and Kannada, but retained Konkani as their mother tongue and preserved their lifestyle. Their 15-year captivity at Seringapatam imposed by Tipu Sultan, the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, from 24 February 1784 to 4 May 1799 led to the near extinction of the community. After Tipu's defeat and subsequent killing by the British in 1799, the community resettled in South Canara, and later prospered under British rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> already had considerable freedom {{to practice in}} private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E

5|$|The most {{commonly}} observed faith in Lethbridge is Christianity. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, 52,595residents, representing 65percent of respondents, {{indicated they were}} Christian, down from 76% in 2001. Over 32percent of Lethbridgians reported no religious affiliation, a substantial increase from 22% in 2001. The number of residents reporting other religions, including Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Sikhs amounted to 3percent. For specific denominations, Statistics Canada reported 16,945Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> were 21percent of the population, and 7,335members of the United Church of Canada who were about 9percent of the population.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether Hugh Devore, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E
5|$|By 1686, Seringapatam, {{capital of}} the Kingdom of Mysore, was home to a {{community}} of more than 400 <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> were severely harassed in the following two decades when their churches were destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. This destruction was undertaken {{in the name of}} the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I by his finance minister. The priest's house was eventually returned to the church in 1709. Sometime between 1700 and 1717, another church was built in Rampura, a suburb of Seringapatam, in the face of local opposition. During the period of Chikka Devaraja (1673–1704), 400 priests who protested against high taxes were executed; as per a legend, they were strangled by the wrestlers of his court. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when an anti-Christian purge led to the expulsion of the resident priest who was thereafter forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian demonstrations followed, but by 1736 relations had once more improved between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, about {{eighty percent}} of Sri Lankan Tamils were Hindus who {{followed}} the Shaiva sect. The rest were mostly Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>who</b> converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also {{a small minority of}} Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission. Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu. Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations. The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|In Gampaha District, Tamils have {{historically}} inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, {{there was a}} substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century. Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam. There are also Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman <b>Catholics,</b> <b>who</b> have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri. Some residents of these two districts, especially the traditional fishermen, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating fishing communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.|$|E
5|$|Native Christians include East Indian <b>Catholics,</b> <b>who</b> were {{converted}} by the Portuguese during the 16th century, while Goan and Mangalorean Catholics also constitute {{a significant portion}} of the Christian community of the city. Jews settled in Bombay during the 18th century. The Bene Israeli Jewish community of Bombay, who migrated from the Konkan villages, south of Bombay, are believed to be the descendants of the Jews of Israel who were shipwrecked off the Konkan coast, probably in the year 175 BCE, during the reign of the Greek ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Mumbai is also home to the largest population of Parsi Zoroastrians in the world, numbering about 60,000 though with a sharply declining population. Parsis migrated to India from Pars (Persia/Iran) following the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The oldest Muslim communities in Mumbai include the Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, and Konkani Muslims.|$|E
