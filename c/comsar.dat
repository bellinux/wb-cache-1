The concept was launched when maritime authorities from seven nations requested the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee to add {{the development of an}} e-navigation strategy to the work programs of the IMO's NAV and <b>COMSAR</b> sub-committees. Working groups in three sub-committees (NAV, <b>COMSAR</b> and STW) and an intersessional correspondence group, led by Norway, has subsequently developed a Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP). Member states of IMO and a number of Intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations have contributed to the work, including the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), Comité International Radio-Maritime (CIRM),the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ...|$|E
50|$|The IMO {{entrusted}} Norway and the Norwegian Coastal Administration {{to coordinate}} the work of developing a proposal for an e-navigation strategy implementation plan. Three sub-committees within the IMO - NAV, <b>COMSAR</b> and STW - established working groups on e-navigation; each group was chaired by John Erik Hagen of the Norwegian Coastal Administration. Further, a correspondence group overseen by the Norwegian Coastal Administration had an ongoing role in gathering input from national maritime administrations to proposals and decisions related {{to the process of}} establishing an e-navigation Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP).|$|E
50|$|It was {{therefore}} proposed {{to add a}} new item on e-navigation to the work programme of the Sub-Committee on Safety of Navigation (NAV) and also to that on Radiocommunications and Search and Rescue (<b>COMSAR).</b> The aim {{was to develop a}} strategic vision for the utilization of existing and new navigational tools, in particular electronic tools, in a holistic and systematic manner. e-navigation can thereby help reduce navigational accidents, errors and failures by developing standards for an accurate and cost-effective system that would make a major contribution to the IMO’s agenda of safe, secure and efficient shipping on clean oceans.|$|E
