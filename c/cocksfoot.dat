5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing <b>cocksfoot.</b> When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch.

His prime area of experimentation was on the selective breeding for sheep. The most common sheep in the area was the Norfolk Horn, which was long-legged and slow to mature. Coke became a promoter of the English Leicester, a breed noted as fast-maturing and excellent when fed turnips. Coke cross-bred the two, with the resulting sheep being highly tame and superior to the pure Norfolk breed. Coke also bred cattle and used oxen for ploughing rather than horse, being the first to use them harnessed rather than yoked and winning a prize for his oxen in 1837.|$|E

50|$|One {{method for}} {{improving}} nitrogen utilisation by ruminants and reduce greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O), without altering their nitrogen and energy value, {{is to use}} forages that contain condensed tannins, such as sainfoin. The nutritive value of sainfoin, despite its lower nitrogen content than lucerne, is high. Future research, on the nutritional impact of condensed tannins is likely not only be based on condensed tannin content, but also include structure-activity considerations.The results obtained, with sheep at maintenance fed a diet containing only sainfoin will be tested with producing animals, for example growing sheep and cattle, lactating ewes, goats or cows. In producing animals the diet will comprise different forage sources and supplement feeds. Sainfoin is seldom used as a pure crop and is generally introduced in pasture in a grass-legume mix with <b>cocksfoot</b> (Dactylis), ryegrass (Lolium) or with other legumes such as red clover, white clover or lucerne. Results have shown {{the choice of the}} variety is important. A variety like Esparcette, characterised by the highest condensed tannin content, may provide beneficial effects with a lower proportion in a mixture with other legumes. Preserving legumes, as silage, {{is a good way to}} provide an on-farm source of home-grown energy and protein, offers advantages over traditional haymaking, being less weather-dependent, and allows a high quality of forage during the harvesting period. In particular, wrapped silage bales of sainfoin have great potential in animal nutrition and can be used by farmers, as found that condensed tannin effects were not reduced by this mode of preservation.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} a fertile Walcanui silt loam in 1991 / 92 to examine the productivity of 4 perennial pasture grass species, Grasslands Roa tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), Grasslands Marsden hybrid tyegrass (Lolium perenne x Lolium hybridum), Grasslands Maru phalaris (Phalaris aquatica), Grasslands Wana <b>cocksfoot</b> (Dactylis glomerata), and 2 binary mixtures, tall fescue plus <b>cocksfoot</b> and phalaris plus <b>cocksfoot.</b> Between July 1991 and September 1992 the highest production came from phalaris plus <b>cocksfoot</b> at 19. 05 t DM/ha. Hybrid ryegrass, phalaris, tall fescue plus <b>cocksfoot,</b> <b>cocksfoot,</b> and tall fescue produced 17. 44, 17. 13, 16. 96, 14. 17, and 13. 13 t DM/ha respectively. The botanical composition of both mixtures averaged equal proportions of the sown species. The proportion of <b>cocksfoot</b> increased over the summer period then declined for the following autumn/winter period. The experiment shows that simple pasture grass mixtures may be highly productive. These findings support the increasing farmer practice of sowing some pasture grasses in simple mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen {{content in}} plant biomass yield of {{subterranean}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and <b>cocksfoot</b> (Dactylis glomerata L.) was determined {{as related to}} the different concentrations of nitrogen supply. Plants were grown sole and in mixture as symbiotrophic or heterotrophic cultures under controlled mineral elements concentration {{in the media and}} inoculation with rhyzobial strain. Two concentrations of inorganic nitrogen were tested: 0. 125 mM (N 1) and 1. 25 mM (N 2). Experimental variants: subterranean clover (100 %) + N 1; subterranean clover (100 %) + N 2; <b>cocksfoot</b> (100 %) + N 1; <b>cocksfoot</b> (100 %) + N 2; subterranean clover + <b>cocksfoot</b> (50 : 50 %) + N 1; subterranean clover + <b>cocksfoot</b> (50 : 50 %) + N 2. Inorganic nitrogen concentration had greater effect on shoot yield nitrogen content than on root yield nitrogen content for both crops. Nitrogen content in whole plant biomass yield of subterranean clover grown either sole or in mixture with <b>cocksfoot</b> was almost three times greater under high nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen use efficiency was highest in the mixture...|$|E
40|$|Grazing is {{the most}} common way of using a hill and {{mountain}} areas because of their specific agro-ecological conditions. <b>Cocksfoot</b> is a grass with high productivity and quality, and it is very good for sowing in the sward for grazing. Because of its good adaptability to different growing conditions, especially in very dry and cold areas, it is excellent in relation to some other good grasses, which can not be raised in such areas. The aim of the experiment was to determine effect of N application (0 -N 0 and 150 kg ha- 1 year- 1 -N 150) and rotational grazing by cattle (C) and sheep (S), and their interaction on the <b>cocksfoot</b> sown in a mixture of smooth-stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in hill mountain areas. In a three-year average, the application of 150 kg ha- 1 N had significant impact on <b>cocksfoot</b> population density (number of tillers m- 2), and it was 51. 4 % higher than the recorded one before grazing (P< 0. 05) and 42. 2 % higher after grazing (P< 0. 01) in comparison to N 0. The application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in significantly higher <b>cocksfoot</b> dry matter (DM) yield for 38. 6 % (P< 0. 01) and 15. 3 % higher <b>cocksfoot</b> share in the total mixture in relation to N 0 (P< 0. 01). Grazing management and grazing management interaction with N rate did not significantly affect the population density of individual years. However, in the three-year average, grazing management significantly affected <b>cocksfoot</b> DM (P< 0. 01) and its percentage in the total DM mixture (P< 0. 01). Cattle grazing resulted in 9. 9 % higher <b>cocksfoot</b> DM yield and 15. 2 % higher <b>cocksfoot</b> percentage in pasture. Interaction of grazing management and N-level had significant influence on the percentage of <b>cocksfoot</b> DM in grass-clover mixture. On cattle grazed areas fertilized with 150 kg ha- 1 N, the percentage of <b>cocksfoot</b> DM was the highest (74. 07 %), while the lowest percentage of <b>cocksfoot</b> DM was recorded on the sheep grazed areas without N (55. 12 %) ...|$|E
