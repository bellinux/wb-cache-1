40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to test the {{effectiveness}} of Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) technique in detecting specific molecular markers to genetically discriminate some species of teleost fish. As model species, we used four Mediterranean sea bream species (i. e. Diplodus annularis, D. puntazzo, D. sargus sargus, and D. vulgaris), and the <b>common</b> Mediterranean <b>dentex</b> Dentex dentex. Furthermore, the occurrence in our samples of two partially albino sparids (suspected, on a morphological basis, to probably belong to D. sargus sargus and to D. dentex, respectively) allowed ISSRs to be tested on doubtful specimens. Eight ISSR primers produced 95 out of 97 scorable polymorphic loci with a large number (63) of species-private bands. Maximum parsimony analysis, ΔK statistics, and assignment test were consistent in separating the five species and solving the taxonomic position of specimens of dubious attribution. The results obtained evidence the usefulness of ISSR markers in specimen and species identification, particularly when the morphological traits of fish make the classification problematic...|$|R

Overfishing is a recognised problem—450 species of fish live in the Adriatic Sea, including 120 species threatened by excessive commercial fishing, a problem exacerbated by pollution and global warming. Overexploited species include <b>common</b> <b>dentex,</b> red scorpionfish, monkfish, John Dory, blue shark, spiny dogfish, mullet, red mullet, Norway lobster, as well as European hake, and sardines. Turtles and common bottlenose dolphins are also being killed by fishing nets. The depleted fish stock, and Croatia's Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) contributed to accusations of overfishing exchanged between Italian and Croatian fishermen. ZERP was introduced in 2003, but its application to EU member states was suspended in 2004. The depleted stocks of fish are being addressed through a new proposed EU fisheries policy that was scheduled to take effect in 2013, when Croatia acceded to the EU, and restore the stocks to sustainable levels by 2015.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> Dentex dentex (Linnaeus, 1758) is {{an iconic}} marine coastal {{fish in the}} Mediterranean Sea. It is a {{demersal}} sparid fish (0 – 200 m), that grows to a maximum length of 100 cm and a weight of 13 kg, with a relatively long life span (more than 20 years). As a high trophic level predator, it holds a key position in coastal marine food webs. The <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> is of great economic importance for both artisanal (small-scale coastal fisheries) and recreational fishing. Despite its economic and ecological importance, scientific data on this species in its natural environment are still very scant.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the stock structure of the <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> at relatively fine spatial scale around Corsica Island, using a combination of markers that have different spatial and temporal scales of integration: microsatellite DNA markers, otolith shape analysis and parasites communities. Microsatellite analysis indicated that there was no significant genetic differentiation in D. dentex between the four sampling sites around Corsica. Otolith shape analysis suggests one potential distinct population unit of D. dentex centered in one site (Cap Corse) varying in their degree of differentiation from those in the other zones. Multivariate analysis on parasite abundance data highlights to a lower extent two sites (Bonifacio and Galeria) with some connectivity between adjacent zones. The combination of these three markers together highlights the resulting three sites while giving complementary insights and an opportunity to compare their utility and potential to understand population interactions.

Nine isonitrogenous (43 %) and isoenergetic (22 MJ kg− 1) diets were formulated combining three types, pregelatinized starch (PS), dextrin (Dx) andmaltodextrin (Mx), and three levels (12, 18 and 24 %) of carbohydrates. Growth performancewas not significantly influenced by treatments. The best feed utilizationwas observed in 18 % Mx group. Higher hepatic lipid content was found in fish fed lower dietary carbohydrate levels. PS induced higher liver and white muscle hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities compared to the lower values observed for Mx. Malic enzyme and glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase in liver and white muscle were lower in Mx group.

SOD and CAT were not affected. GPX in liver and white muscle and GR in liver increased at higher inclusion carbohydrates levels. The lowest levels of GR and G 6 PDH in both tissues and LPO in liverwere observed in maltodextrin groups. No significant effects by carbohydrate sourcewere observed in liver PO and white muscle LPO.

A series of rearing experiments were conducted {{in order to determine}} biological traits important for the evaluation of this potential aquaculture candidate. In juveniles (2. 5 - 50 g), growth rates were found to be exceptionally high compared to other aquaculture species and food conversion very efficient (FC#approx# 1, based on food dry matter). Results wre attained under ambient conditions (Temperature: #approx# 25 C, Salinity: 40 - 42 ppt). Feeding consisted of moist diets (35 % H_ 2 O) with high energy (22 - 24 MJ/kg) and high protein (51 - 53 %) content. Feeding exclusively commercial dry pellets (isocaloric to the moist diet), resulted in significantly reduced growth rates, reduced food conversion efficiencies, increased mortalities due to agonistic behaviour and an increased disease susceptibility. The poor performance of test specimens fed dry diets compared to those fed self - prepared most diets was not explained by the different moisture content of the test diets (8 - 10 % vs 35 - 50 %). <b>Common</b> <b>dentex</b> reach marketable size (300 - 500 g) within 14 - 18 months after hatching under favourable ambient conditions (South Aegean Sea), while feeding self - prepared moist diets.

The study analyzes 9 morphometric characters (total length, standard length, fork length, pre- and post anal length, head length, body height, mouth opening, eye diameter) and describes their allometric development in juvenile and adult dentex (n= 69 - 463). The occurrence of abnormalities was monitored and described during all rearing periods. Seven types of skeletal deformations and one abnormal scale development were identified.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} mucosal surfaces, and in {{particular}} the fish skin and its secreted mucus, has been of great interest recently among immunologists. Measurement of the viscosity and other physico-chemical parameters (protein concentration, pH, conductivity, redox potential, osmolality and density) of the skin mucus can help to understand its biological functions. We have used five marine species of teleost: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa L.), <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> (Dentex dentex L.) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus L.), all of them with commercial interest in the aquaculture of the Mediterranean area. Mucus showed a direct shear- and temperaturedependent viscosity, with a non-Newtonian behavior, which differed however between two groups: one with higher viscosity (D. labrax, U. cirrosa, D. dentex) and the other with lower viscosity (S. aurata, E. marginatus). In addition, there was a clear interrelation between density and osmolality, as well as between density and temperature. Taking into account that high values of viscosity should improve the barrier effect against pathogens but low values of viscosity are needed for good locomotion characteristics, our results may help elucidate the relationship between physico-chemical and biological parameters of skin mucus, and disease susceptibility.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>dentex</b> Dentex dentex is {{an iconic}} {{endangered}} {{species in the}} Mediterranean where is a sought after target species for small-scale, recreational and spearfishing fisheries. The reproductive biology of D. dentex in the natural environment is poorly known; therefore the reproductive strategy of the species was assessed by combining reproductive traits with the growth characteristics (estimated from length-at-age data), the size/age of sexual maturity and the energetic dynamics. A total of 358 wild fish were sampled on Mallorca Island (W Mediterranean) from March 1996 to June 1999 with a 19 to 84. 7 cm total length (LT) range. The sex ratio was skewed towards females (1. 361) albeit the length composition was not different between sexes (p = 0. 551). Three young immature individuals (< 28 cm LT, 0. 8 % individuals) were rudimentary hermaphrodites supporting the late gonochoristic species classification. The age composition determined from sagitta otolith interpretation ranged from 0 to 26 years (yr). Concerning growth, between sex differences in von Bertalanffy parameters were not relevant, even after accounting for potential between-year differences. The most noticeable difference was found for L∞ (64. 7 cm for females versus 61. 6 for males) but even in this case, the bayesian credibility interval of between-sex differences included zero.  Maturity ogives at size and age showed that females achieved 50 % maturity at 34. 9 cm LT and 3. 3 years, while males did at 33. 8 cm LT and 2. 5 years. The onset of gonad developing phase took place in December, while it progresses until April. The spawning peak was in April and May for both sexes. A generalized linear model showed that female size didn’t affect significantly the spawning season, whilst {{there was a strong}} seasonality in the spawning. Most of the evidences showed that fecundity is likely determinate, with an asynchronous oocyte development before spawning and a clear ovarian bimodal organization after the onset of spawning. Female weight explained 84 % of the observed variance for fecundity. The gonadosomatic, hepatosomatic and condition indexes varied significantly with the reproductive season for females and only the gonadosomatic index for males. Storage in muscle seemed to be the primary source of energy for reproduction, although liver appeared to play a short-term role in egg production, suggesting a combination of capital and income breeding. The results indicate that the life history strategy of <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> possess consist on maturing well before reaching maximum size, investing in growth after maturation, and therefore the reproductive effort is distributed through a longer lifespan and related with the size attained after maturation. At present no management measures are directed to D. dentex; given its life history strategy we suggest that a slot limit should be implemented, i. e. a minimum and a maximum landing size, with a minimum size of 35 cm. The upper threshold, to protect the higher reproductive potential of older and larger fish, should still be defined...|$|E

Bacterial isolates (n= 433) from healthy and moribund fish and their environments were identified by biochemical methods; 75 % of them were identified as Gram-negative (mainly Vibrio spp.) and 25 % as Gram-positive. Vibrio scophthalmi and other Vibrio species were recovered from moribund fish samples. Some bacteria were recovered from diseased fish reared in hatcheries, introduced mainly from sea water. Among anaerobic bacteria, Eubacterium tarantellae was recovered from larval gut flora while Clostridium botulinum was recovered from juvenile gut flora. TEM also showed that bacterial endocytosis first occurs when fish are fed granulated dry feeds and becomes more prevalent in the juvenile stages when many bacteria are present in the microvilli. TEM also revealed that the bacteria enter the larvae via the mouth and gills before the granulated feeding stage, after which they begin to penetrate the gut and finally also contaminate the marine rearing stage. The results of this study showed that the granulated feeding stage is critical for pathogen invasion in <b>common</b> <b>dentex...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} reports total mercury (THg) and {{methylmercury}} (MeHg) concentrations in 32 different lean fish species from the Western Mediterranean Sea, {{with a special}} focus on the Balearic Islands. The concentrations of THg ranged between 0. 05 mg/kg ww and 3. 1 mg/kg ww (mean 0. 41 mg/kg ww). A considerable number {{of the most frequently}} fish species consumed by the Spanish population exceed the maximum levels proposed by the European legislation when they originate from the Mediterranean Sea, such as dusky grouper (100 % of the examined specimens), <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> (65 %), conger (45 %), common sole (38 %), hake (26 %) and angler (15 %), among others. The estimated weekly intakes (EWI) in children (7 - 12 years of age) and adults from the Spanish population (2. 7 µg/kg bw and 2. 1 µg/kg bw, respectively) for population only consuming Mediterranean fish were below the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of THg established by EFSA in 2012, 4 µg/kg bw. However, the equivalent estimations for methylmercury, involving PTWI of 1. 3 µg/kg bw, were two times higher in children and above 50 % in adults. For hake, sole, angler and dusky grouper, the most frequently consumed fish, the estimated weekly intakes in both children and adults were below the maximum levels accepted. These intakes correspond to maximum potential estimations because fish from non-Mediterranean origin is often consumed by the Spanish population including the one from the Balearic Islands...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{skin mucus}} {{contains}} several immune substances {{that provide the}} first line of defence against a broad spectrum of pathogens although they are poorly studied to date. Terminal carbohydrate composition and levels of total IgM antibodies, several immune-related enzymes (lysozyme, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases) as well as the bactericidal activity (against fish pathogenic Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae and non-pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Shewanella putrefaciens) were identified and measured in the skin mucus of five marine teleosts: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa), <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> (Dentex dentex) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus). First, lectin binding results suggests that skin mucus contain, in order of abundance, N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and fucose residues. Second, results showed that while some immune activities were very similar in the studied fish (e. g. IgM and lysozyme activity) other such as protease, antiprotease, alkaline phosphatase, esterase and peroxidase activities varied depending on the fish species. High levels of peroxidase and protease activity were found in U. cirrosa respect to the values obtained in the other species while E. marginatus and S. aurata showed the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and esterase activities, respectively. Moreover, skin mucus of S. aurata revealed higher bactericidal activity against pathogenic bacteria, contrarily, to what happened with non-pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, B. subtilis). Thus, study of the variations in the carbohydrate profile and immune-related components of the fish skin mucus could help to understand the fish resistance as well as the presence and distribution of pathogens and magnitude of infections, aspects that are of major importance for the aquaculture industry.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> Dentex dentex is {{an iconic}} {{endangered}} {{species in the}} Mediterranean, where it is a target species that is sought after for small-scale, recreational and spearfishing fisheries. The reproductive biology of D. dentex in the natural environ¬ment is poorly known; therefore, the reproductive strategy of the species was assessed {{through a combination of}} reproductive traits and growth characteristics (estimated from length-at-age data), the size/age of sexual maturity and the energetic dynamics. A total of 358 wild fish, ranging in total length (LT) from 19 to 84. 7 cm, was sampled at Mallorca Island (Western Mediterranean) from March 1996 to June 1999. The sex ratio was skewed towards females (1. 361); however, the length composition was not different between sexes (p = 0. 551). Three young immature individuals (< 28 cm LT, 0. 8 % individuals) were rudimentary hermaphrodites, offering support for classification as a late gonochoristic species. The age composition, determined based on the sagittal otolith, ranged from 0 to 26 years (yr). The von Bertalanffy growth function did not differ between sexes (F = 2. 58, p = 0. 762) : L∞ = 76. 581 cm, K = 0. 127 yr- 1, t 0 = - 2. 335 in a combined function. The maturity ogives for size and age showed that females achieved 50 % maturity at 34. 922 cm LT and 3. 3 yr, and males, at 33. 812 cm LT and 2. 5 yrs. The onset of annual ripening took place in December, whereas vitellogenesis occurred from February to April. The spawning peak was in April and May for both males and females. A generalised linear model (GLM) showed that female size did not significantly affect the spawning season, whilst the seasonal component affected both the onset and end of spawning (GLM, p < 0. 005). The gonadosomatic index (IG), hepatosomatic index (IH) and relative condition index (KR) varied significantly with the reproductive season for females, and IG varied for males. The microscopic observation of the gonads showed that fecundity is likely determinate, with an asynchronous oocyte development before spawning and a clear ovarian bimodal organization after the onset of spawning. The oocyte density variance of 85 % was explained by the oocyte diameter, which also offered support for the trait of determinate fecundity. Female weight explained 84 % of the observed variance for fecundity. Liver storage seemed to be the primary source of energy for maturity, which suggests a combination of capital and income breeding. The results suggested a reproductive strategy of type A, with balanced trade-offs be¬tween survival, growth and reproduction. At present, no management measures are being directed to D. dentex; herein, we suggest a minimum landing size of 35 cm LT to ensure a higher proportion of larger fish to preserve the stockVersión del editor 0, 568...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{movement}} {{is a key}} biological process {{for the maintenance of}} ecosystem services, and a major concern for the conservation of biodiversity. The aim of movement ecology is to understand the causes and consequences of these movements, including the effect of internal and external factors and its ecological implications. This research field has rapidly grown in the last decades fostered by recent technological and analytical developments, and is making substantial contributions to conservation biology, such as allowing the incorporation of the spatial and temporal scales of movements into management policies to enhance their scope and efficiency. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the most used tools to face the effects of anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. They {{play a major role in}} restoring and conserving overfished fish populations, and also potentially enhancing fisheries yield in adjacent areas through the direct spillover of juvenile and adult individuals. However, in order to be effective and generate such benefits, MPAs must be designed according to the movement attributes of targeted species, but this information is still rarely available, specially in temperate regions. In the last decades, passive acoustic telemetry techniques have demonstrated to be a valuable tool to study the movements and behavior of fishes covering large spatial and temporal scales, but the acoustic nature of the signals and the large amounts of data that they provide entail a series of challenges for their analysis and interpretation. The main objective of this thesis is to characterize the movement ecology of coastal fishes in relation to MPAs. This constitutes a basic information on the biology of species, which is required to understand changes in populations and ecosystems driven by natural or human induced impacts, as well as to correctly evaluate the outcomes of management actions. Specifically, the movements of two species, the white seabream (Diplodus sargus) and the <b>common</b> <b>dentex</b> (Dentex dentex), were monitored using acoustic telemetry in the Medes Islands MPA (Catalonia, NW Mediterranean Sea). Both species play important ecological and economical roles, shaping the structure and functioning of biological communities through top-down controls, and being an important resource for local artisanal and recreational fisheries. Nevertheless, they present a contrasting biology (omnivorous vs. predator), and therefore, different conservation needs. Firstly, we characterized the general movement attributes of the two species, including their habitat requirements and space use and activity patterns, within zones with different protection levels of the MPA. Secondly, we studied the behavioral responses of the two species to environmental fluctuations, by adding environmental information (seawater temperature and wave height) to movement analysis. These behavioral responses provide essential information on the ecology of the species such as their resistance to perturbations. Thirdly, we characterized their movement behavior during the spawning season, describing, for the first time, the formation of spawning aggregations for both species. Finally, this thesis also has an important computational and numerical component. A special effort has been done to adapt and develop new methods to visualize and analyze acoustic telemetry data, specially to improve the space use estimations by incorporating the vertical dimension, in order to provide a more comprehensive view of complex movement patterns. By studying the movement ecology of these species, we provide general mechanistic insights to understand the effects of protection on coastal fish species, as well as to predict future changes in their populations derived from climate change. We specially highlight the importance of studying the movement ecology of diverse species in order to propose integrative and more efficient management actions. Las áreas marinas protegidas (AMPs), son las herramientas de gestión más utilizadas para contrarrestar los impactos antropogénicos sobre los ecosistemas marinos y juegan un papel fundamental en la protección y restauración de las poblaciones de peces afectadas por la sobrepesca. Sin embargo, para ser efectivas y generar los beneficios que se esperan de ellas, las AMPs deben ser diseñadas en concordancia con los atributos de los movimientos de las especies de peces que se pretenden proteger, pero esta información no suele estar disponible. El principal objetivo de esta tesis es caracterizar, mediante técnicas de telemetría acústica, la ecología del movimiento de especies de peces costeros en relación a AMPs, mediante el estudio del movimiento de dos especies: el sargo común (Diplodus sargus) y el dentón (Dentex dentex), en la reserva marina de las islas Medas (Catalunya, Mediterráneo NO). Específicamente, se han caracterizado los patrones de movimiento y actividad generales de las dos especies, la presencia de respuestas comportamentales a fluctuaciones ambientales (temperatura y oleaje), y su comportamiento reproductor. Además, se ha hecho un esfuerzo especial en adaptar y desarrollar nuevas técnicas de análisis y visualización para datos de telemetría acústica, con el objetivo de mejorar las estimaciones del uso del espacio, incorporando la dimensión vertical, y de proporcionar una visión más exhaustiva de los complejos patrones de movimiento. Toda esta información es de gran aplicabilidad para la gestión de estas y otras especies costeras, así como para entender los cambios en las poblaciones y en los ecosistemas derivados del cambio global...|$|E
