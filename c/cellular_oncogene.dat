40|$|Pharmacologic {{elevation}} of cyclic AMP (cAMP) promotes growth arrest and differentiation {{in a variety}} of transformed mammalian cells, including the HL- 60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. However, mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Because cellular oncogenes play a pivotal role in regulating proliferation and differentiation, we examined whether cAMP-promoted differentiation of HL- 60 was preceded by a decrease in the expression of c-myc, a <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene</b> both amplified and constitutively expressed in HL- 60. We find that cyclic AMP elevation in HL- 60 caused by three different pharmacologic regimens is followed by an abrupt, greater than 90 % decrease in steady state c-myc mRNA levels within 3 h, well before detectable changes in proliferation and differentiation. This decrease, which occurs despite protein synthetic blockade, is attributable to transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc and is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure near c-myc promoter sites. Our findings establish that cAMP, a ubiquitous intracellular regulatory messenger previously known only to enhance gene transcriptional activity in higher eukaryotic cells, can also suppress transcription of a <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene,</b> thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for cAMP-promoted differentiation...|$|E

Another plasma cell malignancy, multiple myeloma (MM), arising spontaneously in the ageing C 57 BL/KaLwRij mice, was investigated in order to see whether the MM cells contain c-myc abnormalities of the MPC or RIC type. Rearrangement of the c-myc oncogene was found in the bone marrow cells only in 5 T 2 MM transplantation line in a mouse of the 24 th generation and in none of the seven other MM of the 5 T series which were of earlier generations. Since the mouse 5 T MM resembles the human MM very closely, including the absence of consistent structural c-myc oncogene abnormalities, it can serve as a useful experimental model for studies on the aetiopathogenesis of this disease.

40|$|Abstract: Oral {{cancer is}} the {{cancerous}} tissue growth located in the oral cavity. It may arise as a primary lesion originating {{in any of the}} oral tissues, by metastasis from a distant site of origin, or by extension from a neighboring anatomic struc-ture, such as the nasal cavity or the maxillary sinus. Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with about 75 percent of oral cancer cases. Alcohol use is another high-risk activity associated with oral cancer. Infection with human papillo-mavirus (HPV), particularly type 16 (there are over 120 types), is a known risk factor and independent causative factor for oral cancer. Oncogenes, gain-of-function mutations of highly regulated normal cellular counterparts (proto-oncogenes), are likely involved in the initiation and progression of oral neoplasia. <b>Cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> were initially discovered by the ability of tumor cell DNA to induce transformation in gene transfer assays. Mechanisms of activation of these <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> include point mutations and DNA re-arrangements. Several of these <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are homologs of retroviral oncogenes (e. g., the ras genes); others are new oncogenes. Tumor suppressor genes or anti-oncogenes have been documented to confer potent negative regulatory controls which are lost due to chromosomal alterations during tumor formation.
