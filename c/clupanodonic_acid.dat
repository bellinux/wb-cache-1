The chirality of these hydroxyl residues {{has not yet}} been defined (other structural details of the RvDn-3DPA are given at Specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins).

50|$|Maresin 1 (MaR1 or 7R,14S-dihydroxy-4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) is a macrophage-derived {{mediator}} of inflammation resolution coined from macrophage mediator {{in resolving}} inflammation. Maresin 1, {{and more recently}} defined maresins, are 12-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites of the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), that possess potent anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, protective, and pro-healing properties similar {{to a variety of}} other members of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) class of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites. SPM are dihydroxy, trihydroxy, and epoxy-hydroxy metabolites of long chain PUFA made by certain dioxygenase enzymes viz., cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. In addition to the maresins, this class of mediators includes: the 15-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX15 and/or possibly ALOX15B)-derived Lipoxin A4 and B4 metabolites of the omega 6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid; the cyclooxygenase 2-derived Resolvin E series metabolites of the omega 3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid; certain 15-lipoxygenase-derived Resolvin D series metabolites of DHA; certain other 15-lipoxygenase-derived protectin D1 and related metabolites of DHA; and the more recently defined and therefore less fully studied 15-lipoxygenase-derived Resolvin Dn-3DPA metabolites of the omega-3 fatty acid n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (n-3 DPA or <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid),</b> the cyclooxygenase 2-derived Resolvin T metabolites of this <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the 15-lipoxygenase-derived products of the N-acetylated fatty acid amide of the DHA metabolite, docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (see resolvins).|$|E
50|$|Resolvins (Rvs) {{fall into}} several sub-classes {{based on the}} {{straight}} chain PUFA from which they are formed and/or a unique aspect of their structure. The Resolvin Ds (RvDs) are metabolites of the 22-carbon PUFA, DHA (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid); the resolvin Es (RvEs) are metabolites of the 20-carbon PUFA, EPA (i.e. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin Dn-6DPA (RvDsn-6DPA) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, osbond acid (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin Dn-3DPA (RvDn-3DPA) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid</b> (i.e. 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid); and the resolvin Ts (RvTs) are metabolites of <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid</b> that, in contrast to (RvDsn-3DPA (all of which possess a 17S-hydroxyl residue), possess a 17R-hydroxyl residue. Certain isomers of RvDs are termed aspirin-triggered resolvin Ds (AT-RvDs) because their synthesis is initiated by a drug-modified COX2 enzyme to form 17(R)-hydroxyl rather than 17(S)-hydroxyl residue of the ReVEs; however, an as yet unidentified cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) may also forms this 17(R)-hydroxy intermediate and thereby contribute {{to the production of}} AT-RvEs. All of the cited resolvins except the RvDsn-6DPAs are metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids; it is proposed that the metabolism of dietary omega-3 fatty acids to these resolvins is an important mechanism by which these diets may ameliorate diverse inflammatory reactions and inflammation-based diseases.|$|E
5000|$|T series resolvins {{are very}} {{recently}} described resolvins. In the model system {{used to identify}} them, human platelets pretreated with aspirin or atorvastatin metabolize the omega-3 DPA, <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid</b> (DPAn-3 [...] ) by aspirin-treated or atorvastatin-treated COX2 to a 13S-hydroperoxy intermediate (aspirin and atorvastatin change the activity of COX2 from a cyclooxygenase to an hydroxyperoxidase-forming enzyme. The intermediate is then passed to nearby human neutrophils which metabolize it, probably by ALOX5 enzyme activity, to four poly-hydroxyl metabolites: RvT1 (7,13R,20-trihydroxy-DPAn-3); RvT2 (7,8,13R-trihydroxy-DPAn-3); RvT3 (7,12,13R-trihydroxy-8Z,10E,14E,16Z,19Z-DPAn-3) and RvT4 (7,13R-dihydroxy-DPAn-3). The chirality of the 13 hydroxyl residue is assumed but not yet formally proven; the chirality of the other hydroxyl residues {{has not yet been}} determined. Subsequent studies found that these four RvT's are also formed by mixtures of human neutrophils and vascular endothelium cells and, additionally, are detected in the infected tissues of rodents and humans.|$|E
50|$|Resolvins are {{autacoids}} of {{a specific}} lipid structure: dihydroxy or trihydroxy metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) but also the docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid.</b> They are members of an expanding class of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites termed specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). Other SPMs include the lipoxins, protectin D1 and its related products, and the maresins. SPMs are locally formed and locally acting cell signaling autacoids: they are made by cells and act upon their parent or nearby cells to coordinate functional responses. SPMs possess potent anti-inflammation, tissue protection, and tissue healing activities in diverse animal models and accordingly are proposed {{to be involved in}} resolving physiological inflammatory responses. Their failure to form in adequate amounts is also proposed to underlie a broad range of human diseases involving pathological inflammation. Metabolically stable analogs of the SPMs, including the resolvins, are in development and being tested in volunteers with chronic inflammation-related diseases.|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{essential fatty}} acid (EFA) status of neonates born after normal and hypertensive pregnancies (PIH) and that of their mothers was assessed by measuring the fatty acid composition of phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE) of umbilical cord serum and maternal serum, respectively. Relative contents of linoleic acid of serum PL and CE were significantly lower in mothers with PIH compared to normal pregnancies. Most other (n- 6) polyenes in PL tended to be higher under hypertensive conditions. Total maternal (n- 3) polyenes of serum PL were significantly higher in PIH, mainly due to <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid,</b> 22 : 5 (n- 3), and cervonic acid, 22 : 6 (n- 3). Total maternal (n- 7) and (n- 9) fatty acids were also significantly higher in PIH (PL and CE). The results indicate that PIH {{is associated with a}} relative increased unsaturation of maternal serum PL, which might facilitate the placental transfer of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids. As a result, the neonatal EFA status after PIH only slightly differs from normal...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Fatty acid {{metabolism}} {{is involved}} in the immune response and inflammation processes in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Fatty acid changes may be relevant to the clinical course of the disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the qualitative and quantitative fat intake and fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue in a defined population of CD patients with those in matched controls. METHODS: Dietary fat intake and fatty acid profile of plasma phospholipids and adipose tissue were assessed in two patient populations: 20 patients with recently diagnosed CD and 32 patients with longstanding (> 10 yr) CD clinically in remission, matched for age and gender with healthy controls. RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in quantitative or qualitative fat intake between CD patients and controls. Percentages of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in plasma phospholipids or adipose tissue were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, we observed a significantly (p < 0. 05) lower percentage of the sum of the n- 3 fatty acids, with significantly (p < 0. 01) higher levels of <b>clupanodonic</b> <b>acid</b> (22 : 5 n- 3) and significantly (p < 0. 05) lower levels of docosahexaenoic (22 : 6 n- 3) and arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6). The aberrant fatty acid profile was more evident in patients with longstanding CD than in patients with recently diagnosed CD. CONCLUSION: The aberrant fatty acid profile found in these CD patients is a result of altered metabolism rather than of essential fatty acid malabsorption. The reported findings may be important in the pathophysiology of CD and hence in the choice of fatty acids to be used when therapeutic supplementation is considered in CD patients...|$|E
