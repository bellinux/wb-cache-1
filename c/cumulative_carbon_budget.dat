40|$|The {{cumulative}} impact {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emissions on climate has potentially profound economic and policy implications. It implies that the long-term climate change mitigation challenge should be reframed as a stock problem, while {{the overwhelming majority of}} climate policies continue to focus on the flow of CO 2 into the atmosphere in 2030 or 2050. An obstacle, however, to the use of a <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> in policy is uncertainty in the size of this budget consistent with any specific temperature-based goal such as limiting warming to 2 °C. This arises from uncertainty in the climate response to CO 2 emissions, which is relatively tractable, and uncertainty in future warming due to non-CO 2 drivers, which is less so. We argue these uncertainties are best addressed through policies that recognize the need to reduce net global CO 2 emissions to zero to stabilize global temperatures but adapt automatically to evolving climate change. Adaptive policies would fit well within the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at level that will avoid dangerous climate impacts. However, greenhouse gas concentration stabilization is an awkward {{framework within which}} to assess dangerous climate change {{on account of the}} significant lag between a given concentration level, and the eventual equilibrium temperature change. By contrast, recent research has shown that global temperature change can be well described by a given cumulative carbon emissions budget. Here, we propose that cumulative carbon emissions represent an alternate framework that is applicable both as a tool for climate mitigation {{as well as for the}} assessment of potential climate impacts. We show first that both atmospheric CO 2 concentration at a given year and the associated temperature change are generally associated with a unique cumulative carbon emissions budget that is largely independent of the emissions scenario. The rate of global temperature change can therefore be related to first order to the rate of increase of cumulative carbon emissions. However, transient warming over the next century will also be strongly affected by emissions of shorter lived forcing agents such as aerosols and methane. Non-CO 2 emissions therefore contribute to uncertainty in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> associated with near-term temperature targets, and may suggest the need for a mitigation approach that considers separately short- and long-lived gas emissions. By contrast, long-term temperature change remains primarily associated with total cumulative carbon emissions due to the much longer atmospheric residence time of CO 2 relative to other major climate forcing agents...|$|E
40|$|Humanity faces {{three large}} {{challenges}} {{over the coming}} decades: urbanisation and industrialisation in developing countries at unprecedented levels; concurrently, we need to mitigate against dangerous climate change {{and we need to}} consider fi nite global boundaries regarding resource depletion. Responses to these challenges as well as models that inform strategies are fragmented. The current mainstream framework for measuring and modelling climate change mitigation focuses on the fl ows of energy and emissions and is insuffi cient for simultaneously addressing the material and infrastructure needs of development. The models’ inability to adequately represent the multiple interactions between infrastructure stocks, materials, energy and emissions results in notable limitations. They are inadequate: (1) to identify physically realistic (mass balance consistent) mitigation pathways, (2) to anticipate potentially relevant co-benefi ts and risks and thus (3) to identify the most effective strategies for linking targets for climate change mitigation with goals for sustainable development, including poverty eradication, infrastructure investment and mitigation of resource depletion. This chapter demonstrates that a metabolic approach has the potential to address urbanisation and infrastructure development and energy use and climate change, as well as resource use, and therefore to provide a framework for integrating climate change mitigation and sustainable development from a physical perspective. Metabolic approaches can represent the cross-sector coupling between material and energy use and waste (emissions) and also stocks in the anthroposphere (including fi xed assets, public and private infrastructure). Stocks moderate the supply of services such as shelter, communication, mobility, health and safety and employment opportunities. The development of anthropogenic stocks defi nes boundary conditions for industrial activity over time. By 2050 there will be an additional three billion urban dwellers, almost all of them in developing countries. If they are to receive the level of services converging on those currently experienced in developed nations, this will entail a massive investment in infrastructure and substantial quantities of steel, concrete and aluminium (materials that account for nearly half of industrial emissions). This scenario is confronted by the legacy of existing infrastructure and the limit of a <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> within which we could restrain global temperature rise to < 2 °C. A metabolic framework incorporating stock dynamics can make an explicit connection between the timing of infrastructure growth or replacement and the material and energy needs of that investment. Moreover, it provides guidance on the technical and systemic options for climate mitigation concurrent with a future of intense urban development and industrialisation© The Author(s) 201...|$|E
40|$|Human {{economies and}} {{ecosystems}} form a coupled system coevolving {{in time and}} space, since human economies use ecosystems services {{and at the same}} time affect ecosystems through their production and consumption activities. The study of the interactions between human economies and ecosystems is fundamental for the efficient use of natural resources and the protection of the environment. This necessitates the development and use of models capable of tracing the main interactions, links and feedbacks. In developing this chapter, our objective was to focus on a segment of rapidly developing literature on coupled ecological/economic models with an emphasis on climate change. The advantage of this approach is that it introduces the reader to a very important current research topic, but it also allows, by using climate as the reference ecosystem, the exploration of new modeling approaches which are relevant and useful for the modeling of other types of coupled ecological/economic systems. These include modeling of deep structural uncertainty by using robust control methods, exploring modeling through <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>budgeting,</b> studying spatial transport phenomena and spatial aspects in economic/ecological modelling...|$|R
40|$|China's {{growing demand}} for energy - and its {{dependence}} on coal - has seen its carbon emissions increase more than 50 % since 2000. Within the debate about mitigating global climate change, there is mounting pressure for emerging economies like China to take more responsibility for reducing their carbon emissions within a post- 2012 international climate change policy framework. For China, this leads to fundamental questions about how feasible {{it is for the}} country to shift away from its recent carbon intensive pattern of growth. This paper presents some general results of scenarios that have been developed to investigate how China might continue to develop within a <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>budget.</b> The results show how changes in the key sectors of the Chinese economy could enable China to follow four different low carbon development pathways, each of which complies with a cumulative emissions constraint. Each scenario reflects different priorities for governmental decision making, infrastructure investments and social preferences. Having compared the key features of each scenario, the paper concludes with some implications for Chinese government policy.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{climate change}} and those aspects of global warming that are required to understand the rationale behind the setting of emissions targets. We then review recent evidence that indicates that immediate and substantial action {{needs to be taken}} globally to cut emissions of carbon dioxide in order to keep its atmospheric concentration at a ‘safe’ level. This limit implies a range of <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emissions <b>budgets</b> for the UK from now until 2050. We adopt a figure {{at the low end of}} the range to derive a comparable budget for Winchester, UK. Given Winchester’s consumption emissions of 1. 52 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2004, we calculate an emissions pathway until 2050 consistent with this budget. This suggests annual reductions of 6. 7 % are required. Our methodology can be applied to other local authority areas provided relevant statistics are available...|$|R
40|$|While Eric A. Posner and David Weisbach {{advocate}} {{that climate}} change and poverty be tackled separately, the realiZaion that only a single <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>budget</b> is available to accommodate all nations through all centuries of the current millennium shows why efforts to confront these two challenges are inextricably linked Once carbon dioxide from fossil fuels reaches the atmosphere, most molecules remain for several centuries. Therefore, most additions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere are effectively net additions to a rapidly swelling total accumulation. Total <b>cumulative</b> atmospheric <b>carbon</b> correlates strongly with maximum surface temperature. It is, consequently, urgent to cease pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so the use of fossil fuels by anyone must rapidly be reduced to near Zero. All viable methods for reducing the burning of fossil fuel depend on raising its price, through either permit trading or taxes. Raising the price of fossil fuel will drive many additional poor people into 2 ̆ 2 energy poverty, 2 ̆ 2 making vital energy unaffordable for them. We can avoid being responsible for radical increases in poverty only if our efforts to make carbon fuels more expensive are accompanied by vigorous efforts to make non-carbon fuels less expensive. Feasible mechanisms to lower non-carbon prices while raising carbon prices are available now, and the US ought to cease its opposition to them. We can thereby exit the carbon era soon enough with far less human suffering...|$|R
40|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{estimate}} the <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions that would keep global warming to below a given temperature limit. Here we review estimates reported by the IPCC and the recent literature, and discuss the reasons underlying their differences. The most scientifically robust number — the <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> for CO 2 -induced warming only — is also the least relevant for real-world policy. Including all greenhouse gases and using methods based on scenarios that avoid instead of exceed a given temperature limit results in lower <b>carbon</b> <b>budgets.</b> For a > 66 % chance of limiting warming below the internationally agreed temperature limit of 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels, the most appropriate <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> estimate is 590 – 1, 240 GtCO 2 from 2015 onwards. Variations within this range depend on the probability of staying below 2 °C and on end-of-century non-CO 2 warming. Current CO 2 emissions are about 40 GtCO 2 yr− 1, and global CO 2 emissions thus have to be reduced urgently to keep within a 2 °C-compatible budget...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{estimates}} of the global <b>carbon</b> <b>budget,</b> or allowable <b>cumulative</b> CO 2 emissions consistent with a given level of climate warming, {{have the potential to}} inform climate mitigation policy discussions aimed at maintaining global temperatures below 2 °C. This raises difficult questions, however, about how best to share this <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> amongst nations in a way that both respects the need for a finite cap on total allowable emissions, and also addresses the fundamental disparities amongst nations with respect to their historical and potential future emissions. Here we show how the contraction and convergence (C&C) framework {{can be applied to the}} division of a global <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> among nations, in a manner that both maintains total emissions below a level consistent with 2 °C, and also adheres to the principle of attaining equal per capita CO 2 emissions within the coming decades. We show further that historical differences in responsibility for climate warming can be quantified via a <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> debt (or credit), which represents the amount by which a given country's historical emissions have exceeded (or fallen short of) the emissions that would have been consistent with their share of world population over time. This carbon debt/credit calculation enhances the potential utility of C&C, therefore providing a simple method to frame national climate mitigation targets in a way that both accounts for historical responsibility, and also respects the principle of international equity in determining future emissions allowances...|$|R
40|$|Climate model {{experiments}} {{reveal that}} transient {{global warming is}} nearly proportional to <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. However, it is not quantitatively understood how this near-linear dependence between warming and <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions arises in transient climate simulations. Here, we present a theoretically derived equation of the dependence of global warming on <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions over time. For an atmosphere–ocean system, our analysis identifies a surface warming response to <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions of 1. 5 ± 0. 7 K for every 1, 000 Pg of carbon emitted. This surface warming response is reduced by typically 10 – 20 % {{by the end of}} the century and beyond. The climate response remains nearly constant on multi-decadal to centennial timescales as a result of partially opposing effects of oceanic uptake of heat and carbon. The resulting warming then becomes proportional to <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions after many centuries, as noted earlier 9. When we incorporate estimates of terrestrial carbon uptake, the surface warming response is reduced to 1. 1 ± 0. 5 K for every 1, 000 Pg of carbon emitted, but this modification is unlikely to significantly affect how the climate response changes over time. We suggest that our theoretical framework may be used to diagnose the global warming response in climate models and mechanistically understand the differences between their projections...|$|R
40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>budgets,</b> which {{define the}} total {{allowable}} CO 2 emissions {{associated with a}} given global climate target, are a useful way of framing the climate mitigation challenge. In this paper, we review the geophysical basis {{for the idea of}} a <b>carbon</b> <b>budget,</b> showing how this concept emerges from a linear climate response to cumulative CO 2 emissions. We then discuss the difference between a “CO 2 -only carbon budget” associated with a given level of CO 2 -induced warming and an “effective carbon budget” associated with a given level of warming caused by all human emissions. We present estimates for the CO 2 -only and effective <b>carbon</b> <b>budgets</b> for 1. 5 and 2 °C, based on both model simulations and updated observational data. Finally, we discuss the key contributors to uncertainty in <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> estimates and suggest some implications of this uncertainty for decision-making. Based on the analysis presented here, we argue that while the CO 2 -only <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> is a robust upper bound on allowable emissions for a given climate target, the size of the effective <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> is dependent on the how quickly we are able to mitigate non-CO 2 greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. This suggests that climate mitigation efforts could benefit from being responsive to a changing effective <b>carbon</b> <b>budget</b> over time, as well as to potential new information that could narrow uncertainty associated with the climate response to CO 2 emissions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> “supply curves” {{for global}} forests utilizing an dynamic timber supply model for sequestration of forest carbon. Because {{the period of}} concern is the next century, and particular time points within that century, the curves are not traditional Marshallian supply curves or steady-state supply curves. Rather, {{the focus is on}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> cost curves (quasi-supply curves) at various points in time over the next 100 years. The research estimates a number of long-term, <b>cumulative,</b> <b>carbon</b> quasi-supply curves under different price scenarios and for different time periods. The curves trace out the relationship between an intertemporal price path for carbon, as given by carbon shadow prices, and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> sequestered from the initiation of the shadow prices, set at 2000, to a selected future year (2010, 2050, 2100). The timber supply model demonstrates that <b>cumulative</b> <b>carbon</b> quasi-supply curves that can be generated through forestry significantly depend on initial carbon prices and expectations regarding the time profile of future carbon prices. Furthermore, long-run quasi-supply curves generated from a constant price will have somewhat different characteristics from quasi-supply curves generated with an expectation of rising carbon prices through time. The “least-cost” curves vary the time periods under consideration and the time profile of carbon prices. The quasi-supply curves suggest that a policy of gradually increasing carbon prices will generate the least costly supply curves in the shorter periods of a decade or so. Over longer periods of time, however, such as 50 or 100 years, these advantages appear to dissipate. carbon supply curves, sequestration, timber, forests, model, global warming, prices, markets...|$|R
