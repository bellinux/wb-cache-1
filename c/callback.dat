5|$|The Rocky Horror Picture Show {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} other feature films and television series over the years. Episodes of The Simpsons, The Venture Bros., The Boondocks, Glee, The Drew Carey Show, That '70s Show, and American Dad! spotlight Rocky Horror, as well as films like Vice Squad, Halloween II (2009), and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. The 1980 film Fame featured the audience reciting their <b>callback</b> lines to the screen and dancing the Time Warp, the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a novelty dance at parties.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client {{to be a part of}} the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a <b>callback</b> read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

5000|$|Seinfeld, a show {{built around}} {{stand-up}} comedy, {{was one of}} the first sitcoms to regularly use <b>callbacks</b> in its scripts, although on a level which would often be missed or disregarded by viewers; its use of the strategy commonly kept the <b>callbacks</b> confined to events in the same episodes, having the effect of bringing the episode full-circle or creating an ironic twist ending. A more recent series, 30 Rock, employs <b>callbacks</b> to reference fictitious movies and television programs created within the show. Arrested Development became well known by fans for its regular use of <b>callbacks</b> throughout all of its episodes.|$|R

5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a <b>callback.</b> Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E

25|$|Although incarceration {{in general}} {{has a huge}} effect on employment, the effects become even more {{pronounced}} when looking at race. Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of <b>callback</b> compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back {{at a rate of}} 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a <b>callback</b> for white men by 50%, it decreases the <b>callback</b> chances for black men by 64%.|$|E

At each casting call, Mark and Read identified comics to participate in <b>callback</b> auditions in front of live audiences. Mark and Read then selected a predetermined number of comics from each <b>callback,</b> who {{were invited to participate}} in a semifinal qualifying round.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} Arizona State University study were {{somewhat}} different from Pager’s study, {{but the main}} finding was expected: Incarceration decreased the chances of getting employed. For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most amount of callbacks, roughly 40%. Hispanic women followed up with a 34% <b>callback</b> rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record {{were less likely to}} receive a <b>callback</b> compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and Hispanic women with a community college degree applying online.|$|E

25|$|One {{source of}} {{evidence}} for hiring discrimination against openly gay men comes from a field experiment that sent two fictitious but realistic resumes to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar {{in terms of the}} applicant's qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance of being called for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The <b>callback</b> gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample – Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant <b>callback</b> gaps.|$|E
