5|$|From Howard northward, {{the freeway}} runs through {{suburban}} Brown County to Suamico, parallel {{to a line}} of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS), through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. There are frontage roads {{on both sides of}} the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US41/US141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and Abrams in Oconto County. At Abrams, US141 splits from US41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the Oconto River in Stiles south of the interchange with WIS22. The freeway bypasses Lena to the east and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US141 continues to the Marinette County communities of <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Pound as an expressway. Through <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Pound there is also a Business US141. Past the latter town, US141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.|$|E

5|$|Coghill met Powderfinger when he {{attended}} {{one of their}} practice sessions and joked with the band, introducing himself as a drummer. Two years later, when Steven Bishop left the band, guitarist Ian Haug recognised Coghill at an audition, and signed him at that point. Previously, Coghill had been rejected in an audition for Custard. Jon spent about six months playing alongside Scott <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band, Gland, before committing full-time to Powderfinger in early 1992. In December 1997, Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with Regurgitator.

5|$|In Somerset, NY148 {{remains a}} two-lane roadway, passing through sparsely {{developed}} areas {{on its way}} to the village of Barker. In the southern part of the community, the route meets <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> West Somerset roads (CR2 and CR3, respectively). Through Barker, NY148 is a two-lane residential street, passing west of Barker Free Library and east of Barker High School. After Haight Road, NY148 leaves the village, continuing north through a lightly populated area. At Arlington Road, the number of homes along NY148 rises once again as the route enters the hamlet of Somerset, located at the junction of NY148 and NY18 (Lake Road). This junction serves as the northern terminus of NY148, while CR15 continues north through Somerset towards Lake Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E

Glyn Pardoe missed {{training}} on Monday 21st with a leg injury, but after the fitness of Pardoe, Tony <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Alan Oakes was tested in a practice match, all three were passed fit. Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on the Thursday, staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final. However, in a practice match against Brentford, Sjoberg {{had to leave the}} field with a groin injury. His place in the team was taken by Alan Woollett.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{executives}} {{balked at}} Hitchcock's proposal {{and refused to}} provide his usual budget. In response, Hitchcock offered to film Psycho quickly and inexpensively {{in black and white}} using his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Shamley Productions executive Joan Harrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} this decline was the club's ongoing {{financial}} problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then {{on the outskirts of}} urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By {{the end of the decade}} the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.|$|E

5|$|Victor {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin for business, and he {{eventually}} formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises.

25|$|Three days later, on July 20, <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Brown {{were arrested}} in Evanston. As <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Brown walked westward across an intersection, they passed {{immediately}} {{in front of a}} man in a car stopped at the red light who was from Coleman's neighborhood in Waukegan. He recognized <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> drove north to a gas station and notified the police. A description of the two was broadcast to police. As officers entered the area, a detective saw <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Brown sitting on portable bleachers in empty Mason Park, but noted they were wearing different T-shirts. As the detective reported this, two sergeants who were driving by the park heard this, turned, and saw <b>Coleman</b> <b>and</b> Brown. As they approached Coleman, the officers observed Brown walking away from Coleman toward the rear of the park. The detective joined the two sergeants and Coleman was approached for questioning; he had no identification and denied he was Alton Coleman. Meanwhile, two other officers stopped Brown as she tried to exit the park, searched her, and found a gun in her purse. The pair were taken into custody without incident and transported to the Evanston Police Department, where both were identified by their fingerprints.|$|E
