40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} an unprecedented explo-sion in transistor densities. Diminutive feature sizes have en-abled microprocessor designers to break the billion-transistors per <b>chip</b> <b>mark.</b> However various new reliability challenges such as Process Variation (PV) have emerged that {{can no longer be}} ignored by chip designers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of PV on the microprocessor’s Issue Queue. Varia-tions can slow down issue queue entries and result in as much as 20. 5 % performance degradation. To counter this, we look at different solutions that include Instruction Steering, Operand- and Port- switching mechanisms. Given that PV is non-deterministic at design-time, our mechanisms allow the fast and slow issue-queue entries to co-exist in turn enabling in-struction dispatch, issue and forwarding to proceed with mini-mal stalls. Evaluation on a detailed simulation environment in-dicates that the proposed mechanisms can reduce performance degradation due to PV to a low 1. 3 %...|$|R

40|$|We have {{introduced}} the histone variant H 3. 3 into chicken erythroid cell lines and examined its {{distribution in the}} neighborhood of the folate receptor (FR) and β-globin genes by using high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (<b>ChIP).</b> <b>Marked</b> incorporation of tagged H 3. 3 into the FR gene is confined to its upstream regulatory region and is observed whether or not the gene is transcriptionally active. Incorporation is also observed over locus control regulatory elements in the absence of transcription of genes regulated by these elements, suggesting that gene activity per se is not necessarily required to replace H 3 with H 3. 3. Other active genes display various behaviors, either incorporating H 3. 3 over both the coding region and upstream regulatory region or over upstream sequences only. There is, however, no straightforward correlation between sites of H 3. 3 incorporation and regions of enrichment in H 3 acetylation and lysine- 4 methylation. In the case of FR and VEGF-D, in which incorporation is confined to upstream regions, the presence of exogenous H 3 results in reduced expression, whereas H 3. 3 stimulates expression. This finding suggests that these histone variants can be active rather than passive participants in regulation of expression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{internally}} coded time-hopping optical code-division multiple-access (TH/OCDMA) {{scheme for}} fiber-optic communication systems is proposed, and its multiple-access performance is evaluated using optical orthogonal codes (OOCs). In the proposed method, {{the duration of}} each bit is divided into x � frames, each one containing v chips. Two signature codes, namely, one pseudonoise (PN) sequence and one OOC, are assigned to each user. During each bit interval, based on the output of an channel encoder and the user’s dedicated PN sequence, one of the x � frames is selected, in which ‡ pulses are transmitted in ‡ <b>chips,</b> <b>marked</b> by the user’s OOC. We consider three detectors at the receiver front end, namely, correlation, soft chip-level, and hard chip-level detectors. We evaluate the multiple-access performance of the system for each detector considering the effects of shot noise, dark current, and thermal noise. We compare the results with those obtained for the conventional OCDMA systems. Our numerical results indicate that, for the same bit rate and bandwidth, our proposed method substantially outperforms the conventional OCDMA system. Our results also show that the soft chip-level detector outperforms the other detection techniques in all cases considered. Index Terms—Chip-level receiver, correlation receiver, error-correcting codes (ECCs), fiber-optic code-division multiple access (CDMA), optical orthogonal codes (OOCs), superorthogonal codes (SOCs).

40|$|The {{machining}} parameters affect {{surface quality}} and usually, wood planing process is {{heavily influenced by}} external parameters. External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or down milling). This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, torn grain and <b>chip</b> <b>marks</b> often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 m min - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 m min - 1 for Dark Red Meranti. While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 m min - 1 of feed speed. This research also revealed {{that the combination of}} feed rate, depth of cut and wood species used had no significant effect on the surface quality of samples...|$|R
