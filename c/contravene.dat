5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not <b>contravene</b> Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from a system in which all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{continues}} {{to have a significant}} impact in English law, as its precedents serve to provide a definition of obscenity that is used in other legal contexts. For instance, anything deemed likely to <b>contravene</b> the Act is prohibited from videos awarded an R18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. A list of the categories of material most commonly prosecuted under the Act is published by the Crown Prosecution Service.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to <b>contravene</b> {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{an offence}} to attempt to commit an offence under Part III; to assist someone that one knows or has {{reasonable}} cause to believe has committed an offence to prevent, hinder or interfere with that person's arrest, trial or punishment; or generally to <b>contravene</b> or fail to comply with any provision of Part III or any order made, direction given or requirement imposed under Part III, or to abet any contravention or failure by another person.|$|E
5|$|Judicial: India has {{a unitary}} three-tier {{independent}} judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, {{headed by the}} Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, {{and a large number}} of trial courts. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts. It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which <b>contravene</b> the constitution, as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean citizens, {{government}} and non-governmental organisations may display or fly the national flag {{throughout the year}} to identify themselves with the nation, and especially encouraged to do so during occasions of national celebration or national significance. Non-Singaporean businesses and organisations are also allowed to display the flag throughout the year. The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules made under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act. It is an offence to knowingly <b>contravene</b> specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty is a fine not exceeding S$1,000.|$|E

5|$|The pay dispute {{split the}} unit. About two thirds went on strike, {{saying they would}} not return to action unless the Army upped their wages and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, {{some of the more}} {{contented}} Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge—the Army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment, saying this would <b>contravene</b> Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries—the disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which <b>contravene</b> constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E

25|$|The {{names of}} all nine mothers {{mentioned}} above in Völuspá hin skamma appear elsewhere as the names of female jötnar (generally in the þulur). Adding to the confusion, Orchard points out, Gjálp and Greip are otherwise mentioned as jötunn maidens who seek to <b>contravene</b> the god Thor from reaching their father, and Járnsaxa is otherwise the mother of Thor's son, Magni.|$|E
25|$|The second, {{and older}} {{hallmark}} of the employment contract is that employees are bound to follow their employers’ instructions while at work, so long as that does not <b>contravene</b> statute or their agreed terms. Every employment relation leaves the employer with a residue of discretion, historically expressed as the ‘master-servant’ relationship. Today, in practice, this leaves the employer {{with the ability to}} vary the way work is done in accordance with business need. The courts have allowed this to continue, so long as it does not contradict a contract’s express terms, which always require an employee’s consent, or renegotiation of a collective agreement. The status of ‘flexibility clauses’, purporting to allow employers the discretion to vary any contract term has been contested, as it will often enable abuse of power that the common law controls. The limits of the courts’ tolerance for such practices are evident if they touch procedures for accessing justice, or potentially if they would <b>contravene</b> the duty of mutual trust and confidence.|$|E
