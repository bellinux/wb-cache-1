The bridge was completed three days early on June 13, 1888, at 3p.m. At the time of its opening, the Arthur Kill Bridge was the largest drawbridge ever constructed in the world. There were no fatalities in the construction of the bridge. On January 1, 1890, the first train operated from Saint George Terminal to Cranford Junction. Once the Arthur Kill Bridge was completed, pressure was brought upon the United States War Department by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad to have the newly built bridge torn down and replaced with a bridge with a different design, claiming that it was an obstruction for the navigation of the large numbers of coal barges past Holland Hook on the Arthur Kill.

40|$|Introduction This {{communication}} {{describes a}} mechanism for controlling the pipeline occupancy of an asynchronous processor, aiming to produce a power adaptive processor using only micro-architectural modifications.

If there is enough power to run the processor in its full capacity and the task being executed has hard <b>completion</b> <b>deadlines,</b> {{there is nothing to}} do. But if the available power is relatively low, the processor should work as fast as it can with the power it has. Alternatively in an operating environment where the processor has plenty of slack time, the execution can be slowed down, by reducing the supply voltage or the switching activity to save more power than what could be achieved by just slowing it down. Dynamic voltage scaling [Fle 00],[BPSB 00] is a suitable candidate for this work, but it su#ers from very slow transition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A deadline-aware {{scheduling}} {{scheme for}} the λ grid system is proposed {{to support a}} huge computer grid system based on an advanced photonic network technology. The assignment of wavelengths to jobs in order to efficiently carry various services is critical in λ grid networks. Such services have different requirements such as the job <b>completion</b> <b>deadlines</b> and wavelength assignment must consider the job deadlines. The conventional job scheduling approach assigns a lot of time-slots to a call within a short period in order {{to finish the job}} as quickly as possible. This raises the blocking probability of short deadline calls. Our proposal assigns wavelengths in λ grid networks so as to meet QoS (Quality of Service) guarantees. The proposed scheme assigns time-slots to a call over time according to its deadline, which allows it to increase the system performance in handling short deadline calls, for example, lowering their blocking probability. Computer simulations show that the proposed scheme can reduce the blocking probability by a factor of 100 compared with the conventional scheme under the low load condition in which the ratio of long deadline calls is high. The proposed scheduling scheme can realize more efficient λ grid networks. I...|$|R
