Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Dyson sphere {{originated}} in fiction, {{and it is}} a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> has appeared often in science fiction since then.

5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> eludes precise categorization or definition, {{and this}} has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is {{that there may be}} some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author regards {{learning}} as {{the phenomenon of}} knowledge acquisition {{in the absence of}} explicit programming. The author gives a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of <b>concepts</b> <b>that</b> can be learned using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. Although inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits on the range of <b>concepts</b> <b>that</b> can be learned, the author shows that there are some important nontrivial classes of propositional <b>concepts</b> <b>that</b> can be learned in a realistic sens...|$|R

5|$|A {{limited edition}} retail {{version of the}} PC game was {{released}} in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a Super Meat Boy comic. In 2012 Team Meat began prototyping an iOS and Android version of the game. The game {{is intended to be}} a different take on the Super Meat Boy <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. Later Team Meat released two images of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.|$|E
5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> requires changing the wing profile {{for a given}} phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E

5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E

Thomas developed the rotating red bucket sign, was an early advocate of the take-out <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> Harman had pioneered, and introduced a bookkeeping form that Sanders rolled out across the entire KFC chain. Thomas sold his shares in 1968 for US$1 million (around US$7 million in 2013), and became regional manager for all KFC restaurants east of the Mississippi before founding Wendy's in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{graduated}} from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine.
