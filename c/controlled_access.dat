40|$|Commodity {{software}} components are intrinsically untrustworthy. It is highly insecure {{to use them}} directly in mission critical systems. Part of the insecurity {{can be attributed to}} the common-used but flawed mechanisms for discretionary <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> which is coarsegrained and based on user's privileges. Many alternative mechanisms have been investigated to provide mandatory <b>access</b> <b>control</b> that is fine-grained and specific to individual {{software components}}. A predominate approach to this end is to classify processes into domains and roles, and to configure <b>access</b> <b>control</b> accordingly. However, this approach has limited applications in practice due to inconvenience in its manual procedure for <b>access</b> <b>control</b> configuration. This position paper introduces a new approach to address the limitation. Our approach differentiates static from dynamic <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies such that only a small amount of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies needs to be configured statically, and that a large amount of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies can be configured dynamically through automatic composition. The differentiation and composition together allow flexible and convenient management of <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> even when it is mandatory and is configured with a highly fine granularity.

5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E

5|$|In 907, the Khitan {{chieftain}} Abaoji {{succeeded in}} getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north, laying the foundations to what would officially become the Liao dynasty. In 936, the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang, which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923. The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border region known as the Sixteen Prefectures in return. With the Sixteen Prefectures, the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> to the plains of northern China, including the main Great Wall line.|$|E

40|$|As the {{development}} of computer science and smart health-care technology, there is a trend for patients to enjoy medical care at home. Taking enormous users in the Smart Health-care System into consideration, <b>access</b> <b>control</b> is an important issue. Traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models, discretionary <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> mandatory <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> and role-based <b>access</b> <b>control,</b> do not properly reflect the characteristics of Smart Health-care System.

The task-role-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (T-RBAC) model introduces a task concept, dividing tasks into four categories. It also supports supervision role hierarchy. T-RBAC is a proper <b>access</b> <b>control</b> model for Smart Health-care System, and it improves the management of access rights.

5|$|On March 8, 1846, after a final {{attempt to}} {{pressure}} Mexico {{to settle on}} a boundary for Texas, Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor to move his army, which included May's dragoon squadron, to the Rio Grande. Taylor's destination was the river's north bank, directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros, which stood at a natural choke-point and <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> to well-traveled routes to the south. When Taylor refused to leave the region, Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25, 1846, which officially commenced hostilities. On May 8, 1846, the two main forces met at the Battle of Palo Alto, where May's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge.|$|E

5|$|Neville {{was named}} Lord Chancellor of England on 17 May 1226. The {{appointment}} {{was made by}} the great council during the minority of King Henry III, and Neville obtained a grant of the office for life. Unlike Hubert de Burgh, who lost his offices when Henry III attained his majority and took control of the government, Neville remained chancellor with only slight disagreements until 1238, although a confirmation of the lifetime nature of his tenure was made in 1232. Under Neville, the first signs that the chancery was becoming a department of the government, rather than just a royal department {{that was part of the}} royal household, began to emerge. The contemporary writer Matthew Paris praised Neville for his actions as chancellor, claiming that he treated all equally and was transparent in discharging his duties, which was important, as the chancellor's office <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> to the king. Neville oversaw a number of changes in chancery procedures, splitting off the liberate rolls from the letters close in 1226 and reviving the keeping of the Charter Rolls in 1227. He also issued writs on his own authority, the so-called writs de cursu. Neville received a number of gifts and privileges from the king while chancellor, including the right of exemption from the seizure of his possessions by any royal or other secular official. The king also agreed not to interfere with the execution of Neville's last will and testament.|$|E

After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other {{destinations}} {{on the east side of}} the lake, the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill.
