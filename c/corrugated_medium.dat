5000|$|Corrugated {{fiberboard}} sometimes {{known as}} corrugated board or corrugated cardboard, is a combined paper-based material {{consisting of a}} fluted <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> {{and one or two}} flat liner boards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> and {{linerboard}} board {{both are}} made of kraft containerboard, a paperboard material usually over 0.01 in thick. Corrugated fiberboard and paperboard are sometimes called corrugated cardboard, although cardboard might be any heavy paper-pulp based board.|$|E
50|$|Corrugated {{fiberboard}} is {{a combination}} of paperboards, usually two flat liners and one inner fluted <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium.</b> It is often used for making corrugated boxes for shipping or storing products.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{propagation}} of a Love wave in a corrugated isotropic layer over a homogeneous isotropic half-space has been investigated. The dispersion relation of Love wave propagation in a <b>corrugated</b> layer <b>medium</b> bounded by irregular boundaries is derived. In special cases, the dispersion relation is reduced for the corrugated layers bounded by periodic boundary surfaces, d cos px, d 1 cos px and d 2 cos px. The dispersion relation {{is found to be}} a function of the amplitudes of the corrugation, frequency and position parameters of the corrugated boundary surfaces. The results of Ewing et al. and results similar to Noyer are recovered from our analysis. The phase velocity and group velocity of Love waves are computed numerically and the results are depicted graphically...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{proposal}} is to identify unexplored areas {{of research in the}} field of packaging science, specifically related to the incorporation of Nanocrystalline Cellulose (NCC) as a functional material in fiber based packaging, as well as to highlight some of potential risks and unknowns in the product lifecycle. This research hypothesizes that incorporating NCC into wood fiber-based c-flute <b>corrugated</b> packaging <b>medium</b> will show a sufficient performance improvement to justify additional research. Nanomaterials, as a whole, are still being understood, including those using naturally occurring bases such as NCC. Further incremental testing with NCC will help provide a performance and safety baseline for the necessary future research prior to mass production. NCC holds great promise for the future: a commonly available, naturally occurring material that’s easily recyclable and biodegradable, yet has the strength of steel. Due diligence is required for this material to come to market in a safe and sustainable manner...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{tremendous}} growth {{of interest in the}} utilization of non-wood based material to support the insufficient raw materials availability for the pulp and paper industry. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of 120 gsm linerboard and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper made from unbeaten durian rinds chemi-mechanical (CMP) pulp. The linerboard and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper were prepared and tested according to Malaysian Standards / International Organization for Standardization (MS ISO) and Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) standard methods. Based on the burst index (2. 03 kPa. m 2 /g), RCT (1. 97 N. m 2 /g) and CMT (129 N), the linerboard and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> from CMP durian rind pulp have shown a good potential as an alternative raw material for papermaking and comparable with other types of wood and non-wood based papers as well as current commercial papers...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} test {{was conducted to}} investigate the characteristics of linerboard and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper made from durian rind waste. Naturally dried durian rinds were pulped according to Soda-Anthraquinone (Soda-AQ) pulping process with a condition of 20 % active alkali, 0. 1 % AQ, 7 : 1 liquor to material ratio, 120 minutes cooking time and 170 °C cooking temperature. The linerboard and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper with a basis weight of 120 gsm were prepared and evaluated according to Malaysian International Organization for Standardization (MS ISO) and Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI). The {{results indicate that the}} characteristics of durian rind linerboard are comparable with other wood or non-wood based paper and current commercial paper. However, low CMT value for <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> and water absorptiveness quality for linerboard could be improved in future. Based on the bulk density (0. 672 g/cm 3), burst index (3. 12 kPa. m 2 /g) and RCT (2. 00 N. m 2 /g), the durian rind has shown a good potential and suitable as an alternative raw material source for linerboard industry...|$|E

In the factory, three kinds of products are produced which are printing and writing paper, <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper and newspaper paper. Linear programming method has been used in the research. Limitations are wood resources, manpower costs, chemical materials, distribution costs and production capacity. Profit maximization is objective function for three kinds of the products. Results show that with respect to the model, optimum amounts for printing and writing paper and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> paper have to increase 35 and 18 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{corrugated}} cardboard {{is widely used}} in manufacturing industries as a packaging and transportation material. Faculty of {{corrugated cardboard}} is depended on the fragility, weight, thickness, toughness and so on. The strength of corrugated cardboard changed with the fabrication process, used atmosphere and variety of loading patterns. On the machining process of corrugated cardboard box, the cutting and ruling technology is very important factor. The effects of these factors {{on the strength of}} corrugated cardboard have not yet enough been identified. In general, the corrugated cardboard was composed with three layer of paperboard. One is outside liner and inside liner and the other is <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium.</b> The top of <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> is bonded with glue on outside or inside layer surface. The bonded space was decided by company standard. The evolutional method of bonding strength had not been established. The development of new simple method has been needed. In this research, to establish the evaluation method of strength of corrugated cardboard material, new practical tensile test and shear test, considering the glue bonding strength, was proposed and the factory of these test method was investigated. In current studies, it was too hard to evaluate the reproductive tensile and shear strength of corrugated cardboard, because of fabrication method of the cut specimen and the deformation of chuck position. On the shear test, as the direction of parallel chuck changed during loading process, the specimen was rotated. In this research, the new developed method of tensile and shear was accomplished, the reproduced strength could be obtained. The fatigue test was tried on the shear test to investigate the effect of thickness of specimen...|$|E
40|$|Striping is a print defect that {{is common}} in flexo post-printing on {{corrugated}} board. Striping is print density and/or print gloss variations that appears as stripes on the printed liner parallel to the flutes of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium.</b> The periodic print variations are often thought to originate from a non-uniform printing pressure caused by the corrugated board structure. Experiments and numerical simulations have been performed to study how print density and print gloss variations {{can be related to}} local contact pressure during flexo post-printing on corrugated board. Print gloss and print density have been measured for prints with known printing pressure. The local printing pressure in an industrial flexo post-printing press has been simulated with a finite element model. The results showed that the print density variations are caused by the printing pressure variations, depending on the ink transfer characteristics of the liner board, while the print gloss variations are caused by surface distortion of the corrugated board, such as “washboarding”...|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium,</b> flute size, {{combining}} adhesive, and linerboards can be varied {{to design a}} corrugated board with specific properties. In this paper, the nonlinear finite element analysis of the fluted corrugated sheet in the corrugated cardboard based on software SolidWorks 2008 was investigated. The model of corrugated board with three or more flutes is reliable for stress and displacement measurement to eliminate {{the influence of the}} number of flutes in models. According to the static pressure test, with the increase of flute height H or arc radius of flute, the maximum stress in the models decreased and the maximum displacement increased. However the maximum stress and maximum displacement in the models increase nonlinearly in the static pressure test with the increase of the flute angle θ. According to the drop test, with the increase of flute height H, the maximum stress of goods on the upper board in the drop test decreased. The maximum stress of the model in the drop test decreases firstly and then increases with the increase of flute angle, and the optimal flute angle θ could be 60 ° for corrugated board. All the conclusions are consistent with experimental data or product standards...|$|E
40|$|SRI has {{examined}} the organosolv (organic solvation) pulping of Australian bagasse using technology supplied by Ecopulp. In the process, bagasse is reacted with aqueous ethanol in a digester at elevated temperatures (between 150 degrees Celsius and 200 degrees Celsius). The products from the digester are separated using proprietary technology before further processing into a range of saleable products. Test trials were undertaken using two batch digesters; the first capable of pulping about 25 g of wet depithed bagasse and the second, larger samples of about 1. 5 kg of wet depithed bagasse. From this study, the unbleached pulp produced from fresh bagasse did not have very good strength properties {{for the production of}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> for cartons and bleached pulp. In particular, the lignin contents as indicated by the Kappa number for the unbleached pulps are high for making bleached pulp. However, in spite of the high lignin content, it is possible to bleach the pulp to acceptable levels of brightness up to 86. 6 %ISO. The economics were assessed for three tier pricing (namely low, medium and high price). The economic return for a plant that produces 100 air dry t/d of brownstock pulp is satisfactory for both high and medium pricing levels of pricing. The outcomes from the project justify that work should continue through to either pilot plant or upgraded laboratory facility...|$|E
40|$|Paper and {{paperboard}} are {{the most}} widely used packaging materials in the world. The combination of <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> (fluting) and linerboard can be varied to design a corrugated paperboard package in relation to specific mechanical properties of the paper and paperboard. Tensile tests were performed on five different paper grammages (175 g m- 2, 200 g m- 2, 225 g m- 2, 250 g m- 2, and 300 g m- 2) in the principal directions of the paperboard (machine direction, cross direction and thickness direction) at standard conditions (23 °C and 50 % relative humidity) and refrigerated transport conditions (0 °C and 90 % relative humidity). At the same environmental conditions, edgewise compression tests were performed on the corrugated paperboard. Results showed that the mechanical properties of paper and paperboard were affected by the environmental conditions. At the refrigerated transport conditions, the modulus of elasticity strongly decreased in the range of 20 – 53 % compared to standard conditions for all the paper grammages. The modulus of elasticity was observed to be higher in the machine direction (MD) than other directions for all the paper grammages. The buckling behaviour of the experimental edgewise compression test of the corrugated paperboard was compared with numerical results. The finite element model of the corrugated paperboard accurately predicted the experimental value of the incipient buckling load with an error of 0. 4 % and 5. 5 % at the standard and refrigerated conditions, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Corrugated {{board is}} an {{engineering}} structure, whose strength characteristics {{depend on the}} cross–section geometry and the material properties of liner and <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium.</b> Therefore, the board combination (combination of material for preparing corrugated board) of corrugated boards should be optimized with considering the quality characteristics of corrugated board demanded to achieve the optimum packaging design. The board combinations of corrugated boards can be determined by employing the configuration method for the paperboard stiffness and the basis weight. The results of board combinations can greatly affect the buckling resistance and compression strength of the box. In order to analyze {{the effect of the}} configuration method for the board stiffness and the basis weight on the flexural stiffness of corrugated board, we performed experiments based on cost– and time–consuming procedures. However, by using a simulation method such as finite element analysis (FEA) has the advantages such as saving of the time and cost in experiments and sample production as well as detailed analysis by adjusting several parameters. In the case of the simulation method, the estimation of reliability and reproducibility of the results should be strongly considered. In this study, we observed the strength–optimal design conditions for the corrugated board combinations by analyzing the flexural stiffness index (FSI). The FEA method was used in the study using the four–point loading conditions. We found that the difference between the FEA result and the test results were approximately 18 – 31 %. However, it was estimated that the variations in FSI estimated by using both methods are similar. Therefore, we expect that the flexural balance for different board combinations would be successfully analyzed {{on the basis of the}} qualitative comparison of FSI values corresponding to the combinations when the stiffness for each of the liner and the corrugating medium are assumed to be with 2 – 3 levels...|$|E
40|$|Linear Corrugating is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>medium</b> are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional corrugating process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the Cross Machine Direction (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear Corrugating process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear Corrugating boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear Corrugating are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear Corrugating process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual manufactures joints (glue joints). This box manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear Corrugating process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in corrugating medium in the MD of the paper. This operation is the central requirement of the Linear Corrugating process. Items I and II were successfully completed, showing predicted BCT increases from the Linear Corrugated boxes and significant strength improvement in the Dual Joint boxes. The Former was constructed and operated successfully using kraft linerboard as the forming medium. It was found that tensile strength and stretch characteristics of the corrugating medium were not sufficient to allow fluting this paper in the former. Possible causes and corrective actions to overcome this problem are addressed in the body of the report below...|$|E
