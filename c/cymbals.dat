5|$|Peart played Zildjian A-series <b>cymbals</b> and Wuhan china <b>cymbals</b> {{until the}} early 2000s when he {{switched}} to Paragon, a line created for him by Sabian. In concert, Peart uses an elaborate 360-degree drum kit, with a large acoustic set in front and electronic drums to the rear.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian <b>cymbals.</b> By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass drum, he switched to a larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride <b>cymbals</b> instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish janissaries {{military}} corps {{had included}} since the 14th century bands called mehter or mehterân which, {{like many other}} earlier military bands in Asia featured {{a high proportion of}} drums, <b>cymbals,</b> and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of noise was pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehterân could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of <b>cymbals,</b> small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.|$|E

50|$|Some drummers use a china <b>cymbal,</b> a sizzle <b>cymbal</b> or a {{specialized}} tone {{such as a}} swish or pang <b>cymbal</b> as a ride <b>cymbal.</b> When playing extremely softly, when using brushes, and when recording, even a paper-thin crash may serve well as a ride <b>cymbal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The University of Massachusetts Amherst Minuteman Marching Band {{covered the}} song {{live in a}} version {{featuring}} xylophones, chimes, snare drums, <b>cymbals,</b> bass drum and timpani.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010-11 Time Machine Tour Peart used a new DW kit {{which was}} {{outfitted}} with copper-plated hardware and time machine designs {{to match the}} tour's steampunk themes. Matching Paragon <b>cymbals</b> with clock imagery were also used.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to destroy the {{cohesion}} of the Crusader army and unsettle their resolve, the Ayyubid onslaught was accompanied by the clashing of <b>cymbals</b> and gongs, trumpets blowing and men screaming war-cries.|$|E

50|$|Below the <b>cymbal,</b> the {{mounting}} bolt passes through first a dome washer {{and then a}} bottom felt, which support the <b>cymbal.</b> The bolt then passes through the <b>cymbal.</b> The part of {{the mounting}} bolt that passes through the <b>cymbal</b> is separated from the <b>cymbal</b> by a sleeve, most commonly of plastic, which protects the metal <b>cymbal</b> from contact with the metal bolt. Omission of this sleeve by beginners is common, and leads to keyhole damage to the <b>cymbal</b> mounting hole, and often also to cracking around the hole.|$|R
5000|$|The second percussionist {{plays the}} first triangle, the second claves, six temple blocks, {{a very small}} <b>cymbal,</b> a small <b>cymbal</b> and a {{suspended}} <b>cymbal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{duration}} {{of the work is}} about 35 minutes. The score calls for one piccolo, three flutes (third doubling second piccolo), one alto flute, four oboes (fourth doubling second English horn), English horn, three clarinets in B and A (third doubling second bass clarinet), clarinet in E and D, one bass clarinet, four bassoons (fourth doubling second contrabassoon), one contrabassoon; eight horns (seventh and eighth doubling tenor Wagner tubas), trumpet in D, four trumpets in C (fourth doubling bass trumpet in E), two trombones, one bass trombone, two bass tubas; a percussion section with 5 timpani (requiring two players), bass drum, tam-tam, triangle, tambourine, <b>cymbals,</b> antique <b>cymbals</b> in A and B, güiro; and strings. Despite the large orchestra, much of the score is written chamber-fashion, with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles.|$|E
5|$|Connotations is scored {{for full}} symphony {{orchestra}} with augmented percussion. The complete ensemble includes piccolo, three flutes (third flute doubling second piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third bassoon doubling contrabassoon), six horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba, tympani, five percussionists (glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone, conga drums, timbales, <b>cymbals,</b> metal sheet, tam-tam, triangle, claves, temple block, woodblock, bass drum, snare drum, tenor drum), piano (doubling celesta) and strings.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of World Painted Blood, King used BC Rich Guitars, Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs, Dunlop strings and picks, EMG pickups, and Korg tuners. Hanneman used ESP guitars, Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs, Dunlop strings and picks, Monster Cables, and Shure Wireless System. Vocalist/bassist Araya used ESP basses, Marshall Bass Amplifiers and Cabs, EMG Pick-Ups, Dunlop Picks and accessories, and MXR Effects. Lombardo used Tama Drums, Paiste <b>cymbals,</b> Pro-Mark drum sticks, and Evans drum heads.|$|E
5000|$|Tama's top-of-the-line {{series of}} stands aimed at {{traveling}} musicians, as RoadPro stands for [...] "Road-Proven". It features double-braced legs, die-cast joints, a reversible <b>cymbal</b> sleeve, and Tama's patented <b>Cymbal</b> Mate. RoadPro <b>cymbal</b> stands also feature TAMA's Quick-Set Tilter for adjusting the <b>cymbal</b> to any angle.|$|R
2500|$|A sizzler is a metal chain or {{combination}} of chains that is hung across a <b>cymbal,</b> creating a distinctive metallic sound when the <b>cymbal</b> is struck {{similar to that}} of a sizzle <b>cymbal.</b> Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a <b>cymbal</b> and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a [...] "sizzler" [...] chain is that the chain can be removed and the <b>cymbal</b> will return to its normal sound (in contrast, a <b>cymbal</b> with rivets would have to have the rivets removed).|$|R
50|$|The lower <b>cymbal</b> of the {{piggyback}} {{is often}} a crash, or less often a ride, but larger splashes and even chinas can be used. The upper <b>cymbal</b> could in theory be any <b>cymbal</b> small enough to allow the lower <b>cymbal</b> to be played, but in practice is almost always a splash.|$|R
5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and <b>cymbals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} were popular {{entertainments}} {{for those who}} could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, <b>cymbals,</b> tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The total {{vocal and}} {{instrumental}} resources {{required for the}} oratorio are a SATB chorus with soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloists, and an orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, <b>cymbals</b> and strings. According to the vocal score, the approximate duration {{of the work is}} 66 minutes.|$|E
50|$|They {{are also}} called hand cymbals; however, a hand <b>cymbal</b> {{can also be}} a {{suspended}} <b>cymbal</b> struck by hand rather than with a beater, and western types are often called crash cymbals; however, a crash <b>cymbal</b> is more commonly a medium-sized and strongly tapered suspended <b>cymbal</b> struck with a drum stick.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{essential}} difference between this technique and stacking. A <b>cymbal</b> stack produces a different sound to that produced by either <b>cymbal</b> individually. The piggyback, like the double stand, is primarily a method of mounting the splash <b>cymbal,</b> without producing any major difference {{in the tone of}} either <b>cymbal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{sound of}} a crash is changed by its luster. A cleaner <b>cymbal</b> creates a crisper sound, whereas a <b>cymbal</b> showing signs of {{oxidation}} (called a 'raw' <b>cymbal)</b> creates a duller sound.|$|R
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, <b>cymbals,</b> and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, <b>cymbals,</b> triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian <b>cymbals.</b> He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
50|$|A crash/ride <b>cymbal</b> is {{a medium}} weight, {{slightly}} tapered <b>cymbal,</b> normally in the 18 - 22 in range, designed {{to serve in}} a drum kit as both a crash and a ride <b>cymbal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Above the <b>cymbal</b> {{is a top}} felt, above {{which may}} be a flat washer but this is {{sometimes}} omitted to allow looser mounting of the <b>cymbal,</b> and last a wingnut or <b>cymbal</b> nut.|$|R
50|$|Stacking {{should not}} be {{confused}} with piggybacking, in which the upper <b>cymbal</b> is bell down, the lower <b>cymbal</b> bell up, and a spacing felt is used between the <b>cymbal</b> bells, preventing any contact.|$|R
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using <b>cymbals</b> for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|Little {{history is}} {{available}} in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, castanets, and <b>cymbals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neila met her husband, Sathyalingam Suntharalingam, at Kalakshetra. The {{son of a}} Sri Lankan politician, C. Suntharalingam, he had {{graduated}} from the University of Madras with a Sangitha Sironmani (Degree in Music) and from Kalakshetra in 1955 with a Diploma in Music, and was then teaching Indian classical music theory and the playing of the Indian drum and <b>cymbals</b> at the academy. After a two-year courtship, they married in 1956 and moved back to Sri Lanka where {{they lived in a}} 40-ha farm just outside Colombo. Sathyalingam then taught dance in schools while raising her children, the first of whom was born in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|It {{started with}} the Formula 602 [...] "Dark Ride" [...] <b>cymbal</b> in the early 70s. This <b>cymbal</b> was {{developed}} with Jack DeJohnette. In 1975, Paiste introduced the Sound Creation as a <b>cymbal</b> line.|$|R
5000|$|A sizzler is a metal chain or {{combination}} of chains that is hung across a <b>cymbal,</b> creating a distinctive metallic sound when the <b>cymbal</b> is struck {{similar to that}} of a sizzle <b>cymbal.</b> Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a <b>cymbal</b> and putting metal rivets in the holes.

50|$|In <b>cymbal</b> making, taper {{refers to}} the gradual change in {{thickness}} from the bell to {{the rim of the}} <b>cymbal.</b> It {{is one of the key}} features that determines the tone of the <b>cymbal.</b>|$|R
