5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
5|$|The braking a is from {{an initial}} speed u {{to a final}} speed v, over a length of time t. The {{equation}} u - v = at implies that the greater the acceleration the shorter {{the time needed to}} <b>change</b> <b>speed.</b> The stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> from slow to fast at any time.|$|E

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> or color.|$|E
25|$|A {{conventional}} {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{flight control system}} consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they <b>change</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|A show jumper, however, is bred {{less for}} overall form and more for power over tall fences, along with speed, scope, and agility. This favors a horse {{with a good}} {{galloping}} stride, powerful hindquarters that can <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> or direction easily, plus a good shoulder angle and length of neck. A jumper has a more powerful build than either the hunter or the racehorse.|$|E
5000|$|Multispeed Vibrators: Multispeed {{vibrators}} allow {{users to}} customize {{how fast the}} vibrator's pulsing or massaging movements occur. Depending on the specific type of vibrator, the <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> is made by simply pushing a button {{a certain number of}} times, allowing users to <b>change</b> <b>speeds</b> several times throughout the usage.|$|R

5000|$|A {{centrifugal}} governor regulates {{the speed of}} an engine by using spinning masses that move radially, adjusting the throttle, as the engine <b>changes</b> <b>speed.</b> In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement.|$|R
25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly <b>change</b> <b>speed.</b> The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power.|$|E
25|$|The Eudoxan {{system had}} several {{critical}} flaws. One was {{its inability to}} predict motions exactly. Callippus' work {{may have been an}} attempt to correct this flaw. A related problem is the inability of his models to explain why planets appear to <b>change</b> <b>speed.</b> A third flaw is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by Autolycus of Pitane (c. 310 BC).|$|E

40|$|While {{studies have}} {{investigated}} <b>speed</b> and <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed</b> in rugby league players, no study has investigated the reactive agility of these athletes. In addition, {{the relationship among}} <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility within the specific context of rugby league has not been determined. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate a wide range of <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility tests commonly used by rugby league coaches to determine which, if any tests discriminated higher and lesser skilled players, and to investigate the relationship among <b>speed,</b> <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed,</b> and reactive agility in these athletes. Forty-two rugby league players completed tests of speed (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m sprint), <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed</b> (‘L’ run, 505 test, and modified 505 test), and reactive agility. The validity of the tests to discriminate higher and lesser skilled competitors was evaluated by testing first grade (N = 12) and second grade (N = 30) players. First grade players had faster speed, and movement and decision times on the reactive agility test than second grade players. No significant differences were detected between first and second grade players for <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed.</b> While movement times on the reactive agility test were significantly related to 10 m and 20 m sprint times and <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed,</b> no significant relationships were detected among measures of decision time and response accuracy during the reactive agility test and measures of linear <b>speed</b> and <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed.</b> These findings question the validity of preplanned <b>change</b> of direction <b>speed</b> tests for discriminating higher and lesser skilled rugby league players, while also highlighting the contribution of perceptual skill to agility in these athletes...|$|R
2500|$|On June 30, 2005, {{at about}} 10:10a.m. (17:10 UTC), the vessel Queen of Oak Bay, on the Nanaimo–Horseshoe Bay (Trans-Canada Highway) ferry route, lost power four minutes {{before it was}} to dock at the Horseshoe Bay terminal. The vessel became adrift, unable to <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> but able to steer with the rudders. [...] The horn was blown steadily, and an {{announcement}} telling passengers to brace for impact was made minutes before the 139m (456ft) ship slowly ran into the nearby Sewell's Marina, where it destroyed or damaged 28 pleasure craft and subsequently went aground {{a short distance from}} the shore.

2500|$|Replay {{officials}} took 12minutes {{to review}} the play. [...] On the video replays, the ball comes very close to Jessee's hands {{but it does not}} seem to <b>change</b> <b>speed</b> or trajectory as it goes past them. [...] Despite the video replays providing no conclusive proof that Jessee had actually touched the ball officials ruled that he had made contact. [...] The ball was declared dead at that point and the officials declared that Jessee had committed illegal interference; they declared an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty assessed against Texas. [...] The ball went back to the Sun Devils and they were awarded half the distance to the goal, giving ASU fourth-and-3 at the 7-yard line. [...] On the next play, Carpenter threw a touchdown pass to Chris McGaha to make the score 21–7 Texas.|$|E

50|$|As {{an example}} of the {{velocity}} changes involved, a spacecraft travelling from low Earth orbit to Mars using a simple trajectory must first undergo a <b>change</b> in <b>speed</b> (also known as a delta-v), in this case an increase, of about 3.8 km/s. Then, after intercepting Mars, it must <b>change</b> its <b>speed</b> by another 2.3 km/s in order to match Mars' orbital speed around the Sun and enter an orbit around it. For comparison, launching a spacecraft into low Earth orbit requires a <b>change</b> in <b>speed</b> of about 9.5 km/s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze the current leakage of the power grid due to the <b>change</b> in <b>speed</b> of {{high-speed}} rail (HSR). First, using PSIM software as the fundamental basis, this study constructed an overall HSR circuit-based model system, including Scott transformer, auto-transformer, and the track equivalent circuit and grounding system. In addition, this paper sought to study the current leakage transient responses of a train’s <b>change</b> in <b>speed</b> using this equivalent circuit model. Through simulation results, the study found that the dramatic change in DC voltage from a <b>change</b> in the <b>speed</b> of electric locomotives causes current leakage flowing through the high-speed rail power grid and a rise in ground potential. The study’s analysis results provide possible performance improvements to the high speed rail’s electric locomotives during <b>changes</b> in <b>speed...</b>|$|R
