40|$|There {{are good}} reasons to believe that lunar {{volcanic}} glasses originated from a deep interior source. The presence of {{a thin layer of}} surface correlated elements on these glasses may indicate that the Moon has some reservoirs that are enriched in volatiles. Since the glasses themselves do not show similar enrichment, the source should be of limited extent. Three scenarios are advanced for the origin of these elements. The mechanism for lunar volcanism differs from the mechanism for volcanism on Earth since the former produces bubbling and the latter explosive fountaining. From the condensation behavior of the volatile compounds, which leads to heterogeneous condensation, it is concluded that <b>comparing</b> <b>element</b> ratios of surface correlated elements gives little sense. It seems as if the volatile reservoirs are of rather limited extent and that they do not enlarge the volatile content of the bulk Moon significantly...|$|E

40|$|Previously threats were {{conceived}} as being connected to wars and armed attacks on other countries. But if we observe {{the world today}} there are financial situations that, if {{they got out of}} hand, could cause severe problems for large parts of a countries population. The environment is another area where severe consequences can be expected. Buzan, Waever and de Wilde (1998 : 2) work from the premises that security can, and should, be applied to a wider selection of areas in society. From this stand point this Bachelor thesis will cover the discourse of threats in the inaugural addresses of USAs five most recent presidents: Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump. The inaugural address` were chosen because it is the presidents opportunity to outline their strategy and ‘set the tone’ for their term in office (Brownell 2016). Throughout the analysis there is a focus on the five sections outlined in Buzans (1991 : 116) analysis model: military, politics, economy, ecology and societal. The analysis frame is based on both traditional realism and more alternative security theory. There is also a <b>comparing</b> <b>element</b> to examine whether there have been any changes in the discourse, connected to threats, since the 9 / 11 attacks. Furthermore, the study sets out to see if any of the subjects have shown signs of becoming securitized. The result of this study shows that the discourse of threat is mainly focused around the military section. There has been a general {{increase in the number of}} threats mentioned since 9 / 11, although some sections have decreased.

40|$|Ancient harbour areas {{represent}} a peculiar context where the cooperation between geosciences and archaeology may provide useful {{information about the}} mutual interactions involving natural settings and human society. Several multidisciplinary studies have recently focused on Mediterranean seaports evolution, furnishing a wide literature about past bio-sedimentary response to harbour activities (Marriner et al., 2010). On the contrast few geoarchaeological-palaeoecological data on strictly lacustrine harbours, where the importance of ostracods as bioindicators is enhanced {{by the lack of}} other organisms as foraminifers, are available. As a part of the “Magdala project” and in the framework of the late Hellenistic-Roman (167 BC- 350 AD) sedimentary history reconstructed by Sarti et al. (in press) for Magdala harbour area (Kinneret Lake, north Israel), quantitative ostracod analyses were performed on 28 samples collected from two key stratigraphic sections excavated in front of the Roman harbour structures (docks and a flight of stairs). Along the sections, detailed described in terms of sedimentological features and anthropogenic artifacts (Lena, 2012; Sarti et al., in press), the abundant and well-preserved ostracod fauna show a very similar faunal composition and distribution. Despite the oligotypic character of the ostracod community, strongly dominated by the opportunistic, true euryhaline species Cyprideis torosa, two different associations were distinguished. Similarly to what observed within the present-day lake basin at ca. 5 m water depth (Mischke et al., 2010), comparable proportion of smooth and noded valves of C. torosa characterize the sandy interval barren in anthropogenic artifacts and interpreted as the natural lacustrine beach at the sections bottom (pre-harbour unit). At the passage to the overlying bay silty sands, containing several late Hellenistic archaeological artifacts, a sharp increase of noded C. torosa (up to 87 % of total fauna) is recorded along with the occurrence of other species preferring fine-grained substrates and high-organic stagnant waters, as Pseudocandona albicans. This diagnostic change in ostracod content is paralleled by a sharp increase in concentration (up to double concentration values) of trace metals Zn, Pb and Cu within the silty sands interval, suggesting the establishment of an anthropogenically forced semi-protected basin with high levels of heavy-metal pollution during the late Hellenistic period (sin-harbour unit). In order to increase the quality of our palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and provide insights into the harbour water chemistry derived by human activities, ostracod geochemistry analyses (ICP-MS, …) are in progress on C. torosa valves recovered from the pre-harbour and sin-harbour units. The integration of palaeontological and geochemical analyses will potentially differentiate unpolluted from polluted conditions, avoiding complications related to grain-size partitioning. This methodological approach may also improve our knowledge about the “factor X” (van Harten, 2000) that contributes to the development of phenotypic nodes on C. torosa within freshwater-oligohaline settings. <b>Comparing</b> <b>element</b> concentrations with the frequency of noded forms and plotting shell chemistry of smooth versus noded valves can provide new information about ostracods, including C. torosa ecophenotypical features, as bioindicators of high pollution levels within ancient lacustrine harbours...|$|E

The study of these Markov chains reveals an interesting phenomenon. Namely, in several cases, the algorithm which repeatedly <b>compares</b> only adjacent <b>elements</b> is better than the one making arbitrary comparisons: on the long-run, the former algorithm produces sequences that are "better sorted". The analysis of the underlying Markov chain poses new interesting questions as the latter algorithm yields a non-reversible chain and therefore its stationary distribution seems difficult to calculate explicitly...|$|R
