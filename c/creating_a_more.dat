5|$|The Haiti Democracy Project {{was officially}} {{launched}} at the Brookings Institution in November 2002 as a non-profit organization. Its funding was raised from Haitian-Americans and Haitians {{living in the}} United States, {{as well as other}} U.S. citizens. Its primary purpose was <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pragmatic and operative U.S. policy towards Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour of Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{physical}} midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors. Thus, the China Western Development policy aimed to attract foreign investment. This was {{to be done by}} <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. The creation of a new economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would lead to greater rates of progress.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of record-keeping. Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E
5|$|John {{spent much}} of 1205 {{securing}} England against a potential French invasion. As an emergency measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's Assize of Arms of 1181, with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies. When the threat of invasion faded, John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou, and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy. To achieve this, John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns, <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised, but would be financially supported by the other nine; knights would serve for an indefinite period. John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen. The king {{was supported by a}} team of leading barons with military expertise, including William Longespée, William the Marshal, Roger de Lacy and, until he fell from favour, the marcher lord William de Braose.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his work, Tricky blurs the {{normally}} clear sexual definitions found within hip hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip hop in his debut album, Maxinquaye, he fights against typical sexual representations by, for example, dressing {{as a woman}} on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult to define sound, so go his lyrics, <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> ambiguous and blurry take on sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Murders {{are almost}} always carried out by members. It is very rare for the Mafia to recruit an {{outsider}} for a single job, and such people are liable to be eliminated soon afterwards because they become expendable liabilities. Mafia violence is most commonly directed at other Mafia families competing for territory and business. Violence {{is more common in}} the Sicilian Mafia than the American Mafia because Mafia families in Sicily are smaller and more numerous, <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> volatile atmosphere.|$|E
