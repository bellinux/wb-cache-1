25|$|There {{had been}} {{tensions}} prior to these events. In 337 BC a {{war broke out}} between the Aurunci and the Sidicini. The Romans decided to help the Aurunci because they had not fought Rome during the First Samnite War. Meanwhile, the ancient city of Aurunca was destroyed, and so they fled to Suessa Aurunca, which they fortified. In 336 BC the Ausoni joined the Sidicini. The Romans defeated the forces of these two peoples in a minor battle. In 335 BC {{one of the two}} Roman consuls besieged, seized and garrisoned <b>Cales,</b> the main town of the Ausoni. The army was then sent to march on the Sidicini so that the other consul could share the glory. In 334 BC, 2500 civilians were sent to <b>Cales</b> to set up a Roman colony there. The Romans ravaged the territory of the Sidicini and there were reports that in Samnium there had been calls for war with Rome for two years. Therefore, the Roman troops were kept in Sidicini territory. There were also tensions north of the River Liris, in the Volscian territory. In 330 BC the Volscian towns of Fabrateria and Luca offered Rome overlordship over them in exchange for protection from the Samnites and the senate sent a warning to the Samnites not to attack their territories. The Samnites agreed. According to Livy this was because they were not ready for war. In the same year the Volscian towns of Privernum and Fundi rebelled and ravaged the territories of another Volscian town and two Roman colonies in the area. When the Romans sent an army Fundi quickly pledged its loyalty. In 329 BC, Privernum either fell or surrendered (this is unclear). Its ringleaders were sent to Rome, its walls were pulled down and a garrison was stationed there.|$|E
25|$|In Livy’s account {{there is}} a sense that the peace with the Samnites had been on a thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that <b>Cales</b> was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E

Minucius took up position {{to the north of}} the plain to watch both the via Latina and via Appia with a detachment, while Taenum was also garrisoned. The main Roman army camped near Mount Massicus, north of the plain to the west of Minucius, ready to support his position. A detachment of 4,000 troops was sent to watch the passes of Mount Callicula to the east of the plain near Allifae, one of the possible passes through which Hannibal might choose to leave the plain. The exact location is still unknown and remains debatable. Thus, the Roman dispositions hemmed the Carthaginians in the plain, trapping them. It seemed that Hannibal would have to attack a Roman position directly to break out; the only question was whether he would choose such a dangerous manoeuvre before or after his supplies had failed. Fabius had ensured the best possible situation for Rome in his view. All the Romans now had to do was wait until the Carthaginians ran out of supplies and then were forced to take desperate measures.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving Arpi, Hannibal marched west into Samnium, {{and then}} moved to Beneventum, ravaging the {{countryside}} at will. Fabius cautiously followed the Carthaginians keeping to the high ground. From Beneventum, which had shut its gates against Hannibal, the Carthaginians moved north to capture a town called either [...] "Venosia" [...] or Telesia. From this place Hannibal struck south west towards Ager Falernus, a fertile river plain which lay on the south of Latium, and {{to the north of}} Capua. After going through Allifae, Callifae, across the Volturnus River to <b>Cales</b> and then down on the plain the Carthaginians finally arrived near Casilinum. Hannibal let loose his soldiers on the rich land, and all through the summer collected a rich booty of cattle, grain, supplies and prisoners unhindered by Roman military activity. Hannibal had entered the potential trap because either his Italian guides had mistaken [...] "Casinum" [...] as [...] "Casilinum", or some Campanian prisoners had suggested that Capua might defect once Carthaginians reached Campania, which did not materialise at this point of time. It had also been suggested that Hannibal had invaded Ager Falernus to show the Italians the inability of Romans to defend their own property, after failing to get Fabius to fight. There were eight possible routes out of Ager Falernus, but being positioned north of the Volturnus River, and with all the bridges in Roman hands, there were only three that Hannibal could take to leave the river plain. Fabius seized this strategic opportunity presented to him and set about to trap the Carthaginian army.|$|E

[...] So spake the Son of God; but Satan now [...] Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, [...] Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply'd. [...] Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, [...] Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught [...] By me propos'd in life contemplative, [...] Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, [...] 370 [...] What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness [...] For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, [...] And thither will return thee, yet remember [...] What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause [...] To wish thou never hadst rejected thus [...] Nicely or cautiously my offer'd aid, [...] Which would have set thee in short time with ease [...] On David's Throne; or Throne of all the world, [...] Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, [...] 380 [...] When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill'd. [...] Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, [...] Or Heav'n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars [...] Voluminous, or single characters, [...] In thir conjunction met, give me to spell, [...] Sorrows, and labours, Opposition, bate, [...] Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, [...] Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, [...] A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, [...] Real or Allegoric I discern not, [...] 390 [...] Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, [...] Without beginning; for no date prefixt [...] Directs me in the Starry Rubric set. [...] So saying he took (for still he knew his power [...] Not yet expir'd) and to the Wilderness [...] Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, [...] Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose, [...] As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night [...] Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, [...] Privation meer of light and absent day. [...] 400 [...] Our Saviour meek and with untroubl'd mind [...] After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, [...] Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, [...] Wherever, under some concourse of shades [...] Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield [...] From dews and damps of night his shelter'd head, [...] But shelter'd slept in vain, for at his head [...] The Tempter watch'd, and soon with ugly dreams [...] Disturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic now [...] 'Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the Clouds [...] 410 [...] From many a horrid rift abortive pour'd [...] Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire [...] In ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the winds [...] Within thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad [...] From the four hinges of the world, and fell [...] On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, [...] Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks [...] Bow'd thir Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, [...] Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, [...] O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst [...] 420 [...] Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, [...] Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round [...] Environ'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd, [...] Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou [...] Sat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless peace. [...] Thus pass'd the night so foul till morning fair [...] Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; [...] Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar [...] Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds, [...] And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais'd [...] 430 [...] To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. [...] And now the Sun with more effectual beams [...] Had chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the wet [...] From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds [...] Who all things now behold more fresh and green, [...] After a night of storm so ruinous, [...] Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray [...] To gratulate the sweet return of morn; [...] Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn [...] Was absent, after all his mischief done, [...] 440 [...] The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem [...] Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, [...] Yet with no new device, they all were spent, [...] Rather by this his last affront resolv'd, [...] Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, [...] And mad despight to be so oft repell'd. [...] Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, [...] Back'd on the North and West by a thick wood, [...] Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; [...] And in a careless mood thus to him said. [...] 450 [...] Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, [...] After a dismal night; I heard the rack [...] As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self [...] Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them [...] As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, [...] Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, [...] Are to the main as inconsiderable, [...] And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze [...] To mans less universe, and soon are gone; [...] Yet as being oft times noxious where they light [...] 460 [...] On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, [...] Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, [...] Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, [...] They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: [...] This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; [...] Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. [...] Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject [...] The perfet season offer'd with my aid [...] To win thy destin'd seat, but wilt prolong [...] All to the push of Fate, persue thy way [...] 470 [...] Of gaining David's Throne no man knows when, [...] For both the when and how is no where told, [...] Thou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no doubt; [...] For Angels have proclaim'd it, but concealing [...] The time and means: each act is rightliest done, [...] Not when it must, but when it may be best. [...] If thou observe not this, be sure to find, [...] What I foretold thee, many a hard assay [...] Of dangers, and adversities and pains, [...] E're thou of Israel's Scepter get fast hold; [...] 480 [...] Whereof this ominous night that clos'd thee round, [...] So many terrors, voices, prodigies [...] May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign. [...] So talk'd he, while the Son of God went on [...] And staid not, but in brief him answer'd thus. [...] Mee worse then wet thou find'st not; other harm [...] Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none; [...] I never fear'd they could, though noising loud [...] And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs [...] Betok'ning, or ill boding, I contemn [...] 490 [...] As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; [...] Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing. [...] Obtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I accepting [...] At least might seem to hold all power of thee, [...] Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, [...] And storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie [...] Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern'd [...] And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest. [...] To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd: [...] Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; [...] 500 [...] For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, [...] Of the Messiah I have heard foretold [...] By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length [...] Announc't by Gabriel with the first I knew, [...] And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, [...] On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. [...] From that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye [...] Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, [...] Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; [...] Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all [...] 510 [...] Flock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest, [...] Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n [...] Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd. [...] Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view [...] And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn [...] In what degree or meaning thou art call'd [...] The Son of God, which bears no single sence; [...] The Son of God I also am, or was, [...] And if I was, I am; relation stands; [...] All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought [...] 520 [...] In some respect far higher so declar'd. [...] Therefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that hour, [...] And follow'd thee still on to this wast wild; [...] Where by all best conjectures I collect [...] Thou art to be my fatal enemy. [...] Good reason then, if I before-hand seek [...] To understand my Adversary, who [...] And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, [...] By parl, or composition, truce, or league [...] To win him, or win from him what I can. [...] 530 [...] And opportunity I here have had [...] To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee [...] Proof against all temptation as a rock [...] Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm [...] To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, [...] Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory [...] Have been before contemn'd, and may agen: [...] Therefore to know what more thou art then man, [...] Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav'n, [...] Another method I must now begin. [...] 540 [...] So saying he caught him up, and without wing [...] Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime [...] Over the Wilderness and o're the Plain; [...] Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, [...] The holy City lifted high her Towers, [...] And higher yet the glorious Temple rear'd [...] Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount [...] Of Alabaster, top't with golden Spires: [...] There on the highest Pinacle he set [...] The Son of God; and added thus in scorn: [...] 550 [...] There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright [...] Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house [...] Have brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is best, [...] Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, [...] Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: [...] For it is written, He will give command [...] Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands [...] They shall up lift thee, lest at any time [...] Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone. [...] To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, [...] 560 [...] Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. [...] But Satan smitten with amazement fell [...] As when Earths Son Antaeus (to compare [...] Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove [...] With Joves Alcides and oft foil'd still rose, [...] Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, [...] Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd, [...] Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell; [...] So after many a foil the Tempter proud, [...] Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride [...] 570 [...] Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. [...] And as that Theban Monster that propos'd [...] Her riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, devour'd; [...] That once found out and solv'd, for grief and spight [...] Cast her self headlong from th' Ismenian steep, [...] So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, [...] And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought [...] Joyless triumphals of his hop't success, [...] Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, [...] Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. [...] 580 [...] So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe [...] Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, [...] Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft [...] From his uneasie station, and upbore [...] As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, [...] Then in a flowry valley set him down [...] On a green bank, and set before him spred [...] A table of Celestial Food, Divine, [...] Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, [...] And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, [...] 590 [...] That soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd [...] What hunger, if aught hunger had impair'd, [...] Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires [...] Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory [...] Over temptation, and the Tempter proud. [...] True Image of the Father whether thron'd [...] In the bosom of bliss, and light of light [...] Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin'd [...] In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, [...] Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, [...] 600 [...] Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing [...] The Son of God, with Godlike force indu'd [...] Against th' Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, [...] And Thief of Paradise; him long of old [...] Thou didst debel, and down from Heav'n cast [...] With all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd [...] Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing [...] Temptation, hast regain'd lost Paradise, [...] And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: [...] He never more henceforth will dare set foot [...] 610 [...] In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: [...] For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail'd, [...] A fairer Paradise is founded now [...] For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou [...] A Saviour art come down to re-install. [...] Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be [...] Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. [...] But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long [...] Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star [...] Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav'n trod down [...] 620 [...] Under his feet: for proof, e're this thou feel'st [...] Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound [...] By this repulse receiv'd, and hold'st in Hell [...] No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues [...] Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe [...] To dread the Son of God: he all unarm'd [...] Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice [...] From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, [...] Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, [...] And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, [...] 630 [...] Lest he command them down into the deep [...] Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. [...] Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, [...] Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work [...] Now enter, and begin to save mankind. [...] Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek [...] Sling Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht [...] Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv'd [...] Home to his Mothers house private return'd.|$|E

[...] He brought our Saviour to the western side [...] Of that high mountain, whence he might behold [...] Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide, [...] Washed by the southern sea, and on the north [...] To equal length backed with a ridge of hills [...] That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men [...] 30 [...] From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst [...] Divided by a river, off whose banks [...] On each side an Imperial City stood, [...] With towers and temples proudly elevate [...] On seven small hills, with palaces adorned, [...] Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts, [...] Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs, [...] Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes [...] Above the highth of mountains interposed-- [...] By what strange parallax, or optic skill [...] 40 [...] Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass [...] Of telescope, were curious to enquire. [...] And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:-- [...] "The city which thou seest no other deem [...] Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth [...] So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched [...] Of nations. There the Capitol thou seest, [...] Above the rest lifting his stately head [...] On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel [...] Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine, [...] 50 [...] The imperial palace, compass huge, and high [...] The structure, skill of noblest architects, [...] With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, [...] Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires. [...] Many a fair edifice besides, more like [...] Houses of gods--so well I have disposed [...] My aerie microscope--thou may'st behold, [...] Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs [...] Carved work, the hand of famed artificers [...] In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold. [...] 60 [...] Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see [...] What conflux issuing forth, or entering in: [...] Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces [...] Hasting, or on return, in robes of state; [...] Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power; [...] Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings; [...] Or embassies from regions far remote, [...] In various habits, on the Appian road, [...] Or on the AEmilian--some from farthest south, [...] Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, [...] 70 [...] Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west, [...] The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea; [...] From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these), [...] From India and the Golden Chersoness, [...] And utmost Indian isle Taprobane, [...] Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed; [...] From Gallia, Gades, and the British west; [...] Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north [...] Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool. [...] All nations now to Rome obedience pay-- [...] 80 [...] To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain, [...] In ample territory, wealth and power, [...] Civility of manners, arts and arms, [...] And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer [...] Before the Parthian. These two thrones except, [...] The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, [...] Shared among petty kings too far removed; [...] These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all [...] The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory. [...] This Emperor hath no son, and now is old, [...] 90 [...] Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired [...] To Capreae, an island small but strong [...] On the Campanian shore, with purpose there [...] His horrid lusts in private to enjoy; [...] Committing to a wicked favourite [...] All public cares, and yet of him suspicious; [...] Hated of all, and hating. With what ease, [...] Endued with regal virtues as thou art, [...] Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, [...] Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne, [...] 100 [...] Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending, [...] A victor-people free from servile yoke! [...] And with my help thou may'st; to me the power [...] Is given, and by that right I give it thee. [...] Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world; [...] Aim at the highest; without the highest attained, [...] Will be for thee no sitting, or not long, [...] On David's throne, be prophesied what will." [...] To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:-- [...] "Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew [...] 110 [...] Of luxury, though called magnificence, [...] More than of arms before, allure mine eye, [...] Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell [...] Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts [...] On citron tables or Atlantic stone [...] (For I have also heard, perhaps have read), [...] Their wines of Setia, <b>Cales,</b> and Falerne, [...] Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold, [...] Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems [...] And studs of pearl--to me should'st tell, who thirst [...] 120 [...] And hunger still. Then embassies thou shew'st [...] From nations far and nigh! What honour that, [...] But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear [...] So many hollow compliments and lies, [...] Outlandish flatteries? Then proceed'st to talk [...] Of the Emperor, how easily subdued, [...] How gloriously. I shall, thou say'st, expel [...] A brutish monster: what if I withal [...] Expel a Devil who first made him such? [...] Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out; [...] 130 [...] For him I was not sent, nor yet to free [...] That people, victor once, now vile and base, [...] Deservedly made vassal--who, once just, [...] Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well, [...] But govern ill the nations under yoke, [...] Peeling their provinces, exhausted all [...] By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown [...] Of triumph, that insulting vanity; [...] Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured [...] Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed; [...] 140 [...] Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still, [...] And from the daily Scene effeminate. [...] What wise and valiant man would seek to free [...] These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved, [...] Or could of inward slaves make outward free? [...] Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit [...] On David's throne, it shall be like a tree [...] Spreading and overshadowing all the earth, [...] Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash [...] All monarchies besides throughout the world; [...] 150 [...] And of my Kingdom there shall be no end. [...] Means there shall be to this; but what the means [...] Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell." [...] To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:-- [...] "I see all offers made by me how slight [...] Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st. [...] Nothing will please the difficult and nice, [...] Or nothing more than still to contradict. [...] On the other side know also thou that I [...] On what I offer set as high esteem, [...] 160 [...] Nor what I part with mean to give for naught, [...] All these, which in a moment thou behold'st, [...] The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give [...] (For, given to me, I give to whom I please), [...] No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else-- [...] On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, [...] And worship me as thy superior Lord [...] (Easily done), and hold them all of me; [...] For what can less so great a gift deserve?" [...] Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:-- [...] 170 [...] "I never liked thy talk, thy offers less; [...] Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter [...] The abominable terms, impious condition. [...] But I endure the time, till which expired [...] Thou hast permission on me. It is written, [...] The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship [...] The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.' [...] And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound [...] To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed [...] For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve, [...] 180 [...] And more blasphemous; which expect to rue. [...] The kingdoms of the world to thee were given! [...] Permitted rather, and by thee usurped; [...] Other donation none thou canst produce. [...] If given, by whom but by the King of kings, [...] God over all supreme? If given to thee, [...] By thee how fairly is the Giver now [...] Repaid! But gratitude in thee is lost [...] Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame [...] As offer them to me, the Son of God-- [...] 190 [...] To me my own, on such abhorred pact, [...] That I fall down and worship thee as God? [...] Get thee behind me! Plain thou now appear'st [...] That Evil One, Satan for ever damned." [...] To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:-- [...] "Be not so sore offended, Son of God-- [...] Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men-- [...] If I, to try whether in higher sort [...] Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed [...] What both from Men and Angels I receive, [...] 200 [...] Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth [...] Nations besides from all the quartered winds-- [...] God of this World invoked, and World beneath. [...] Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold [...] To me most fatal, me it most concerns. [...] The trial hath indamaged thee no way, [...] Rather more honour left and more esteem; [...] Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed. [...] Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, [...] The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more [...] 210 [...] Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not. [...] And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined [...] Than to a worldly crown, addicted more [...] To contemplation and profound dispute; [...] As by that early action may be judged, [...] When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st [...] Alone into the Temple, there wast found [...] Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant [...] On points and questions fitting Moses' chair, [...] Teaching, not taught. The childhood shews the man, [...] 220 [...] As morning shews the day. Be famous, then, [...] By wisdom; as thy empire must extend, [...] So let extend thy mind o'er all the world [...] In knowledge; all things in it comprehend. [...] All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law, [...] The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote; [...] The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach [...] To admiration, led by Nature's light; [...] And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, [...] Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st. [...] 230 [...] Without their learning, how wilt thou with them, [...] Or they with thee, hold conversation meet? [...] How wilt thou reason with them, how refute [...] Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes? [...] Error by his own arms is best evinced. [...] Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount, [...] Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold [...] Where on the AEgean shore a city stands, [...] Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil-- [...] Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts [...] 240 [...] And Eloquence, native to famous wits [...] Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, [...] City or suburban, studious walks and shades. [...] See there the olive-grove of Academe, [...] Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird [...] Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long; [...] There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound [...] Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites [...] To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls [...] His whispering stream. Within the walls then view [...] 250 [...] The schools of ancient sages--his who bred [...] Great Alexander to subdue the world, [...] Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next. [...] There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power [...] Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit [...] By voice or hand, and various-measured verse, [...] AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes, [...] And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, [...] Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called, [...] Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own. [...] 260 [...] Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught [...] In chorus or iambic, teachers best [...] Of moral prudence, with delight received [...] In brief sententious precepts, while they treat [...] Of fate, and chance, and change in human life, [...] High actions and high passions best describing. [...] Thence to the famous Orators repair, [...] Those ancient whose resistless eloquence [...] Wielded at will that fierce democraty, [...] Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece [...] 270 [...] To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne. [...] To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, [...] From heaven descended to the low-roofed house [...] Of Socrates--see there his tenement-- [...] Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced [...] Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth [...] Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools [...] Of Academics old and new, with those [...] Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect [...] Epicurean, and the Stoic severe. [...] 280 [...] These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home, [...] Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight; [...] These rules will render thee a king complete [...] Within thyself, much more with empire joined." [...] To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:-- [...] "Think not but that I know these things; or, think [...] I know them not, not therefore am I short [...] Of knowing what I ought. He who receives [...] Light from above, from the Fountain of Light, [...] No other doctrine needs, though granted true; [...] 290 [...] But these are false, or little else but dreams, [...] Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. [...] The first and wisest of them all professed [...] To know this only, that he nothing knew; [...] The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits; [...] A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense; [...] Others in virtue placed felicity, [...] But virtue joined with riches and long life; [...] In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease; [...] The Stoic last in philosophic pride, [...] 300 [...] By him called virtue, and his virtuous man, [...] Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing, [...] Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, [...] As fearing God nor man, contemning all [...] Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life-- [...] Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can; [...] For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, [...] Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. [...] Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead, [...] Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, [...] 310 [...] And how the World began, and how Man fell, [...] Degraded by himself, on grace depending? [...] Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry; [...] And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves [...] All glory arrogate, to God give none; [...] Rather accuse him under usual names, [...] Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite [...] Of mortal things. Who, therefore, seeks in these [...] True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion [...] Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, [...] 320 [...] An empty cloud. However, many books, [...] Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads [...] Incessantly, and to his reading brings not [...] A spirit and judgment equal or superior, [...] (And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?) [...] Uncertain and unsettled still remains, [...] Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself, [...] Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys [...] And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge, [...] As children gathering pebbles on the shore. [...] 330 [...] Or, if I would delight my private hours [...] With music or with poem, where so soon [...] As in our native language can I find [...] That solace? All our Law and Story strewed [...] With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed, [...] Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon [...] That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare [...] That rather Greece from us these arts derived-- [...] Ill imitated while they loudest sing [...] The vices of their deities, and their own, [...] 340 [...] In fable, hymn, or song, so personating [...] Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. [...] Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid [...] As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest, [...] Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight, [...] Will far be found unworthy to compare [...] With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling, [...] Where God is praised aright and godlike men, [...] The Holiest of Holies and his Saints [...] (Such are from God inspired, not such from thee); [...] 350 [...] Unless where moral virtue is expressed [...] By light of Nature, not in all quite lost. [...] Their orators thou then extoll'st as those [...] The top of eloquence--statists indeed, [...] And lovers of their country, as may seem; [...] But herein to our Prophets far beneath, [...] As men divinely taught, and better teaching [...] The solid rules of civil government, [...] In their majestic, unaffected style, [...] Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome. [...] 360 [...] In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, [...] What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so, [...] What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat; [...] These only, with our Law, best form a king." [...] So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now [...] Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent), [...] Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:-- [...] "Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts, [...] Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught [...] By me proposed in life contemplative [...] 370 [...] Or active, tended on by glory or fame, [...] What dost thou in this world? The Wilderness [...] For thee is fittest place: I found thee there, [...] And thither will return thee. Yet remember [...] What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause [...] To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus [...] Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid, [...] Which would have set thee in short time with ease [...] On David's throne, or throne of all the world, [...] Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, [...] 380 [...] When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled. [...] Now, contrary--if I read aught in heaven, [...] Or heaven write aught of fate--by what the stars [...] Voluminous, or single characters [...] In their conjunction met, give me to spell, [...] Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate, [...] Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries, [...] Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death. [...] A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom, [...] Real or allegoric, I discern not; [...] 390 [...] Nor when: eternal sure--as without end, [...] Without beginning; for no date prefixed [...] Directs me in the starry rubric set." [...] So saying, he took (for still he knew his power [...] Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness [...] Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there, [...] Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose, [...] As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night, [...] Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both, [...] Privation mere of light and absent day. [...] 400 [...] Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind [...] After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore, [...] Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest, [...] Wherever, under some concourse of shades, [...] Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield [...] From dews and damps of night his sheltered head; [...] But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head [...] The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams [...] Disturbed his sleep. And either tropic now [...] 'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds [...] 410 [...] From many a horrid rift abortive poured [...] Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire, [...] In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds [...] Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad [...] From the four hinges of the world, and fell [...] On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines, [...] Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks, [...] Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, [...] Or torn up sheer. Ill wast thou shrouded then, [...] O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st [...] 420 [...] Unshaken! Nor yet staid the terror there: [...] Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round [...] Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked, [...] Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou [...] Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace. [...] Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair [...] Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey, [...] Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar [...] Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds, [...] And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised [...] 430 [...] To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. [...] And now the sun with more effectual beams [...] Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet [...] From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds, [...] Who all things now behold more fresh and green, [...] After a night of storm so ruinous, [...] Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray, [...] To gratulate the sweet return of morn. [...] Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn, [...] Was absent, after all his mischief done, [...] 440 [...] The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem [...] Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came; [...] Yet with no new device (they all were spent), [...] Rather by this his last affront resolved, [...] Desperate of better course, to vent his rage [...] And mad despite to be so oft repelled. [...] Him walking on a sunny hill he found, [...] Backed on the north and west by a thick wood; [...] Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape, [...] And in a careless mood thus to him said:-- [...] 450 [...] "Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God, [...] After a dismal night. I heard the wrack, [...] As earth and sky would mingle; but myself [...] Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them, [...] As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven, [...] Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath, [...] Are to the main as inconsiderable [...] And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze [...] To man's less universe, and soon are gone. [...] Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light [...] 460 [...] On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent, [...] Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, [...] Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point, [...] They oft fore-signify and threaten ill. [...] This tempest at this desert most was bent; [...] Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. [...] Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject [...] The perfect season offered with my aid [...] To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong [...] All to the push of fate, pursue thy way [...] 470 [...] Of gaining David's throne no man knows when [...] (For both the when and how is nowhere told), [...] Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt; [...] For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing [...] The time and means? Each act is rightliest done [...] Not when it must, but when it may be best. [...] If thou observe not this, be sure to find [...] What I foretold thee--many a hard assay [...] Of dangers, and adversities, and pains, [...] Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold; [...] 480 [...] Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round, [...] So many terrors, voices, prodigies, [...] May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign." [...] So talked he, while the Son of God went on, [...] And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:-- [...] "Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm [...] Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none. [...] I never feared they could, though noising loud [...] And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs [...] Betokening or ill-boding I contemn [...] 490 [...] As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; [...] Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing, [...] Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting, [...] At least might seem to hold all power of thee, [...] Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God; [...] And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify [...] Me to thy will! Desist (thou art discerned, [...] And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest." [...] To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:-- [...] "Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born! [...] 500 [...] For Son of God to me is yet in doubt. [...] Of the Messiah I have heard foretold [...] By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length [...] Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew, [...] And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field, [...] On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. [...] From that time seldom have I ceased to eye [...] Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, [...] Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; [...] Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all [...] 510 [...] Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest [...] (Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven [...] Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved. [...] Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view [...] And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn [...] In what degree or meaning thou art called [...] The Son of God, which bears no single sense. [...] The Son of God I also am, or was; [...] And, if I was, I am; relation stands: [...] All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought [...] 520 [...] In some respect far higher so declared. [...] Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour, [...] And followed thee still on to this waste wild, [...] Where, by all best conjectures, I collect [...] Thou art to be my fatal enemy. [...] Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek [...] To understand my adversary, who [...] And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent; [...] By parle or composition, truce or league, [...] To win him, or win from him what I can. [...] 530 [...] And opportunity I here have had [...] To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee [...] Proof against all temptation, as a rock [...] Of adamant and as a centre, firm [...] To the utmost of mere man both wise and good, [...] Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory, [...] Have been before contemned, and may again. [...] Therefore, to know what more thou art than man, [...] Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven, [...] Another method I must now begin." [...] 540 [...] So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing [...] Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime, [...] Over the wilderness and o'er the plain, [...] Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, [...] The Holy City, lifted high her towers, [...] And higher yet the glorious Temple reared [...] Her pile, far off appearing like a mount [...] Of alablaster, topt with golden spires: [...] There, on the highest pinnacle, he set [...] The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:-- [...] 550 [...] "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright [...] Will ask thee skill. I to thy Father's house [...] Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best. [...] Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand, [...] Cast thyself down. Safely, if Son of God; [...] For it is written, 'He will give command [...] Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands [...] They shall uplift thee, lest at any time [...] Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'" [...] To whom thus Jesus: [...] "Also it is written, [...] 560 [...] 'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'" [...] He said, and stood; [...] But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell. [...] As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare [...] Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove [...] With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose, [...] Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, [...] Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined, [...] Throttled at length in the air expired and fell, [...] So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud, [...] Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride [...] 570 [...] Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall; [...] And, as that Theban monster that proposed [...] Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured, [...] That once found out and solved, for grief and spite [...] Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep, [...] So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend, [...] And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought [...] Joyless triumphals of his hoped success, [...] Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, [...] Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. [...] 580 [...] So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe [...] Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, [...] Who on their plumy vans received Him soft [...] From his uneasy station, and upbore, [...] As on a floating couch, through the blithe air; [...] Then, in a flowery valley, set him down [...] On a green bank, and set before him spread [...] A table of celestial food, divine [...] Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life, [...] And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink, [...] 590 [...] That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired [...] What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired, [...] Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires [...] Sung heavenly anthems of his victory [...] Over temptation and the Tempter proud:-- [...] "True Image of the Father, whether throned [...] In the bosom of bliss, and light of light [...] Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined [...] In fleshly tabernacle and human form, [...] Wandering the wilderness--whatever place, [...] 600 [...] Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing [...] The Son of God, with Godlike force endued [...] Against the attempter of thy Father's throne [...] And thief of Paradise! Him long of old [...] Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast [...] With all his army; now thou hast avenged [...] Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing [...] Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise, [...] And frustrated the conquest fraudulent. [...] He never more henceforth will dare set foot [...] 610 [...] In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke. [...] For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed, [...] A fairer Paradise is founded now [...] For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou, [...] A Saviour, art come down to reinstall; [...] Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be, [...] Of tempter and temptation without fear. [...] But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long [...] Rule in the clouds. Like an autumnal star, [...] Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down [...] 620 [...] Under his feet. For proof, ere this thou feel'st [...] Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound) [...] By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell [...] No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues [...] Thy bold attempt. Hereafter learn with awe [...] To dread the Son of God. He, all unarmed, [...] Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice, [...] From thy demoniac holds, possession foul-- [...] Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly, [...] And beg to hide them in a herd of swine, [...] 630 [...] Lest he command them down into the Deep, [...] Bound, and to torment sent before their time. [...] Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds, [...] Queller of Satan! On thy glorious work [...] Now enter, and begin to save Mankind." [...] Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek, [...] Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed, [...] Brought on his way with joy. He, unobserved, [...] Home to his mother's house private returned.|$|E
