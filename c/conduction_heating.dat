50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or fire tube Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The fire tube boiler arrangement utilizes <b>conduction</b> <b>heating</b> which transfers heat from physical contact. Fire tube boilers are not commonly used due to their method of <b>conduction</b> <b>heating</b> because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|E

50|$|Many other {{derivative}} parameters may {{be calculated}} for each weld, yielding confidence in a production environment that is notably more difficult to achieve in conduction transfer systems, where analysis, if present is generally post-weld as relatively large thermal mass of heating and conduction elements combined impair rapid temperature change. Inductive heating with quantitative feedback such as that provided by power analysis techniques further allows {{for the possibility of}} dynamic adjustments in energy delivery profile to the target. This opens the possibility of feed-forward systems where the induction generator properties are adjusted in near real-time as the heating process proceeds, allowing for a specific heating profile track and subsequent compliance feedback - something that is not generally practical for <b>conduction</b> <b>heating</b> processes.|$|E
50|$|Enhancements for {{improving}} the effectiveness of SVE can include directional drilling, pneumatic and hydraulic fracturing, and thermal enhancement (e.g., hot air or steam injection). Directional drilling and fracturing enhancements are generally intended to improve the gas flow through the subsurface, especially in lower permeability zones. Thermal enhancements such as hot air or steam injection increase the subsurface soil temperature, thereby improving the volatility of the contamination. In addition, injection of hot (dry) air can remove soil moisture and thus improve the gas permeability of the soil. Additional thermal technologies (such as electrical resistance heating, six-phase soil heating, radio-frequency heating, or thermal <b>conduction</b> <b>heating)</b> {{can be applied to}} the subsurface to heat the soil and volatilize/desorb contaminants, but these are generally viewed as separate technologies (versus a SVE enhancement) that may use vacuum extraction (or other methods) for collecting soil gas.|$|E

This ''standardized'' curve was then used, through Duhamel's superposition theorem, to calculate product temperatures for time-varying retort temperature profiles. Limitations associated with the application of Duhamel's theorem were also transferred to the proposed methodology.

40|$|Convection is {{the primary}} heat {{transfer}} mechanism for most foods heated in an earth-based environment.

This fact poses a problem for food heating during space flight. A numerical model has been developed to evaluate this problem. This model simulates the food-heating process for Skylab.
