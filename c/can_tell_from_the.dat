The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> density of impact craters on the surface.

Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.|$|E
25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, {{as well as a}} spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E

Carlos Quintana from About.com gave the DVD {{a very positive}} review and praised the selection of songs, saying they were reflective of Shakira's [...] "evolution as an artist", and also commended her talent and performance, writing, [...] "Besides her sensual dancing, unique voice and great energy, you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> images on the DVD {{she is a very}} professional artist who takes her job very seriously". He concluded by calling the audio CD of Live from Paris a [...] "compilation [...] covers in a good way her musical spectrum" [...] and the DVD [...] "fantastic" [...] due to [...] "the high quality of the sound and the video"; he also commented that the live album [...] "offers a good overview of Shakira's musical career". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic complimented the energy of the audio CD and Shakira's versatility, commenting she [...] "leans heavily on glitzy electro-dance crossovers but finds room for quieter moments, whether it’s a stripped-down cover of Metallica's [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] or her own [...] "Gypsy", keeping the momentum running throughout a lengthy set, then bringing down the house with [...] "Waka Waka". He, however, found the video versions much more impressive, opining that they [...] "give a greater indication {{of the size of the}} spectacle" [...] and [...] "emphasize Shakira's intense charisma". Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a mixed review; he praised the visual show Shakira put up, but was critical of her vocals, saying [...] "she writhes and dry-humps through her catalog like the world's highest-paid strip-aerobics instructor, showing off plenty of skin — but sadly, not much musicianship". He also felt that Shakira's performance was too sexual, commenting that she [...] "sometimes comes off more stripper than superstar". The album was nominated [...] "Best Live DVD" [...] at the 2012 Premios Shock awards ceremony, ...|$|E

60|$|Yes, it is {{very good}} to get away once more {{and pick up the}} old and ever fresh {{business}} of the vagrant, loafing through new towns, learned in the manners of dogs, babies, and perambulators half the world over, and tracking the seasons by the up-growth of flowers in stranger-people's gardens. St. Paul, standing at the barn-door of the Dakota and Minnesota granaries, is all things to all men except to Minneapolis, eleven miles away, whom she hates and by whom she is patronised. She calls herself the capital of the North-West, the new North-West, and her citizens wear, not only the tall silk hat of trade, but the soft slouch of the West. She talks in another tongue than the New Yorker, and--sure sign that we are far across the continent--her papers argue with the San Francisco ones over rate wars and the competition of railway companies. St. Paul has been established many years, and if one were reckless enough {{to go down to the}} business quarters one would hear all about her and more also. But the residential parts of the town are the crown of it. In common with scores of other cities, broad-crowned suburbs--using the word in the English sense--that make the stranger jealous. You get here what you do not get in the city--well-paved or asphalted roads, planted with trees, and trim side-walks, studded with houses of individuality, not boorishly fenced off from each other, but standing each on its plot of well-kept turf running down to the pavement. It is always Sunday in these streets of a morning. The cable-car has taken the men down town to business, the children are at school, and the big dogs, three and a third to each absent child, lie nosing the winter-killed grass and wondering when the shoots will make it possible for a gentleman to take his spring medicine. In the afternoon, the children on tricycles stagger up and down the asphalt with due proportion of big dogs at each wheel; the cable-cars coming up hill begin to drop the men each at his own door--the door of the house that he builded for himself (though the architect incited him to that vile little attic tower and useless loggia), and, naturally enough, twilight brings the lovers walking two by two along the very quiet ways. You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> houses almost the exact period at which they were built, whether in the jig-saw days, when if behoved respectability to use unlovely turned rails and pierced gable-ends, or during the Colonial craze, which means white paint and fluted pillars, or in the latest domestic era, a most pleasant mixture, that is, of stained shingles, hooded dormer-windows, cunning verandas, and recessed doors. Seeing these things, one begins to understand why the Americans visiting England are impressed with the old and not with the new. He is not much more than a hundred years ahead of the English in design, comfort, and economy, and (this is most important) labour-saving appliances in his house. From Newport to San Diego you will find the same thing to-day.|$|E
