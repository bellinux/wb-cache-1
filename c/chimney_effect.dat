5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar <b>chimney</b> <b>effect</b> (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar <b>chimney</b> <b>effect</b> has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the <b>chimney</b> <b>effect</b> wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat.

25|$|A chimney is a {{structure}} that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, {{to ensure that the}} gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in {{what is known as the}} stack, or <b>chimney</b> <b>effect.</b> The space inside a chimney is called a flue. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, and the term funnel can also be used.|$|E
25|$|The shaft was {{elevated}} as {{it moved}} toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in via an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from outside air (also allowing miners to easily enter and exit the work area). The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran {{the entire length of}} the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine via the <b>chimney</b> <b>effect.</b> The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the location where the miners were working. This precluded the need for additional ventilation shafts that could have been observed by the enemy, and served well in disguising the diggers' progress.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the natural}} {{convection}} heat transfer from chimney-based radial heat sinks was investigated numerically and experimentally. The thermal {{performance of a}} radial heat sink with chimney was estimated and {{compared with that of}} a radial heat sink without a <b>chimney.</b> The <b>effects</b> on the heat sinks' thermal performance were investigated in regard to the orientation angle with respect to gravity (0 degrees <= theta <= 180 degrees), the fin number (15 <= N <= 30), and the distance between the base plate and chimney (5 mm <= H-c <= 25 mm). The results show that there exist optimal values for and N. The orientation angles 0 degrees and 45 degrees result in slightly better thermal performance than 135 degrees and 180 degrees, while 90 degrees results in the worst thermal performance.

50|$|The great {{advantage}} of the tube anemometer {{lies in the fact}} that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the <b>chimney,</b> an <b>effect</b> may be produced equal to a wind of 10 mi/h (16 km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.|$|R

50|$|An {{empirical}} {{application of}} the principle was in widespread use on steam locomotives before its formal development as the injector, {{in the form of}} the arrangement of the blastpipe and chimney in the locomotive smokebox. The sketch on the right shows a cross section through a smokebox, rotated 90 degrees; it can be seen that the same components are present, albeit differently named, as in the generic diagram of an injector at the top of the article. Exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed through a nozzle on the end of the blastpipe, to reduce pressure inside the smokebox by entraining the flue gases from the boiler which are then ejected via the <b>chimney.</b> The <b>effect</b> is to increase the draught on the fire to a degree proportional to the rate of steam consumption, so that as more steam is used, more heat is generated from the fire and steam production is also increased. The effect was first noted by Richard Trevithick and subsequently developed empirically by the early locomotive engineers; Stephenson's Rocket made use of it, and this constitutes much of the reason for its notably improved performance in comparison with contemporary machines.|$|R

40|$|Building {{ventilation}} {{is crucial}} for improving the indoor air quality and thermal comfort. Nowadays, mechanical ventilation systems such as air conditioning and fans are most commonly used in buildings. However, these devices consume a lot of electricity which is mainly generated from the combustion of fossil fuels, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases and thereby contributing to climate change. Consequently, {{it is essential to}} switch to natural ventilation systems which are environmentally friendly as they are based on renewable sources of energy. One such type of natural ventilation system is the solar chimney which can either be roof-mounted or wall-mounted in buildings. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a mathematical model for assessing the thermal performance of roof-mounted (inclined) and wall-mounted (vertical) solar chimneys. The model was validated using numerical simulations in MATLAB. Different configurations of solar chimneys were designed and modelled in MATLAB in order to compare their performances, in terms of the ventilation rate expressed as the number of air changes per hour, ACH. Raw climatic data, including the intensities of global and diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal plane, wind speed and ambient temperature were obtained for Stellenbosch, located in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.

40|$|The Vestnesa Ridge {{marks the}} {{northern}} boundary of a known submarine gas hydrate province {{in the west}} Svalbard margin. Several seafloor pockmarks at the eastern segment of the ridge are sites of active methane venting. Until recently, seismic reflection data was the main tool for imaging beneath the ridge. Coincident controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM), high-resolution two-dimensional (2 D) airgun, sweep frequency SYSIF and three-dimensional (3 D) p-cable seismic reflection data were acquired at the south-eastern part of the ridge between 2011 and 2013. The CSEM and seismic data contains profiles across and along the ridge, passing several active and inactive pockmarks. Joint interpretation of resistivity models obtained from CSEM and seismic reflection data provides new information regarding the fluid composition beneath the pockmarks. There is considerable variation in transverse resistance and seismic reflection characteristics of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) between the ridge flanks and chimneys beneath pockmarks. Layered seismic reflectors on the flanks are associated with around 300 Ωm 2 transverse resistance, whereas the seismic reflectors within the chimneys exhibit amplitude blanking and chaotic patterns. The transverse resistance of the GHSZ within the chimneys vary between 400 and 1200 Ωm 2. Variance attributes obtained from the 3 D p-cable data also highlight faults and chimneys, which coincide with the resistivity anomalies. Based on the joint data interpretation, widespread gas hydrate presence is likely at the ridge, with both hydrates and free gas contained within the faults and chimneys. However, at the active <b>chimneys</b> the <b>effect</b> of gas likely dominate the resistive anomalies...|$|R

Numerical investigations of the indoor thermal comfort condition in a simple office space governed by the solar <b>chimney</b> stack <b>effect</b> have been undertaken using CFD techniques. A mathematical model was developed based on the relevant analytical framework governing the phenomena to simulate the velocity flow field and temperature distribution on the designated plane within the indoor space. Boussinesq approximation was incorporated to numerical scheme with realistic boundary conditions for flow simulation. The model was enriched by incorporating a sufficient fluid volume to represent environment surrounding the space and thereby eliminating the entry effect to the flow. Hexahedral cells were used in a non-uniform grid distribution to minimise numerical diffusion. A fine mesh is used near the walls to enhance the resolution and accuracy resolving the problems under the turbulent flow conditions. Grid independence analysis was carried out to ensure {{the accuracy of the}} numerical results. Under-relaxation factors 0. 3, 1, 2, 0. 8, 0. 8, 1, 0. 9 for pressure, density, momentum, turbulence kinetic energy, turbulence dissipation rate, turbulent viscosity, energy respectively were used. The model outputs were compared with the available experimental measurements taken under the same condition to calibrate the numerical scheme. A parametric study was carried out using the calibrated model to assess the distribution of thermal comfort index against the changes in geometrical and solar radiation parameters. The values of activity, metabolic rate for seated activity and clothing insulation were selected as 0, 60 W/m 2 and 0. 5 Clo respectively for thermal performance analysis.
