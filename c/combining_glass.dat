When Henrik Conrad died in 1888 in Moscow he left {{everything}} to his three daughters. His sons, in his opinion, had received an expensive upbringing and training which was to be their sole legacy. To make it possible to continue the business, his eldest son Wilhelm James Andreevitch Bolin opened a branch for his St. Petersburg cousins called C. E. Bolin. He continued on his own in Moscow, very much in the old tradition and was especially interested in silverware, bringing in young French sculptors as designers and making magnificent pieces in the somewhat overladen style of the 1880s. Eventually, he adopted the Art Nouveau style, often <b>combining</b> <b>glass</b> (Lalique), ceramics and cut crystal with silver mounts. In 1912 he took over the Moscow shop in his own name W.A.

The lower tower was an early example of the luxury high-rise residential buildings by star architects in the center large cities which became very popular in the early 21st century. The office tower has a discreetly peculiar form; the east façade bulges out slightly from its base, reaching its maximum width at the top floors. The curved and twisted shape of east the façade echoes that of the Sydney Opera House on the harbor.

40|$|This practice-led {{research}} {{investigates the}} feasibility of <b>combining</b> <b>glass</b> and ceramics in a hot state, {{as a means of}} artistic expression in studio practice. Glass and ceramics have many related material qualities and are processed in similar ways. Chemically they are alike however structurally they are very different, which creates compatibility problems when they are combined in a hot state. Through controlled processing, material properties can alter when each is partially converted into the other. It is recognised by artists in the field of studio ceramics that porcelain can partially convert into a glassy form when high fired to create a translucent material. Likewise it is recognised in the field of industrial engineering that glass can partially convert into a ceramic form when processed in a controlled way to create a glass-ceramic material; this material is not used by practitioners and would be difficult to develop in a studio environment. A total of 43 contemporary practitioners were found that worked in both glass & ceramics in their work. Of these only 16 practitioners combined glass and ceramics in a hot state, the majority combined them in a cold state to avoid compatibility issues. It became apparent that there is a distinct lack of published material on the combination of glass and ceramics in studio practice. It was the aim of this investigation to address this gap by identifying and testing potential hot state processing routes. This research addresses these issues through a multiple-method approach rooted in creative practice; directed by the following aims: • To develop the practical and creative parameters of the combination of glass and ceramics in a hot state. • To demonstrate and articulate the possible creative and practical benefits of the new processing routes as a model for practitioners in the field. • To articulate the significance of the research methods and results through the mapping of the field. Material testing was focused on artistic practice and experimentation which identified the creative parameters of <b>combining</b> <b>glass</b> and ceramics in a hot state, four potential process routes that combine glass and ceramics in a hot state were identified and tested. This testing was further extended and supported by the application of compatibility studies, which helped to match the expansion rates of glass and ceramics when they are combined. Bone china was identified as the closest fit to glass in terms of expansion rates; quartz was added to further improve the fit of the materials. Case studies of artists that work in glass and ceramics have been used to position the research within the field. New insights have emerged into the combined processing of glass and ceramics in a hot state. This approach offers a series of potential processing routes to be viewed as a model for others in the field. The final submission includes a thesis, a series of materials tests, and a body of related artworks that demonstrate the hot state combination of the materials...|$|E
40|$|Embedding screenprinted {{transfers}} is one {{of several}} processes that can be used by artists as a means of expression to decorate blown glass forms. When screenprinted transfers are embedded into layers of glass and inflated, the imagery can be affected by a number of factors that limit the process. These limitations can include stretching and distortion of imagery, loss of density resulting in faded imagery and loss of clarity and detail of the imagery. Compatibility issues can also result in the artwork cracking. These limitations can result in the artworks being deemed unfit for their purpose, particularly when created for exhibition. This research addressed these limitations through the development of seven print inspired glass processes that alleviated or improved the limitations and provided alternative decorative processes to the use of printed transfers. This was achieved using a multi-method practice led research methodology approached {{from the perspective of a}} professional glass artist. To substantiate the research, several bodies of artwork were produced that developed and demonstrated the practicality and creative potential of the creative print inspired glass processes and extended the repertoire of visual effects that can be achieved when decorating blown glass forms.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method to produce marine aggregates from natural organic material {{based on the}} sticking properties of transparent exopolymeric particles. Seawater samples were prescreened and ultrafiltered to concentrate the 30 kDa to 10 mu m size fraction. First, we produced small magnetizable aggregates by <b>combining</b> <b>glass</b> microfibers and paramagnetic 1 -mu m beads with the organic matter present in the concentrated solution. The second step involved clustering the small aggregates into a single macro-aggregate, using a small ring-shaped magnet as an aggregation nucleus. Viral and bacterial densities, determined after dissolution of the newly formed aggregates with methanol, averaged 13. 8 x 10 (6) +/- 3. 6 x 10 (6) vir. agg. (- 1) and 4. 1 x 10 (6) +/- 1. 1 x 10 (6) bact. agg. (- 1). Bacterial respiration and production measurements of single aggregates averaged 8. 47 +/- 1. 72 nmol O- 2 agg. (- 1) h(- 1) and 1. 54 +/- 0. 45 ng C agg. (- 1) h(- 1), respectively. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen content of the newly formed macro-aggregates averaged 31. 92 +/- 2. 67 mu g C agg.

This approach allows the concentration and isolation of the organic matter precursors that compose natural aggregates and provides a simple protocol for recombining those precursors into single newly formed macro-aggregates, which can then be easily manipulated for further investigation. This method is a new tool for investigations into the interactions between microorganisms and marine aggregates and their implications at the ecosystem level, but also into the interactions between aggregates and dissolved organic or inorganic substances...|$|E

The pate de verre process allows one to cast practically any conceivable form into a glass object. Prior to beginning, however, one should give same consideration to the entire process its possibilities and its limitations. Beginning with making glass frit, the techniques covered include experimentation an <b>combining</b> <b>glass</b> frit with ceramic frits to achieve a variety of surfaces not normally available with one glass formula. The ingredients of the plaster mold used to contain the glass frit as it is fired will change based on different properties of each constituent and the effects each has {{in combination with the}} other materials and on the glass. Individual personal style and experimentation are the best determinant of which plaster formula and method of casting the mold will produce a superior glass casting. The final stage in the pate de verre process is firing the mold which has been packed with frit to a high enough temperature to melt the glass. The kiln is held {{for a period of time}} at the high temperature to allow the frit to fuse completely, flow into and fill the mold. 2 The pate de verre process is flexible, allowing one to sculpt glass into forms not normally achieved with other glass-working processes. The glass casting, once fired, takes en characteristics that evoke other media marble, quartz, stone quite unlike our normal associations with glass. Yet the piece retains that quality of glass I find most fascinating and alluring the ability to capture the light that passes into the glass body and reflect it back out. It is these characteristics the enduring appearance of material and the hint of life and glow from within that enable my sculptural work to begin to speak about life and its struggles, our fragility and our strength...|$|E
40|$|FiberCore Europe is a Dutch company, {{specialized}} {{in the design}} and manufacturing of composite, load-bearing structures for architecture and infrastructure. The company’s main focus is on bridges and lock gates made from glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP). The price for currently produced GFRP bridges longer than approximately 26 meter is often higher than the price for bridges made from conventional steel or reinforced concrete. FiberCore Europe is looking for ways to lower the material costs for longer composite bridges to expand their market. This research focusses on two solutions to lower the material costs. These solutions are based on the implementation of stiffer material in the current GFRP bridge concept. Doing so yields a hybrid composite structure. The two materials addressed in this study are structural steel and standard modulus carbon fibers. <b>Combining</b> <b>glass</b> fibers, polyester and fully embedded steel or carbon fibers in large, load-bearing civil engineering structures is a new topic. This requires research on material behavior and design modelling. Tests are performed to assess the corrosion characteristics of steel embedded in GFRP and the strength of the adhesive bond between GFRP and steel. A comparison of 14 different carbon fiber fabrics was made to determine the most suitable carbon fabric in combination with a polyester matrix. Hybrid carbon-glass-polyester laminates were built and tested. A design model has been created to compare different hybrid design sub-concepts {{with each other and with}} the reference GFRP bridge. The model is implemented in a Microsoft Excel design tool. The tool shows that it is possible to lower the material costs, the mass and the design height of a GFRP bridge simultaneously by embedding steel. Carbon fibers can lower the mass and the design height of the bridge even more, but only at increased material costs. Initial concerns with respect to the interfacial bond strength between carbon fibers and polyester were confirmed. Taking the total costs of ownership into account, hybrid composite bridges are cheaper than bridges from conventional materials. This is mainly due to the savings on maintenance costs over a design lifetime of 100 years. Design and Production of Composite StructuresAerospace Structures and MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
