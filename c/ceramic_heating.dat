40|$|Graduation date: 1986 This report {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers {{for use in a}} combined-cycle, wood-fired power plant. The combined-cycle system investigated is characterized by having a wood-fueled combustor, an indirect-fired gas turbine, and a Rankine steam cycle. The direct use of low-grade fuels, such as wood, in present gas turbines will present difficulties due to corrosion and erosion of the turbine components from the particulate matter in the exhaust gases. This difficulty can be overcome by indirectly firing the gas turbine with the transfer of energy from the combustion gases to the compressor air by means of a heat exchanger. Gas turbines suitable for this type of power plant operate at their maximum efficiency at the rated turbine inlet temperature, typically in the range of 1750 F. Modern ceramics exhibit excellent high temperature strength, and hence a <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger is considered a very suitable candidate for such applications. In the power plant considered, air enters the heat exchanger at 540 F where it is heated to the turbine inlet temperature. Since a compact unit with low leakage was desired, a multiple gas-side pass, cross-flow heat exchanger was selected for the present application. A model was developed to simulate the <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. This model was used to size a heat exchanger for the power plant. The influence of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger on the overall power plant performance were analyzed. The other plant components were simulated by using a computer code developed during previous studies of this power plant. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger system was compared with a metallic heat exchanger system.

Finally, the <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger system was compared to other possible methods of obtaining a high turbine inlet temperature. The results of the study indicate that the use of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger has good potential for this type of power plant.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work was the development of electro-conductive ceramic screen printing pastes. By screen printing these pastes on ceramic substrates microstructured <b>ceramic</b> <b>heating</b> elements were developed, covering the temperature range from room temperature up to about 1000 C. Until now, no commercial pastes are available for this high temperature region. The scope of the work comprises the development of screen printing pastes of three different materials: Al_ 2 O_ 3 /TiN, Si_ 3 N_ 4 /TiN and Indium-Tin-Oxide (In_ 2 _-_xSn_xO_ 3). The paste optimisation was conducted to accomplish the prerequisites for a dense sintered microstructure of the layers leading to reproducible electrical properties. Furthermore the rheological properties of the pastes were adjusted in order to yield an optimised printing result. Microstructured ceramic resistance heating elements, screen printed onto alumina substrates could be realized for the material combination Al_ 2 O_ 3 /TiN and for In_ 2 _-_xSn_xO_ 3, whereas Si 3 N 4 /TiN showed severe deficiencies.

40|$|Much of the {{material}} science gained in microgravity research requires processing a sample in a high performance furnace. One such furnace currently being designed is the Quench Module Insert (QMI). The Principle Investigators, for whom the furnace is proposed, require high temperature gradients in their cylindrical samples to achieve the science objectives. One of the components critical to achieving high sample axial temperature gradients in the Quench Module Insert is a high performance cold zone to extract {{the heat from the}} sample. This cold zone employs a compliant, sliding thermal interface based on a Vel-Therm felt. This felt provides a conductive path between the Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) exterior surface and the interior surface of the water cooled chill block while allowing movement of the sample relative to the chill block. The Vel-Therm felt is composed of long polymer-based fibers affixed to a thin flexible substrate layer. The fibers are oriented perpendicular to this substrate giving the felt the appearance of a velvet fabric. The Vel-Therm felt heat extraction capability was quantified in earlier tests performed in an inert gas environment. The current activity, described in this paper, is intended to characterize the extraction capability of Vel-Therm felt in a vacuum environment similar to the QMI environment. This testing is necessary to quantify the thermal performance of the Vel-Therm felt and the sensitivity of that performance to key variables. The data derived from these tests will be incorporated into the current thermal models {{to improve the quality of}} the models and reduce uncertainty of the analytical results. In addition, the data will be used to help select the appropriate Vel-Therm felt and set proper operating limits as well as assess the performance range of the furnace. The objective of this test is to measure the heat extraction rate of the Vel-Therm felt as specified by the effective heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, the test setup was designed to force the bulk of the heat transfer through the area where the Vel-Therm felt was applied. A heat source, consisting of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>heating</b> element encased in a Copper (Cu) housing is mounted on four isolated support rods. A 6 -layer molybdenum radiation shield is used to insulate against heat loss from the heater and prevent heat exchange between the hot and cold sides of the test apparatus. The Vel-Therm felt is affixed to the surface of the cold sink, a water-cooled Cu chill block. An adjustable plate supports and isolates the cold sink from above and is used to control the amount of the deflection of the Vel- Therm when in contact with the Cu heating element housing. The primary means of establishing the power being conducted through the felt is to measure the energy being transferred to the water passing through the chill block. Analysis was performed to support the assumption that the source and sink surfaces were approximately isothermal under the specific test conditions. As a check on the amount of power passing through the felt, the power supplied to the heater was also measured. Thermocouples were strategically located throughout the test apparatus for measurement purposes. A bell jar was lowered over the assembly to impose vacuum conditions. Currently, variables tested have been fiber compression and fiber type and surface temperatures (both the hot and cold side temperatures are hypothesized to be important to the performance of the Vel-Therm.) Selected runs were repeated to ensure consistency and repeatability. Results obtained thus far reveal that Vel-Therm performance is significantly degraded by fibers being exposed to high compression. It also shows that performance is somewhat negatively impacted by previous compression, thereby, raising the question of repeatability. In addition, early results show a significant dependence on temperature. A computer aided mathematical analysis of the test setup is ongoing. The results will be correlated to actual results. The correlation will examine such details as parasitic loses, conduction down the power leads and many other concerns...|$|E
