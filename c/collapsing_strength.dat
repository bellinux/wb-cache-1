The frame structure of the unit-cell was analyzed using the finite element method. The plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> was determined when the joints of ligaments became plastic hinges under the assumption of elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior of the metallic material. Both elastic modulus and plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> were computed using a single step of finite element analysis without any iterative or incremental procedure.

The next study considered the effective elastic moduli and plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strengths</b> of the same metallic foams filled with a viscoelastic material. For this study, the unit-cell model was modified. The model considered the ligament frame structure supported by viscoelastic foundation that represented the filler material. In order to validate the unit-cell models, experiments were also conducted. The experimental data agreed very well with the predicted values of both stiffness and strength. Proper design of the materials studied here can have high strength and stiffness, low weight, high damping properties so that they may be useful for multifunctional materials that can be used in the Navy and Department of Defense applications.

40|$|The {{collapse}} {{phenomenon of}} long, thick-walled tubes subjected to axial tension and external pressure is investigated. A combined experimental and analytic approach is adopted. The diameter to thickness ratio (DA) of the tubes studied {{is in the}} range 10 - 40. A series of collapse tests are conducted using thick-walled, small diameter tubes of two different materials. Careful measurements of geometrical and material parameters are carried out before each collapse test. Tension-Pressure collapse envelopes are obtained for tubes of different D/t and loading paths. Collapse tests involving initially ovalized tubes are also carried out. The results show that <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> is strongly influenced by initial ovality. A two-dimensional model is used for predicting the <b>collapse</b> <b>strength.</b> The limit point behavior of a long tube with initial geometric imperfections has been modeled. The tube {{is assumed to be}} under generalized plane strain conditions and the possible variations of material and geometric parameters along the length are not considered. Hill's anisotropic plasticity theory involving a quadratic yield function is used to model the anisotropies in yield shown by drawn tubes. A power law creep model is employed to assess the effect of primary creep on <b>collapse</b> <b>strength.</b> The interaction between collapse pressure and tension is found to depend on both material and geometric parameters. The yield behavior of the tube material strongly affects the collapse phenomenon.

In this part, the quasi-static {{strengths of the}} lattices are predicted by limit analysis, with the consideration of the elastic effect and large deformation effect. The planar lattices are firstly classified into bending-dominated and membrane-dominated structures. <b>Collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of typical bending-dominated lattices, such as hexagonal and rhombus structures, has identical initial lower bound and upper bound, so that the equivalent stress-strain curve of a bending-dominated lattice possesses a plateau. On the contrary, the equivalent stress-strain curve of a membrane-dominated lattice, such as square, triangular or Kagome structure, usually contains a peak followed by a sharp drop without a plateau. Consequently, the energy absorption behavior of the bending-dominated lattices is similar to type I structure, while that of the membrane-dominated lattices is similar to type II structure.

This paper investigates the use of FEA on ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of damaged steel grillages and the influence of the damage aperture on the developing failure modes within the structure. The study finds that the presence of damage, in the form of a hole, can lead to the failure mode changing as damage aperture size is increased leading to significant changes to the ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of the structure. It concludes that to assess the damaged strength of steel plated structures, it is critical that modelling methods are able to capture and account for such mode changes in order to accurately assess the true residual strength of the structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taking {{account of}} the {{influence}} of friction between the outer wall of buckling tubular and the inner wall of casing under vibrating loads, the burst and <b>collapse</b> <b>strengths</b> of worn tubular would be reduced greatly compared to the unworn tubular. If the reduction of burst and <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> weren’t taken into consideration, there may be potential risk in well completion. The models of worn tubular strings were established based on finite element method, and thus the relationships between strength of burst and collapse and the degree of wear were analyzed. The results of FEM were verified by the equations in API 5 C 3. The results show that the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced with the increase of wear degree, and the burst strength will be reduced more sharply. When the tubular strings are worn by 30 %, the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced by almost 50 %. While the strengths of burst and collapse will be reduced by almost 60 %, when the tubular strings are worn by 50 %. So, to avoid the accident caused by the worn tubular, the work case should be controlled strictly correspondingly...|$|R

40|$|Aimed at {{studying}} the casing wear {{in the highly}} deviated well drilling, the experimental study on the casing wear {{was carried out in}} the first place. According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint–casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for casing wear mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the wear depth, exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the casing wear process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining <b>collapse</b> <b>strength.</b> Then the change curve of the maximum casing wear depth with time was obtained. Besides, the relationship between the maximum wear depth and remaining <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> was established to predict the maximum wear depth and the remaining strength of the casing after a period of accumulative wear, providing a theoretical basis for the safety assessment of worn casing...|$|R
40|$|Metal pipes are {{sometimes}} swaged by a metal cone to enlarge them, {{which increases the}} strain in the material. The amount of strain {{is important because it}} affects the burst and <b>collapse</b> <b>strength.</b> Burst strength is the amount of internal pressure that a pipe can withstand before failure, while <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> is the amount of external pressure that a pipe can withstand before failure. If the burst or <b>collapse</b> <b>strengths</b> are exceeded, the pipe may fracture, causing critical failure. Such an event could cost the owners and their customers millions of dollars in clean up, repair, and lost time, in addition to the potential environmental damage. Therefore, a reliable way of estimating the burst and <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of strained pipe is desired and valuable. The sponsor currently rates strained pipes using the properties of raw steel, because those properties are easily measured (for example, yield strength). In the past, the engineers assumed that the metal would be work-hardened when swaged, so that yield strength would increase. However, swaging introduces anisotropic strain, which may decrease the yield strength. This study measured the yield strength of strained material in the transverse and axial direction and compared them to raw material, to determine the amount of anisotropy. This information will be used to more accurately determine burst and collapse ratings for strained pipes. More accurate ratings mean safer products, which will minimize risk for the sponsor’s customers. Since the strained metal has a higher yield strength than the raw material, using the raw yield strength to calculate burst and collapse ratings is a conservative method. The metal has even higher yield strength after strain aging, which indicates that the stresses are relieved. Even with the 12 % anisotropy in the strained and 9 % anisotropy in the strain aged specimens, the raw yield strengths are lower and therefore more conservative. I recommend that the sponsor continue using the raw yield strength to calculate these ratings. I set out to characterize the anisotropic nature of swaged metal. As expected, the tensile tests showed a difference between the axial and transverse tensile strength. The correlation was 12 % difference in yield strength in the axial and transverse directions for strained material and 9 % in strained and aged material. This means that the strength of the metal in the hoop (transverse) direction is approximately 10 % stronger than in the axial direction, because the metal was work hardened during the swaging process. Therefore, the metal is more likely to fail in axial tension than in burst or collapse. I presented the findings from the microstructure examination, standard tensile tests, and SEM data. All of this data supported the findings of the mini-tensile tests. This information will help engineers set burst and collapse ratings and allow material scientists to predict the anisotropic characteristics of swaged steel tubes...|$|R

40|$|In 2012 106 vessels over 100 gross tonnes were lost. During {{the damage}} {{incidents}} {{many of these}} vessels required assistance from shore based emergency response services with regards to their damaged strength to stabilise the situation, preserve life, prevent environmental disaster and limit financial costs to owners and insurers. The research work presented in this Engineering Doctorate Thesis surrounds the strength assessment of damaged steel ship structures, the influence of damage {{on the strength of}} steel-plated structures and methods for assessing the residual strength of a vessel in an emergency. The focus of the work is to improve the modelling of damaged steel ship structures within an emergency situation, in order to improve guidance provided to a stricken vessel during a damage incident or salvage process. Literature study has shown that structural idealisation through the use of interframe progressive collapse analysis, to be {{the current state of the}} art method for the rapid assessment of intact and damaged ship structures. However, a number of weaknesses have been identified in the method when applied to damage assessment. The literature study has also shown a lack of understanding of the effect of damage on steel-plated structures as specific analysis has not been performed previously. Significant research has been undertaken into the influence of damage, in the form of a hole, on the ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of steel-plated structures. Three levels of structural modelling have been used, stiffened-plate, stiffened panel and grillage. Comparison of the predicted ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> by finite element analysis (FEA) with predictions using the interframe progressive collapse idealisation, has shown the calculated results to be conservative for the assessment of damaged structure when the failure mode remains in the interframe collapse form. However, changes in the failure mode lead to the interframe progressive collapse method over predicting the ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength.</b> The analysis shows that even small damage events can lead to significant changes to the failure mode and resulting ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of the structure. Such influences must be accounted for in any simplified method. A new method for the assessment of damaged ship structures is proposed that is capable of modelling a damage scenario more accurately. Demonstration of the method has shown the results to be less conservative than the current state of the art, when compared to FEA, for local analysis of damaged steel-plated structure. The ability of the method to account for the influence of damage, and the resulting failure modes, that may significantly influence the ultimate bending strength of the structure has also been demonstrated. The method implements a compartment level progressive collapse analysis with structural data captured through the use of the response surface method ‘kriging’, using data points provided from FEA. This method allows the critical damage variables to be captured and strength data accessible quickly for use in the analysis. The time to provide a solution to the damage scenario is equivalent to the existing interframe progressive collapse method. Therefore, the method is suitable for application within an emergency response or salvage service...|$|R

The uniform overall thickness is then adjusted to maintain the constant average density. The resulting fractal-appearing hierarchical structure {{is defined by the}} ratios of replacement edge lengths to the underlying network edge length and also the cell wall angle. The effective elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio and plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> in the principal directions of hierarchical honeycombs were obtained analytically as well as by finite element analyses. The results show that anisotropic hierarchical honeycombs of first to fourth order can be 2. 0 – 8. 0 times stiffer {{and at the same time}} up to 2. 0 times stronger than regular honeycomb at the same wall angle and the same overall average density. Plastic collapse analysis showed that anisotropic hierarchical honeycomb has the larger plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> compared to regular hierarchical honeycomb of the same order at certain oblique wall angles. The current work provides insight into how incorporating anisotropy into the structural organization can play a significant role in improving the mechanics of the materials structure such as regular or hierarchical honeycombs, and introduces new opportunities for development of novel materials and structures with desirable and actively tailorable properties. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially, the compression properties of the core have been evaluated at quasi-static and impact rates of strain. It has been shown that the plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of the cores is highly rate-sensitive, increasing by up to one hundred percent in passing from quasi-static to dynamic rates of loading. Subsequently, the SENB (Mode I) and shear (Mode II) fracture properties of the polymer foams were evaluated. Mode I tests have shown that the crosslinked PVC foams and the PET foams fail in a brittle manner, however, the linear PVC foams fail in a ductile mode. Here, {{it has been shown that}} the Mode II shear toughnesses of the crosslinked PVC foams were up to thirty-five times greater than their corresponding Mode I values. Following this, a series of indentation tests were conducted on polymer-foam sandwich structures and their response was characterised using a Meyer indentation law of the form P = Cn. It has been shown that the value of the exponent parameter, n, does not vary significantly with the properties of the core or the skin, typically being close to unity for all tests. The contact stiffness, C, was found to depend on the plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of the foam, the indentor radius and the properties of the skin. It has been shown that a plot of contact stiffness against plastic <b>collapse</b> <b>strength,</b> containing all of the quasi-static and dynamic data, appears to yield a unique curve. Subsequently, the perforation resistances {{of a range of}} foam-based sandwich structures were investigated. The influence of the plastic collapse stress of the foam in determining the failure thresholds of the front and rear composite skins has been established. Here, a simple model has been used to successfully predict failure of the top surface composite skin in the sandwich structures. In addition, the force associated with perforating the lightweight core has been shown to be strongly dependent on the shear strength of the polymer foam. The perforation response of sandwich structures based on fully-recyclable materials has also been investigated. The design of the SRPP skin has a significant effect on the energy-absorbing characteristics of the sandwich structure, with the performance of systems based on multiple layer skins greatly exceeding that associated with a monolithic skin.

Idealised Structural Unit Method (ISUM) can allow rapid assessment of large structural arrangements by simplification into smaller constituent parts, which are assessed against pre-calculated failure data for each part.

Steel shell {{structures}} such as silos, tanks, pressure vessels, offshore platforms, chimneys and tubular towers generally consist of two or more of these basic shell elements. Axisymmetric intersections featuring meridional slope mismatches between the connected elements are common features in steel shell structures. High bending and circumferential membrane stresses are developed in these intersections, and their buckling and <b>collapse</b> <b>strengths</b> are a key design consideration. This paper presents a summary of recent research on the stress, stability and strength of axisymmetric steel shell intersections. Particular attention is paid to intersections formed from cylindrical and conical segments as these are more common and have been more extensively researched. A simple approximate method for extrapolating the knowledge gained on these intersections to those containing curved shell segments is also suggested.

40|$|Abstract. A more comprehensive,systematic experimentical ground {{tests of}} the {{expansion}} process of expandable casing were performed. In the tests, 6 5 1 / 2 "N 80 casings were selected, of which five had been carried out expansion tests, another one casing {{was used to test}} the <b>collapse</b> <b>strength,</b> not been expanded. In the course of the tests,some important parameters of the expandable casing were measured before and after expansion,including the inner and outer diameter, wall thickness, ovality, wall thickness of inequality and the axial deformation, etc [...] These data provide a reliable basis for the mechanism research of the N 80 casing expansion. After expansion tests, these six casing pipes had been performed the collapsing tests in Xi'an Tubular Goods Research Institute of CNPC. The test results show that after expansiong the collaps strength of expandable casing get decreased compared with unexpanded casing which provides a practical basis and reference for the design of expandable casing...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTEvaluation of the {{performance}} of aging structures is essential in the oil and gas industry, where the inaccurate prediction of structural performance can have significantly hazardous consequences. The effects of structure failure due to the significant reduction in wall thickness, which determines the burst strength, make it very complicated for pipeline operators to maintain pipeline serviceability. In other words, the serviceability of gas pipelines and elbows needs to be predicted and assessed to ensure that the burst or <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> capacities of the structures remain less than the maximum allowable operation pressure. In this study, several positions of the corrosion in a subsea elbow made of API X 42 steel were evaluated using both design formulas and numerical analysis. The most hazardous corrosion position of the aging elbow was then determined to assess its serviceability. The results of this study are applicable to the operational and elbow serviceability needs of subsea pipelines and can help predict more accurate replacement or repair times...|$|R
40|$|Biocompatible gelatin foams {{were found}} to exhibit {{significantly}} improved mechanical properties by the additions of sepiolite nanofibres. Gelatin nanocomposite foams containing various contents of sepiolite were prepared by lyophilization. With the presence of 9. 1 wt% sepiolite, the Young's modulus and compressive <b>collapse</b> <b>strength</b> of the gelatin foam with a cell size of 159 μm and a porosity of 98 % were increased by 288 % and 308 %, respectively. Such enhancements were attributable to the strong interactions between hydrophilic gelatin and sepiolite {{as suggested by the}} results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry which show substantial shifts in the characteristic absorption peaks and the glass transition temperature, to the reduced cell sizes characterised by scanning electron microscopy, and to the reinforcement effects of sepiolite on the gelatin solid material. The mechanical properties of the low-density closed-cell gelatin/sepiolite nanocomposite foams were well predicted using the Gibson–Ashby model for open cells after normalisation of the Young's modulus of the neat polymer foam...|$|R
