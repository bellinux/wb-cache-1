40|$|Since 1996 all {{consumer}} credit transactions in Australia have been {{regulated by the}} Consumer Credit Code.

By exposing participants to typical consumer <b>credit</b> <b>documents,</b> this research discovered quite poor comprehension of important features of the relevant transactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma work is to present {{upgrading}} of an operating document system, more precisely introducing credit confirmation into the existent banking document management system. The intention of this system is to enable Banka Volksbank d. d. Ljubljana to use electronic credit confirmation as well as electronic archiving of the related documentation. First, a document system as {{a key part of}} up-to-date business information systems is described. Document systems, which nowadays develop extremely rapidly, enable more than merely secure data saving. Today requirements are much higher, since current document systems upgrade the entire business process of a company, which consequently puts the company ahead of competition and increases its effectiveness. In the past credit confirmation procedure at the bank was not electronically supported, which due to the abundance of documents caused lack of clarity, bad control and hence, slow credit operating of the company. This led to the requirement for creation of a program solution “Credit confirmation in banking document management system,” which is the topic of my diploma work. The existing document system, being already used in the working environment of the company, has been expanded to the process of credit confirmation. The tool Lotus Notes/Domino, suitable for business process and documentation management, has been used. It works on the principle client – server, which enables access to information (documents), its classification and management in the network. The access to documents is very simple and is performed via views or embedded views in the form. By categorized display and access to <b>credit</b> <b>documents</b> from one site, the work of bank clerks has been facilitated, as otherwise the documentation would move from one department to another. The aim of this paper has been achieved: an operating part of a document system that meets all the requirements has been developed. A credit can be monitored through the entire process, from sending an offer to transferring the money. In this way, safety, tracking and prompt informing of accountable staff about the state of <b>credit</b> <b>documents</b> is ensured. Key words: document system, electronic confirmation, electronic archiving, Lotus Notes, Lotus Domino...|$|R

This process is also called [...] "perfecting the security interest" [...] in the property, and this type of loan is a secured loan.
