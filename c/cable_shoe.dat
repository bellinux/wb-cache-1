40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{methods and}} experiments {{for the assessment}} and evaluation of energy efficiency strategies for manufacturing processes {{in the field of}} electric drives production. First, the system for the Least Energy Demand Method will be explained. The basic idea of this calculation is the comparison and evaluation of energy efficiency based on the ratio of the theoretically required energy consumption to the measured energy consumption. Using these values as well as further derived indicators for energy efficiency, the main energy consumers within the field of electric drives production are identified. Subsequently, these processes are analysed and optimized to achieve major energy saving instructions. From an energy point of view during the stator production chain, especially the impregnation process and the joining process have to be optimized as, in the here presented measurements, the impregnation process amounts to more than 80  % of the cumulated energy demands. Moreover, the process of joining insulated copper wires of the stator windings to corresponding <b>cables</b> <b>shoes</b> is optimized, as it shows strong energy saving potentials. Additionally, the power consumption values within {{the state of the art}} joining process are varying strongly thus leading to higher load peaks within the production line, which have to be reduced. Regarding energy efficiency within the manufacturing of permanent magnet synchronous rotors, the process of magnet assembly also has to be evaluated. It can be subdivided into magnet manufacturing, logistics, magnetization and assembly. A major part of the energy used in this process is accounted for by means of transportation, especially when considering that magnetized magnets need larger packaging volumes and weights due to the ferromagnetic shielding and spacers to support handling of the magnet bodies. Thus, the energy efficiency can be increased considerably by shifting the magnetization step directly to right before the assembly step. In addition, energy can be saved by optimizing the magnetization process according to the magnetization strategy and the interaction of all process parameters, such as capacity of the magnetizer, inductivity and size of the magnetizing coil, magnet size, material and coating...|$|R
50|$|Shoe dangling, or shoe flinging, is the {{practice}} of throwing shoes whose shoelaces have been tied together so that they hang from overhead wires such as power lines or telephone <b>cables.</b> Once the <b>shoes</b> are tied together, the pair is then thrown at the wires {{as a sort of}} bolas. The practice, despite its widespread use throughout the United States has been one of curiosity over the years as a number of possible explanations for the act have cropped up without any general consensus on its origins. Shoe flinging has also been reported in many other countries.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the drum brake lining, as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum brakes, levers and rods or <b>cables</b> operated the <b>shoes</b> mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small wheel cylinder and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two wheel cylinders.|$|R
40|$|The {{compounding}} of Polyvinylchloride (PVC) {{with some}} additives was studied for {{the enhancement of}} physical and mechanical properties. Two categories of formulations (un-plasticized and plasticized PVC) were prepared with PVC (K value ranging from 60 to 70) taking as base polymer. Different additives generally categorized as plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers, pigments and processing aids, were mixed in the standard concentration unit “parts per hundred resins (phr) ” with base polymer. <b>Cable</b> compound and <b>shoe</b> compound were prepared in plasticized-PVC category containing mainly plasticizing additives like diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP) (40 phr) and epoxidized soybean oil (2 - 3 phr) with general plasticizer (50 - 80 phr) respectively. Whereas the rigid pipe and sheet compounds were prepared as un-plasticized PVC category containing different fillers/stabilizers like tribasic lead sulphate (6 phr), lead stearate (1 phr), glyceryl monostearate (0. 4 phr) in rigid pipe and butylin mercaptides (2 - 2. 5 phr), fatty alcohol and fatty acid ester (0. 5 - 0. 8 phr) in rigid sheet compound. Experimental investigation was carried out for analyzing the mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness and physical property i. e. specific gravity for the compounded samples. An appreciable increase was observed in tensile strength from 460 Kg/cm 2 (base PVC-polymer) {{to a range of}} 550 Kg/cm 2 for un-plasticized PVC compounds (rigid PVC-pipe and sheet) with little increase in elongation at break from 56 % (base polymer) to 124. 33 % and 150 % (for Pipe and Sheet compounds respectively). On the other side the elongation at break for plasticized PVC compounds was increased from 56 % to 250. 67 % (for cable compound) and 351. 33 % (for shoe compound), where as the tensile strength was decreased from 460 Kg/cm 2 to 150. 33 Kg/cm 2 (for cable compound) and 120. 33 Kg/cm 2 (for shoe compound). The hardness (shore A, D) was increased from 40 to 80 for all the compounds except shoe compound with hardness of 65. 33. The impact of plasticizers was found in direct proportion on elongation at break but having inverse proportion on tensile strength...|$|R
