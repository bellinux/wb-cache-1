Both North Korean and American armor swarmed to the scene and US Marines aircraft continued to provide cover, but neither side was able to make appreciable gains despite inflicting massive numbers of casualties on one another.

25|$|Industrial {{automation}} incorporates {{programmable logic}} controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for <b>control</b> <b>task</b> and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.|$|E

40|$|Performance on {{cognitive}} <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> deteriorates when <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> are performed {{together with other}} <b>control</b> <b>tasks,</b> that is, if simultaneous cognitive control is required. Surprisingly, this is also observed if <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> are preceded by other <b>control</b> <b>tasks,</b> that is, if sequential cognitive control is required. The typical explanation for the latter finding is that previous acts of cognitive control deplete a common resource, just like a muscle becomes fatigued after repeated usage. An alternative explanation, however, is that previous acts of cognitive control reduce motivation to match allocated resources to required resources. In this paper we formalize these muscle and motivation accounts, and show that they yield differential predictions regarding the interaction between simultaneous and sequential cognitive control. These predictions were tested using a paradigm where participants had to perform multiple stop-signal tasks, which varied in their demands on simultaneous and sequential control. Results of two studies supported predictions derived from the motivation account. Therefore, we conclude {{that the effects of}} sequential cognitive control are best explained in terms of a reduction of motivation to match allocated to required resources...|$|R

At the technical level the results rely on a homogeneity assumption on the continuous dynamics and extend to the selftriggered framework some of the advantages of event-triggered implementations recently studied by the authors.

50|$|Other researchers, such as Katzir & Pareblagoev {{have pointed}} out that neuroimaging {{methodology}} as it stands may not be suitable for the examination of higher level cognitive functions, because it relies primarily on the ‘subtraction method’. By this method, brain activity during a simple <b>control</b> <b>task</b> is subtracted from that of a ‘higher order’ cognitive task, thus leaving the activation that is related specifically to the function of interest. Katzir & Pareblagoev suggest that while this method may be very good for examining low level processing, such as perception, vision and touch, {{it is very hard to}} design an effective <b>control</b> <b>task</b> for higher order processing, such as comprehension in reading and inference making. Thus, some researchers argue that functional imaging technologies may not be best suited for the measurement of higher order processing. Katzir & Pareblagoev, suggest that this may not be a deficit of the technology itself, but rather of the design of experiments and the ability to interpret the results. The authors advocate using experimental measures in the scanner for which the behavioural data is already well understood, and for which there exists a strong theoretical framework.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is {{codesign}} of flexible real-time control systems. Integrating control theory and real-time scheduling theory, {{it is possible to}} achieve higher resource utilization and better control performance. The integration requires new tools for analysis, design, and implementation. The problem of scheduling the individual parts of a control algorithm is studied. It is shown how subtask scheduling can reduce the input-output latency in a set of <b>control</b> <b>tasks.</b> Deadline assignment under different scheduling policies is considered. A feedback scheduling architecture for <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> is introduced. The scheduler uses feedback from execution-time measurements and feedforward from workload changes to adjust the sampling periods of a set of <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> so that the combined performance of the controllers is optimized. The Control Server, a novel computational model for real-time <b>control</b> <b>tasks,</b> is presented. The model combines time-triggered I/O with dynamic, reservation-based task scheduling. The model provides short input-output latencies and minimal jitter for the controllers. It also allows <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> to be treated as scalable real-time components with predictable performance. Two MATLAB-based toolboxes for analysis and simulation of real-time control systems have been developed. The Jitterbug toolbox evaluates a quadratic cost function for a linear control system with timing variations. The tool makes it possible to investigate the impact of delay, jitter, lost samples, etc., on control performance. The TrueTime toolbox facilitates detailed cosimulation of distributed real-time control systems. The scheduling and execution of <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> is simulated in parallel with the network communication and the continuous process dynamics...|$|R

40|$|A motor imagery (MI) based brain {{computer}} interface (BCI) is {{a system}} that enables humans to interact with their environment by translating their brain signals into control commands for a target device. In particular, synchronous BCI systems make use of cues to trigger the motor activity of interest. So far, {{it has been shown that}} Electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns before and after cue onset can reveal the user cognitive state and enhance the discrimination of MI related <b>control</b> <b>tasks.</b> However, there has been no detailed investigation of the nature of those EEG patterns. We, therefore, propose to study the cue effects on MI related <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> by selecting EEG patterns that best discriminate such <b>control</b> <b>tasks,</b> and analysing where those patterns are coming from. The study was carried out under two methods: standard and all-embracing. The standard method was based on sources (recording sites, frequency bands and time windows), where the modulation of EEG signals due to motor activity is typically detected. The all-embracing method included a wider variety of sources, where not only motor activity is reflected. The findings of this study showed that the classification accuracy of MI related <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> did not depend on the type of cue in use. However, EEG patterns which best differentiated those <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> emerged from sources well defined by the perception and cognition of the cue in use. An implication of this study is the possibility of obtaining different control commands that could be detected with the same accuracy. Since different cues trigger <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> that yield similar classification accuracies, and those <b>control</b> <b>tasks</b> produce EEG patterns differentiated by the cue nature, this leads to accelerate the brain-computer communication by having a wider variety of detectable control commands. This is an important issue for Neuroergonimcs research because neural activity could not only be used to monitor the human mental state as is typically done, but this activity might be also employed to control the system of interest...|$|R
