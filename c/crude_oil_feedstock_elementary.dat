With the {{continued}} decline in global oil reserves, {{there is a}} growing need to develop alternative sources of conventional fuels to complement the current dependence on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> Natural gas, coal and biomass have been identified for this purpose. The distinctive advantage of using natural (stranded) gas is that it is turned into a useful product, thereby increasing its value and reducing the environmental impact of simply flaring it. The value-added work up of natural gas is effected by Gas-to-Liquid conversion via the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. Long-chain hydrocarbon waxes are produced and these are subsequently hydrocracked into the required middle distillate fuels, preferably diesel, as diesel engines are more efficient than their petrol counterparts. Hydrocracking may be carried out using a bifunctional catalyst, consisting of metal and acid components. Industrially, hydrocracking is used to crack heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> fractions into the desired fuel range, however, the catalysts used are sulphided transition metals. These are less suitable for cracking Fischer-Tropsch waxes as they would introduce sulphur into a clean feedstock.

30|$|In recent times, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the demand for propylene, a petrochemical industry feedstock [5] and it is chiefly sourced from light olefins in the naphtha steam pyrolysis process. Naphtha steam pyrolysis process is a high energy consumption process because it is carried out at about 800  °C and separation of olefins is done at a temperature as low as −[*] 100  °C [5]. This makes the naphtha steam pyrolysis process a more capital intensive one. However, propylene and ethylene are sourced cheaply from the FCC unit due to the abundance and cheapness of the FCC feedstock compared with Naphtha [4, 5], and the recent growth in demand for propylene in the world has maintained focus on the refineries toward FCC technologies for the maximization of propylene production to achieve economic profit [6]. In addition, the FCC operates below 550  °C and does not require extreme ‘cold’ for the separation of propylene from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [5]. Therefore, the cost of producing propylene from the FCC is much lower than that from steam pyrolysis [7]. The FCC unit is thus ideally suited for the manufacture of ethylene and propylene from the light products. Currently, there is an increasing interest in maximizing propylene yield of FCC units [7, 8]. The FCC unit has the ability to produce high yields when suitable operating conditions are selected. However, due to changes in quality, nature of the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>feedstock,</b> changes in the environment and the desire to achieve maximum profitability, it results in many different operating conditions in the FCC riser unit [5, 9].|$|R
40|$|The {{two methods}} of {{processing}} synthetic crude from organic marlstone in demonstration or small-scale commercial {{status in the}} U. S. are in situ extraction and surface retorting. The considerable uncertainty surrounding the technological characterization, resource characterization, and choice of the system boundary for oil shale operations indicate that oil shale is only a minor net energy producer if one includes internal energy (energy in the shale that is used during the process) as an energy cost. The energy return on investment (EROI) for either of these methods is roughly 1. 5 : 1 for the final fuel product. The inclusions or omission of internal energy is a critical question. If only external energy (energy diverted from the economy to produce the fuel) is considered, EROI appears to be much higher. In comparison, fuels produced from conventional petroleum show overall EROI of approximately 4. 5 : 1. “At the wellhead” EROI is approximately 2 : 1 for shale oil (again, considering internal energy) and 20 : 1 for petroleum. The low EROI for oil shale leads to a significant release of greenhouse gases. The large quantities of energy needed to process oil shale, combined with the thermochemistry of the retorting process, produce {{carbon dioxide and other}} greenhouse gas emissions. Oil shale unambiguously emits more greenhouse gases than conventional liquid fuels from <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>feedstocks</b> by a factor of 1. 2 to 1. 75.

40|$|Includes synopsis. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 141 - 144). Although it {{is debatable}} {{as to the}} lifetime of the planet’s <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> reserves, it is indisputable that they are finite and will, eventually, become exhausted. As such it is desired to devise methods whereby currently available non-crude <b>oil</b> derived hydrocarbon <b>feedstocks</b> may be utilised {{for the production of}} clean, high quality liquid fuels (particularly middle distillate fuels such as diesel and jet fuel), aiding in alleviating the demand on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> reserves. One technique whereby this may be achieved involves the conversion of the non-crude <b>oil</b> derived hydrocarbon <b>feedstock</b> (for example stranded gas, remote natural gas, coal or biomass) to syngas (a mixture of CO and H 2). This syngas is subsequently converted to paraffinic wax by Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, and this wax selectively hydrocracked down to the desired distillate fuels fraction. This hydrocracking may be conducted utilising either monofunctional or bifunctional catalysts. Monofunctional catalysts, such as the supported sulphided base metals or metal oxides utilised in many <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> refineries, yield a product with minimal additional branching, as desired, though would contaminate the otherwise clean Fischer-Tropsch wax with sulphur. Bifunctional catalysts, utilising a metal on an acidic support, yield a product with significant branching, yet do not contaminate the product. Furthermore, the acid supports utilised in oil refinery applications are limited to either amorphous silica-alumina, or H-USY (a thermally treated large pore zeolite) due to the presence of large, bulky polycyclic and highly branched molecules in the feedstock. Fischer-Tropsch wax exhibits only minimal branching, and it was hence the aim of this investigation to determine whether zeolites with pores smaller than those utilised in the hydrocracking of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> derived <b>feedstocks,</b> specifically medium pore zeolites such as H-MFI, may be utilised in the bifunctional hydrocracking of this wax to impart shape selectivity upon the reaction, thereby limiting the extent to which branching may occur. In this regard, four different zeolites (H-MFI, H-BEA, H-USY and H-MOR) were tested under the same, industrially relevant conditions, and the results collated so as to quantify the effects of the each zeolite’s unique properties, in particular their pore geometries (in terms of pore size, shape and channel inter-connectivity), the performance of each catalyst in terms of its activity (the overall conversion of the feedstock) and selectivity (with regards to both carbon number distribution and the degree of branching). Furthermore, it was desired {{to determine the extent to}} which the anticipated transition state shape selectivity of some of the zeolites affected the stability (on-stream lifetime) of the catalyst through a reduction in coke formation. The results of this investigation indicated that medium pore zeolites show significant potential for use in the selective hydrocracking of a Fischer-Tropsch wax feedstock. It was found that those zeolites possessing medium sized pores (specifically H-MFI and H-BEA) exhibited a significantly higher activity than did those with only larger pores (H-USY and H-MOR), a phenomenon theorised to be due to the more orderly and efficient configuration of the adsorbed molecules within the medium pores promoting contact with active acid sites. Furthermore, it was found that H-MFI, with a porous network comprised entirely of medium pores, showed an improved selectivity towards the desired linear products, whilst zeolites with only wide pores (H-USY and H-MOR) and those with intersecting wide and medium pores (H-BEA) showed branched product selectivities roughly equivalent to one another, all greatly favouring the production of mono-methyl branched species.

S. has fallen below the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in 2010, {{and it remains}} questionable if the U. S. can meet the one billion gallon RFS mandate in the coming year. The U. S. biodiesel industry encounters the challenge of feedstock price volatility, high feedstock price diminishes biodiesel producers’ profit margin, reducing producers’ incentive to produce. Soybean oil is the most prominent feedstock in the U. S. biodiesel industry. Investigating the main drivers of soybean oil price will be useful for policy and business suggestions aiming to buffer biodiesel producers’ profit margin. This study analyzes soybean price through supply and demand factors namely: (1) energy cost of producing soybeans, (2) land use competition, (3) demand of soybean oil from export, (4) demand of soybean oil from the U. S. food industry and (5) demand of soybean oil from the U. S. biodiesel industry. The relative importance of the above mentioned factors are evaluated with Principle Component Analysis and multiple regression analysis using monthly data obtained from the U. S. Census Bureau. Analyses results suggest while supply factors do not significantly affect soybean oil price, soybean oil demand from the biodiesel industry and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price are the main drivers of soybean oil price. Policy solutions should target to protect biodiesel producers’ profit margin by paying attention to <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price and <b>feedstock</b> demand from the biodiesel industry. Some possible policy solutions include diversifying feedstock, setting a national demand mandate, and implementing a variable subsidy {{in addition to the}} RFS mandate...|$|R
