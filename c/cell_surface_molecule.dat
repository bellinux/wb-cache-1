5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecule,</b> a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new theory of <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> capping based on the {{principles}} of nucleation. When antibody interacts with <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules,</b> the molecules initially form small aggregates called patches that later coalesce into a large aggregate called a cap. While a cap can form by patches being pulled together by action of the cell's cytoskeleton, in the case of some molecules, disruption of the cytoskeleton does not prevent cap formation. Diffusion of large aggregates on a <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> is slow, and thus we propose that a cap can form solely through the diffusion of small aggregates containing just one or a few <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules.</b> Here we consider the extreme case in which single molecules are mobile, but aggregates of all larger sizes are immobile. We show that a set of patches in equilibrium with a "sea " of free <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> can undergo a nucleation-type phase transition in which the largest patch will bind free <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules,</b> deplete the concentration of such molecules in the "sea, " and thus cause the other patches to shrink in size. We therefore show that a cap can form without patches having to move, collide with each other, and aggregate...|$|R

His group purified and characterized the Thy1 molecule and from this work came the proposal {{of the concept of}} the immunoglobulin superfold,. The success linked to this work on Thy1 prompted Williams to expand the search for surface molecules on lymphocytes {{that could be used to}} characterize these cells. Establishing a collaboration with Cesar Milstein, who had recently developed hybridoma technology along with Georges Kohler, Williams made a number of discoveries including identification of a <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecule</b> that later proved to be the coreceptor CD4 which identifies helper T cells. Following this his group generated antibodies that identified rat CD8, a marker of cytotoxic T cells [...] as well as rat CD45.

50|$|CD44 is a multistructural and {{multifunctional}} <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecule</b> {{involved in}} cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, angiogenesis, presentation of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to the corresponding receptors, and docking of proteases at the cell membrane, {{as well as}} in signaling for cell survival. All these biological properties are essential to the physiological activities of normal cells, but they are also associated with the pathologic activities of cancer cells. Experiments in animals have shown that targeting of CD44 by antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and CD44-soluble proteins markedly reduces the malignant activities of various neoplasms, stressing the therapeutic potential of anti-CD44 agents. Interestingly, high levels of the adhesion molecule CD44 on leukemic cells are essential to generate leukemia. Furthermore, because alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications generate many different CD44 sequences, including, perhaps, tumor-specific sequences, the production of anti-CD44 tumor-specific agents may be a realistic therapeutic approach. However, in many cancers (renal cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are exceptions), a high level of CD44 expression is not always associated with an unfavorable outcome. On the contrary, in some neoplasms CD44 upregulation is associated with a favorable outcome. Additionally, in many cases different research groups analyzing the same neoplastic disease reached contradictory conclusions regarding the correlation between CD44 expression and disease prognosis, possibly due to differences in methodology. These problems must be resolved before applying anti-CD44 therapy to human cancers.|$|E

Yet, how fungal morphogenesis modulates the biophysical properties and interactions of the <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> is poorly understood, mainly owing to the paucity of high-resolution imaging techniques. Here, we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy to localize and analyze the key components of the surface of living C. albicans cells during morphogenesis. We show that the yeast-to-hypha transition leads to a major increase in the distribution, adhesion, unfolding, and extension of Als adhesins and their associated mannans on the <b>cell</b> <b>surface.</b> We also find that morphogenesis dramatically increases <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> hydrophobicity.

40|$|CD 28 is a <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecule</b> that mediates a {{costimulatory signal}} crucial for T cell {{proliferation}} and lymphokine production. The signal transduction mechanisms of CD 28 {{are not well}} understood. Itk, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase specifically expressed in T cells and mast cells, has been implicated in the CD 28 signaling pathway because of reports that it becomes phosphorylated on tyrosines and associates with CD 28 upon cross-linking of the <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecule.</b> To determine whether Itk plays a functional role in CD 28 signaling, we compared T cells from Itk-deficient mice and control mice for their responses to CD 28 costimulation.

Whereas the CD 3 -mediated proliferative response was severely compromised in the absence of Itk, the calcineurin-independent CD 28 -mediated response was significantly elevated when compared with cells from control animals. The augmented proliferation was not due to increased production of interleukin- 2. The results suggest that Itk has distinct roles in the CD 3 versus the CD 28 signaling pathways. By negatively regulating the amplitude of signaling upon CD 28 costimulation, Itk may provide a means for modulating the outcome of T cell activation during development and during antigen-driven immune responses...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) is an {{aggressive}} bone marrow malignancy where the immature leukemia cells communicate with neighboring cells through constitutive cytokine release and through their <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> adhesion <b>molecules.</b> The primary AML cells express various integrins. These heterodimeric molecules containing an α and a β chain are <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> that bind extracellular matrix <b>molecules,</b> <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> and soluble mediators. The β 3 integrin (ITGB 3) chain can form heterodimers {{only with the}} two α chains αIIb and αV. These integrins {{are among the most}} promiscuous and bind to a large number of ligands, including extracellular matrix <b>molecules,</b> <b>cell</b> <b>surface</b> <b>molecules</b> and soluble mediators. Recent studies suggest that the two β 3 integrins are important for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in human AML. Firstly, αIIb and β 3 are both important for adhesion of AML cells to vitronectin and fibronectin. Secondly, β 3 is important for the development of murine AML and also for the homing and maintenance of the proliferation for xenografted primary human AML cells, and for maintaining a stem cell transcriptional program. These last effects seem to be mediated through Syk kinase. The β 3 expression seems to be regulated by HomeboxA 9 (HoxA 9) and HoxA 10, and the increased β 3 expression then activates spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and thereby contributes to cytokine hypersensitivity and activation of β 2 integrins. Finally, high integrin αV/β 3 expression is associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and decreased sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor sorafenib; this integrin can also be essential for osteopontin-induced sorafenib resistance in AML. In the present article, we review the experimental and clinical evidence for a role of β 3 integrins for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity in AML...|$|R
