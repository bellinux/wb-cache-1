5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignite</b> combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E

40|$|Oil shale is an {{important}} energy resource alternative. Despite its recognition as an unconventional oil source, oil shale is also considered as {{an important}} solid fossil fuel alternative to <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites</b> due to the solid form and remarkable extent of organic content. Utilization possibilites, similar to <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites,</b> have been considered in the past decades and direct use of oil shales in thermal power production has been possible in countries like Estonia and China. In the perspective of utilization of oil shales {{in a similar manner}} to <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites,</b> problems <b>and</b> restrictions related to the inorganic ash-making and potentially pollutant constituents are applied. In this respect, cleaning of this important energy source through mineral processing methods, particularly by flotation, is an outstanding option. However, on the basis of unique features and distinctive characteristics, treatment of oil shales like a type of coal is a big perception and may be highly misleading. This paper discusses specific challenges regarding flotation behavior of oil shales with reference to the surface characteristics and behavior of oil shale entities – probably the most important aspect that determines the efficiency and success of the flotation based cleaning process...|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} coal stoves are {{fitted with a}} grate so {{allowing}} part of the combustion air to be admitted below the fire. The proportion of air admitted above/below the fire depends {{on the type of}} <b>coal.</b> Brown <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites</b> evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above the fire. The ratio of air above/below the fire must be carefully adjusted to enable complete combustion.|$|R
40|$|The coal {{combustion}} processes constitute {{one of the}} major sources of heavy metals emission into the atmosphere. From {{the point of view of}} the reduction of the emission of heavy metals and the selection of the correct exhaust gas treatment system, it is important to monitor the amount of trace elements in the solid fuels and in the solid by-products from {{coal combustion}}. One of these highly toxic elements is arsenic. The average content of arsenic in Polish hard <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites</b> is 0 ÷ 40 mg/kg [1] and 5 ÷ 15 mg/kg [2], respectively. The world average content of arsenic in hard <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignites,</b> is equal to 9. 0 ± 0. 8 and 7. 4 ± 1. 4 mg/kg [3], respectively. During coal combustion processes, a significant amount of arsenic enters the atmosphere through gases and fly ashes. The proportions in which those two forms of arsenic occur in exhaust gases depend on the conditions of combustion processes [4]. The aim of the research was to determine the content of arsenic in <b>coal</b> blends <b>and</b> by-products of their combustion (slag, fly ash, gypsum, filter cakes). The determination of the arsenic quantity was performed using the Atomic Absorption Spectrometry with the electrothermal atomization...|$|R

40|$|The use of coal {{for fuel}} {{in place of}} {{oil and natural gas}} has been {{increasing}} in the United States. Typically, users store their reserves of coal outdoors in large piles and rainfall on the coal creates runoffs which may contain materials hazardous to the environment and the public 2 ̆ 7 s health. To study this hazard, rainfall on model coal piles was simulated, using deionized water <b>and</b> four <b>coals</b> of varying sulfur content. The simulated surface runoffs were collected during 9 rainfall simulations spaced 15 days apart. The runoffs were analyzed for 13 standard water quality parameters, extracted with organic solvents and then analyzed with capillary column GC/MS, and the extracts were tested for mutagenicity with the Ames Salmonella microsomal assay and for clastogenicity with Chinese hamster ovary cells. ^ The runoffs from the high-sulfur <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lignite</b> exhibited extremes of pH (acidity), specific conductance, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids; the low-sulfur coal runoffs did not exhibit these extremes. Without treatment, effluents from these high-sulfur <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> <b>lignite</b> would not comply with federal water quality guidelines. ^ Most extracts of the simulated surface runoffs contained at least 10 organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, their methyl and ethyl homologs, olefins, paraffins, and some terpenes. The concentrations of these compounds were generally less than 50 (mu) g/l in most extracts. ^ Some of the extracts were weakly mutagenic and affected both a DNA-repair proficient and deficient Salmonella strain. The addition of S 9 decreased the effect significantly. Extracts of runoffs from the low-sulfur coal were not mutagenic. ^ All extracts were clastogenic. Extracts of runoffs from the high-sulfur coals were both clastogenic and cytotoxic; those from the low-sulfur <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lignite</b> were less clastogenic and not cytotoxic. Clastogenicity occurred with and without S 9 activation. Chromosomal lesions included gaps, breaks and exchanges. These data suggest a relationship between the sulfur content of a <b>coal,</b> its mutagenicity <b>and</b> also its clastogenicity. ^ The runoffs from actual coal piles should be investigated for possible genotoxic effects in view of the data presented in this study. ...|$|R
