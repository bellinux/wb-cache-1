25|$|The routine <b>chromosome</b> <b>{{analysis}}</b> (Karyotyping) {{refers to}} analysis of metaphase chromosomes {{which have been}} banded using trypsin followed by Giemsa, Leishmanns, or a mixture of the two.

25|$|The {{analysis}} of the Y-chromosome yields weaker results than autosomal <b>chromosome</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the patrilineal line. This leads to a less precise analysis than if autosomal chromosomes were testing, because of the random matching that occurs between pairs of chromosomes as zygotes are being made.|$|E

500|$|The family Ursidae {{is one of}} nine {{families}} in the suborder Caniformia, or [...] "doglike" [...] carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear <b>chromosome</b> <b>analysis</b> show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers {{can be explained by}} the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.|$|E

40|$|The PFT {{cell line}} {{originated}} from diploid endometrial cells and was subcultured more than 500 times. Nontumoral, benign and malignant transformation appeared at different stages. Four populations (F 1, F 2, F 3 and F 4) of cells were demonstrated sequentially by <b>chromosomes</b> <b>analysis.</b> These consisted of eight phenotypes {{corresponding to the}} sequential appearance of markers which included three chromosomal aberrations. The PFT malignant transformation in vitro is a progressive process through qualitatively different stages and may reflect neoplastic development in vivo.

40|$|A {{panel of}} 94 diverse {{hexaploid}} wheat accessions {{was used to}} map quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the yield related traits on chromosome 3 A. Population structure and kinships were estimated using unlinked SSR markers from all 21 <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of variance revealed significant difference among accessions; however, genotype × year interaction was non-significant for majority of yield related traits. A mixed linear model (MLM) approach identified six QTLs for four traits that individually accounted for 10. 7 to 17. 3 % phenotypic variability. All QTLs were consistently observed for both study years. New putative QTLs for the maximum fertile florets per spike and spike length were identified.

2500|$|Bone marrow samples can be {{obtained}} by aspiration and trephine biopsy. [...] Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy. [...] The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a pathologist under a light microscope and analyzed by flow cytometry, <b>chromosome</b> <b>analysis,</b> or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of immunohistochemistry) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow. A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.|$|E

Both endo-oxidation (derived from the tea-leaves enzymes themselves) and microbial catalysed, exo-oxidation of tea polyphenols occurs. The microbes are also responsible for metabolising the carbohydrates and amino acids present in the tea leaves. Although the microbes responsible have proved highly variable from region to region and even factory to factory, the key organism found and responsible for almost all pu'er fermentation has been identified in numerous studies as Aspergillus niger, with some highlighting the possibility of ochratoxins produced by the metabolism of some strains of A.niger having a potentially harmful effect through consumption of pu'er tea. This notion has recently been refuted through a systematic <b>chromosome</b> <b>analysis</b> of the species attributed to many East Asian fermentations, including those that involve pu'er, where the authors have reclassified the organisms involved as Aspergillus luchuensis.

40|$|Supernumerary {{chromosomes}} are {{widespread in}} the plant kingdom but little is known of their molecular nature or mechanism of origin.
