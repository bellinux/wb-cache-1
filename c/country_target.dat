40|$|This study {{explores the}} use of new English loanwords in {{electronic}} media in Ukraine. The division of the country according to language preferences is tightly connected with the divergence of political views, namely a pro-Western orientation in the Ukrainian-speaking West and pro-Russian tendencies in the Russian-speaking East, which could contribute to a greater influence of English on one language and less on the other. The main research question the thesis aims to answer is a higher frequency of recent loanwords in the Ukrainian language in comparison to Russian. The study is based on material from three Ukrainian newspapers which represent {{different regions of the}} <b>country,</b> <b>target</b> different audiences and are written in the two different languages. Contrary to the hypothesis, Ukrainian does not show a higher influx of anglicisms than Russian.

40|$|The recent {{surge in}} world {{commodity}} prices might alter {{the role of}} traditional export crops in African economies. While export crops have traditionally been important sources of foreign exchange earnings and government revenues, Ghana is an exceptional case, where a combination of favorable external conditions and internal reforms have made cocoa the driver of growth and poverty reduction. Cocoa's share of agricultural GDP has been increasing rapidly and existing yield gaps and the prospects of continued high world commodity prices suggest further growth potential. We find that increasing cocoa production by around 60, 000 tons per annum is needed to support Ghana reaching its middle-income <b>country</b> <b>target.</b> However, cocoa’s poverty-growth elasticity is low, thus implying that further growth is unlikely {{to lead to the}} large reductions in poverty experienced in the past. Finally, we show that, even with complimentary growth in other sectors, cocoa will continue to dominate agricultural exports over the medium term and that structural diversification remains a key challenge for Ghana.

The {{main purpose of}} this research is to investigate how youth may be 'rationed out' of HAART use by better understanding rationing and access mechanisms and their interaction. This is done by making use of both qualitative and quantitative methods. The data collection consists of 35 transcripts of face-to-face interviews. Project description: This research examines the achieved use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) by young people in Malawi. HIV prevalence in Malawi is amongst the highest national rates but is not constant across the life cycle, peaking at age 30 - 34. Prevalence among youth represents more recent HIV infections. Malawi initiated a national HAART programme in 2004. 170, 000 HIV-infected people are considered clinically eligible for HAART. The agreed <b>country</b> <b>target</b> is to place 80, 000 patients on HAART by the end of 2005. No clear consensus has been achieved for rationing criteria and a variety of implicit and explicit mechanisms exist. It is known that young people experience problems in accessing sexual and reproductive health services. Underlying causes include Malawi's conservative attitudes towards adolescent sexuality, prevailing cultural beliefs about sexual behaviour and young people's social status...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Many of the world’s most {{valuable}} fisheries involve highly migratory stocks that cross national jurisdictions.   These same fisheries face severe threats from direct overfishing or excessive bycatch. Traditional input and/or output controls generally have been costly and ineffective.   Incentive-based programs that provide tradable shares in an annual {{total allowable catch}} or tradable credits acquired by reduced bycatch harvests are attractive alternatives. These rely on Coasean exchange, but implementing them is costly due to fleet heterogeneity—flag <b>country,</b> <b>target</b> species, vessel size, technology; monitoring; new entry; and importantly, participation by countries whose exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are involved.  Country leaders engage in international collaboration to manage fish stocks when {{it is in the}} interests of key constituents to do so.  Although there may be worldwide benefits from fishery stock conservation, constituents in key countries may be made worse off from reduced access, harvest and processing levels, and license revenues. These constituents and politicians who represent them may view international efforts as imposing disproportionate burden.  Traditional “polluter pays” rules focus on restricting fishers. “Beneficiary pays rules,” however, emphasize payments from significant beneficiaries (International Organizations, NGOs, major fishing nations, major consuming nations), to elicit the cooperation of essential parties through compensation. Such payments can change perceptions within key countries to view international efforts as delivering proportionate benefits and costs. Such a distribution has been shown in the literature as a precondition for successful collective action in many settings.   Within EEZs design can then turn to effective incentive-based schemes to protect stocks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Studies in bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) to date {{are limited in}} their ability to provide a whole-disease perspective - their scope has generally been confined to a single disease phase and/or a specific treatment. Moreover, most clinical trials have focused on the manic phase of disease, and not on depression, which is associated with the greatest disease burden. There are few longitudinal studies covering both types of patients with BD (I and II) and the whole course of the disease, regardless of patients' symptomatology. Therefore, the Wide AmbispectiVE study of the clinical management and burden of Bipolar Disorder (WAVE-bd) (NCT 01062607) aims to provide reliable information on the management of patients with BD in daily clinical practice. It also seeks to determine factors influencing clinical outcomes and resource use in relation to the management of BD. Methods WAVE-bd is a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional, longitudinal study. Approximately 3000 patients diagnosed with BD type I or II with at least one mood event in the preceding 12 months were recruited at centres in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela. Site selection methodology aimed to provide a balanced cross-section of patients cared for by different types of providers of medical aid (e. g. academic hospitals, private practices) in each <b>country.</b> <b>Target</b> recruitment percentages were derived either from scientific publications or from expert panels in each participating country. The minimum follow-up period will be 12 months, with a maximum of 27 months, taking into account the retrospective and the prospective parts of the study. Data on demographics, diagnosis, medical history, clinical management, clinical and functional outcomes (CGI-BP and FAST scales), adherence to treatment (DAI- 10 scale and Medication Possession Ratio), quality of life (EQ- 5 D scale), healthcare resources, and caregiver burden (BAS scale) will be collected. Descriptive analysis with common statistics will be performed. Discussion This study will provide detailed descriptions of the management of BD in different countries, particularly in terms of clinical outcomes and resources used. Thus, it should provide psychiatrists with reliable and up-to-date information about those factors associated with different management patterns of BD.

The importance of marketing destinations {{is believed to be}} an esential part of promoting destinations. The growing number of destinations, competing in the international marketplace, poses a challenging situation of a merciless competition among them. A destination's tourism authorities try to present their country at the best possible way as a perfect blend of culture, nature, unforgettable experiences, which will be able to attract tourists, thus increasing tourists' receipts in the destination. Bulgaria is an emerging destination on the worldwide tourism marketplace. A former Communist country and one of the new members of the European Union, the country is trying to find its place amongst the other competing destinations by offering tourists breathtaking scenery, rich cultural and historical heritage, hospitable people and delicious cuisine. Great Britain and Ireland are of a significant importance to Bulgaria, especially the UK is one of the primary markets for the country in terms of number of tourists. Six brochures produced by the Bulgarian State Agency of Tourism for marketing campaign 2008 and the official website of Bulgaria(www. bulgariatravel. org) will be analysed both in terms of content and images. Eleven British and Irish tour operators have been selected as a sample for evaluating their promotional tools(brochures and websites) about Bulgaria. A content analysis as a qualitative method is used to compare the two parties' promotional techniques.

Secondly, I analyze the viability of HIV prevention programs for women in Havana. Finally, this project investigates how social and government organization of space impacts risk or perceived risk for HIV in women. The main phase of the dissertation fieldwork occurred in 2000 and 2001. I conducted semi-structured surveys with approximately 225 individuals, as well as conducted open-ended interviews with public health officials, analyzed media, and used participant observation method. The primary findings indicate that individual risk is a reflection of one's identity. Often, individuals in this study made a point of distancing themselves from stigmatized groups in Cuba society, such as homosexuals or sex workers. In addition, the women who appeared to be most at risk were those in "monogamous relationships. " While these participants thought that the stability in their relationship would make them immune to HIV, often their partners were not sexually faithful to one woman. Therefore, one policy recommendation is that prevention programs in the <b>country</b> <b>target</b> heterosexual women. Additionally, geography factored into peoples' perceptions of risk. Participants associated physical places and spaces with disease and contamination. These spaces were generally where "deviance" was present, for example tourist districts and places where homosexuals are known to congregate. The AIDS sanatorium system is unique to Cuba, and one of its legacies is the "paradox of othering. " Participants considered that the physical separation of people living with HIV from the general populace to be good for both the patients and citizens. The participants saw the sanatorium as a way to contain the virus, reform the individuals' behaviors, and thus integrate those with HIV into postrevolutionary Cuban society...|$|E
