40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Moody's <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> and variables that represent {{the quality of life}} in American cities. The 25 largest cities as measured by population in 1970 fonned the units of analysis. Thirteen quality of life variables were tested. The relationships were calculated using co"elation analysis (Speannan co"elation coefficients). The conclusion is that municipal <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> can be useful to urban geographers interested in {{the quality of life in}} U. S. cities. <b>Bond</b> <b>ratings</b> can be considered self-fulfilling prophecies in that low <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> force interest rates up, necessitating higher taxes and higher fiscal deficits. The result is a further weakening of the city's financial structure, and perhaps a further lowering of the bond rating. Thus, cities with low <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> may face unstable or declining futures, whereas cities with higher <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> may face improving, brighter futures.

This study takes samplefrom companies that published bonds in 2006. First, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practices and credit risk. Credit risk (default risk) can be measured by <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> (Billings, 1999). Using ordered probit regressions, we find evidence that the quality of transparency and financial information disclosure that proxied by big- 4 auditors and audit committee havesignificant influence on <b>bond</b> <b>ratings,</b> but the relationship between block holders and institutional ownership is not significant on <b>bond</b> <b>ratings.</b> Second, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practice and bond yields.

Then we put <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> in the equation, we find that <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> give incremental effect to the evidence. This evidence is consistent to Bradley et. al, (2007), that <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> are the prominent determinant for bond yields.

The probability of explicit restriction in place-is positively related to the amount of capital to be raised in support of the hypothesized relationship: the larger the amount of borrowing, the more likely an explicit restriction is to be included in debt contract. The negative coefficient for <b>bond</b> <b>ratings</b> is statistically significant in strong support of the hypothesized negative relationship between the probability of explicit contracting and <b>bond</b> <b>ratings.</b> The larger the agency costs of debt (that is, the lower the <b>bond</b> <b>ratings),</b> the more likely explicit restrictions are in place.
