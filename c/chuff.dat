60|$|We {{heard the}} <b>chuff</b> {{of the motor}} in the porch, {{and the first to}} enter was Agnes Strickland, whom the Infant makes no secret of adoring.|$|E
60|$|He {{was showing}} the Club to his family. He had 'brought them thither in the light-blue fly, {{waiting at the}} Club door; with Mrs. Chuff's hobbadehoy footboy on the box, {{by the side of}} the flyman, in a sham livery. Nelson Collingwood; pretty Mrs. Sackville; Mrs. Captain <b>Chuff</b> (Mrs. Commodore <b>Chuff</b> we call her), were all there; the latter, of course, in the {{vermilion}} tabinet, which, splendid as it is, is nothing in comparison to the splendour of the 'Sarcophagus.' The delighted Sackville Maine was pointing out the beauties of the place to them. It seemed as beautiful as Paradise to that little party.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{was gone}} Wagley burst out laughing. 'COAL-BLACK eyes!' said he; 'you've just hit it. That's Mrs. Sackville Maine, and that was her husband who just went away. He's a coal-merchant, Snob my boy, and I have no doubt Mr. Perkins's Wallsends are {{supplied}} from his wharf. He is in a flaming furnace when he hears coals mentioned. He {{and his wife and}} his mother are very proud of Mrs. Sackville's family; she was a Miss <b>Chuff,</b> daughter of Captain <b>Chuff,</b> R.N. That is the widow; that stout woman in crimson tabinet, battling about the odd trick with old Mr. Dumps, at the card-table.' ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Chuffing</b> {{is one of}} the low-frequency instabilities {{in solid}} {{propellant}} rockets functioning at low chamber pressures. In <b>chuffing,</b> the rocket motor experiences brief spurts of combustion and consequent pressure buildup, followed by periods of near ambient pressures in the combustion chamber. This period of dormancy can extend up to a few seconds. According to many earlier workers, 1 - 3 during the low-pressure induction period, slow reactions take place in a subsurface layer of the propellant which eventually reaches the temperature where a thermal explosion can occur. Rapid burning of this preheated layer is followed by a sudden ceasing of propellant combustion as the layers beneath it, being at low temperature, cannot sustain the process. While this theory projects the condensed phase reactions as solely responsible for <b>chuffing,</b> there are also those which bring in the importance of gas phase processes...|$|R
60|$|And so, in fact, it was. Sackville Maine (whose name is {{a hundred}} times more elegant, surely, than that of <b>Chuff)</b> was blest with a pretty wife, and a genteel mother-in-law, both of whom some people may envy him.|$|E
6000|$|If you tire, give me both burdens, {{and rest}} the <b>chuff</b> {{of your hand}} [...] on my hip, [...] And in due time you shall repay the same service to me, [...] For after we start we never lie by again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've been {{carrying}} on this game,' thought Jonas {{in a brown}} study, 'for {{the last two or}} three weeks. I never saw my father take so much notice of him as he has in that time. What! You're legacy hunting, are you, Mister <b>Chuff?</b> Eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|Sackville did {{not enter}} it, though little Laura took the back seat on purpose, and left him the front place {{alongside}} of Mrs. <b>Chuff's</b> red tabinet.|$|R

60|$|The {{locomotive}} <b>chuffed</b> slowly {{between the}} banks, hidden. The mare {{did not like}} it. She began to wince away, as if hurt by the unknown noise. But Gerald pulled her back and held {{her head to the}} gate. The sharp blasts of the <b>chuffing</b> engine broke with more and more force on her. The repeated sharp blows of unknown, terrifying noise struck through her till she was rocking with terror. She recoiled like a spring let go. But a glistening, half-smiling look came into Gerald's face. He brought her back again, inevitably.|$|R
60|$|For seeing Mrs. <b>Chuff,</b> his mother-in-law, had a {{taste for}} the genteel--(indeed, her talk was all about Lord Collingwood, Lord Gambier, Sir Jahaleel Brenton, and the Gosport and Plymouth balls)--Wagley and I, {{according}} to our wont, trumped her conversation, and talked about Lords, Dukes, Marquises, and Baronets, as if those dignitaries were our familiar friends.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, {{with two}} engines, we grunt and <b>chuff</b> and twist {{to get over}} the break-neck heights that shut Messina in from the north coast. The windows are opaque with steam and drops of rain. No matter--tea from the thermos flask, to the great {{interest}} of the other two passengers who had nervously contemplated the unknown object.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All as {{right as}} ever,' said Jonas, {{propping}} {{the lid of}} the desk open with his forehead, and unfolding a paper. 'Here's the will, Mister <b>Chuff.</b> Thirty pound a year for your maintenance, old boy, and all the rest to his only son, Jonas. You needn't trouble yourself to be too affectionate. You won't get anything by it. What's that?' ...|$|E

50|$|One (GER No. 490, BR No. 62785) {{has survived}} {{to form a}} part of the National Collection and is {{currently}} located at Bressingham Steam Museum. There are Transacord recordings of their gentle <b>chuffing</b> through the byways of East Anglia.|$|R
50|$|The bricks were Yellow Stock bricks, {{the colour}} {{produced}} by {{adding up to}} 17% chalk to the clay. The brick were graded as Firsts, Seconds (used for facings), Thirds (used for internals), Roughs (used for hardcore) and <b>Chuffs</b> that were unusable.|$|R
60|$|And, ye gods! what a {{difference}} there was between Sackville's dreary French banquets in Pimlico, and the jolly dinners at the Oval! No more legs-of-mutton, no more of 'the best port-wine in England;' but ENTREES on plate, and dismal twopenny champagne, and waiters in gloves, and the Club bucks for company--among whom Mrs. <b>Chuff</b> was uneasy and Mrs. Sackville quite silent.|$|E
6000|$|... '"He {{shall not}} weary for my death, Chuff;" [...] {{that was what}} he said next,' pursued the old clerk, as he wiped his eyes; '{{that was what he}} said next, crying like a little child: [...] "He shall not weary for my death, <b>Chuff.</b> He shall have it now; he shall marry where he has a fancy, <b>Chuff,</b> {{although}} it don't please me; and you and I will go away and live upon a little. I always loved him; perhaps he'll love me then. It's a dreadful thing to have my own child thirsting for my death. But I might have known it. I have sown, and I must reap. He shall believe that I am taking this; and when I see that he is sorry, and has all he wants, I'll tell him that I found it out, and I'll forgive him. He'll make a better man of his own son, and be a better man himself, perhaps, Chuff!"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet, sir, {{that green}} ginger has been drunk {{by some of}} England's proudest heroes,' Mrs. <b>Chuff</b> would exclaim. 'Admiral Lord Exmouth tasted and praised it, sir, on board Captain Chuff's ship, the [...] "Nebuchadnezzar," [...] 74, at Algiers; and he had three dozen with turn in the [...] "Pitchfork" [...] frigate, a part of which was served out to the men before he went into his immortal action with the [...] "Furibonde," [...] Captain Choufleur, in the Gulf of Panama.' ...|$|E
60|$|What {{could make}} a man so happily disposed, unhappy? What could cause discomfort, bickering, and estrangement in a family so {{friendly}} and united? Ladies, {{it was not my}} fault--it was Mrs. <b>Chuff's</b> doing--but the rest of the tale you shall have on a future day.|$|R
50|$|The d√©nouement {{reveals that}} it was a revenge {{campaign}} against the woman who rejected him years ago, young Mr. McFarlane's mother. Oldacre tries to pass off his actions as a practical joke, but he is taken into custody. Holmes lightly <b>chuffs</b> his rival for neglecting Blackheath, where he acquired the key information.|$|R
500|$|Yeah, we {{were kind}} of {{disappointed}} [...] because it sold really well. I think it was just the timing because One Direction at the same time shot straight to number one with 'Little Things'. It's always hard to compete with the 1D lads. And we're <b>chuffed</b> to bits for them; we've always been supportive of them.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after his}} {{marriage}} {{the old lady}} {{was good enough to}} come and pay him a visit--just for a fortnight--at his pretty little cottage, Kennington Oval; and, such is her affection for the place, has never quitted it these four years. She has also brought her son, Nelson Collingwood <b>Chuff,</b> to live with her; but he is not so much at home as his mamma, going as a day-boy to Merchant Taylors' School, where he is getting a sound classical education.|$|E
60|$|His Majesty {{then went}} on to explain that, now old age was {{creeping}} upon him, he proposed to devote his remaining strength to bringing about a keener sense of local patriotism in the various municipalities of London. How few of them knew the legends of their own boroughs! How many there were who had never heard of the true origin of the Wink of Wandsworth! What {{a large proportion of the}} younger generation in Chelsea neglected to perform the old Chelsea <b>Chuff!</b> Pimlico no longer pumped the Pimlies. Battersea had forgotten the name of Blick.|$|E
60|$|In {{the great}} library (225 feet long by 150) {{the only man}} Mrs. <b>Chuff</b> saw, was Tiggs. He was lying on a crimson-velvet sofa, reading a French novel of Paul de Kock. It was a very little book. He is a very little man. In that {{enormous}} hall {{he looked like a}} mere speck. As the ladies passed breathless and trembling in the vastness of the magnificent solitude, he threw a knowing, killing glance at the fair strangers, as much as to say, 'Ain't I a fine fellow?' They thought so, I am sure.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} theoretical and experimental studies concerned with hybrid rocket instability. The instabilities discussed include atomization and mixing instabilities, <b>chuffing</b> instabilities, pressure coupled combustion instabilities, and vortex shedding.

50|$|At the inn {{later that}} night the Traveller hears the faint whistle and <b>chuffing</b> of a passing train before {{retiring}} to bed, and in his sleep dreams of The Signalman telling him not to call out and, {{even though he could}} not hear it as the time, of the bell bathed in the red light of the tunnel making its vibrating ring.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2009, Steve McDonald {{was voted}} the nation's {{favourite}} soap {{character in a}} poll conducted by The People newspaper.

6000|$|... 'Good fellow, the Duke,' Wagley replied. 'Pray, ma'am' (to Mrs. <b>Chuff),</b> 'you {{who know}} the world and etiquette, {{will you tell me}} what a man ought to do in my case? Last June, his Grace, his son Lord Castlerampant, Tom Smith, and myself were dining at the Club, when I offered the odds against DADDYLONGLEGS for the Derby--forty to one, in sovereigns only. His Grace took the bet, and of course I won. He has never paid me. Now, can I ask such a great man for a sovereign?--One more lump of sugar, if you please, my dear madam.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if that be all," [...] said Lambourne, [...] "my motives lie above water. While this gold of mine lasts"--taking out his purse, {{chucking}} it {{into the}} air, and catching it as it fell--"I will make it buy pleasure; {{and when it is}} out I must have more. Now, if this mysterious Lady of the Manor--this fair Lindabrides of Tony Fire-the-Fagot--be so admirable a piece as men say, why, there is a chance that she may aid me to melt my nobles into greats; and, again, if Anthony be so wealthy a <b>chuff</b> as report speaks him, he may prove the philosopher's stone to me, and convert my greats into fair rose-nobles again." ...|$|E
60|$|Coming out of {{the lane}} along the darkness, with the dark space {{spreading}} down to the wind, and the twinkling lights of the station below, the far-off windy <b>chuff</b> of a shunting train, the tiny clink-clink-clink of the wagons blown between the wind, the light of Beldover-edge twinkling upon the blackness of the hill opposite, {{the glow of the}} furnaces along the railway to the right, their steps began to falter. They would soon come {{out of the}} darkness into the lights. It was like turning back. It was unfulfilment. Two quivering, unwilling creatures, they lingered {{on the edge of the}} darkness, peering out at the lights and the machine-glimmer beyond. They could not turn back to the world--they could not.|$|E
5000|$|The Class O {{locomotive}} {{was also}} included in the Rails of War Mod for Minecraft. It only comes with no armor, and a black paint-scheme(you can change it with dye), and is the biggest and fastest loco in the mod, with <b>chuffing</b> sounds, and a 5-chime steam whistle, and it goes well with the other engines: B-2023, an 0-6-0, and the Cherepanov loco.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mulla-mulgars," [...] he said, [...] "and {{beside his}} bow and his sharp-nosed darts, {{he has three}} big knubbly cudgels in the corner higher than is Nod.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} Constraint Programming (CP) {{models to}} solve a cryptanalytic problem: the chosen key differential attack against the standard block cipher AES. The problem is solved in two steps: In Step 1, bytes are abstracted by binary values; In Step 2, byte values are searched. We introduce two CP models for Step 1 : Model 1 is derived from AES rules in a straightforward way; Model 2 contains new constraints that remove invalid solutions filtered out in Step 2. We also introduce a CP model for Step 2. We evaluate scale-up properties of two classical CP solvers (Gecode and Choco) and a hybrid SAT/CP solver (<b>Chuffed).</b> We show that Model 2 is much more efficient than Model 1, and that <b>Chuffed</b> is faster than Choco which is faster than Gecode on the hardest instances of this problem. Furthermore, we prove that a solution claimed to be optimal in two recent cryptanalysis papers is not optimal by providing a better solution...|$|R
