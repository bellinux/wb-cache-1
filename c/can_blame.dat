25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships {{as more of a}} priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London researchers say it’s evolutionary and we <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> our ancestors for this.|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you back now love".|$|E

2500|$|Producer Deeley, on {{the other}} hand, was quick to defend Cimino's {{comments}} on the nature and motives of the film: [...] "The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn't about drugs or {{the collapse of the}} morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now is surreal. The Deer Hunter is a parable... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> their leaders.. or they <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory." ...|$|E

He stood by Kat while she had his cousin's baby and through the misery of losing baby Tommy. It would be absolutely devastating for him to learn that all this tragedy has driven them apart again."

2500|$|In a 1914 {{interview}} Weber declared: [...] "In {{moving pictures}} I have found my life's work. I find at once {{an outlet for}} my emotions and my ideals. I can preach to my heart's content, and {{with the opportunity to}} write the play, act the leading role, and direct the entire production, if my message fails to reach someone, I <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> only myself." [...] As many of Weber's films focused on a moral topic, she [...] "was often mistaken as a Christian fundamentalist, but she was more of a libertarian, opposing censorship and the death penalty and championing birth control. The need for a strong, loving and nurturing home was clearly promoted as well and if there was a single maxim that underlay each film it was that selfishness and egocentricity erode the individual and community".|$|E
2500|$|BBC {{diplomatic}} correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article, after {{describing the}} [...] "scarred decade" [...] of the 1990s with [...] "rampant hyperinflation", harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate {{like that for}} a nation in a war, the country turning [...] "from superpower into beggar", wonders: [...] "So who <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E

After he became emperor, his stepmother Guo Nüwang became the empress dowager.

You're your father's son so you <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> your dead father. Are you going to kill your stepmother for your real mother?" [...] Cao Rui turned furious and forced Empress Dowager Guo to commit suicide. He had her buried with the funeral rites befitting that of an empress, but also ordered her dead body to be treated {{in the same manner as}} she did to his mother – hair covering face, mouth stuffed with rice husks. However, the historical text Weilüe stated that after Empress Dowager Guo died of illness in 235, Cao Pi's concubine Lady Li (李夫人) told Cao Rui about the fate of his mother. Cao Rui was deeply grieved and he ordered Guo's dead body to be treated in the same manner as she did to his mother.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accepting}} the role Noel Clarke comments that he [...] "had {{to have a}} lot of faith" [...] in executive producers Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner because he felt the series was not of high quality at the time of its previous cancellation. Mickey was created alongside Rose's mother Jackie in order to explore the question of who is left behind after a companion leaves earth to travel with the Doctor. Russell T Davies created the two characters and returned frequently to them in order to make Rose [...] "real" [...] and [...] "give her a life". Whilst Billie Piper, who played Rose, felt that the character of Rose was [...] "ruthless" [...] in abandoning elements from her home life, Clarke commented that he felt anybody would do the same, stating [...] "who <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> her really?" [...] He felt that Rose's relationship with Mickey consisted of her [...] "sitting on the couch, watching him watch football". Retrospectively viewing the episode [...] "Rose" [...] in 2009, Davies identifies Mickey's characterisation as [...] "naturally selfish"—in the same vein he identifies many of his characters—drawing into question his [...] "mysterious emails" [...] and the fact he [...] "abandons Rose for the football down the pub". He suggests that the character [...] "deserved to lose his girlfriend, right from the start". Clarke feels the character of Mickey wasn't widely liked in the first series, admitting that he also saw the part as a [...] "kids’ TV" [...] role.|$|E

[...] Jackson's wardrobe and suggestive choreography drew media controversy; also considered to start fashion trends.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the pitch {{invasion}} against West Bromwich Albion, Leeds were banned from playing their first five home games of the 1971–72 season at home, and only managed to pick up 2 points from those games. However, they still managed to mount a challenge for the Double; an Allan Clarke goal was enough as Leeds beat Arsenal 1–0 in the FA Cup Final, but once again heavy fixture congestion meant that Leeds had to play three crucial games within the space of one week; an away match against Chelsea in the league three days before the FA cup final and they had to play their final league game less than two days after the final, which was away to Wolves. Leeds only had to draw this game to win the title, but they were beaten. The league went to Derby County, again by 1 point. Eric Todd of the Guardian wrote on the situation in the week prior to these games: [...] "If Leeds fail to win either the Cup or the League title they need not blame loss of form. They must blame the system. And if Leeds cannot field a full strength side against Arsenal at Wembley, the crowd <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> the Football League and Chelsea who have decided that their jaunt to the West Indies, or wherever it is, is more important than trying to help Leeds prepare properly for crucial football matches." [...] In later years controversy surrounding this game would develop into a match-fixing scandal, with accusations directed towards Leeds United captain Billy Bremner. However Bremner would clear his name of these allegations in court, with evidence given for Bremner by Wolves captain and forward Derek Dougan, who scored the winning goal in the match.|$|E
