5000|$|Before the {{development}} of semiconductor power electronics, {{it was difficult to}} vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications. Applications such as electric overhead cranes used DC drives or wound rotor motors (WRIM) with slip rings for rotor <b>circuit</b> <b>connection</b> to variable external resistance allowing considerable range of speed control. However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads.

50|$|Analog current loops were {{historically}} occasionally carried between buildings by dry pairs in telephone cables leased {{from the}} local telephone company. 4-20 mA loops were {{more common in the}} days of analog telephony. These circuits require end-to-end direct current (DC) continuity, and unless a dedicated wire pair was hardwired, their use ceased with the introduction of semiconductor switching. DC continuity is not available over a microwave radio, optical fibre, or a multiplexed telephone <b>circuit</b> <b>connection.</b> Basic DC circuit theory shows that the current is the same all along the line. It was common to see 4-20 mA circuits that had loop lengths in miles or circuits working over telephone cable pairs that were longer than ten thousand feet end-to-end. There are still legacy systems in place using this technology. In Bell System circuits, voltages up to 125 VDC were employed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} of an IGCT {{is very similar}} to a GTO thyristor. In an IGCT, the gate turn-off current is greater than the anode current. This results in a complete elimination of minority carrier injection from the lower PN junction and faster turn-off times. The main differences are a reduction in cell size, and a much more substantial gate connection with much lower inductance in the gate drive circuit and drive <b>circuit</b> <b>connection.</b> The very high gate currents and fast dI/dt rise of the gate current mean that regular wires {{can not be used to}} connect the gate drive to the IGCT. The drive circuit PCB is integrated into the package of the device. The drive circuit surrounds the device and a large circular conductor attaching to the edge of the IGCT is used. The large contact area and short distance reduce both the inductance and resistance of the connection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Normal hand gesture {{recognition}} methods using surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals require {{designers to}} use {{digital signal processing}} hardware or ensemble methods as tools to solve real time hand gesture classification. Some methods {{could also result in}} complicated computational models, complex <b>circuit</b> <b>connection</b> and lower online recognition rate. It is therefore imperative to have good methods to explore a more suitable online design choice, which can avoid the problems mentioned above. An online hand gesture recognition model by using Flexible Neural Trees (FNT) and based on sEMG signals is proposed in this paper. The sEMG is a non-invasive, easy to record signal of superficial muscles from the skin surface, which has been applied in many fields of treatment and rehabilitation. The FNT model is generated and evolved based on the pre-defined simple instruction sets, which can solve highly structure dependent problem of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). FNT method avoids complicated computation and inconvenience of <b>circuit</b> <b>connection</b> and also has an higher online recognition rate. Testing has been conducted using several continuous experiments conducted with five participants.

40|$|Axons in the {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system (CNS) fail to regenerate after injury. A major goal of neuroscience is to develop strategies to promote axon regeneration and to re-establish accurate <b>circuit</b> <b>connections.</b> Using the mouse visual system as a model I show that neural activity of adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) induced by either visual experience or by chemogenetic activation, promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve crush. When combined with activation of the cell growth- promoting protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), visual stimulation-driven RGC activity triggers axons to regenerate {{all the way back}} into the brain. Analysis of genetically-labeled RGC types revealed that remarkably, regrowth is target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided incorrect visual targets suggesting the guidance cues that direct RGC axons are either still present or are re- expressed in response to regeneration. Moreover, the target-specific regrowth of adult RGC axons resulted in partial recovery of several different visual functions. These findings indicate that visually-evoked and artificially-induced sensory activity can be powerful tools for enhancing axon regeneration and they highlight the remarkable capacity of mammalian CNS neurons to re-establish accurate <b>circuit</b> <b>connections</b> in the adult brain...|$|R
