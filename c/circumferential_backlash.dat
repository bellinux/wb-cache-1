40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is {{to discuss the issue}} of {{strength}} of the <b>circumferential</b> <b>backlash</b> compensating beam in a high-efficiency gear pump. Three geometric versions of the compensating beam structure differing in the wrapping angle are analyzed. The mechanical model is solved assuming the curved beam model supported at the contact points between the beam and the gear teeth. The assumed mechanical structure is statically indeterminate. In order to determine the reactions in the supports and in the beam fixing, the Menabrei and Castigliano theorems are used. Based on analytical calculation results, the cause of compensation structure damage during experimental tests of prototype units is identified and the most favorable variant of beam structure, from the mechanical strength point of view, is determined...|$|E
