40|$|This study {{applied a}} novel {{conversion}} method to convert {{coal fly ash}} (CFA) into pure form (without mixture of CFA residue), single phase and high crystalline zeolite 4 A. This novel conversion method allows a reduction by half of the total conversion time while maintaining {{a high degree of}} crystallinity of zeolite 4 A which exists in a narrower particle size distribution. Applications of the CFA converted zeolite 4 A (C 4 A) in waste water treatment of multi-heavy-metal-ions and in <b>catalytic</b> methane <b>combustion</b> were evaluated. In waste water treatment, for C 4 A and commercial zeolite 4 A, the equilibrium sorption data were well fitted by the Langmuir model and showed the affinity order: Cu 2 + > Cr 3 + > Zn 2 + > Co 2 + > Ni 2 +. Compared to commercial zeolite 4 A, the C 4 A and the treated CFA residue (TCFAR) were effective in removing multi-heavyions in water and could be an alternative material for treatment of wastewater. In <b>catalytic</b> methane <b>combustion,</b> post-treatment of C 4 A was performed to enhance catalytic activity of the catalyst. <b>Catalytic</b> methane <b>combustion</b> was conducted at atmospheric pressure and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) between 3230 and 16150 h - 1 under different lean fuel concentrations (equivalence ratio of 0. 1 - 0. 4) at 500 °C. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) results showed the catalyst (M(250) -C 4 A) could be operated at a temperature of 700 °C without damage to the zeolite structure. At 500 °C, higher combustion efficiency was achieved by either reducing the GHSV under the same fuel concentration or reducing the fuel concentration under the same GHSV. Comparing to a commercial catalyst 2 %Pd/Al 2 O 3, the catalyst (M(250) -C 4 A) achieved a higher methane conversion % in the GHSV range of 3230 - 9690 h - 1.

40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> {{hydrocarbon}} <b>combustion</b> is a technologically important, {{but still}} relatively poorly understood reaction. To shed more {{light on the}} role of various physical and chemical characteristics of the catalyst on its activity for hydrocarbon combustion, La 1 -xSrxM 1 -yM'O-y(3 -delta) perovskites (M and M' represent transition metals) were used as a model system. Four representative compositions were prepared and fully characterized by different methods and their activity was determined in methane and propane combustion. Oxygen desorption reflecting oxygen mobility is mainly a function of composition, more or less independently from specific surface area (SSA). On the other hand, the results confirm that SSA is the important factor determining the high activity. Yet, in these oxide type catalysts (perovskites) the loss of activity due to lower SSA, resulting from aging at elevated temperatures, seems, to a large part, be compensated for by fast oxygen mobility assured in oxygen nonstoichiometric compositions.
