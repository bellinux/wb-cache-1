5000|$|Mortiz Traube was a German {{student of}} the German chemist Justus von Liebig in the mid-19th century. In 1867, Traube {{developed}} the Traube cell from <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide,</b> in order to study the properties of plasma membranes. The artificial cell would expand and bud like living cells. Surgeon and professor Wilhelm Pfeffer used this model to study and coin the term [...] "plasma membrane".|$|E
5000|$|The Traube {{precipitation}} membrane {{consists of}} <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> and forms readily on a surface of crystal potassium ferrocyanide when the crystal {{is put into}} a dilute solution of copper sulfate. The membrane is semi-permeable, and expands rapidly into the Traube cell. Within the cell is {{a high concentration of}} potassium ferrocyanide with strong osmotic force. While it cannot diffuse outward, water and the copper sulfate solution can flow inwards. When the expansion caused the membrane to burst, a new membrane was quickly formed. In this way, the cell could [...] "grow" [...] and become several centimeters long. The ability of the Traube cell membrane to allow water to flow in while retaining the cell solute is comparable to living cells.|$|E
50|$|Multicolor is a {{subtractive}} natural color {{motion picture}} process. Multicolor, {{introduced to the}} motion picture industry in 1929, {{was based on the}} earlier Prizma Color process, and was the forerunner of Cinecolor. For a Multicolor film, a scene is shot with a normal camera capable of bipacking film. Two black-and-white 35 mm film negatives are threaded bipack in the camera. One records the color red (via a dyed panchromatic film), and the other, blue (orthochromatic). In printing, duplitized stock is exposed and processed with one record on each side. In a tank of toning solution, the film is floated upon the top of the solution with the appropriate chemical. The cyan record is toned a complementary red with a <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> solution, and the red being toned blue/cyan with ferric ferrocyanide solution.|$|E
40|$|The ultracytochemical {{localization}} of 3 ƒÀ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 ƒÀ-HSD) and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) {{was investigated}} in cells of the rat adrenal cortex using <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide.</b> After incubation in a 3 ƒÀ-HSD medium, final reaction products of <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> were observed in the cytoplasmic matrix near the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and in the intracristal spaces of mitochondria of the fascicular zone and reticular zone. No deposits appeared in the Golgi apparatus or nuclei. Cells of the glomerular zone were devoid of enzyme activity. The final re-action products of <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> of the G 6 PD activity were found mainly in the cytoplasmic matrix {{in the vicinity of}} the plasma membrane of the fascicular zone. Some cells of the glomerular zone demonstrated the same reaction products in the cytoplasmic matrix. This finding was consistent with the fact that G 6 PD is a cytoplasmic enzyme. The result of our ultracyto-chemical study on the localization of 3 ƒÀ-HSD activity has not always been in accord with the biochemical data in cell fraction reporting that most of th...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{composite}} materials based on metal ferrocyanides combined with natural mineral sorbents {{for treatment of}} high salinity Cs-containing liquid radioactive waste (LRW) was investigated. The study indicated that among the investigated composites, the best sorption characteristics for Cs were shown by materials based on <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide.</b> Several factors affecting the removal of cesium from LRW, namely total salt content, pH and organic matter content, were also investigated. High concentrations of complexing organic matter significantly reduced the sorption capacity of ferrocyanide sorbents...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic acetycholinesterase-positive {{cells in}} the basal layer of the {{epidermis}} and in wool follicles of the sheep have been identified ultrastructurally as Langerhans cells using a <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> technique to demonstrate acetycholinesterase. This enzyme {{is located on the}} outer surface of the plasma membranes of the Langerhans cells and in the intercellular spaces between these cells and the adjacent epithelial cells. No enzyme activity has been detected within Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells in fetal and adult sheep are morphologically similar and no developmental stages have been detected. Ultrastructurally these cells are similar to those described in other mammals. However, in sheep epidermis they are restricted to the basal layer and are less frequent than in man or guinea pig where they are mainly found in the spinous layer. Langerhans {{cells in the}} sheep, which form a system in contact with all keratinocytes in the basal layer, may have a significant influence on the function of the epidermis...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the uptake of {{compounds}} that ordinarily do not penetrate into cells {{have been a}} source of data {{on the size of the}} extracellular space in nervous tissue. The distribution of one such compound, ferrocyanide, has been studied in the toad retina by means of the light and electron microscopes. At the level of the light microscope, ferrocyanide, detected as Prussian blue, appears to penetrate predominantly within the inner processes of M/iller cells. A diffuse background staining by Prussian blue can be noticed also at the inner retinal layers. At the level of the electron microscope, Mfiller cells exhibit an extensively developed system of channels which are formed by infoldings of the plasma membrane. Ferrocyanide, detected as <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> deposits, is found occupying the lumina of these channels and in the narrow intercellular gaps of the retina. These observations indicate that in the toad retina the extracellular medium includes the intercellular spaces plus a glial compartment formed by the infoldings of the plasma membrane of the Mfiller cells. Electron microscope studies of the central nervous system have shown that in nervous tissue the cellular elements are so tightly packed that the intercellular space is reduced to gaps of about 120 to 250 A between the plasma membrane o...|$|E
40|$|Cytochemical {{staining}} {{techniques for}} microbodies (peroxisomes) are limited at {{present to the}} enzymes catalase and a-hydroxy acid oxidase, and neither technique can distinguish glyoxysomes from other microbodies. Described here is a procedure using ferricyanide for the cytochemical demonstration by light and electron microscopy of malate synthase activity in glyoxysomes of cotyledons from fat-storing cucumber and sunflower seedlings. Malate synthase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, catalyzes the condensation of acetyl CoA with glyoxylate to form malate and release free coenzyme A. Localization of the enzyme activity {{is based on the}} reduction by free CoA of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, and the visualization of the latter as an insoluble, electron-opaque deposit of <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> (Hatchett's brown). The conditions and optimal concentrations for the cytochemical reaction mixture were determined in preliminary studies using a colorimetric assay developed to measure disappearance of ferricyanide at 420 nm. Ultrastructural observation of treated tissue reveals electron-opaque material deposited uniformly throughout the matrix portion of the glyoxysomes, with little background deposition elsewhere in the cell. The reaction product is easily visualized in plastic sections by phase microscopy without poststaining. Although the method has been applied thus far only to cotyledons of fat-storing seedlings, it is anticipated that the technique will be useful in localizing and studying glyoxylate cycle activity in a variety of tissues from both plants and animals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The myenteric plexus of the {{proximal}} colon, midcolon, and distal colon was studied in mice chronically {{infected with the}} Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi by means of histochemical methods for NADH-diaphorase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) on whole mount preparations. Ganglia of infected mice displayed an irregular distribu-tion, with neurons severely altered in form and were found {{side by side with}} slightly degenerated or morphologically normal ones. Significant reductions of at least 36 % in the numbers of neurons were recorded in all regions of the colons of infected animals, especially in the distal colon where the neuron number decreased by more than 44 %. Measurements of neuron size suggest that the neuronal destruction caused by T. cruzi affected the medium and large neurons. The small neurons apparently were not affected by the infection. The histochemical demonstration of AChE by the direct coloring <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> method showed that in the control animals, most of the neurons of the plexus displayed AChE activity in the cytoplasm although the neurons showed different reaction intensities. The AChE activity was also present, but at a lower intensity, in the myenteric plexus of the colons of infected animals. These results suggest that the T. cruzi infection affects some categories of neurons and implies that some particular enteric neurotransmitter systems could be affected and the potency of their action upon intestinal function conse-quently reduced. The digestive form of Chagas ’ disease involves denerva...|$|E
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for localizing sites of cholinesterase activity in rat cardiac muscle by electron microscopy. The method utilizes thiocholine esters as substrates, and {{is believed to be}} dependent on the reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide by thiocholine released by enzymatic activity. The ferrocyanide thus formed is captured by copper to form fine, electron-opaque deposits of <b>copper</b> <b>ferrocyanide,</b> which sharply delineate sites of enzymatic activity at the ultrastructural level. Cholinesterase activity in formalin-fixed heart muscle was localized: (a) in longitudinal elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not in the T, or transverse, elements; and (b) in the A band, with virtually no activity noted in the M band, or in the H zone. The I band was also negative. No activity was detected in the sarcolemma, or in invaginations of the sarcolemma {{at the level of the}} Z band. The perinuclear element of the sarcoplasmic (endoplasmic) reticulum was frequently strongly positive. Activity at all sites was completely abolished by omitting the substrates, or by inhibition with eserine 10 - 4 M and diisopropylfluorophosphate 10 - 5 M. Eserine 10 - 5 M completely inhibited reaction in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and virtually abolished that in the A band. These observations, together with the use of the relatively specific substrates and suitable controls to eliminate non-enzymatic staining, indicate that cholinesterase activity was being demonstrated. The activity in rat heart against different substrates was that of non-specific cholinesterases, in accordance with biochemical data. The activity in the A band was considered to be probably due to myosincholinesterase. It is proposed that the localization of cholinesterases in myocardium at the ultrastructural level should be taken into account in considering the possible functions of these myocardial enzymes, and it is hoped that knowledge of their localization will open up new avenues of approach in considering their physiological role in myocardium, which at present is not definitely known...|$|E
