50|$|<b>Carbonitriding</b> {{also has}} other {{advantages}} over carburizing. To begin, {{it has a}} greater resistance to softening during tempering and increased fatigue and impact strength. It is possible to use both <b>carbonitriding</b> and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with low case hardenability, such as {{the seat of the}} valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required case depth (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then <b>carbonitriding</b> to achieve required <b>carbonitrided</b> case depth. The parts are then oil quenched, and the resulting part has a harder case than possibly achieved for carburization, and the addition of the <b>carbonitrided</b> layer increases the residual compressive stresses in the case such that the contact fatigue resistance and strength gradient are both increased.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Currently in {{the repair}} and {{manufacture}} {{at the stage}} of recovery of steel parts, widely used special coatings formed by electrolytic effects on ferrous ions. This technique offers high performance, ease of implementation, low cost of technological equipment and materials used, as well as easy automation of the process. However, this method has several disadvantages: low fatigue strength of reconditioned parts, insufficiently strong grip of the iron coating to the substrate, particularly in alloy steels, insufficient wear resistance. For the purpose of increasing durability and wear resistance of parts, restored through electrochemical action, it is proposed to use chemical-heat treatment, consisting {{in the application of}} <b>carbonitriding.</b> Investigated the efficacy of different modes of <b>carbonitriding</b> in the highly carburizing paste-and their influence on the structure and properties of iron plating. It is established that the nitrocarburizing both low and high temperatures repeatedly (6 - 7. 5 times) increases the microhardness of the coatings. The highest hardness is obtained by low-temperature <b>carbonitriding</b> with direct quenching in water. Conducting the <b>carbonitriding</b> process at low temperatures (650 °C), significantly increases the hardness of the iron coatings, increasing the limit of its fluidity, a and also greatly increases its endurance limit. Nitrocarburized fatigue strength of samples with iron precipitation on the surface, as shown by our studies, not only higher strength of the same samples without <b>carbonitriding</b> (more than 2 times), but higher than the fatigue strength of the base metal without coatings. Raising the temperature of the <b>carbonitriding</b> did not increase the hardness of electrolytic iron. Developed a rational technology of hardening of steel parts, re-chain iron fortification. Selected optimum conditions for <b>carbonitriding</b> hardening restored iron fortification, with the purpose of increasing durability of machine parts Optimal process temperature re-benching of the process of <b>carbonitriding</b> in which is possible to obtain maximum fatigue strength and wear resistance from the restored detail, is the process of <b>carbonitriding</b> at 650 °C, followed by quenching and tempering at 150 °C...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{identification}} of mechanical properties of <b>carbonitrided</b> steels using the spherical indentation test. The proposed procedure consists in performing the Vickers microindentation hardness test across the <b>carbonitrided</b> steel {{in order to obtain}} the thickness of the hardened layers. Thus, with the assumption of a linear variation of the plastic properties in the intermediate layers between surface and substrate, two spherical macroindentation tests, performed on the substrate and {{on the surface of the}} <b>carbonitrided</b> steel, are necessary to identify the work hardening laws' variation through the thickness of the <b>carbonitrided</b> steel. The proposed method does not call for inverse analysis but is based on the use of a database of finite element simulation F–h curves obtained by simulating indentation tests on the surface of various pseudo-carbonitrided materials. The advantage of this method compared to those based on inverse analysis is that it allows a representative strain and a confidence domain of the solution to be determined.
