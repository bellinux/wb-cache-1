5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat and the 2010 animated television series The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat Knows a Lot About That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hats {{popularity}} {{also led}} to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's Horton Hatches the Egg had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, {{the year after the}} publication of The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat, 27,643 copies of Horton were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

5|$|Geisel {{agreed to}} write The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat {{at the request}} of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under {{contract}} with Random House, the head of Random House, Bennett Cerf, made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is a habitat generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle cat {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

5|$|For {{the main}} villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery {{suggested}} Klaus Maria Brandauer, {{the lead of}} the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film Mephisto. Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush – the name coming from one of the early scripts of Thunderball. Carrera's performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat {{has been}} adapted for various media, {{including}} theater, television, film, and educational software. The animated musical TV special premiered in 1971 and starred Allan Sherman as the Cat.

Boxoffice.com {{reports that the}} film grossed $133,960,541 worldwide on an estimated $165 million budget. In 2012, following the financial success of The Lorax, the animated film adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book of the same name, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment announced plans to produce a CGI adaptation of the book. Rob Lieber will write the script, Chris Meledandri will produce, and Audrey Geisel will be the executive producer.|$|E

You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Myron {{published}} , {{written with}} the help of Bret Witter, which reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list of nonfiction books. The book told the story of Dewey's life at the library, interspersed with the difficulties faced by the town and Myron in her personal life, and how Dewey helped ease those burdens. Based on their first book, Myron and Witter published two children's books: Dewey: There's a <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Library!, a picture book for young children and Dewey: The Library Cat, a book for middle-grade readers. Later in 2008, Meryl Streep was cast to star in a film based on the book. By May 2012, a final script had not been approved, and the film option was due to expire in June 2012. Myron and Witter published a sequel, Dewey's Nine Lives, in 2010, detailing previously unreleased stories about Dewey, as well as tales Myron heard about other cats after Dewey's death. That same year, Myron and Witter published a children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library, intended for 3–6 year-olds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic <b>cat.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Though he {{was never}} {{returned}} to the wild, the recorded observations of Yon are extremely important regarding Iriomote cat preservation. Every day, records were taken including what he did at what time, weight, and anything else of note. Because of difficulties <b>in</b> researching Iriomote <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild, observations of Yon are currently {{the best example of}} the cats' natural behavior. There are also very few cases of the cats being cared for by people, so records of his health care may help injured and sick Iriomote <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|R
50|$|According to some claims, {{the first}} litters of {{typically}} Oregon-Rex-like <b>cats</b> occurred <b>in</b> 1944. <b>The</b> first documented {{case of an}} Oregon Rex cat is traced back to a litter of <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Oregon <b>in</b> 1955. <b>The</b> specific kitten differed from its siblings and its mother by having a curly coat whereas the others all had straight fur.|$|R

5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore {{begins with a}} black and white {{flashback}} to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E

40|$|Blood {{samples from}} 1, 072 {{domestic}} cats of nine administrative regions of Belo Horizonte, MG, were collected and tested using PCR nested for {{the occurrence of}} feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Overall occurrence was 47. 5 % (507 / 1072) being North (68. 1 %) and East (54. 4 %) the most prevalent areas. Epidemiological data showed that FeLV infection was very common among examined cats and breed neither gender nor were predisposing factors for FeLV.

40|$|Feral cats (Felis catus) {{have caused}} the decline and {{extinction}} of threatened species on islands worldwide. The eradication or long-term control of cats is therefore {{an essential part of}} restoring native communities on these islands. In most situations, a combination of lethal techniques is required to remove feral cats, including trapping, hunting and poisoning. Para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) is being developed as a new, humane poison for feral cats. Mammalian carnivore species appear more susceptible to PAPP than birds, so it potentially has higher target selectivity than other available toxins. A proprietary formulation of PAPP (PredaSTOP) developed by Connovation NZ Ltd. has been shown to kill cats humanely when delivered in a meat bait in pen trials. Two field trials of the formulation were undertaken with radio-collared cats. Toxic baiting was carried out by placing meat baits containing 80 mg PAPP in bait stations. Five of eight radio-collared <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Island study and 13 of 16 radio-collared <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Island study were poisoned. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> latter study, an additional three cats without collars that were monitored using infra-red cameras were also poisoned.
