In the first part, male and female participants were assigned to either a low or high resource (pay) condition. In two successive trials of a <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> it was modeled that individuals in the high pay condition had the greater authority. In a third trial, participants were asked to complete a measure assessing their status beliefs regarding themselves and their partners, and were then asked to complete an additional decision making task. It was found that both men and women formed status beliefs that ascribed greater legitimate authority to individuals with greater resources. Furthermore, it was found that men were more likely than women to assert their authority when {{they were part of the}} perceived [...] "favored" [...] group. This was thought to be because there are more severe perceived social consequences for women who assert authority illegitimately. In further support of this, a second phase of the study found that men in the perceived higher status group were less likely to submit to a partner's influence than men in the perceived lower status group; however, there was no such status group effect for women, suggesting that gender itself was influencing participants' willingness to resist influence.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{has been relatively}} silent about post-conflict processes. However, understanding the way humans deal with post-conflict situations is a challenge in our societies. With this in mind, we focus the present study on the rationality of <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> after an intergroup conflict, i. e., {{the extent to which}} groups take advantage of post-conflict situations to obtain benefits from collaborating with the other group involved in the conflict. Based on dual-process theories of thinking and affect heuristic, we propose that intergroup conflict hinders the rationality of <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> We also hypothesize that this rationality improves when groups are involved in an in-group deliberative discussion. Results of a laboratory experiment support the idea that intergroup conflict ¿associated with indicators of the activation of negative feelings (negative affect state and heart rate) ¿ has a negative effect on the aforementioned rationality over time and on both group and individual decision making. Although intergroup conflict leads to sub-optimal decision making, rationality improves when groups and individuals subjected to intergroup conflict make decisions after an in-group deliberative discussion. Additionally, the increased rationality of the group decision making after the deliberative discussion is transferred to subsequent individual decision making...|$|E

40|$|Women {{constitute}} {{more than}} half of the Ethiopian population; their socio-economic condition especially in rural areas remains worst than any other time. Rural women belong to the most marginalized section of the society facing adverse conditions in terms of social oppression and economic inequality, a visible majority of them being extremely deprived. Considering this scenario, this paper investigates the key determinants of the socio-economic empowerment of Ethiopian women’s in a cooperative society. The methodology of this study is quantitative based on the data collected from five primary cooperatives found in Degua Tembien Woreda. The data was mainly primary data, from 67 randomly selected women member of a cooperatives and secondary data was collected from the documents of the societies. Tables, percentages, and multiple regressions analysis were used to analyze the collected data. Considering its multidimensional nature and aspects, a cumulative index for women empowerment is constructed using three indices i. e. personal autonomy, family unit <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> and domestic economic decisions. In this study, it was found that income, education level, training, years of stay in the cooperatives, marital status and asset ownership are statistically significant at all levels and have positive impact on women empowerment. Conversely, number of dependents, age of the women, loan size and number of dependents are inversely related with dependent variable Cumulative Empowerment Index (CEI). Finally, concerted efforts like extension work and rural development campaign should be undertaken so as to improve women empowerment by concentrating on the significant factors by the major intervening agencies.

40|$|Taken together, the {{six nations}} of Central America count a {{population}} of roughly 40 million people and an energy market equal in size to that of Colombia, sufficient to benefit from economies of scale. The region has traditionally been a net importer of hydrocarbons, and hydroelectricity has dominated electric generation. But more recently, thermoelectric generation (diesel and fuel oil) has greatly increased {{as a percentage of}} the regional generation market. Progress has been made across the region’s electric sector, beginning with reforms in the 1990 s and the 1996 signing of a regional treaty aimed at the development of a regional energy integration project – the Central American Electrical Interconnection System, or SIEPAC. A fundamental SIEPAC goal is to set up a regional electric market and a regulatory system. Indeed, after many years of development, SIEPAC is poised to open a new chapter in Central America’s electric infrastructure and market. But this new era must contend with critical issues such as the need to consolidate the regional electric market, political issues surrounding the venture, and security concerns. Moreover, local conflicts, in different degrees, have become priorities for policymakers, and these are possible barriers to completing the project. The goals of the SIEPAC project and of deepening the broader electric integration process are possible if national and regional decision makers understand that <b>cooperative</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> will produce better results than separate national decision making.
