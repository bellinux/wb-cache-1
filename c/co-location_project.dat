The Group won public tenders to build co-located private hospitals on the grounds of Beaumont Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital, and University Hospital Limerick. The Limerick facility was to be built by Sisk Group, while the Cork and Dublin hospitals were to be built by Ascon-Rohcon. BMG were to be owners and developers, while UPMC would manage and operate the hospitals. The <b>co-location</b> <b>projects</b> were expected to cost over €850m, providing approximately 1,000 new beds. The new hospitals would provide almost 6,000 full-time, permanent jobs and a further 4,600 construction jobs. <b>Co-location</b> <b>projects</b> were stalled by Vhi Healthcare's refusal to provide cover in the new hospitals. In April 2011, the contracts for the projects expired.|$|R
40|$|Project {{success is}} {{understood}} differently by project participants {{because it is}} multifaceted, requiring many performance measures to determine success. Previous studies have underrepresented the business context of projects and their role in contributing {{to the success of}} the instigating organisation. This issue becomes particularly significant when two or more further and higher education (FE/HE) organisations co-locate their educational operations on a shared site and seek diverse goals from a single project. The relationship between construction project success and long-term educational success created the need for a comprehensive performance measurement framework that defines the contribution of the construction project in supporting FE/HE collaborating institutions through providing a learning environment that enhances the shared educational activities. This study explores the success of constructing a co-located further and higher education (FE/HE) campus when a project definition that continues beyond construction project completion and commissioning, and which encompasses the client’s views of expected business benefits, is adopted. The research developed a measurement framework capable of measuring the performance of FE/HE <b>co-location</b> construction <b>projects,</b> in light of this broader definition. The methodology used to achieve the research aim, influenced by the pragmatic views of the researcher, combined several methods. A focus group identified success criteria for constructing FE/HE co-location campuses. A questionnaire survey elicited the relationships between success criteria from representatives of the directors, senior administrators, and estates managers of further and higher education providers throughout Scotland. Finally, a Delphi survey validated the performance measurement framework by capturing the views of experts in FE/HE co-location. The thesis contributes a comprehensive performance measurement framework structured around two distinctive performance perspectives (performance drivers and performance results) which incorporates multiple project success dimensions and measures. The framework provides a structured way of aggregating performance measures to characterise the representation of thematic performance dimensions...|$|R
