Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking <b>crest</b> <b>line.</b> This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).|$|E
25|$|The {{hinge points}} along an entire folded surface form a hinge line, {{which can be}} either a <b>crest</b> <b>line</b> or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear hinge line gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the axial surface. The axial surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the axial surface is a planar surface then it is called the axial plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An axial trace is the line of intersection of the axial surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E

2500|$|During {{most of the}} Paleozoic Era, {{what became}} the Ouachita Mountains was {{the bottom of a}} shallow sea, where several {{sedimentary}} layers were created. [...] About 500 million years ago a collision of the South American Plate with the North American Plate caused the shale and sandstone layers to fracture and fissure, creating mountains of the folded rocks. [...] The thermal springs emerge from the plunging <b>crest</b> <b>line</b> of a large overturned anticline in the Zigzag Mountains of the Ouachita anticlinorium. The overturned anticline plunges toward the southwest into the Mazarn Basin. There are two recognized major thrust faults trending nearly parallel to fold axes that define the northern and southern limits of the thermal springs discharge area. The northern fault extends nearly parallel to Fountain Street northeastward about [...] onto the southeast flank of North Mountain, and dips about 26 degrees north. At the northern extent of the thermal springs, this fault is suggested to form along the bedding contact of the Hot Springs Sandstone and Stanley Shale, with the Stanley Shale forming the hanging wall of the fault. The southern fault extends northeastward about [...] roughly along the axis of the Hot Springs anticline, and dips about 44 degrees north. It has been proposed that a fault splits away from the southern fault, trends west and connects with the northern fault. A natural ravine trends along the location of this fault. [...] Extensive cracks, joints, and fissures in the Bigfork Chert, Arkansas Novaculite, and the Hot Springs Sandstone allow the water to flow in the thermal springs area. [...] Dissolved minerals in the water precipitate to form the white to tan travertine or [...] "tufa rock" [...] seen near the openings of the hot springs.|$|E

5000|$|Images {{returned}} show {{evidence for}} a geologic feature known as ripple cross-stratification. At {{the base of the}} rock, layers can be seen dipping downward to the right. The bedding that contains these dipping layers is only one to two centimeters (0.4 to 0.8 inches) thick. In the upper right corner of the rock, layers also dip to the right, but exhibit a weak [...] "concave-up" [...] geometry. These two features -- the thin, cross-stratified bedding combined with the possible concave geometry -- suggest small ripples with sinuous <b>crest</b> <b>lines.</b> Although wind can produce ripples, they rarely have sinuous <b>crest</b> <b>lines</b> and never form steep, dipping layers at such a small scale. The most probable explanation for these ripples is that they were formed in the presence of moving water.|$|R
60|$|Once I saw in {{miniature}} through glasses a great wave of infantry surge forward along a spur and disappear beyond a <b>crest</b> <b>line.</b> The patter of the Mauser rifles swelled into a continuous rumbling {{like a train}} of waggons passing over a pontoon bridge, and presently the wave recoiled; the minute figures that composed it squeezed themselves into cover among some rocks, a great many groups of men began carrying away black objects. A trickle of independent dots dispersed itself. Then we groaned. There had been a check. The distant drama continued. The huddling figures began to move again--lithe, active forms moved about rearranging things--officers, we knew, even at the distance. Then the whole wave started again full of impetus--started--went forward, and never came back.

60|$|It is {{the same}} in {{politics}} {{as it is in}} war. When one <b>crest</b> <b>line</b> has been left, it is necessary to go to the next.

These arguments convinced his Majesty's Government that it would be necessary to annul the Letters Patent issued on March 31, 1905, and make an end of the Lyttelton Constitution. That Constitution now passes away into the never-never land, into a sort of chilly limbo that is reserved for the disowned or abortive political progeny of many distinguished men.|$|E
6000|$|Pursuing his {{discovery}} of free gold with great zeal, which he probably credited to his conscience as a grave digger, Mr. Barney Bree {{had made an}} unusually deep sepulcher, and it was near sunset before Mr. Doman, laboring with the leisurely deliberation of one who has [...] "a dead sure thing" [...] and no fear of an adverse claimant's enforcement of a prior right, reached the coffin and uncovered it. When he had done so he was confronted by a difficulty {{for which he had}} made no provision; the coffin--a mere flat shell of not very well-preserved redwood boards, apparently--had no handles, and it filled the entire bottom of the excavation. The best he could do without violating the decent sanctities of the situation was to make the excavation sufficiently longer to enable him to stand {{at the head of the}} casket and getting his powerful hands underneath erect it upon its narrower end; and this he proceeded to do. The approach of night quickened his efforts. He had no thought of abandoning his task at this stage to resume it on the morrow under more advantageous conditions. The feverish stimulation of cupidity and the fascination of terror held him to his dismal work with an iron authority. He no longer idled, but wrought with a terrible zeal. His head uncovered, his outer garments discarded, his shirt opened at the neck and thrown back from his breast, down which ran sinuous rills of perspiration, this hardy and impenitent gold-getter and grave-robber toiled with a giant energy that almost dignified the character of his horrible purpose; and when the sun fringes had burned themselves out along the <b>crest</b> <b>line</b> of the western hills, and the full moon had climbed out of the shadows that lay along the purple plain, he had erected the coffin upon its foot, where it stood propped against the end of the open grave. Then, standing up to his neck in the earth at the opposite extreme of the excavation, as he looked at the coffin upon which the moonlight now fell with a full illumination he was thrilled with a sudden terror to observe upon it the startling apparition of a dark human head--the shadow of his own. For a moment this simple and natural circumstance unnerved him. The noise of his labored breathing frightened him, and he tried to still it, but his bursting lungs would not be denied. Then, laughing half-audibly and wholly without spirit, he began making movements of his head from side to side, in order to compel the apparition to repeat them. He found a comforting reassurance in asserting his command over his own shadow. He was temporizing, making, with unconscious prudence, a dilatory opposition to an impending catastrophe. He felt that invisible forces of evil were closing in upon him, and he parleyed for time with the Inevitable.|$|E
