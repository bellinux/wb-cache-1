The first objective {{of this study was to}} establish the time course of lidocaine and its metabolites, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), in clinically normal dogs. The ultimate goal was to identify the best time(s) for sample collection when disposition of lidocaine is used as a test of hepatic dysfunction. The second goal was to compare the disposition of lidocaine and its metabolites in normal dogs (G 1) and dogs with Alport syndrome, a hereditary proteinuric nephritis (G 2). Lidocaine (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (IV) to six clinically normal dogs. Blood samples were collected intermittently for twelve hours. Concentrations of lidocaine, MEGX, and GX were quantitated in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The resulting data was subjected to standard non-compartmental analysis. A <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> for MEGX occurred between 10 and 60 minutes and for GX between 60 and 120 minutes after the administration of lidocaine. The ratio of concentrations of GX to MEGX versus time was linear from 15 minutes to 180 minutes after IV administration of lidocaine characterized by a slope of 0. 0144 ? 0. 0090 GX/MEGX ratio over time. Subsequently, lidocaine (3 mg/kg) was administered IV to six dogs with Alport syndrome. Pharmacokinetic parameters for lidocaine, MEGX, and GX were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Values for the parameters did not differ between the two groups (p > 0. 05). In G 2, the concentration plateaus for MEGX and GX occurred at the same time as that found in G 1. However, the <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> for MEGX was greater in G 2 (193. 5 ng/ml) than G 1 (143. 6 ng/ml). Also, the <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> for GX was greater in G 2 (153. 7 ng/ml) than G 1 (132. 6 ng/ml). The ratio between the concentrations of GX and MEGX versus time was linear in G 2 from 15 minutes to 180 minutes after IV administration of lidocaine and was characterized by a slope of 0. 0211 ? 0. 0119 GX/MEGX ratio over time.

The two-part plan: (i) China and other developing countries accept targets at BAU in the coming budget period, the same period in which the US first agrees to cuts below BAU; (ii) all countries are asked in the future to make further cuts in accordance with a formula which sums a Progressive Reductions Factor, Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and Gradual Equalization Factor.

This study reports the evaluation of lidocaine pharmacokinetics and appearance and disappearance of its de-ethylated metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). The study was completed to develop a new lidocaine-MEGX liver function test for use in diagnosing and monitoring dogs with chronic progressive liver disease. The lidocaine-MEGX test is used in humans for evaluation of liver function during organ transplant selection, prognostication of chronic liver disease, prioritization of liver transplant recipients, and in monitoring human patients after liver transplant. The principal of the test is that MEGX concentrations 15 or 30 minutes after lidocaine administration is representative of overall liver function. Single point assessment is possible because MEGX concentrations have a steady state plateau starting approximately 15 minutes after lidocaine administration. This plateau is preserved in patients with liver disease but occurs at lower concentrations. Alterations of lidocaine pharmacokinetics also occur in liver disease patients and have been investigated in combination with and independent of MEGX concentrations. This study examined the concentrations and pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and MEGX after administration of lidocaine at a clinically safe dose, 1 mg/kg intravenously, in eleven healthy dogs. Lidocaine and MEGX concentrations were compared using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) measurement of lidocaine. Measurement of lidocaine concentrations using enzyme-linked immunoassay was not successful. A MEGX <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> was present in canine serum from 15 to approximately 60 minutes after lidocaine administration; however, the concentrations were only half that of humans after a comparable lidocaine dose. Lidocaine concentrations measured by HPLC and FPIA were significantly different. Concentrations obtained by FPIA were 2. 5 to 4. 5 -fold higher than those measured by HPLC. This difference is not reported in human serum and has clinical relevance in design of a canine lidocaine-MEGX test and therapeutic drug monitoring of dogs with cardiac disease receiving lidocaine. Monoethylglycinexylidide and lidocaine measurements and pharmacokinetic calculations were hampered by limited HPLC detection ranges. Conclusions are that MEGX concentrations at 30 minutes are likely representative of the <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> in dogs but that further research is necessary at a higher lidocaine dose and/or with assay methods designed for measurements of lower concentrations...|$|E

Various modes of administration were used to achieve different patterns of drug plasma concentrations. Electrophysiological and histological examinations were performed to correlate pharmacokinetics and ototoxicity. Results show that: the uptake of the drug by the inner ear tissues is dose dependent and manifests a rapid saturation kinetics with a <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> of about 1 micrograms/mg of protein. The low ratio of the perilymph and endolymph to plasma concentrations argues against the concept of an accumulation of the drug in the inner ear over drug levels in plasma, which has been considered as the basic mechanism of ototoxicity.

In other organs (liver, heart, lung, and spleen), no saturation could be demonstrated within the duration of the experiment.

Methacholine provocations {{were carried out}} on three days before and after increasing doses of theophylline, enprofylline, and placebo, a double blind study design being used. Methacholine responsiveness was determined as the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a fall of 20 % in FEV 1 (PC 20). The patients were characterised pharmacokinetically before the main study to provide an individual dosage scheme for each patient that would provide rapid steady state plasma <b>concentration</b> <b>plateaus</b> of 5, 10, and 15 mg/l for theophylline and 1. 25, 2. 5, and 3. 75 mg/l for enprofylline.

FEV 1 showed a small progressive decrease after placebo; it remained high in relation to placebo after both drugs and this effect was dose related. Methacholine PC 20 values decreased after placebo; mean values were higher after theophylline and enprofylline than after placebo (maximum difference 2. 0 and 1. 7 doubling doses of methacholine); the effect of both drugs were dose related.

40|$|AbstractVolcano petrologists and geochemists {{increasingly}} use time-scale determinations of magmatic processes from {{modeling the}} chemical zoning patterns in crystals. Most determinations are done using one-dimensional traverses across a two-dimensional crystal section. However, crystals are three-dimensional objects with complex shapes, and diffusion and re-equilibration occurs in multiple dimensions. Given {{that we can}} mainly study the crystals in two-dimensional petrographic thin sections, the determined time-scales could be in error if multiple dimensional and geometrical effects are not identified and accounted for. Here we report {{the results of a}} numerical study where we investigate the role of multiple dimensions, geometry, and initial conditions of Fe–Mg diffusion in an orthopyroxene crystal with the view towards proper determinations of time scales from modeling natural crystals. We found that merging diffusion fronts (i. e. diffusion from multiple directions) causes ‘additional’ diffusion that has the greatest influence close to the crystal’s corners (i. e. where two crystal faces meet), and with longer times the affected area widens. We also found that the one-dimensional traverses that can lead to the most accurate calculated time-scales from natural crystals are along the b- crystallographic axis on the ab-plane when model inputs (concentration and zoning geometry) are taken as measured (rather than inferred from other observations). More specifically, accurate time-scales are obtained if the compositional traverses are highly symmetrical and contain a <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> measured through the crystal center. On the other hand, for two-dimensional models the ab- and ac-planes are better suited if the initial (pre-diffusion) concentration and zoning geometry inputs are known or can be estimated, although these are a priory unknown, and thus, may be difficult to use in practical terms. We also found that under certain conditions, a combined one-dimensional and two-dimensional model performed on the ab-section can reveal the initial (pre-diffusional) concentration, and thus, offer a unique opportunity to recover lost petrologic information. The influence of three-dimensional diffusion on the one-dimensional two-dimensional model estimates is the combined result of the crystal shape, in particular the presence of facets, and somewhat of the aspect ratio. Our study focuses on Fe–Mg in orthopyroxene, but many of the effects we report are also applicable to other minerals and elements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGeological {{storage of}} CO 2 in mafic and ultramafic rocks {{relies on the}} {{dissolution}} of their silicate components, followed by the precipitation of carbonates, the overall process being {{commonly referred to as}} carbonation. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the rate- and yield-controlling factors of mineral carbonation, three batch experiments were conducted in CO 2 -saturated water, at (a) 90 °C, (b) 120 °C and (c) 170 °C, respectively (with citrate ligands added to the 90 °C experiment) in a Ti-reactor at pCO 2 = 280 bar, using San Carlos olivine (Fo 88) as a model mineral of (ultra) mafic environments. Those physicochemical conditions were purposely chosen so as to promote the dissolution rate of olivine. (a) At 90 °C, ~ 40 wt. % of olivine were dissolved within 3 weeks, a result which suggests that the passivation barrier evidenced in previous studies carried out in citrate-free media had been overcome. However, while saturation with respect to magnesite was overstepped in this experiment, the carbonation yield remained below ~ 1 wt. %, which we attributed to the slow kinetics of magnesite precipitation. (b) At 120 °C, the concentration of Mg and Si monitored by aqueous fluid sampling reached an apparent plateau for over 4 weeks, at conditions close to saturation with respect to amorphous silica, and with Fe concentration being below the detection limit. A resumption of the dissolution process was subsequently observed while the concentration of Fe suddenly increased in solution. The <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> was attributed either to the formation of a protective Si–Fe(III) layer, or to the occurrence of Fe(III) phases clogging the porosity of a secondary silica layer. The resumption of olivine dissolution was ascribed to the increasingly reducing conditions that led to the breakdown of the protective phases. This late resumption led to a carbonation yield slightly above 2 wt. %. (c) At 170 °C, Fe was incorporated into a presumably permeable Fe-rich phyllosilicate layer, so that the dissolution process was likely less affected by such an interfacial layer. Nevertheless, carbonate minerals still formed in low quantity (~ 6 wt. %), while other amorphous phases represented the main sink for Mg cations. Overall, this study emphasizes that achieving carbonation reactions in reducing environments and circum-neutral aqueous solutions may represent a necessary requirement for making olivine carbonation a viable process in these temperature ranges. It also insists on the importance of transitory phases, which form both at the fluid-silicate interface and from the bulk solution. While they may not appear in overall carbonation equations or in thermodynamic databases, arguably they can drive the global kinetics of olivine dissolution and its transformation towards magnesite...|$|E
40|$|Chromatography is {{a widely}} used {{separation}} technique including many different modes, for example supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) which uses a supercritical fluid as mobile phase. A supercritical fluid is achieved when a substance is subjected to a temperature and pressure above the critical point and {{the boundary between the}} liquid phase and gas phase is erased. The interest for SFC has increased in recent years, mainly for separation of chiral molecules in the pharmaceutical industry. What makes SFC interesting {{is that it is a}} quick, cost-efficient and green method. This is in part due to less organic solvent used in the mobile phase in SFC compared with liquid chromatography and that the carbon dioxide that represents the major part of the mobile phase is a by-product from other processes. In SFC modifiers, often small alcohols, are added to carbon dioxide based mobile phase in order to increase the solubility of polar compounds. In this study the adsorption of methanol to two different stationary phases; Kromasil-Diol and chiral Lux Cellulose- 4 were studied. Adsorption is a phenomenon where surface interactions crate a higher density of molecules at the surface than in the bulk. The aim of this work has been to study the adsorption of modifier (methanol) to the stationary phase both to determine the extent of adsorption and the kinetics for system equilibration. These findings were then put into perspective of normal use of SFC for separation of molecules. There are a number of techniques for measuring adsorption; in this study the tracer pulse method is used. This is a pulse method where a <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> is created and an isotope labelled molecule is injected. This was performed in the mobile phase composition from pure carbon dioxide to pure methanol. In addition to the tracer pulse experiments the isotope effect, the eluent flow, equilibration times for the column and retention times for a set of analytes were measured. For the Diol column no large isotope effect was observed, the method was also proved to be highly reproducible since several runs gave consistent results. Calculations based on the experimental data showed that a 6. 3 Å thick layer was built up at a methanol fraction of 13 % (v/v), corresponding to a monolayer. Changes of the methanol fraction below the saturation level has has greater effect on the retention factor for the analytes than at higher methanol fractions, when the monolayer was saturated. The conclusion of this is that SFC is more stable in the area where the layer has been built up. A preliminary study has been made for the chiral Lux Cellulose- 4 column which was not as conclusive as for the Kromasil-Diol column. This type of column needs further studies to confirm the deviating observations and to investigate the cause for these...|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{knowledge}} about the yolk precursor, vitellogenin (Vtg) and the process of vitellogenesis in female greenback flounder (Rhombosolea tapirina), including purification and characterization of Vtg; development of a specific Vtg assay; induction of Vtg by l 7 P-estradiol (E 2) in vivo and in vitro; relationship between endocrine regulation of vitellogenesis and oocyte growth in mature females; and the possible role of Vtg feedback on ovarian steroid production. Vtg purified from the plasma ofE 2 -treated male animals by gel filtration chromatography had an estimated molecular weight (MW) of 540 kD, and resolved into three bands with estimated MW of 152, 102, 80 kD after SDSp AGE. Western blotting demonstrated that the Vtg consisted of one subunit (152 kD). A polyclonal antibody against the 152 kD band developed from sheep, was used to establish-an indirect antibody-capture competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The validation of the ELISA was confirmed by the parallelism between the standard Vtg curve and serial dilutions of plasma from vitellogenic females, but no cross-reaction was found with the plasma of males, or plasma from a range of other species. In Ez-treated fish, detectable concentrations of plasma Vtg were first found at 48 h, and reached a peak at 96 h post-injection, and increased as the E 2 dose increased, with a threshold of 0. 1 mg E 2 Kg body weight - 1. Multiple injections of E 2 increased the absolute concentrations of Vtg and extended the peak Vtg up to 288 h, but did not change the threshold dose. The time-course and dose response for induction of Vtg by E 2 in the flounder was similar to that seen in other species, however, plasma concentrations of Vtg were generally lower than those found in other teleosts. Oocyte size-frequency distributions from mature females showed that this species has multiple clutch group synchronous type of oocyte development. But that reproductive development is not synchronized within the population. Consistent with this observation, there were no significant seasonal variations in gonadosomatic index (IG), hepatosomatic index (IH), or plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and testosterone (T). Significant increases in IG, IH and plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and T were observed in vitellogenic fish, and in fish undergoing final maturation. Plasma concentrations of Vtg and E 2 rose steadily across oocyte sizes from 100 to 450 μm, and both reached a <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> at oocyte sizes of around 450 μm.

Isolated vitellogenic follicles were incubated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) and gonadal steroid precursors T, 17 - hydroxyprogesterone (17 P) and androstenedione (A) in the presence or absence of Vtg. High concentrations ofVtg suppressed the production of E 2 and T, and the effect appeared to operate at several levels along the steroidogenic pathways. These observations combined with findings of other studies indicate that Vtg might regulate its own production by modulating ovarian steroid synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with the contamination of groundwater environments by non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) such as chlorinated solvents, gasoline and manufacturing gas plant (MGP) residuals, including their distribution and persistence, are well accepted. The treatment of groundwater by in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) relies on the oxidation potential of chemical reagents to destroy harmful organic compounds. The interaction of these oxidants with target and non-target compounds in the subsurface will help determine effectiveness and efficiency of an ISCO treatment system. Push-pull tests (PPTs) have the utility to estimate key properties in situ and allow for sampling a larger volume of aquifer to yield more representative estimates as compared to conventional bench-scale tests. The scale and cost-effectiveness of a PPT make it an ideal tool to collect valuable information on subsurface system behaviour so that uncertainties can be minimized. The use of PPTs to provide insight into treatment expectations or to support the design of an ISCO system requires a suitable interpretation tool. A multi-species numerical model (‘PPT-ISCO’) in a radial coordinate system was developed to simulate a PPT with the injection of a conservative tracer and oxidant (persulfate or permanganate) into the saturated zone of a porous medium environment. The pore space may contain variable amounts of immobile, multicomponent, residual NAPL. The aquifer material contains a natural organic matter (NOM) fraction and/or other oxidizable aquifer material (OAM) species. The model is capable of simulating mass transport for an arbitrary number of conservative and reactive tracers and NAPL constituents subjected to chemical reactions. The ability of PPTs to capture the in situ natural oxidant interaction (NOI) was tested with PPTISCO. Breakthrough curve (BTC) data collected from permanganate and persulfate PPTs conducted in the field were compared to simulated BTCs by assigning the same field operational parameters to the model and applying NOI kinetic information obtained from batch tests. These tests confirmed the usability of the model and PPTs to obtain the NOI kinetics from PPT BTCs. The sensitivity of PPT BTCs to variations in the field operating and NOI parameters were investigated. The results of varying the field operating parameters indicated that the oxidant BTCs could be scaled to match varying injection and extraction flow rates. Variations in NOI parameters revealed that the permanganate BTC is primarily controlled by the permanganate fast reaction rate coefficient and the quantity of OAM present in the aquifer. The spatial profiles of OAM across the test zone revealed {{that the majority of the}} OAM consumption is from the fast fraction and occurs in the vicinity of the well where the permanganate concentration is greatest. An estimate of the permanganate fast reaction rate coefficient can be obtained from a permanganate PPT BTC by employing the model to simulate the PPT with the operational parameters (used in the field) and literature estimates of the remaining NOI parameters. Calibration between the simulated and observed BTCs can be undertaken to adjust the permanganate fast reaction rate coefficient to fit the permanganate PPT BTC. Persulfate NOI sensitivity investigations revealed that persulfate PPT BTCs can be characterized by a <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau</b> at early times as a result of the increased ionic strength in the area around the injection well. The ionic strength is primarily controlled by the injected persulfate concentration, and as persulfate degrades into sulphate and acid, the ionic strength is enhanced. Graphical analysis of the BTC revealed that an underestimated value of the persulfate degradation rate coefficient can be obtained from the PPT BTC. A more representative estimate of the persulfate degradation rate coefficient can be achieved after fitting the field BTC to the simulated results, applying the underestimated value as a starting point. PPTs investigating ISCO treatability have the ability to provide insight into the effect of the NOI on the oxidation of target compounds, site-specific oxidant dosage requirements and NAPL treatment expectations. NAPL component BTCs from treatability PPTs are primarily controlled by the mass in the fast region, and the fast region mass transfer rate coefficient. Oxidation estimates extracted from NAPL component BTCs were shown to accurately approximate the mass of each NAPL component oxidized when compared to model calculations. The mass of NAPL oxidized for each of the components yields a site-specific oxidant dosage. This estimate exceeds what is prescribed by the stoichiometry between permanganate and the contaminant of concern due to the effect of the NOI. The utility of PPTs to study and quantify the interaction between injected oxidants and the aquifer material has been demonstrated with PPT-ISCO. In addition, PPT-ISCO has revealed that treatability PPTs can be tailored to investigate the dosage requirements and treatment expectations of residual NAPLs. Results from this effort will be used to support ongoing field research exploring the use of PPTs to assist in understanding the competing subsurface processes affecting ISCO applications...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear waste {{repositories}} {{are being}} installed in deep excavated rock formations {{in some places}} in Europe to isolate and store radioactive waste. In France, the Callovo-Oxfordian formation (COx) is a potential candidate for a nuclear waste repository. After {{the closure of the}} underground nuclear waste repository, aqueous corrosion of the steel canister and, to a lesser extent, radiolysis of water would produce significant amounts of H 2. This H 2 can interact with materials from the repository and with the surrounding clay host formation. The COx formation contains pyrite (FeS 2), which has been demonstrated to react with Hydrogen gas (H 2) (Truche et al. 2010) at temperature ranging from 90 °C to 180 °C. This work aims at understanding these interactions within the range of temperature prevailing into COx using electrochemical techniques and the analysis of solutions and interfaces. After pyrite electrodes had been assembled, various electrochemical disturbances were applied to this material (and to platinum for comparison) while it was submerged in a partially reconstituted solution of COx pore water, enclosed in a High Pressure Thermo-Reactor (HPTR) at 90 °C (present work; Betelu et al., 2012), or in a Low Pressure Thermo-Reactor at 25 °C (see poster session; Ignatiadis et al., 2012), in the absence and in the presence of pyrite grains (particle size between 40 and 63 µm) and H 2 (0 partial pressure or 1 bar). In addition to the electrochemical behaviour of the platinum and the pyrite, the pH, temperature and pressure of the liquid medium were monitored. Analyses of the surface and the inside (cross-section) of pyrite electrodes subjected to the reactivity of H 2 under the various conditions described above enable us to compare the alterations undergone by the pyrite. It is clear that the pyrite reacts with H 2 and that its alteration is indicated by the presence, at the surface of electrodes, of a black scale whose Fe/S ratio is near 1 (FeS), while the ratio within the pyrite is 0. 5 (FeS 2). The growth of this iron sulphide scale in the pyrite dissolution pits, the proximity of the source and the iron sulphide suggests that pyrrhotite easily forms a core and increases more rapidly than the pyrite dissolution. The intensity of the pyrite alteration by H 2 seems to increase with the imposed cathodic potential on the pyrite electrode. Potentiometric measurements demonstrated that EPt and EPy decrease in the presence of H 2 to reach a stable redox potential controlled by the H+/H 2 couple. However, EPt and EPy drop lower, but less rapidly, in the presence of pyrite compared to the case without pyrite grains. Pyrite goes through a period during which EPy is greater than EPt. This period corresponds to the (alkaline dissolution, then) reduction of pyrite by H 2, but without the pyrite's being entirely covered by pyrrhotite. EPt and EPy are identical at this time. The corrosion currents are strong on pyrite in the presence of H 2 and increase with the imposed cathodic potentials. They are much stronger than those measured without pyrite grains. The initial reduction reaction rate is rapid due to the high reactivity of pyrite surface, hence the rapid increase in the sulphide content in the bulk solution, which seems to hinder the progress of the reaction up to a rapidly reached sulphide <b>concentration</b> <b>plateau.</b> Pyrite dissolution and pyrrhotite precipitation are coupled reactions. The fluid composition remains fairly steady when pyrite dissolution balances pyrrhotite precipitation, the iron content remaining very low in the solution. The simulation of the data acquired throughout Electrochemical Impedance Spectrometry enabled to determine an equivalent electrical circuit (EEC). The EEC parameters modelled at different moments and under different conditions made it possible to follow the phenomena occurring on the electrolyte/pyrite interface. In general, Rt is much higher on pyrite in the presence of grains than without grains. The impedance curves measured on pyrite with grains have a different shape than those without grains: appearance of a loop at high frequencies followed by a diffusion segment towards low frequencies. The impedance curves for imposed cathodic potentials (that normally accelerate the reduction processes at the pyrite electrode), compared to those done at the corrosion potential (Ec), have shapes that progressively slant towards the Zreal-axis, with progressive loss of the diffusion segment chronologically as follows: - Rt, high without H 2, decreases progressively in its presence (this means that the charge transfer of the reduction reaction progressively impeded by its consequences); - the diffusion processes (G parameters) accelerate from the electrode to the solution (this means that produced S 2 - progressively diffuses to the bulk solution); - the diffusion processes are hindered (Rc and C parameters) by increasingly thick FeS scale that covers the pyrite surface. Under these conditions, three steps seem to control the kinetics of the pyrite reduction reaction: - The diffusion of H 2 and H 2 S(aq) between the reaction front and the reaction medium through the porous microstructures of the pyrrhotite - The pyrite dissolution reaction at the surface - The pyrrhotite precipitation reaction at the surface The future exploitation of this electrochemical database will make it possible to determine the kinetics of FeS 2 reduction by H 2 in a HPTR. The prospects for this work are, therefore, the exploitation of these data and their extrapolation to storage conditions. The apparent consequences of FeS 2 -H 2 interaction into an actual repository cannot yet be discussed, particularly the impact of HS-/S 2 - freed in solution. Further investigations should be realized, notably at lower temperature and in the presence of COx, {{in order to determine the}} reactivity and competitivity of other sources of sulphur...|$|E

The inclusion of suspended polymers imparts elasticity to fluids, allowing instabilities to be excited when substantial polymer stretching occurs. For high molecular weight polymer chains we find that flow velocities achievable by standard electro-osmotic pumping are sufficient to excite extensional instabilities in dilute polymer solutions. We observe a dependence in measured fluctuations on polymer <b>concentration</b> which <b>plateaus</b> at a threshold corresponding to the onset of significant molecular crowding in macromolecular solutions; plateauing occurs well below the overlap concentration.

Each dog, under light Nembutal anesthesia, received two stepwise primed constant infusions of cortisol (i. v.), each lasting 90 minutes. 23 venous blood samples were withdrawn for determination of plasma ACTH concentrations by adrenal cell suspension bioassay and 25 samples for plasma cortisol determination, at various times before, {{during and after the}} cortisol infusions. ACTH secretion rates were calculated using previously determined ACTH clearance and distribution volume characteristics. As a mean of 6 animals, the cortisol <b>concentration</b> <b>plateaux,</b> which averaged 4. 59 +/- 0. 57 and 6. 49 +/- 0. 92 mug/ 100 ml., caused suppression of ACTH secretion (expressed as percentage of pre-period secretion rates) from 0 % before cortisol to 65. 05 % suppression during plateau # 1 and to 95. 3 % suppression during plateau # 2. 70 minutes after the cessation of cortisol infusion the plasma cortisol had fallen to 1. 95 +/- 0. 43 mug/ 100 ml. with an associated 69. 6 % suppression of ACTH secretion rate. The suppression, associated with the two infusion periods and the delay associated with the recovery in the post-infusion period, suggests a delayed feedback of the order of 1 hour. The infused cortisol resulted in low physiological plasma levels of cortisol which had the following characteristics in these adrenalectomized dogs: metabolic clearance rates of 12. 8 and 17. 4 ml/kg. min associated, respectively, with mean plasma cortisol concentrations of 4. 27 and 6. 23 mug/ 100 ml.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) (7 - 36) amide is an {{intestinal}} incretin hormone {{which also}} inhibits gastric acid secretion in humans. Its {{mechanism of action}} is unclear, but it strongly inhibits vagally induced secretion (sham feeding), suggesting that it could influence vagal activity. AIM/METHODS: The effect of intravenous GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) (1 pmol/kg/min) was studied on pentagastrin induced acid secretion in otherwise healthy subjects, previously vagotomised for duodenal ulcer (n = 8) and {{in a group of}} young (n = 8) and old (n = 6) healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Pentagastrin increased acid secretion significantly in all three groups, but the <b>plateau</b> <b>concentration</b> in the vagotomised subjects was lower than in controls. Infusion of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) significantly inhibited acid secretion in the control groups (to 67 (SEM 6) and 74 (SEM 3) % of <b>plateau</b> <b>concentrations</b> in young and old controls, respectively) but had no effect in the vagotomised subjects. Differences in plasma concentrations of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide), recovery of gastric marker, duodenal regurgitation, or Helicobacter pylori status could not explain the lack of effect. Blood glucose was lowered equally by GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) in all subjects.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to analyse the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in vitro as a function of various exposure times (up to 120 h), keeping constant the parameter C × T (product of the drug concentration per time). Intracellular drug concentrations were measured in parallel following analysis of cisplatin influx and efflux characteristics. A head and neck cancer cell line was selected to represent the spectrum of cisplatin antitumour activity. The IC 50 values (μg/ml) for 1, 2, 11 and 121 h were, respectively 4. 51, 2. 73, 0. 27 and 0. 151. Reduction of the IC 50 was clearly not linearly related to prolongation of the cisplatin exposure time. The kinetics of cisplatin incorporation into CAL 27 cells was investigated as a function of different cisplatin <b>concentrations.</b> A <b>plateau</b> was reached after 16 h of contact. For the extracellular cisplatin concentrations of 1, 2. 5, 5 and 10 μg/ml, the average intracellular Pt <b>concentrations</b> at the <b>plateau</b> were, respectively (ng/ 106 cells) : [mean (S. D.) ] 12. 8 (0. 98), 31. 11 (5. 12), 71. 38 (6. 03) and 136. 7 (16. 5). Intracellular Pt concentrations were linearly related to the extracellular drug concentration (r = 0. 99). The drug left the cells following a two-slope kinetics pattern with an α half-life of 1. 29 h and a β half-life of 94. 4 h. The cytotoxic effect for a given C × T clearly differed for the different cisplatin exposure times. The longest exposure time (121 h) gave the least pronounced cytotoxicity. The intracellular Pt concentrations were linearly related to the C × T values. Cisplatin levels were much lower after the 121 h exposure. These data may prove valuable in establishing a rationale which can aid in selection of optimal modes of clinical cisplatin administration. © 1992. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tracer {{experiments}} are valuable tools for analyzing the transport characteristics of streams and {{their interactions with}} shallow groundwater. The focus of this work is the design of tracer studies in high-gradient stream systems subject to advection, dispersion, groundwater inflow, and exchange between the active channel and zones in surface or subsurface water where flow is stagnant or slow moving. We present a methodology for (1) evaluating and comparing alternative stream tracer experiment designs and (2) identifying those combinations of stream transport properties that pose limitations to parameter estimation and therefore a challenge to tracer test design. The methodology uses the concept of global parameter uncertainty analysis, which couples solute transport simulation with parameter uncertainty analysis in a Monte Carlo framework. Two general conclusions resulted from this work. First, the solute injection and sampling strategy has an important effect on the reliability of transport parameter estimates. We found that constant injection with sampling through <b>concentration</b> rise, <b>plateau,</b> and fall provided considerably more reliable parameter estimates than a pulse injection across the spectrum of transport scenarios likely encountered in high-gradient streams.

40|$|The {{accommodation}} of chain-length mismatch in liquid crystal phase bilayers was examined by using deuterium {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} to obtain smoothed orientational order parameter profiles for acyl chains of both components in binary lipid mixture bilayers. Mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) covering a range of compositions were prepared with either DSPC acyl chains or DMPC acyl chains perdeuterated. Orientational order parameters in the plateau regions of the smoothed profiles for both components were found to increase smoothly with increasing DSPC concentration. The orientational order parameters in the DSPC-smoothed profile {{were found to be}} slightly higher than corresponding values for DMPC over a wide range of bilayer composition. The shapes of the smoothed profiles for both components were found to be sensitive to bilayer composition. At low DSPC concentration, DSPC methylene deuterons near the bilayer center display a secondary plateau at low orientational order. At high DSPC <b>concentration,</b> the <b>plateau</b> of the DMPC-smoothed profile is stretched slightly.
