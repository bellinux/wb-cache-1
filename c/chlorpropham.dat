50|$|Two recent {{approaches}} for coupling capillary scale liquid chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (LC-EI-MS) {{can be incorporated}} {{for the analysis of}} various samples. These are capillary-scale EI-based LC/MS interface and direct-EI interface. In the capillary EI the nebulizer has been optimized for linearity and sensitivity. The direct-EI interface is a miniaturized interface for nano- and micro-HPLC in which the interfacing process takes place in a suitably modified ion source. Superior sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility can be obtained because the elution from the column is completely transferred into the ion source. Using these two interfaces electron ionization can be successfully incorporated for the analysis of small and medium-sized molecules with various polarities. The most common applications for these interfaces in LC-MS are environmental applications such as gradient separations of the pesticides, carbaryl, propanil, and <b>chlorpropham</b> using a reversed phase, and pharmaceutical applications such as separation of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diphenyldramine, amitryptyline, naproxen, and ibuprofen.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of a study of <b>chlorpropham</b> distribution patterns and its behaviour within tuber components in commercial potato stores in the UK. The store examined were both cold (3 - 4 °C) and conventional (8 - 10 °C) stores. As {{a large number of}} samples from different stores were taken, it was important to have a quick and reliable analytical method for <b>chlorpropham</b> determination. This was developed and compared against the original accepted method. Both methods were more or less similar in their precision of results, with recoveries of 83. 80 2. 25 and 93. 14 3. 51 from spiked samples by blending and reflux extracting methods respectively. When the methods were compared for extracting the amount of <b>chlorpropham</b> in commercially treated stored samples, it gave recoveries of 2. 49 0. 25 and 2. 58 0. 17 for the blending and reflux methods respectively. Overall the reflux extracting method was quicker and easier and it was used for further work with some slight modification. The present study showed that the level and distribution pattern of <b>chlorpropham</b> was significantly different within the store and as well as between different commercial stores. The overall range of <b>chlorpropham</b> levels in the examined stores was 2. 11 - 236. 56 mg/kg. The amount of <b>chlorpropham</b> varied with respect to sampling sites of the examined stores. Each store has its own distribution pattern with some similarities.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Addition of the {{methylcarbamate}} compounds p-chlorophenyl N-methylcarbamate (PPG- 124) and 1 -naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (carbaryl) {{to various}} herbicides {{has resulted in}} reduced rates of degradation. Carbaryl affects the degradation of certain herbicides in both plants and soils while PPG- 124 has only been demonstrated to affect degradation in soils. Both these materials are effective in increasing the persistence of isopropyl m-chlorocarbanilate (<b>chlorpropham)</b> in the soil. No work has been published on the possible effect of these compounds on the response of plants to <b>chlorpropham</b> or other carbahilate herbicides. Studies were conducted in a growth-chamber to investigate the effect of PPG- 124 and carbaryl on the response of two test species to <b>chlorpropham.</b> One species, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), was chosen for its resistance to chlorpropham; the other, common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) for its susceptibility. Plants were grown in Hoagland's solution to which the various treatments were added. This approach was used to avoid any soil effects such as differential adsorption and degradation of the <b>chlorpropham.</b> Four experiments were carried out with safflower and two with buckwheat. Varying doses and exposure periods to the chemicals were included but all experiments were of the same duration. The effects of mixtures of <b>chlorpropham</b> with PPG- 124 or carbaryl were {{compared with those of}} individual treatments of the three compounds applied at the same time.

In contrast, a slight synergistic effect at certain concentrations was noted when buckwheat was used as the test species. An explanation of these effects would require uptake and metabolism studies with labeled materials.

40|$|In this study, a {{comparison}} of two carbamic pesticides, <b>chlorpropham</b> and phenisopham, {{was carried out in}} terms of both photodegradability and ecotoxicity. The photochemical behaviour of the two pesticides was investigated under environmental-like conditions (aqueous media, UVB or solar irradiation). The photochemical kinetic parameters were calculated by irradiating 5 105 M solutions (H 2 O–CH 3 CN, 9 : 1 v/v) using UVB lamps. For <b>chlorpropham</b> and phenisopham similar half-life times (39. 0 and 55. 0 min) were determined. Irradiation by sunlight leads to longer degradation half-life times (about 3 months), while it is possible to observe the formation of the same photoproducts. The well-known dechlorination reaction to a hydroxyphenylcarbamate was observed for <b>chlorpropham.</b> Phenisopham undergoes photo-Fries reaction to give rearranged products (hydroxybenzamides) and fragmentation products (hydroxyphenylcarbamate and N-ethylaniline). Acute and chronic toxicity tests of pesticides and their photoproducts were performed on organisms from two levels of the freshwater aquatic chain, the anostraca crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The acute results showed that <b>chlorpropham</b> had median lethal concentrations for the crustacean T. platyurus and the rotifer B. calyciflorus of 10. 16 and 35. 19 mg L 1, respectively, and phenisopham did not show any acute toxicity as the derivatives up to 10 mg L 1.

Chewings fescue {{was found to be}} very susceptible to <b>chlorpropham</b> treatment and the use of this herbicide for weed control in Chewings fescue caused seed yield reduction. Time of <b>chlorpropham</b> application in relation to environmental factors of temperature and photoperiod was more important than the actual toxicity of the herbicide. <b>Chlorpropham</b> used at the recommended rate of 2 lbs/A was lethal to all tillers that were exposed to the herbicide irrespective of time of application. Seed production from treated plants depended on development of new tillers from axillary buds and on prevalence of environmental conditions conducive to induction and initiation.

Apical meristems of the shoot were little affected during the initial stages of injury to the shoots and remained intact even after necrosis of surrounding tissues. When plants were grown at low and high temperature levels and treated with varying herbicide concentrations, tiller production proved to be a more sensitive measure of herbicide-temperature effects than dry matter production. High temperatures favored tiller production and enhanced herbicide toxicity. Time of induction and initiation under natural conditions were determined.

40|$|Work {{described}} in this thesis was designed to address a number of environmental issues relating {{to the use of}} <b>chlorpropham</b> (CIPC) as a sprout suppressant in potato stores. Studies considered the behaviour of CIPC during the application process and storage and also the potential for it to be released into the environment. All commercial studies were carried out in box stores, rather than bulk stores. A survey of potato growers was carried out to provide up-to-date industry information on store management practice and {{to determine the extent of}} <b>chlorpropham</b> use in the UK. Results confirmed that the vast majority of crop held in the UK for both pre-packing and processing is treated with <b>chlorpropham.</b> In most cases, several applications are necessary to maintain sprout control throughout the season, which highlights the inefficiency of the application process. Thermal fog application (the industry standard) is known to be inefficient, and to result in uneven distribution of <b>chlorpropham</b> around the store. This can lead to unacceptably high chemical residues in crop at certain locations, and poor sprout control in places that do not receive the correct dose. The imminent introduction of a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for <b>chlorpropham</b> means that store managers must be able to predict with confidence the amount of chemical reaching each tuber. Analysis of crop from commercial stores found chemical levels ranging from 0 - 50 mg kg- 1 following conventional application. Washing significantly reduced these very high levels in most cases. Improvements in chemical distribution (and a lowering of the highest chemical levels) were seen when the movement of air and fog around the store were manipulated using fans or by restricting air flow using polythene sheeting. A method for the collection and analysis of air samples was developed and used to quantify CIPC in samples of air from treated stores. Vapour concentrations were found to be of the order of mg l- 1 (parts per billion), and to increase linearly with air temperature. 3 -chloroaniline (a metabolite of CIPC) was also identified in the air samples, suggesting significant breakdown of the CIPC molecule may occur during chemical application or storage. The mechanism of breakdown was not identified. Contaminated fabrics within the store are believed to provide a reservoir of chemical that can readily volatilise and be found in the vapour phase. The presence of <b>chlorpropham</b> in the air has implications for crop contamination and the extent of chemical loss from the store. Samples of effluent from potato washing plants were collected and analysed on several occasions. The CIPC concentration to liquid effluent (after removal of all suspended material) was found to range from several mg/l (parts per million) in untreated samples to < 0. 01 mg l- 1 following filtration and digestion.

40|$|The benzamide, RH- 4032, {{was found}} to be a potent antimicrotubule agent in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells. It {{strongly}} inhibited root growth and produced swollen club-shaped roots, an accumulation of cells in arrested metaphase, and loss of microtubules. RH- 4032 inhibited the in vitro assembly of bovine tubulin into microtubules, with inhibition requiring a relatively long incubation period. Treatment of tobacco suspension-cultured cells or isolated bovine tubulin with [14 C]RH- 4032, and analysis of radiolabeled protein revealed a highly specific covalent attachment to β-tubulin. Binding of [3 H]RH- 4032 in tobacco suspension-cultured cells was shown to be saturable and to be influenced by pre-incubation of the cells with various antimicrotubule agents: Binding of [3 H]RH- 4032 was inhibited by the benzamides, pronamide and zarilamide, the N-phenylcarbamate, <b>chlorpropham,</b> and the microtubule-stabilizing drug, paclitaxel, whereas trifluralin and amiprophosmethyl were not inhibitory. A common characteristic of agents that cause microtubule disassembly was a slight enhancement of [3 H]RH- 4032 binding at low concentrations, which did not occur with the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel. For structural analogs of RH- 4032 and various N-phenylcarbamates, it was shown that the ability to inhibit binding of [3 H]RH- 4032 was correlated with the ability to inhibit tobacco root elongation.

We {{have found that}} the cps 1 - 12 mutation also confers (i) hypersensitivity to the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), (ii) hypersensitivity to the drag papulacandin B, which specifically inhibits 1, 3 -Î²-D-glucan synthesis both in vivo and in vitro, and (iii) thermosensitive growth at 37 Â°C. Under any of these restrictive treatments, cells swell up and finally lyse. With an osmotic stabilizer, cells do not lyse, but at 37 Â°C they become multiseptated and multibranched. The cps 1 - 12 mutant, grown at n restrictive temperature, showed an increase in sensitivity to lysis by enzymatic cell wall degradation, in in vitro 1, 3 -Î²- D-glucan synthase activity (173 % in the absence of GTP in the reaction), and in cell wall biosynthesis (130 % of the wild-type amount). Addition of Ca 2 + suppresses hypersensitivity to papulacandin B and septation and branching phenotypes. All of these data suggest a relationship between the eps 1 + gene and cell wall synthesis. A DNA fragment containing the cps 1 + gene was cloned, and sequence analysis indicated that it encodes a predicted membrane protein of 1, 729 amino acids with 15 to 16 transmembrane domains. S. pombe cps 1 p has overall 55 % sequence identity with Fks 1 p or Fks 2 p, proposed to be catalytic or associated subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1, 3 -Î²-D-glucan synthase. Thus, the cps 1 + product might be a catalytic or an associated copurifying subunit of the fission yeast 1, 3 -Î²-D-glucan synthase that plays an essential role in cell wall synthesis. Work by A. D. and J. C. R. was supported by grant BIO 95 - 0500 from the Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología, Spain, and by a contract with Lilly S. A., Madrid, Spain. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlorpropham,</b> {{also known}} as isopropyl-N-(3 -chlorophenyl) {{carbamate}} or CIPC is a sprout suppressant and plant growth regulator of the chemical class derived from carbamic acid (NH 2 COOH). The substance was first developed as a pre-emergence herbicide, and it was quickly identified as a useful potato sprout suppressant for long-term tuber storage (Marth & Schultz 1952). Today CIPC is the major sprout inhibitor used in the potato industry (UK Potato Council 2013 c). As a consequence there is environmental concern about CIPC reaching the aquatic environment from potato washing plants. An RP-HPLC method {{for the analysis of}} CIPC and IPC in methanol solvent with an automatic integration method was developed and validated. The correlation coefficients for CIPC and IPC regression lines at all calibration levels (0. 001 – 100 mg/L) were (R 2 > 0. 999) while IPC exhibited a slightly less linear calibration curve (R 2 > 0. 98) at the lowest concentration range of (0. 001 – 0. 1 mg/L). An acceptable precision of 10...|$|E
40|$|Natural peat {{was tested}} for {{solid-phase}} extraction of acephate, <b>chlorpropham,</b> pirimicarb, bifenthrin, tetradifon and phosalone from the medicinal plant Cordia salicifolia, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with {{selected ion monitoring}} (GC/MS, SIM). Considering {{that there are no}} Brazilian regulations concerning maximum permissible pesticide residue concentrations in medicinal herbs, recovery experiments were carried out (three replicates) at two arbitrary fortification levels (0. 5 and 1. 0 mg kg- 1), resulting in recoveries ranging from 64 % to 118 % and relative standard deviations between 5. 6 % and 26. 4 % for peat sorbent. Detection and quantification limits for herb ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 15 mg kg- 1 and from 0. 15 to 0. 25 mg kg- 1, respectively, for the different pesticides studied. The developed method was linear over the range assayed, 0. 1 - 5. 0 &# 956;g g- 1, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 9975 to 0. 9986 for all pesticides. Comparison between natural peat and conventional sorbent (neutral alumina) showed similar performance of peat for the six pesticides tested...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in flower bulb {{cultivation}} is weed control. Synthetic herbicides are mainly used, although they cause a range of problems, and integrated weed control through application of naturally occurring allelochemicals would be highly desirable. Flower bulb production creates large amounts of leftover biomass. Utilizing this source for weed control may provide new applications of the bulb crops. We therefore screened 33 flower bulb extracts for allelochemical activity against weeds. Several methanol and chloroform extracts were observed to inhibit germination and growth of Senecio vulgaris L. and Lolium perenne L., as representatives of di- and mono-cotyledonous weeds, respectively. Narciclasine was identified as the bioactive compound in Narcissus. The extract of Amaryllis belladonna L. was equally active, but did not contain any narciclasine. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the A. belladonna extract resulted {{in the identification of}} lycorine as the bio-active compound. The IC 50 measured for radicle growth inhibition was 0. 10 µM for narciclasine and 0. 93 µM for lycorine, compared to 0. 11 mM of <b>chlorpropham,</b> a synthetic herbicide. Therefore, the leftover biomass from the spring bulb industry represents an interesting potential source for promising allelochemicals for further studies on weed growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Potatoes {{represent}} an important staple food crop across the planet. Yet, to maintain tuber quality and extend availability, {{there is a}} necessity to store tubers for long periods often using industrial-scale facilities. In this context, preserving potato quality is pivotal for the seed, fresh and processing sectors. The industry has always innovated and invested in improved post-harvest storage. However, the pace of technological change has {{and will continue to}} increase. For instance, more stringent legislation and changing consumer attitudes have driven renewed interest in creating alternative or complementary post-harvest treatments to traditional chemically reliant sprout suppression and disease control. Herein, the current knowledge on biochemical factors governing dormancy, the use of <b>chlorpropham</b> (CIPC) as well as existing and chemical alternatives, and the effects of pre- and post-harvest factors to assure potato tuber quality is reviewed. Additionally, the role of genomics as a future approach to potato quality improvement is discussed. Critically, and through a more industry targeted research, a better mechanistic understanding of how the pre-harvest environment influences tuber quality and the factors which govern dormancy transition should lead to a paradigm shift in how sustainable storage can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} multiresidue {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of seven pesticides in fresh vegetable samples, namely, courgette (Cucurbita pepo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Romaine and Iceberg varieties) and peppers (Capsicum sp.) is described. The procedure, based on microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and analysis by liquid chromatography– photodiode array (LC–PDA) detection {{was applied to}} four carbamates (carbofuran, carbaryl, <b>chlorpropham</b> and EPTC) and three urea pesticides (monolinuron, metobromuron and linuron). Extraction solvent {{and the addition of}} anhydrous sodium sulphate to fresh vegetable homogenate before MAE were the parameters optimised for each commodity. Recovery studies were performed using spiked samples in the range 250 – 403 µgkg- 1 in each pesticide. The pesticide residues were extracted using 20 mL acetonitrile at 60 ºC, for 10 min. Acceptable recoveries and RSDs were attained (overall average recovery of 77. 2 % and RSDs are lower than 11 %). Detection limits ranged between 5. 8 µgkg- 1 for carbaryl to 12. 3 µgkg- 1 for carbofuran. The analytical protocol was applied for quality control of 41 fresh vegetable samples bought in Oporto Metropolitan Area (North Portugal). None of the samples contained any detectable amounts of the studied compounds...|$|E
