5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Each princess {{relates to}} the shah a story {{matching}} the mood of her respective color. [...] These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy {{about half of the}} whole poem. [...] While the shah is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm. Bahram discovers that the affairs of Iran are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade. [...] He <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> mind first by going hunting. [...] After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree. [...] The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors. [...] He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. [...] The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to fire temples for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears. [...] As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (gūr) he instead finds his tomb (gūr).|$|E
2500|$|Twelve {{years later}} in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius sees {{a picture of the}} Weasley family on the front cover of the Daily Prophet taken from the then Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, in which a rat stands perched on Ron's shoulder. The rat is Ron's pet, Scabbers, and Sirius {{recognises}} Pettigrew in his Animagus form, seeing a toe was missing. This knowledge <b>clears</b> <b>his</b> mind and enables him to escape Azkaban. He accomplishes this feat by transforming into his Animagus dog form. His severe weight loss from malnutrition and the Dementors' lack of ability to differentiate between unsophisticated canine emotions and insanity allows him to slip through his cell bars. After his escape, Sirius takes refuge in and around Hogsmeade. Knowing that the Dementors are stationed around Hogsmeade and at Hogwarts, Sirius remains in his Animagus form during this time, and is able to enter the Hogwarts grounds without being detected by the Dementors. He makes several unsuccessful attempts to kill Pettigrew, until his presence is detected by the students and teachers of Hogwarts when he tries to enter Gryffindor Tower, and the school's security is increased. Towards the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron, and Hermione confront Sirius, and Harry attempts to kill him. Lupin, however, who has learned that Sirius is innocent after seeing Pettigrew's name on the Marauder's Map, prevents Harry from doing so. [...] Scabbers is unmasked as Pettigrew, and Harry begins to view Sirius as a surrogate father, with Sirius even offering to let Harry live with him. Events swiftly turn against him again – Pettigrew escapes and Sirius is captured by the Dementors at Hogwarts and sentenced to the [...] "Dementor's Kiss". Harry and Hermione help him escape with Buckbeak, a hippogriff who had also been unjustly condemned.|$|E
