25|$|Early radio {{telegraphy}} used {{spark gap}} and arc transmitters {{as well as}} high-frequency alternators running at radio frequencies. The <b>coherer</b> was the first means of detecting a radio signal. These, however, lacked the sensitivity to detect weak signals.|$|E
25|$|Marconi, then {{twenty years}} old, began to conduct {{experiments}} in radio waves, building {{much of his}} own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of Sasso Marconi), Italy {{with the help of}} his butler Mignani. He built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a <b>coherer,</b> an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Edouard Branly and used in Lodge's experiments, that changed resistance when exposed to radio waves. In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a <b>coherer,</b> and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.|$|E

5000|$|Coherence of {{particles}} by radio waves is an obscure phenomenon {{that is not}} well understood even today. Recent experiments with particle <b>coherers</b> seem to have confirmed {{the hypothesis that the}} particles cohere by a micro-weld phenomenon caused by radio frequency electricity flowing across the small contact area between particles. [...] The underlying principle of so-called [...] "imperfect contact" [...] <b>coherers</b> is also not well understood, but may involve a kind of tunneling of charge carriers across an imperfect junction between conductors.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1886, German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895, Alexander Popov, a physics {{instructor at the}} Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a <b>coherer</b> tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by {{the passage of a}} third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>coherer's</b> poor {{performance}} motivated {{a great deal}} of research to find better radio wave detectors, and many were invented. Some strange devices were tried; researchers experimented with using frog legs and even a human brain from a cadaver as detectors.|$|R
5000|$|Hughes' {{discovery}} that his devices, {{based on a}} loose contact between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks {{as well as the}} metallic granules in a microphone that exhibited unusual properties in the presence of sparks generated in a nearby apparatus, may have anticipated later devices known as <b>coherers.</b> The carbon rod and two carbon blocks, which he would refer to as a [...] "coherer" [...] in 1899 is also similar to devices known as crystal radio detectors.|$|R
50|$|Demodulation {{was first}} used in radio receivers. In the {{wireless}} telegraphy radio systems used during the first 3 decades of radio (1884-1914) the transmitter did not communicate audio (sound) but transmitted information {{in the form of}} pulses of radio waves that represented text messages in Morse code. Therefore, the receiver merely had to detect {{the presence or absence of}} the radio signal, and produce a click sound. The device that did this was called a detector. The first detectors were <b>coherers,</b> simple devices that acted as a switch. The term detector stuck, was used for other types of demodulators and continues to be used to the present day for a demodulator in a radio receiver.|$|R
2500|$|Bose's first {{scientific}} paper, [...] "On polarisation {{of electric}} rays by double-refracting crystals" [...] was {{communicated to the}} Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, {{within a year of}} Lodge's paper. His second paper was communicated to the Royal Society of London by Lord Rayleigh in October 1895. In December 1895, the London journalElectrician (Vol. 36) published Bose's paper, [...] "On a new electro-polariscope". At that time, the word <b>coherer,</b> coined by Lodge, was used in the English-speaking world for Hertzian wave receivers or detectors. The Electrician readily commented on Bose's <b>coherer.</b> (December 1895). The Englishman (18 January 1896) quoted from the Electrician and commented as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bose went to London on {{a lecture}} tour in 1896 and met Italian {{inventor}} Guglielmo Marconi, {{who had been}} developing a radio wave wireless telegraphy system {{for over a year}} and was trying to market it to the British post service. In an interview, Bose expressed his disinterest in commercial telegraphy and suggested others use his research work. In 1899, Bose announced the development of a [...] "iron-mercury-iron <b>coherer</b> with telephone detector" [...] in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 June 1894, at {{a meeting}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a {{memorial}} lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters. Lodge used a detector called a <b>coherer</b> (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "" [...] causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the <b>coherer</b> were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the <b>coherer</b> were broken apart or [...] "decohered" [...] by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi's 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi's later wireless systems, Lodge's lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of detectors including <b>coherers,</b> barretters, and crystal detectors. The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of galena crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a [...] "cat's-whisker detector". They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat's whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1879 the {{experimenter}} and inventor David Edward Hughes working in London {{discovered that a}} bad contact in a Bell telephone he was using in his experiments seemed to be sparking when he worked on a nearby induction balance (an early form of metal detector). He developed an improved detector to pick up this unknown [...] "extra current" [...] based on his new microphone design (similar to later detectors known as <b>coherers</b> or crystal detectors) and developed a way to interrupt his induction balance to produce a series of sparks. By trial and error experiments he eventually found he could pick up these [...] "aerial waves" [...] as he carried his telephone device down the street out {{to a range of}} 500 yd.|$|R
5000|$|While in Colorado, Tesla {{constructed}} {{many smaller}} resonance transformers and conducted further research on concatenated tuned electrical circuits. Tesla also designed various sensitive devices for detecting received electrical energy, including rotating <b>coherers.</b> These used a clockwork mechanism of gears {{driven by a}} coiled spring-drive which rotated a small glass cylinder containing metal filings. These experiments were the final stage after years of work on synchronized tuned electrical circuits. These instruments were constructed to demonstrate how a wireless receiver could be [...] "tuned" [...] {{to respond to a}} specific complex signal while rejecting others. Tesla logged in his diary on January 2, 1900 that a separate resonance transformer tuned to the same high frequency as a larger high-voltage resonance transformer (which acted as a transmitter) received energy from the larger coil, one of many demonstrations of the wireless transmission of electrical energy.|$|R
2500|$|De Forest was {{convinced}} {{there was a}} great future in radiotelegraphic communication (then known as [...] "wireless telegraphy"), but Italian Guglielmo Marconi, who received his first patent in 1896, was already making impressive progress in both Europe and the United States. One drawback to Marconi's approach was his use of a <b>coherer</b> as a receiver, which, while providing for permanent records, was also slow (after each received Morse code dot or dash, it had to be tapped to restore operation), insensitive, and not very reliable. De Forest was determined to devise a better system, including a self-restoring detector that could receive transmissions by ear, thus making it capable of receiving weaker signals and also allowing faster Morse code sending speeds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894, {{the first}} example of {{wirelessly}} controlling at a distance was during a demonstration by the British physicist Oliver Lodge, in which he made use of a Branly's <b>coherer</b> to make a mirror galvanometer move {{a beam of light}} when an electromagnetic wave was artificially generated. This was further refined by radio innovators Guglielmo Marconi and William Preece, at a demonstration that took place on December 12, 1896, at Toynbee Hall in London, in which they made a bell ring by pushing a button in a box that was not connected by any wires. In 1898 Nikola Tesla filed his patent, , named Method of an Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vehicle or Vehicles, which he publicly demonstrated by radio-controlling a boat during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla called his boat a [...] "teleautomaton".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the <b>coherer</b> {{is like a}} steam-valve. Any {{child can}} open a valve and start a steamer's engines, because a turn of the hand lets in the main steam, doesn't it? Now, this home battery here ready to print is the main steam. The <b>coherer</b> is the valve, always ready to be turned on. The Hertzian wave is the child's hand that turns it." ...|$|E
50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, several subtle prerequisites {{are necessary for}} operation. The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as {{the strength of the}} field generated by the radio frequency excitation coil, allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron. Also, the impedance of the tuner that supplies the radio signal must be low to match the low impedance of the excitation coil, requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the telephone earphone must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms. The iron band moves a few millimeters per second. The magnetic detector was much more sensitive than the <b>coherers</b> commonly in use at the time, although not as sensitive as the Fleming valve, which began to replace it around 1912.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{switching}} {{has been}} observed in carefully designed metal-insulator-metal devices built at small geometries. These devices are also commonly known as memristors and consist of specific materials such as transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, perovskites, oxides with valence defects, {{or a combination of}} an inert and an electrochemically active electrode. No simple physical device has been reported to exhibit electrical switching. We have discovered that a simple point-contact or a granular arrangement formed of metal pieces exhibits bipolar switching. These devices, referred to as <b>coherers,</b> were considered as one-way electrical fuses. We have identified the state variable governing the resistance state and can program the device to switch between multiple stable resistance states. Our observations render previously postulated thermal mechanisms for their resistance-change as inadequate. These devices constitute the missing canonical physical implementations for memristor, often referred as the fourth passive element. Apart from the theoretical advance in understanding metallic contacts, the current discovery provides a simple memristor to physicists and engineers for widespread experimentation, hitherto impossible...|$|R

6000|$|And Emil Gluck {{chuckled and}} went his way. He knew. But {{how was the}} world to know? He had {{stumbled}} upon the secret in his old electroplating shop on Telegraph Avenue {{in the city of}} Oakland. It happened, at that time, that a wireless telegraph station was established by the Thurston Power Company close to his shop. In a short time his electroplating vat was put out of order. The vat- wiring had many bad joints, and, on investigation, Gluck discovered minute welds at the joints in the wiring. These, by lowering the resistance, had caused an excessive current to pass through the solution, [...] "boiling" [...] it and spoiling the work. But what had caused the welds? was the question in Gluck's mind. His reasoning was simple. Before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat had worked well. Not until after the establishment of the wireless station had the vat been ruined. Therefore the wireless station had been the cause. But how? He quickly answered the question. If an electric discharge was capable of operating a <b>coherer</b> across three thousand miles of ocean, then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless station four hundred feet away could produce <b>coherer</b> effects on the bad joints in the vat-wiring.|$|E

He had merely smuggled in, in his book boxes, a machine which corresponded with that of the kidnappers, and had substituted its mechanism for that supplied to Mr. Macrae by Gianesi and Giambresi. This he must have arranged on the Saturday night, when Merton saw the kilted appearance of Eachain of the Hairy Arm. A few metallic atoms from the <b>coherer</b> {{on the floor of the}} smoking-room had caught Merton's eye before breakfast on Sunday morning. Now it was Friday morning!

5000|$|In later {{practical}} receivers the decoherer was a clapper {{similar to}} an electric bell, operated by an electromagnet {{powered by the}} <b>coherer</b> current itself. When the radio wave turned on the <b>coherer,</b> the DC current from the battery flowed through the electromagnet, pulling the arm over to give the <b>coherer</b> a tap. This returned the <b>coherer</b> to the nonconductive state, turning off the electromagnet current, and the arm sprang back. If the radio signal was still present, the <b>coherer</b> would immediately turn on again, pulling the clapper over to give it another tap, which would turn it off again. The result was a constant [...] "trembling" [...] of the clapper during the period that the radio signal was on, during the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code signal.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>coherer</b> {{became the}} basis for radio reception, and {{remained}} in widespread use for about ten years, until about 1907. British radio pioneer Oliver Lodge made the <b>coherer</b> into a practical receiver by adding a [...] "decoherer" [...] which tapped the <b>coherer</b> after each reception to dislodge clumped filings, thus restoring the device's sensitivity. It was further developed by Guglielmo Marconi, then replaced about 1907 by crystal detectors.|$|E

Afterward, he worked on his wireless designs. Popov conducted experiments along the lines of Hertz's research. In 1894-95 he built his first radio receiver, an improved version of coherer-based design by Oliver Lodge. In 1895, he built a <b>coherer.</b> Popov constructed a filings <b>coherer,</b> one form of which was used in some surveying experiments by the Russian government. He used early in 1895, the <b>coherer</b> auto-tapping mechanism, and substituted for the galvanometer an ordinary telegraphic relay. He operated this apparatus at a distance by means of a large radiator.

5000|$|The first radio {{receivers}} invented by Marconi, Oliver Lodge and Alexander Popov in 1894-5 used a primitive radio wave detector called a <b>coherer,</b> invented in 1890 by Edouard Branly and improved by Lodge and Marconi. [...] The <b>coherer</b> was a glass tube with metal electrodes at each end, with loose metal powder between the electrodes. [...] It initially {{had a high}} resistance. When a radio frequency voltage {{was applied to the}} electrodes, its resistance dropped and it conducted electricity. In the receiver the <b>coherer</b> was connected directly between the antenna and ground. In addition to the antenna, the <b>coherer</b> was connected in a DC circuit with a battery and relay. When the incoming radio wave reduced the resistance of the <b>coherer,</b> the current from the battery flowed through it, turning on the relay to ring a bell or make a mark on a paper tape in a siphon recorder. In order to restore the <b>coherer</b> to its previous nonconducting state to receive the next pulse of radio waves, it had to be tapped mechanically to disturb the metal particles. [...] This was done by a [...] "decoherer", a clapper which struck the tube, operated by an electromagnet powered by the relay.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Metal filings <b>coherer</b> {{designed}} by Guglielmo Marconi.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} the filings {{continuing}} to cling together and conduct after {{the removal of the}} signal was solved by tapping or shaking the <b>coherer</b> after the arrival of each signal, shaking the filings and raising the resistance of the <b>coherer</b> to the original value. This apparatus was called a decoherer. This process was referred to as 'decohering' the device and was subject to much innovation during the life of the popular use of this component. Tesla, for example, invented a <b>coherer</b> in which the tube rotated continually along its axis.|$|E
50|$|One electrode, A, of the <b>coherer,</b> (C, in {{the left}} diagram) is {{connected}} to the antenna and the other electrode, B, to ground. A series combination of a battery, B1, and a relay, R, is also attached to the two electrodes. When the signal from a spark gap transmitter is received, the filings tend to cling to each other, reducing the resistance of the <b>coherer.</b> When the <b>coherer</b> conducts better, battery B1 supplies enough current through the <b>coherer</b> to activate relay R, which connects battery B2 to the telegraph sounder S, giving an audible click. In some applications, a pair of headphones replaced the telegraph sounder, being much more sensitive to weak signals, or a Morse recorder which recorded the dots and dashes of the signal on paper tape.|$|E
