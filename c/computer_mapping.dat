25|$|With the {{development}} of the mobile computers, the first <b>computer</b> <b>mapping</b> software became feasible, {{at about the same time}} as the popular adoption of the VHS camcorder began a rapid growth phase. Prior to the mid to late 1980s most motion picture equipment consisted of 8 mm film cameras. While the quality of the first VHS consumer cameras was quite poor (and the size somewhat cumbersome) when compared to traditional film formats, the amount of video which could be shot with a minimal amount of resources was much greater than any film format at the time.|$|E
25|$|Gazetteers {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, {{of the information}} presented. World gazetteers usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form gazetteers, often {{used in conjunction with}} <b>computer</b> <b>mapping</b> and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a placeâ€“name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|E

Over the past three decades, much {{progress has been made in}} supplementing planimetric and topographic maps with ground cover details obtained from aerial photographs. The present investigation evaluates the feasibility of using <b>computer</b> <b>maps</b> of ground cover from satellite input tapes. Attention is given to the selection of test sites, a satellite data processing system, a multispectral image analyzer, general purpose computer-generated maps, the preliminary evaluation of <b>computer</b> <b>maps,</b> a test for areal correspondence, the preparation of overlays and acreage estimation of land cover types on the Landsat <b>computer</b> <b>maps.</b> There is every indication to suggest that digital multispectral image processing systems based on Landsat input data will play an increasingly important role in pattern recognition and mapping land cover in the years to come...|$|R

500|$|Long-haul {{drivers are}} {{normally}} {{paid by the}} mile, not by the hour. Legally, truck drivers {{are not required to}} receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard 40-hour work week. Some drivers may choose to violate the HOS to earn more money. Being paid by the mile, any work performed that is not actual driving is of no value to the driver, providing incentive to falsify {{the amount of time spent}} performing non-driving duties. Drivers who falsify their log books often under-report their non-driving duties (such as waiting to be loaded and unloaded) which they are not paid for, and under-report their driving time or total miles. Many drivers who receive mileage pay are not paid by logged miles or actual miles, instead, motor carriers use <b>computer</b> <b>mapping</b> software (such as PC Miler) or published mileage guides (such as the Rand McNally Household Goods Carriers' Bureau Mileage Guide). PATT suggests that paying all drivers by the hour would reduce HOS violations by removing the incentive to [...] "cheat the system" [...] by driving more miles than are being logged. Surveys by OOIDA report 80% of drivers are not paid for waiting times while loading and unloading, and the majority of those drivers log these times as off-duty (while regulations require they be logged as on-duty). These same drivers reported they would log these times as on-duty if they were paid reasonably for such delays.|$|E
