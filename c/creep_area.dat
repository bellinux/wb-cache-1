40|$|Around 15 % of all liveborn piglets die {{during the}} {{lactation}} period, and this poses {{a major economical}} and welfare challenge for the pig production. It has been hypothesized that an increased use of the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> early after birth will reduce piglet mortality as it provides the piglets with heat and protection from crushing. The aim of this thesis was to investigate environmental requirements and preferences in newborn piglets, and to use this information {{in an attempt to}} design a more attractive piglet <b>creep</b> <b>area.</b> Furthermore, we wanted to test the hypothesis that a more attractive <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> would increase the use of the <b>creep</b> <b>area,</b> and reduce piglet mortality. The results showed that piglets were increasingly capable of using thermoregulatory behaviours like posture changes and to a lesser extent, degree of huddling, in order to adapt to changes in the thermal environment, but these strategies were not fine tuned at birth. The thermoregulatory behaviors affected the space occupied by a resting litter, and the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> must be 1. 26 m² in order to accommodate 14 piglets at three weeks of age. In the 60 minute preference test, the piglets preferred to rest in 42 ºC, and in a thick layer of sawdust. Piglets in crates spent more time in the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> compared to piglets in pens. However, the piglets still chose to rest near the sow when a <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> large enough for the whole litter, containing high infrared temperatures and a thick layer of sawdust was presented in the farrowing pen. The findings from this thesis indicate that piglets are able to assess and adjust to their thermal environment and that they have clear preferences for high infrared temperatures. However, our results also show that quality of the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> does not increase time spent in the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> when the sow is present, and more importantly; increased time spent in the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> does not reduce piglet mortality...|$|E

One of the methods frequently used to achieve this is to maintain a low room air temperature and provide protection to the piglets by covering the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> in different ways. However, only limited information is found in literature on the specific thermal consequences of different cover designs. An experiment was conducted with a 0. 6 m by 1. 0 m <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> surrounded by 4 different constructions, each covered with 3 different materials.

40|$|Ultimately, seismotectonic studies seek {{to provide}} ways of {{assessing}} the timing, magnitude and spatial extent of future earthquakes. Ample observations document the spatial variability in interseismic coupling, {{defined as a}} degree of locking of a fault {{during the period of}} stress build-up between seismic events: fully or nearly locked fault patches are often surrounded by aseismically <b>creeping</b> <b>areas.</b> However, it is unclear how these observations could help assess future earthquakes. Here we simulate spontaneous seismic and aseismic fault slip with a fully dynamic numerical model. Our simulations establish the dependence of earthquake rupture patterns and interseismic coupling on spatial variations of fault friction. We consider the long-term evolution of slip on a model fault where two seismogenic, locked segments are separated by an aseismically slipping patch where rupture is impeded. We find that the probability for a large earthquake to break through the rupture-impeding patch is correlated with the interseismic coupling averaged over this patch. In addition, the probability that an earthquake breaks through the rupture-impeding patch and interseismic coupling are both related to fault friction properties through a single non-dimensional parameter. Our study opens the possibility of predicting seismic rupture patterns that a fault system can produce on the basis of observations of its interseismic coupling, and suggests that regions of low interseismic coupling may reveal permanent barriers to large earthquakes...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the current}} experiment, which is {{outlined}} {{in this special}} issue, provides a good representation of earthquake predictability research in Japan, another type of experiment is possible based on the seismicity of Japan. This point is discussed by Okada et al. (2011 in press) who use hundreds of sequences of several to tens of small repeating events with identical waveforms taking place off {{the east coast of}} northeastern Japan. Repeating earthquakes are thought to occur on a small asperity along a plate boundary surrounded on all sides by <b>creeping</b> <b>areas</b> (Uchida et al., 2003). These repeaters present a unique opportunity to test earthquake recurrence time models because each event can be defined objectively and also because observed recurrence intervals are typically in the range of 1 – 4 years, short enough to evaluate model performance. One of the interesting findings is that the timing of repeating earthquakes depend considerably on the time elapsed after the last event, although the dependence became insignificant {{in the aftermath of the}} 2008 M = 7.0 earthquake off Ibaraki Prefecture because of a large slow slip event along the plate boundary that was triggered by that earthquake. This type of result could not have been obtained without systematic testing of a large number of samples under a controlled experimental environment, as was done so by Okada et al. (2011 in press). The experiment is not part of the CSEP, but it serves as a good example of alternative types of predictive statements, demonstrating the extensive role that Japan can play as a natural laboratory for earthquake predictability research.|$|R

Over a period of 24 days 100 per cent of the piglets examined developed sole bruising, and 49. 1 per cent developed sole erosions. Sole bruising lasted for an average of 13 days and sole erosions for seven days. At the beginning of the study, a higher proportion of piglets had mild sole bruising; from three to nine days of age piglets had moderate sole bruising but from days 10 to 20 mild bruising was again observed more frequently. Skin lesions were observed on the carpal aspect of the front limbs; 60. 9 per cent of the piglets developed skin abrasions, 70. 7 per cent developed healed wounds and 90 per cent developed hairless patches. The skin abrasions lasted on average for six days, the healed wounds for five days and the hairless patches for eight days.

This method, which relies on a Bayesian approach, allows {{the determination of the}} scalar seismic moment, corner frequency (fc), and their associated uncertainties, by inverting ratios between seismic displacement spectra of nearby located earthquakes. We apply this method to a large earthquake multiplet (56 events) located under the northern coast of the Corinth gulf at 8 km depth. This multiplet is regularly active between 2001 and 2007. Results show fc (sub P) /fc (sub S) ratios globally between 1. 0 and 1. 5 which is compatible with the values predicted by Madariaga's circular rupture model. In detail, six earthquakes, however, exhibit corner frequency variations {{as a function of the}} station azimuth compatible with linear rupture propagation. Magnitude ranges 1. 08 and 2. 80 with a b value of 1. 04. Source rupture length globally ranges between 40 and 170 m for stress drop between 1 and 100 MPa. We show that the number of ruptures and the cumulated coseismic slip are maximal at the center of the multiplet: this suggests that Multiplet- 866 could be seen as a weak seismogenic patch surrounded by a locked fault. However, the large value of the maximum coseismic slip cumulated over the period 2000 - 2008 (10 cm) rather suggests creep allowing rapid stress reloading and repeated earthquakes with short delays. We therefore propose that Multiplet- 866 is surrounded by a heterogeneous fault surface with both locked and <b>creeping</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} of weaning, piglets are under many stress {{factors such as the}} end of milk immunity, {{separation}} from the mother, mixing with other animals, the adaptation to new diets and new pens, etc. Piglets usually show a non infection malabsorption syndrome response and Immunological System depression.

40|$|Slow slip events along faults and {{fractures}} are reviewed. Such inter-block displacements can {{be recorded}} at various scale levels and considered as transitional from quasi-stable (creep) to dynamic slip (earthquake). Such events include seismogenic slip along faults at velocities by {{one to three}} orders lower than those in case of 'normal' earthquakes, as well as aseismic slip cases. Discovering such events facilitates {{better understanding of how}} energy accumulated during deformation of the crust is released. Studying conditions and the evolution of transitional regimes can provide new important information on the structure and regularities of deformation in fault zones. Data from latest publications by different authors are consolidated, and the data analysis results are presented. Over 170 slow slip events are reviewed. Based on the consolidated data and modelling results obtained by the authors, relationships between parameters of the reviewed process are established, scale relations between the events are considered, and a first-approximation analysis is conducted for impacts of geomaterial characteristics on various deformation regimes. Low-frequency earthquake foci and slow slip sites are most typically located in zones of transition from stable <b>creep</b> <b>areas</b> to seismogenic segments of the discontinuity (Fig. 3) It can be logically supposed that in such transitional zones, the interface has specific frictional properties providing for a regime that can be termed as 'conditionally stable slip'. The duration of slow deformation events is roughly proportional to the released seismic moment, while such a ratio is close to self-similarity in case of 'normal' earthquakes (Fig. 4). In case of slow slip, an area of the displaced section is larger by many factors than the corresponding value for an earthquake with the same seismic moment, while an average displacement amplitude along the fault is significantly smaller (Figures 5 and 6). Velocities of slip propagation along the fault strike are variable from a few hundred metres to 20 – 30 km/day. Slip velocities tend to decrease with scale (Fig. 7). Various slip modes were realized in laboratory experiments with slider model. Main specific features of slow slip along faults were simulated in the laboratory conditions. Possibilities for implementation of different deformation regimes were mainly determined by structure of simulated fault gouge. At equal Coulombic strength, small variations of structural characteristics, such as granulometric composition, grain shape, presence of fluid and its viscosity, may critically impact the deformation mode (Fig. 12). As evidenced by the data consolidated and analysed in this article, conditionally stable regimes of deformation of crustal discontinuities are a common phenomenon. Studies of such transitional deformation regimes seem promising for establishment of regularities in generation and evolution of dynamic events, such earthquakes, tectonic rock bursts, and slope events. </p...|$|R

Then based on porous media seepage theory, gas leakage simulation model including salt rock, cavity interlayers and interface is built. With this strategy, {{it is possible to}} overcome the disadvantage of simulation burden with porous-fractured double medium. It also can provide the details of gas flowing along the damaged zones. Finally this proposal is applied to the salt cavern in Qianjian mines (East China). Under different operation pressures, gas distributions around two adjacent cavities are simulated; the evolvement of gas in the interlayers and salt rock is compared. From the results it is demonstrated that the domain of <b>creep</b> damage <b>area</b> has great influence on leakage range. And also the leakage in the interface will accelerate the development of leakage in salt rock. It is concluded that compared with observations, this new strategy provides closer answers. The simulation result proves its validity for the design and reasonable control of operating pressure and tightness evaluation of group bedded salt rock storage caverns...|$|R
50|$|The Bennett Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area {{located in}} Sonoma County, California. The {{boundaries}} of this appellation lie completely within the North Coast AVA, almost completely within the Sonoma Valley AVA and overlaps into {{some areas of}} the Sonoma Coast AVA and Sonoma Mountain AVA. The region was granted AVA status on December 23, 2003 following the petition of Matanzas Creek Winery. The AVA is surrounded to the south, east and west by the Sonoma Mountains and to the north by the city of Santa Rosa, California. The region receives a moderating effect on its climate from Pacific Ocean through the cool coastal fogs and breeze that <b>creep</b> into the <b>area</b> from the southwest through Crane Canyon between Sonoma Mountain and Taylor Mountain. Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Syrah are the leading grape varieties planted.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} lateral {{variations}} in fault friction control {{the heterogeneity of}} slip observed in large earthquakes, We model these variations using a rate and state-dependent friction law, where we differentiate velocity-weakening into strong and weak-seismic fields, and velocity-strengthening into compliant and viscous fields. The strong-seismic field comprises the seismic slip concentrations, or asperities. The two «intermediate» frictional fields, weak-seismic and compliant, modulate both the tectonic loading and the dynamic rupture process. During the interseismic period, the compliant and viscous regions slip aseismically while the strong-seismic regions remain locked, evolving into stress concentrations that fail only in main shocks. The weak-seismic regions contain most of the interseismic activity and aftershocks, but also «creep seismically», that is, most of the weak-seismic area slips aseismically, actuating the seismicity on the remaining area. This «mixed» frictional behavior {{can be obtained from}} a sufficiently heterogenous distribution for the critical slip distance. The interseismic slip provides an inherent rupture resistance: dynamic rupture fronts decelerate as they penetrate into these unloaded compliant or <b>creeping</b> weak-seismic <b>areas,</b> diffusing into broad areas of accelerated afterslip. Aftershocks occur in both the weak-seismic and compliant areas around the fault, but most of the stress is diffused through aseismic slip. Rapid afterslip on these peripheral areas can also produce aftershocks within the main shock rupture area, by reloading weak fault areas that slipped in the main shock and then healed. We test this frictional model by comparing the interevent seismicity and aftershocks to the coseismic slip distribution for the 1966 Parkfield, 1979 Coyote Lake, and 1984 Morgan Hill earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Tail biting is an {{abnormal}} behaviour of pigs that {{is thought to}} have a multi-factorial origin. It is considered an unpredictable event on farms and is hard to reproduce experimentally. Therefore, a novel approach involving a case control study was used to investigate risk factors for tail biting on commercial units in England. Ninety-two pig farms across England were visited over a period of 11 months. At each visit, the owner or the manager of the unit was interviewed and the unit inspected. Data were recorded on standard forms. Farms were categorised into those that had tail biting in at least one pig in the past 6 months and those that had not. Univariate and logistic regression analyses yielded the following main results. Adding straw in the <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> once or more per day decreased the risk of tail biting 10 -fold. Keeping grower pigs on partially or fully slatted floors versus solid floor increased risks of tail biting (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 2). Using a feeding system with five or more grower pigs per feed space increased risks of tail biting (OR = 2. 7). A stocking density during the growing phase of 110 kg/m(2) or greater increased risks of tail biting (OR = 2. 7). Farms that belonged to a holding of five or more pig units had an increased risk of tail biting (OR = 3. 5). As the number of pens per stockman increased by one, the risk of tail biting increased 1. 06 -fold. Tail biting was also associated with the following disease and production information: as the P 2 back-fat value increased by I turn, the risk of tail biting decreased by 1. 5 -fold; post-weaning mortality above 2. 5 % was associated with a 3. 9 -fold increase in the risk of tail biting; presence of respiratory diseases was associated with a 1. 6 -fold increase in the risk of tail biting. Tail docking was associated with a three-fold increase in the risk of tail biting. This study has identified and quantified some management practices on commercial farms that can be changed to decrease the risk of tail biting in growing and finishing pigs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to analyze different design approaches for RC columns, in particular those cases in which second order effects should be considered when the column is under compression. Throughout the study, a variety of support cases and different types of section will be presented for columns of different slenderness ratios. These cases will be resolved using the Simplified Methods provided in Eurocode 2 {{and the evolution of}} second order effects with the slenderness ratio will be studied. Within this study, the influence of <b>creep,</b> <b>area</b> of reinforcement and area of concrete in the second order moment will be investigated, to then discern the differences between the Nominal Stiffness and the Nominal Curvature methods. It will be determined that in the Nominal Stiffness method creep has an increasing effect as the slenderness ratio increments. Creep will have an effect in the Nominal Curvature method until a certain slenderness value is achieved, which depends on the compressive characteristic strength. When studying the influence of the areas of reinforcement and concrete in taking into account second order effects, it will also be deduced that increasing the area of reinforcement is a good solution if the slenderness only just exceeds the slenderness limit. If the slenderness is much higher than the limit, then it is better to increase the area of concrete since it will increase the limit and reduce the slenderness more effectively. The differences found between the three types of sections will also be a subject of study. These sections will be rectangular with reinforcement placed in opposite sides, rectangular with uniform distribution of reinforcement and circular with uniform distribution of reinforcement. The first section is the least affected by second order effects whilst the second section is the most affected. For the calculations, a tool {{in the form of a}} spreadsheet for the Simplified Methods will be created with the purpose of being intuitive to use and generate output values automatically. Finally, columns of different slenderness ratios will be modeled and tested by means of a finite element (FEM) analysis. The results of the evolution of the second order moment with the slenderness ratio will be compared to those obtained through the Simplified Methods and will prove to be quite similar...|$|E
40|$|Landslides {{are among}} the major threats to urban {{landscape}} and manmade infrastructure. They often cause economic losses, property damages, and loss of lives. Temporal monitoring data of landslides from different epochs empowers the evaluation of landslide progression. Alignment of overlapping surfaces from two or more epochs is crucial for the proper analysis of landslide dynamics. The traditional methods for point-cloud-based landslide monitoring rely on using {{a variation of the}} Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration procedure to align any reconstructed surfaces from different epochs to a common reference frame. However, sometimes the ICP-based registration can fail or may not provide sufficient accuracy. For example, point clouds from different epochs might fit to local minima due to lack of geometrical variability within the data. Also, manual interaction is required to exclude any non-stable areas from the registration process. In this paper, a robust image-based registration method is introduced for the simultaneous evaluation of all registration parameters. This includes the Interior Orientation Parameters (IOPs) of the camera and the Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOPs) of the involved images from all available observation epochs via a bundle block adjustment with self-calibration. Next, a semi-global dense matching technique is implemented to generate dense 3 D point clouds for each epoch using the images captured in a particular epoch separately. The normal distances between any two consecutive point clouds can then be readily computed, because the point clouds are already effectively co-registered. A low-cost DJI Phantom II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was customised and used in this research for temporal data collection over an active soil <b>creep</b> <b>area</b> in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. The customisation included adding a GPS logger and a Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) action camera which facilitated capturing high-resolution geo-tagged images in two epochs over the period of one year (i. e., May 2014 and May 2015). Note that due to the coarse accuracy of the on-board GPS receiver (e. g., +/- 5 - 10 m) the geo-tagged positions of the images were only used as initial values in the bundle block adjustment. Normal distances, signifying detected changes, varying from 20 cm to 4 m were identified between the two epochs. The accuracy of the co-registered surfaces was estimated by comparing non-active patches within the monitored area of interest. Since these non-active sub-areas are stationary, the computed normal distances should theoretically be close to zero. The quality control of the registration results showed that the average normal distance was approximately 4 cm, which is within the noise level of the reconstructed surfaces...|$|E
40|$|By {{measuring}} relative earthquake arrival times using waveform {{cross correlation}} and locating earthquakes using the double difference technique, {{we are able}} to reduce hypocentral errors by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over routine locations for nearly 8000 events along a 35 -km section of the Calaveras Fault. This represents ∼ 92 % of all seismicity since 1984 and includes the rupture zone of the M 6. 2 1984 Morgan Hill, California, earthquake. The relocated seismicity forms highly organized structures that were previously obscured by location errors. There are abundant repeating earthquake sequences as well as linear clusters of earthquakes. Large voids in seismicity appear with dimensions of kilometers that have been aseismic over the 30 -year time interval, suggesting that these portions of the fault are either locked or <b>creeping.</b> The <b>area</b> of greatest slip in the Morgan Hill main shock coincides with the most prominent of these voids, suggesting that this part of the fault may be locked between large earthquakes. We find that the Calaveras Fault at depth is extremely thin, with an average upper bound on fault zone width of 75 m. Given the location error, however, this width is not resolvably different from zero. The relocations reveal active secondary faults, which we use to solve for the stress field in the immediate vicinity of the Calaveras Fault. We find that the maximum compressive stress is at a high angle, only 13 ° from the fault normal, supporting previous interpretations that this fault is weak...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{issues related}} to hydrodynamics in Lake El-Burullus and flow {{patterns}} therein. Burullus Lake is the second largest lake in the northern Egyptian coast with a total area of 410 km 2. It was utilized Delft 3 D-flow module to develop a field validated hydrodynamic model. The shallow brackish Lake is mainly affected by uncontrolled <b>creeping</b> of development <b>areas</b> and growing inflow of untreated agricultural, municipal and industrial drainage water. The developed model {{was used to examine}} a potential mitigation alternative by decreasing the pollutant loads that enter the Lake i. e. diversion of existing drains. In this fashion {{the creation of a new}} development area near-by may be feasible. In addition, the effects of hydrodynamics on pollutant dispersion either from an individual drain or all drains together. The results of this study will be the base for the water quality modeling stage. Actually, this work is the first stage of an integrated Lake management. The study concluded that the developed model efficiently simulated the hydrodynamics of the Lake which can act as an effective decision support tool for improving the environmental conditions in the surroundings...|$|R
25|$|Of all the oaks, the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) is {{the most}} {{resistant}} to drought and the continental-style climate. These forests, of a sub-Atlantic character, often represent the shift from Mediterranean vegetation to Atlantic vegetation. They cover a wide area of the peninsula and are of great importance, above all on the mountain ranges in {{the centre of the}} peninsula; from the interior of Galicia and extending south of the Cordillera Cantábrica they extend throughout the Sistema Central, reaching, to the south, (though scarce by the time they reach this region) the Sierra Nevada and Cádiz. They usually extend from some 700 to 800 metres to some 1500 to 1600 m in altitude. They prefer siliceous soil and, as altitude increases, they replace the damp oak forests and cork oak; on the high ground they give way to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests or to los piornales serranos with <b>creeping</b> juniper. In <b>areas</b> where the influence of the Atlantic is more evident, they are taken over by heather and Erica australis; in the remainder, in clearings and in more degraded phases, rock rose (Cistaceae) mixed with laurel leaf and Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is more frequent. Their natural range is usually covered by forests of Scots pine or maritime pine.|$|R
