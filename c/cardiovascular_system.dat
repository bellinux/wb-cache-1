5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system,</b> decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E

5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system,</b> decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E

50|$|Tests {{measuring}} VO2 max can {{be dangerous}} in individuals who are not considered normal healthy subjects, as any problems with the respiratory and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>systems</b> will be greatly exacerbated in clinically ill patients. Thus, many protocols for estimating VO2 max {{have been developed for}} those for whom a traditional VO2 max test would be too risky. These generally are similar to a VO2 max test, but do not reach the maximum of the respiratory and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>systems</b> and are called sub-maximal tests.|$|R

40|$|Invertebrate <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>systems</b> have {{historically}} been viewed as sluggish, poorly regulated, and &# 8220;open&# 8221;, where blood bathes the tissues directly as it moves through a system of ill-defined sinuses and/or lacunae without an endothelial boundary. When examining cardiovascular/circulatory morphology and physiology in a broader evolutionary context, one can question {{the very nature of}} the definition of a &# 8220;closed&# 8221; versus &# 8220;open&# 8221; circulatory system. Viewed in this context a number of invertebrates have evolved incomplete or even completely cell-lined vessels and or lacunae with a highly branched vasculature that allows for the production of significant driving pressures and flows to meet relatively high metabolic demands driven by active life styles. In light of our current understanding of invertebrate <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>systems</b> and their paralleled complexity to vertebrate systems, a number of long established paradigms must be questioned and new definitions presented to better align our understanding of the nature of &# 8220;open&# 8221; versus &# 8220;closed&# 8221; <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|While humans, as well {{as other}} vertebrates, have a closed <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some {{invertebrate}} groups have an open <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system.</b> The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.
