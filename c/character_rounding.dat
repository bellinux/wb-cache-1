40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results of}} a {{systematic}} study of the elastic properties of nanosized single-crystal wires and beams of bcc iron. Both tensile and bending stiffnesses have been determined employing molecular statics simulations for specimens of different sizes and three different crystallographic orientations. We also analyze the influence of circular cross sections and rounded edges compared to square cross sections with sharp edges for one of the crystallographic orientations. The simulations show that there is a size dependence in Young's modulus and that different crystallographic orientations display different elastic behaviors. There are bands of deviating Young's modulus over the cross sections in the direction 45 degrees from the surfaces emanating from the edges, giving the cross section a heterogeneous <b>character.</b> <b>Rounding</b> the edges, or making the cross section circular, has little influence on the average Young's modulus, but it does influence the distribution over the cross section and, consequently, the aforementioned bands...|$|E

40|$|In Aspects of the Novel, Edward Morgan Forster {{introduces}} the critical concepts of flat and round {{to describe the}} nature {{of different types of}} fictional characters. According to Forster’s theoretical categorization, flat characters are constructed and exist in their fictional realm around a single feature or quality. As this is the key criterion, Forster argues that flat characters can easily be recognized and remembered by the reader. Flat characters remain mostly the same through circumstances. In other words, flat characters never surprise the reader. Contrary to the nature of flat <b>characters,</b> <b>round</b> <b>characters</b> operate in an opposite direction to their counterparts. <b>Round</b> <b>characters</b> never remain the same throughout events, and {{it is not easy to}} recognize them since they do not exist under the dominance of a single trait. In addition to these, <b>round</b> <b>characters</b> are those who surprise the reader. Although Forster’s categorisation of fictional characters has functioned well in most of the cases, some characters are not easily analysed under this formula. Franz Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, for example, seems neither a round nor a flat character. Throughout his story, he remains the same. At the same time, he surprises the reader, which is not expected from him since he is mostly the same character in the text. Samsa’s turning into an insect further complicates the definition of his roundness or flatness. Another example is Iris Murdoch’s Mister Mars. Mister Mars is an animal. But at the same time he is a movie star, a celebrity. He has a pivotal role for the protagonist of the text. Therefore, the aim of this study is first to introduce the theoretical background of the nature of fictional characters and then to display some difficulties present particularly in Forster’s classification through the characterisation of two non-human examples...|$|R

[...] John Berryman, on the other hand, understands the first line of Sonnet 144 to be Shakespeare's way of confessing his romantic relationship with the boy and the dark lady: [...] "This is the sonnet of which the poet John Berryman remarked, in his comments on Lowell in The Freedom of the Poet, 'When Shakespeare wrote [...] reader, he was not kidding."
