5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown {{areas have}} been {{environmentally}} cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E
40|$|Contact state {{information}} is indispensable for performing skillful tasks {{in which an}} end-effector should be {{in contact with the}} environment. In previous work, the authors introduced the concept of a pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> that is useful for tasks involving contact as one expression of the contact state. In this paper, an extended definition of the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is proposed. The pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is defined as the foot of the perpendicular from the nearest point on a reference object to the line on which the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> and external force vector lie. The system may estimate the contact state and its transitions by monitoring the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{in spite of the fact}} that the pseudo <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> does not always denote the real <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method, which is particularly valuable in providing an intuitive positional description of a contact state...|$|R

5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The heads-up display (HUD) interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and <b>contact</b> <b>points)</b> and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other his face. When the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced equipment costs. The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{approved}} the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street {{on the southern}} edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts {{to reduce the number of}} <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
50|$|Identically-shaped balls {{help the}} {{pressure}} waves converge on the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{of the last}} ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off {{the opposite side of}} the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> because the first wave reflects off {{the opposite side of the}} last ball and it meets up at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the 2nd ball. Then the reverberations will reflect off the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> between the 2nd and 3rd balls, but still converging at the last <b>contact</b> <b>point,</b> until the last ball is ejected. But it's less of a wave front with each reflection.|$|R

25|$|The {{movement}} of snakes in arboreal habitats {{has only recently}} been studied. While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of locomotion depending on species and bark texture. In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> are available. Snakes move faster on small branches and when <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} between vibration and friction exists widely in the mechanical system. In order {{to research the}} effect of the vibration amplitude on the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> friction in the mechanical system, a new apparatus is developed independently to measure the <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> friction influenced by the changing amplitude. The data acquired through the apparatus show that the friction at the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> decreases with increasing of the amplitude. In terms of theoretical analysis in this paper, the increasing of the amplitude actually reduces the contact area at the point. In addition, the friction at the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> is proportional to the contact area. So, the friction decreases with the decreasing contact area caused by the increasing amplitude...|$|R
25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the <b>contact</b> <b>points,</b> thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E
