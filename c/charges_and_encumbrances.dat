State registration of restrictions <b>and</b> <b>encumbrances</b> of the rights on land spot is a mean {{to protect the rights}} of holders of material rights on land spot and people for whom those rights are encumbranced or restricted. The current legislation, unfortunately, does not regulate explicitly the registration restrictions <b>and</b> <b>encumbrances</b> of land rights. The objective of this article is the analysis of existing system of state registration of restrictions <b>and</b> <b>encumbrances</b> of land rights and provision of propositions for the improvement of national legislation in this area. Studying the legal nature of the categories of ?restrictions? <b>and</b> ?<b>encumbrances?</b> of land rights the author supports the position of scholars who consider them as different legal categories. Encumbrances of land rights arise from another person?s rights on land and are established to ensure the interests of third parties in this land spot, while restrictions of land rights ? is narrowing the limits of subjective law, which does not follow from the rights of another person. While studying the issue it is found out that only restrictions established by a contract or court decision and under paragraph 2 of the Article 111 of the Land Code of Ukraine should be registered. Besides, information about material rights for strange property that <b>encumbrance</b> land spots, <b>and</b> information about other encumbrances of the rights on land spots are submitted to various sections of the State Register of the Rights on Real Estate. In the conclusion the author has stressed on the need to improve legislation in the sphere of state registration of restrictions <b>and</b> <b>encumbrances</b> of land rights. Firstly, there is a need for a legislative definition of the concepts of ?restrictions? <b>and</b> ?<b>encumbrances?</b> of land rights; secondly, there should be a list of encumbrances of land rights, which are subject to state registration. ???????? ?????? ???? ???????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????? ? ????????????? ???? ?? ?????. ?????????? ???? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????????...|$|R
