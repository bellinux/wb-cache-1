In this study, we investigate the influence of impurities from the crucible on efficiency losses in mc silicon solar cells, focusing on the limitation due to iron. The applicability of p-type mc silicon, crystallized in G 1 sized crucibles of industrial material quality and very pure electrically fused silica, for a high-efficiency solar cell process is examined by measuring lifetime and interstitial iron concentration in the wafers after different processing steps and by estimating the cell efficiency potential from injection-dependent bulk lifetime measurements.

Efficiency losses are quantified to losses due to segregated impurities diffused into the silicon melt, losses due to decorated <b>crystal</b> <b>defects</b> <b>and</b> losses due to solid-state diffusion into the crystal.
