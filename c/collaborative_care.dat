40|$|Objective: Generalized {{anxiety and}} panic {{disorders}} are {{a burden on}} the society because they are costly and have a significant adverse effect on quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cost-utility of a <b>collaborative</b> stepped <b>care</b> intervention for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in primary care compared to care as usual from a societal perspective. Methods: The design of the study was a two armed cluster randomized controlled trial. In total 43 primary care practices in the Netherlands participated in the study. Eventually, 180 patients were included (114 <b>collaborative</b> stepped <b>care,</b> 66 care as usual). Baseline measures and follow-up measures (3, 6, 9 and 12. months) were assessed using questionnaires. We applied the TiC-P, the SF-HQL and the EQ- 5 D respectively measuring health care utilization, production losses and health related quality of life. Results: The average annual direct medical costs in the <b>collaborative</b> stepped <b>care</b> group were 1854 Euro (95 % C. I., 1726 to 1986) compared to € 1503 (95 % C. I., 1374 to 1664) in the care as usual group. The average quality of life years (QALYs) gained was 0. 05 higher in the <b>collaborative</b> stepped <b>care</b> group, leading to an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 6965 Euro per QALY. Inclusion of the productivity costs, consequently reflecting the full societal costs, decreased the ratio even more.

50|$|Although less {{empirical}} {{attention has}} been directed toward improving treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care, Stanley et al. found 8 sessions of CBT delivered in a co-located model, superior to usual care for generalized anxiety disorder. Additionally, a <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> approach that packaged brief CBT with pharmacotherapy reduced disability, increased remitted symptoms, and decreased anxiety sensitivity for individuals diagnosed with panic disorder relative to usual care and demonstrated greater improvement in depression, anxiety, and disability measures at 6 month follow-up,.

The program provides mental health screenings and treatments and uses an evidence- and outcome-based model of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> to treat mental health conditions. Mental health is delivered through an existing network of directly operated and contracted specialty mental health clinics in LA county in three “tiers” of care. The first tier offers {{a full range of}} rehabilitation services and is intended for clients with serious mental illness. The second tier offers evidence-based practices, short-term treatment plans, and psychiatric consultations intended for individuals seen in primary care settings.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{prevalence}} of comorbid diabetes and depression is high, especially in low-income Hispanic or Latino patients. The complex mix of factors in safety-net care systems impedes {{the adoption of}} evidence-based <b>collaborative</b> depression <b>care</b> and results in persistent disparities in depression outcomes. The Diabetes 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cDepression Care-Management Adoption Trial examined whether the <b>collaborative</b> depression <b>care</b> model is an effective approach in safety-net clinics to improve clinical care outcomes of depression and diabetes. MethodsA sample of 964 patients with diabetes from 5 safety-net clinics were enrolled in a quasi-experimental study that included 2 arms: usual care, in which primary medical providers and staff translated and adopted evidence-based depression care; and supportive care, in which providers of a disease management program delivered protocol-driven depression care. Because the study design established individual treatment centers as separate arms, we calculated propensity scores that interpreted the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. Primary outcomes were 5 depression care outcomes and 7 diabetes care measures. Regression models with propensity score covariate adjustment were applied to analyze 6 -month outcomes. ResultsCompared with usual care, supportive care significantly decreased Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 scores, {{reduced the number of}} patients with moderate or severe depression, improved depression remission, increased satisfaction in care for patients with emotional problems, and significantly reduced functional impairment. ConclusionImplementing <b>collaborative</b> depression <b>care</b> in a diabetes disease management program is a scalable approach to improve depression outcomes and patient care satisfaction among patients with diabetes in a safety-net care system. 1 R 18 AE 000054 - 01 /AE/ASPE HHS/United State...|$|R
