5|$|The episode {{featured}} the penultimate {{appearance of the}} alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup,</b> and computer-generated imagery (CGI). A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the syrupy mixture to spill correctly.|$|E

25|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, {{ice cream}} in Canada {{must be at least}} 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per liter. When cocoa, <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup,</b> fruit, nuts, or {{confections}} are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and {{southern}} India (especially the coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka region), avocados are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to {{ice cream and}} other desserts. In Brazil, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, a dessert drink is made with sugar, milk or water, and pureed avocado. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> is sometimes added. In Morocco, a similar chilled avocado and milk drink is sweetened with confectioner's sugar and hinted with orange flower water.|$|E

50|$|In 1997 Matthew Algie {{launched}} Espresso Warehouse (with the strapline ‘Everything but the Coffee’) {{to support}} the growing wave of independent coffee bars. Espresso Warehouse products are sold to coffee retailers in the UK and Ireland {{as well as through}} distributors in Europe. Products include tea (Suk and Pavilion Garden) hot <b>chocolate</b> (<b>Chocolate</b> Abyss), <b>syrups</b> (Da Vinci) biscuits and cookies (Wooden Spoon and The Fine Cookie Co) and a wide range of barista equipment and coffee bar hardware.|$|R
25|$|In November 2011, {{the company}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} adding espresso machines in 1,000 of their locations, later that month. Lattes were added to Ontario stores on November 14, 2011. In February 2012, they offered a new beverage, White Hot Chocolate, in select branches. On April 16, 2012, the brand launched frozen lemonade, in two flavours: original and raspberry. In May 2014, they first offered frozen green tea. On August 15, 2014, the company added a dark roast coffee blend as an alternative. In the summer of 2015, they introduced a frozen drink called Creamy Chocolate Chill which was essentially a chocolate milkshake topped with chocolate whipped cream and drizzled with <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup.</b> In addition to the Creamy Chocolate Chill, they also launched a Maple Chill, a maple milkshake topped with regular whipped cream and sprinkled with maple flakes.|$|E
25|$|A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it {{is served}} in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in half {{lengthwise}} (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream {{served in a}} row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit {{was introduced to the}} American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup,</b> marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.|$|E
500|$|For the [...] "vomit scene" [...] where Jennifer {{has just}} arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and {{inhabited}} by a demon, Fox said the liquid {{she was given}} to spit out [...] "was actually ...<b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> initially". [...] "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke Hershey's <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup.</b> Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. [...] "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene..." [...] Fox said it [...] "clips on. It goes {{around the back of}} my ear and then I bite down on it on the side of my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube..." ...|$|E
25|$|Breakfast bagels, a softer, sweeter variety usually sold in fruity or sweet flavors (e.g., cherry, strawberry, cheese, blueberry, cinnamon-raisin, <b>chocolate</b> chip, maple <b>syrup,</b> banana and nuts) {{are common}} at large {{supermarket}} chains. These are usually sold sliced and are intended to be prepared in a toaster.|$|R
50|$|In North America, {{they are}} often eaten as a breakfast food; {{toppings}} vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and <b>chocolate</b> spread, to <b>syrup</b> and butter or margarine. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a dessert.|$|R
2500|$|In 1907, he {{introduced}} a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named [...] "Hershey's Kiss". [...] Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, {{and the introduction of}} machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon {{to the top of the}} package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product. [...] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. [...] Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk <b>chocolate,</b> Hershey's <b>Syrup</b> (1926), semisweet <b>chocolate</b> chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).|$|R
500|$|In Peru, hot {{chocolate}} {{can be served}} with panettone at breakfast on Christmas Day, even though summer has already started in the southern hemisphere.

500|$|For {{the death}} scenes, the crew used several lifecasts {{of the actors}} and <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> for fake blood. [...] Creating the Rube Goldberg effect for Ms. Lewton's death scene was the most {{difficult}} to plan according to the crew. [...] Perry said that [...] "it was very hard to generate an atmosphere of dread, to create suspense out of scenes that are common".|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} {{screeching}} violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled [...] "The Murder". Hitchcock {{originally intended to}} have no music for the sequence (and all motel scenes), but Herrmann insisted he try his composition. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene, and nearly doubled Herrmann's salary. The blood in the scene is reputed to have been Bosco <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup,</b> which shows up better on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a casaba melon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for the song, {{directed}} by Israel Anthem, {{was released on}} August 31, 2010. It features the band playing {{in the dark and}} there are parts where everyone in the band is faceless and shots of them being covered in <b>chocolate</b> and maple <b>syrup</b> [...] This is related to the lyrics of the song.|$|R
5000|$|Pancakes may {{be served}} {{at any time}} of the day with a variety of {{toppings}} or fillings including jam, fruit, <b>syrup,</b> <b>chocolate</b> chips, or meat, but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food. Pancakes serve a similar function to waffles. In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as [...] "Pancake Day", when perishable ingredients have to be used up before the fasting period of Lent.|$|R
5000|$|A cheaper {{alternative}} to couverture <b>chocolate</b> is chocolate-flavored <b>syrup,</b> also called [...] "chocolate coating". Chocolate coating {{is already in}} liquid form and costs much less than couverture chocolate - although many {{would argue that the}} extra expense of gourmet Belgian couverture chocolate is more than worth it. Another alternative is to use dark chocolate, such as 70% cocoa chocolate. This contains much less sugar, so it isn't so sticky; a small quantity of hot water may be added to thin it further.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} a series milestone, and {{features}} the last appearance of the alien black oil before the series finale, where it appeared via flashback—a plot device that {{plays a significant role}} in the series and in the 1998 X-Files movie. The oil effects were created using <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> and molasses. Principal filming for [...] "Vienen" [...] was carried out at three locations: an oil platform, an oil refinery, and on a specially-created set. The episode's title is a Spanish word meaning [...] "they come" [...] or [...] "they are coming", and has been interpreted as foreshadowing the show's Super Soldier narrative arc. Elements of the plot have been compared to the ancient Greek religious and mythological figure Orpheus.|$|E
500|$|The Last Exit on Brooklyn {{opened on}} June 30, 1967 at 3930 Brooklyn Avenue NE near the University of Washington campus {{in a small}} light-industrial {{building}} leased from the University. It {{was one of the}} pioneer espresso bars in Seattle, adding an espresso machine shortly after Café Allegro opened the first in 1975. The Last Exit was known for its original espresso concoction named the Caffè Medici – [...] "a doppio poured over <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> and orange peel with whipped cream on top". Described in 1985 as [...] "America's second oldest, continuously running coffeehouse", it was also known for its inexpensive food and as a venue for folk music and bohemian conversation.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup,</b> and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E
50|$|Ireland fields a 24-hour ration pack {{somewhat}} {{similar to that}} used by the British. It is packed in a large ziplock plastic bag and contains two pre-cooked main meals and items to be eaten throughout the day. Included are: instant soup, ramen noodles, an oatmeal block, a high-energy protein bar, both brown and fruit biscuits, sweets, and a selection of beverage mixes. Breakfast (bacon and beans or sausage and beans) is packaged in a retort pouch while dinner (Beef Casserole, Irish Stew, Chicken Curry, or a vegetarian main course) comes in either a flat tin or microwaveable plastic tray. Desserts consist of a retort-pouched dessert (<b>chocolate</b> pudding, <b>syrup</b> pudding, fruit dumplings), a Kendal mint cake, and a roll of fruit lozenges. Beverages include tea bags, instant coffee, hot cocoa, and a powdered isotonic drink mix. Also included are a pack of tissues, a small scouring pad, matches, water purification tablets, salt and pepper packets, sugar, dry cream powder, moist towelettes, and individual packets of foot powder.|$|R
50|$|In 1819, {{the owner}} of gardens in Stockholm were allowed to sell their fruits and {{vegetables}} in {{the city on the}} same terms as the members of the Garden master's Guild. Women were also explicitly awarded a number of professional rights, all with reference to their need to support themselves: in 1821, women were given the right to manufacture cut glass; in 1832 the right to make metal objects; and the years up until 1845 the right to make and sell, among others, Lacquer, pomade, perfume, soap, balsam, food, <b>syrup,</b> <b>chocolate,</b> lemonade. In 1835, women were given the right to become bakers without having to apply for a dispensation.|$|R
5000|$|The Coperto dei Figini was a Renaissance porticated {{building}} {{located in}} what is now Piazza del Duomo, the central square in Milan, Italy. The construction began in 1467 on a design by architect Guiniforte Solari (from the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano), ordered by Pietro Figino. [...] The building, located on the north-western side of the piazza, was a popular meeting place for the Milanese people for over 400 years; it housed several shops that sold such drinks as the turbolin (boiled and filtered coffee), <b>chocolate,</b> barbajada, orgeat <b>syrup,</b> and more. Many of these shops evolved into cafes when the first such establishments appeared in Milan; for example, one of the historic Caffé Campari in Milan was located there.|$|R
2500|$|Props {{and special}} effects were fairly simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The blood, for example, was Bosco <b>Chocolate</b> <b>Syrup</b> drizzled over cast members' bodies. Consumed flesh {{consisted}} of roasted ham and entrails donated {{by one of the}} actors, who also owned a chain of butcher shops. Costumes consisted of second-hand clothing from cast members and Goodwill. Zombie makeup varied during the film. Initially makeup was limited to white skin with blackened eyes; but as filming progressed mortician's wax was used to simulate wounds and decaying flesh. As filming was not linear, the piebald faces appear sporadically. Eastman supervised the special effects, wardrobe and makeup. Filming took place between June and December 1967 under the working title Night of Anubis and later Night of the Flesh Eaters. The small budget led Romero to shoot on 35mm black-and-white film. The completed film ultimately benefited from the decision, as film historian Joseph Maddrey describes the black-and-white filming as [...] "guerrilla-style", resembling [...] "the unflinching authority of a wartime newsreel". Maddrey adds, it [...] "seem as much like a documentary on the loss of social stability as an exploitation film".|$|E
50|$|<b>Chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> is {{also used}} to top puddings and cakes. Some {{restaurants}} use an artistic drizzling of <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> to decorate servings of cheesecake or cake, along with other decorations such as cocoa powder, powdered sugar or chocolate shavings. Some brands of <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> are marketed as chocolate milk syrup (e.g., Nestle Quik). Other brands are marketed as ice cream sundae toppings.|$|E
50|$|Fox's U-bet <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> is a {{commercial}} <b>chocolate</b> <b>syrup</b> made by H. Fox & Company in Brooklyn, New York, since 1895. The product is most {{associated with the}} egg cream fountain beverage.|$|E
5000|$|A melonpan (meronpan) (also {{known as}} melon pan, melon bun or melon bread) {{is a type}} of sweet bun from Japan, that is also popular in Taiwan, China and Latin America. They are made from an enriched dough covered in a thin layer of crisp cookie dough. Their {{appearance}} resembles a melon, such as a rock melon (cantaloupe). They are not traditionally melon flavored, but in recent times it has become popular for manufacturers to add melon to melon bread. Variations exist, including some with a few chocolate chips between the cookie layer and the enriched dough layer, and non-melon versions flavored with caramel, maple <b>syrup,</b> <b>chocolate,</b> or other flavors, sometimes with syrup, whipped or flavored cream, or custard as a filling. In the case of such variations, the name may drop the word [...] "melon" [...] ("maple pan") or may keep it despite the lack of melon flavor ("chocolate melon pan").|$|R
40|$|It is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} fungistat and as a mold and yeast inhibitor. Most applications are in post-harvest handling and processing for food preservation and extension of shelf-life (Dorko et al., 1997). Among the food uses include use as a preservative in baked goods, <b>chocolate,</b> soda fountain <b>syrups,</b> fruit cocktails, cheeses, and artificially sweetened jellies (Winters, 1989). It is also used in fruit waxes (Nelson, 1981). These handling and processing uses are not considered in this current review. There are few references to uses of potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, or other sorbic acid salts used as crop fungicides in general or seed treatments in particular. While some experiments were conducted in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, one reference {{found in the literature}} indicates that sorbic acid and potassium sorbate are of little value for this purpose (Davis and Pinckard, 1971). More recent experiments and inventions claim that potassium sorbate is effective as a mold inhibitor with other synthetic fungicides used in tissue culture (Guri and Patel, 1998). Action: The exact mechanism by which sorbic acid and its potassium salt inhibits microbial growth is not entirely understood. No single mechanism appears to explain the range of toxicity to various spoilage organisms. Sorbic acid inhibits the transport of carbohydrates into yeast cells, inhibits oxidative and fermentative assimilation, and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in a variety of bacteria (Dorko et al., 1997). Other mechanisms proposed appear {{to be related to the}} inability of molds to metabolize sorbic acid (Lindsay, 1996). Combinations: Potassium sorbate was petitioned to be used as a seed treatment with sodium propionate and various unspecified polymers used to coat seed (Patil, 2001). It is also used in a number of combinations for food and feed processing (Dorko et al., 1997). Citric acid can be used as a stabilizer for sorbic acid and its salts (Montagna and Lashley, 1958). Sorbic acids and its salts may have a synergistic effect with various synthetic fungicides when used in plant tissue culture media (Guri an...|$|R
