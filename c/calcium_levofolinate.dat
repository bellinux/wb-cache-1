40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> infusions {{could be}} {{prepared}} in advance by a centralized intravenous additive service (CIVAS) to improve safety and time management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate {{the effect of}} freezing, microwave thawing and long-term storage at 5 +/- 3 degrees C on the stability of <b>calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> in 5 % dextrose solution. METHODS: Solutions of 250 mL of 5 % dextrose in polyolefin bags (n = 5) containing approximately 400 mg of <b>calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> were prepared under aseptic conditions and frozen for 95 days at - 20 degrees C. The solutions were then thawed using microwaves and stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C for 1 month. The <b>calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Visual inspection was performed and pH was measured periodically during the storage at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. Stability of the solution {{was defined as a}} concentration remaining superior to 90 % of the initial concentration by regression analysis as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: No colour change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. <b>Calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> infusions were stable when stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C during 1 month after freeze-thaw treatment. Throughout this period, the lower confidence limit of the estimated regression line of concentration-time profile remained above 90 % of the initial concentration. Slight change in pH values from 6. 52 +/- 0. 01 to 6. 50 +/- 0. 01 during storage time did not affect retention time on HPLC and has no clinical consequence, the solutions remaining in the acceptable range for perfusion (4 <or= pH <or= 10). CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, <b>calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> in 5 % dextrose infusion may be prepared, frozen in advance by CIVAS, and then microwave thawed before use. Such treatment extends long-term stability and releases pharmacist's time for major activities such as checking medication order errors...|$|E
40|$|A chiral {{capillary}} electrophoresis assay for the simultaneous {{determination of the}} optical purity and of related substances of <b>calcium</b> <b>levofolinate</b> has been developed and validated. Using 2, 6 -dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector at a concentration of 20 mg/mL, the method was optimized using a full factorial design with four factors including pH and concentration of the background electrolyte, column temperature and separation voltage. Optimized conditions were a 40 mM sodium tetraborate buffer, pH 9. 9, a capillary temperature of 16 °C, and an applied voltage of 21 kV. Methotrexate was used as internal standard to compensate for injection errors and fluctuations of the migration times. A multiple linear regression model was also {{used to test the}} robustness of the method. Validation was performed with respect to specificity, linearity, range, limit of quantification and detection, precision, and accuracy. The assay allowed the detection and determination of related substances including the diastereomeric (6 R, 2 ′S) -impurity of levofolinic acid at the 0. 1 % level, the identification threshold of impurities for orally administered drugs for human use defined by the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines as well as the European Pharmacopoeia...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In Japan, {{there had}} been no {{prospective}} clinical studies conducted in terms of modi-fied FOLFOX 6 þ bevacizumab therapy. We performed a post-marketing Phase II multicenter clinical study to examine the efficacy and safety of this regimen as first-line therapy for Japanese patients with advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer. Methods: Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously, and then oxaliplatin (85 mg/m 2) and <b>levofolinate</b> <b>calcium</b> (200 mg/m 2) were infused intravenously over 2 h. Subsequently, a bolus dose of 5 -fluorouracil (400 mg/m 2) was injected, followed by infusion of 5 -fluorouracil (2400 mg/m 2) for 46 h. This regimen was repeated every 2 weeks until 24 cycles unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. The primary end point was the response rate. Results: Among the 70 patients enrolled, two patients withdrew the study before treatment, and 68 patients were eligible for analysis of efficacy and safety. The response rate was 51. 5 % (95 % confidence interval: 39. 0 – 63. 8 %). The median progression-free survival and median overall survival time were 12. 6 months (95 % confidence interval: 10. 4 – 14. 5 months) an...|$|R
