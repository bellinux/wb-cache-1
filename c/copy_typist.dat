50|$|A <b>copy</b> <b>typist</b> {{is someone}} who specialises in typing text from a source which they read.|$|E
50|$|See <b>copy</b> <b>typist</b> {{for someone}} who uses a written or printed source for the {{documents}} they are typing.{{for someone who}} uses a written of printed source for the documents they are typing.|$|E
50|$|A {{copyholder}} is {{a device}} that holds the hand written or printed material being typed by a <b>copy</b> <b>typist.</b> They {{were used in the}} past with typewriters and are now used with computers and word processors like Writer or Word.|$|E
50|$|<b>Copy</b> <b>typists</b> {{learn to}} touch type {{at a high}} speed, which means they {{can look at the}} copy they are typing and do not {{need to look at the}} {{keyboard}} they are typing on.|$|R
2500|$|Erasing a set {{of carbon}} copies was {{particularly}} difficult, and called {{for the use of}} a device called an eraser shield (a thin stainless-steel rectangle about [...] with several tiny holes in it) to prevent the pressure of erasing on the upper copies from producing carbon smudges on the lower copies. To correct <b>copies,</b> <b>typists</b> had to go from carbon copy to carbon copy, trying not to get their fingers dirty as they leafed through the carbon papers, and moving and repositioning the eraser shield and eraser for each copy.|$|R
50|$|The arm {{has been}} {{employed}} in other devices {{where it is}} necessary to hold an object stationary at a convenient point in space, notably the <b>copy</b> holder for <b>typists</b> and in some applications, the computer display screen.|$|R
50|$|A <b>copy</b> <b>typist</b> or a {{secretary}} with this skill will quote their speed in {{words per minute}} (abbreviated to wpm) on their curriculum vitae and {{may be asked to}} demonstrate their speed and accuracy of this skill as part of the interview or application process.|$|E
5000|$|Bryans {{began her}} career in the media {{industry}} in 1981. Her first job {{was working as a}} temporary <b>copy</b> <b>typist</b> for UTV that summer which was immediately followed by a job working as a secretary in the Religious Affairs department at BBC Northern Ireland. She {{went on to become a}} newsreader and reporter on BBC's Inside Ulster, as well as reading daytime news bulletins and briefly covering continuity shifts for BBC NI. Bryans' career as a broadcaster began when she applied, as a staff member, for a screen test at the BBC, and she became a continuity announcer and newsreader for the Corporation in Belfast. In an interview with The News Letter, she stated, [...] "I thought I'd apply for a laugh, and ended up being one of six picked out of 100." ...|$|E
50|$|A balanced-arm lamp has a base, two {{connected}} arms {{fitted with}} springs, and a lamp-head. The lamp {{can be moved}} into any position, and the springs will maintain the position until moved again. The same mechanism can be employed in other devices with similar requirements, such as <b>copy</b> holders for <b>typists</b> and some computer display holders. This article uses the terminology lamp cap, forearm, upper arm and base for the four basic parts of these lamps.|$|R
2500|$|... Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, Centre d'archives de Québec, Collection Centre d'archives de Québec, P1000,S3,D435. 128-page {{collection}} of research notes on la Corriveau (p.1), typed transcription {{of the article}} by James MacPherson Le Moine, Marie-Josephte Corriveau, A Canadian Lafarge, from 1863 (pp.2–11), a newspaper clipping entitled Le procès de la Corriveau, dated 28 February 1939 (p.12) {{and a copy of}} the proceedings of the Corriveau case (<b>typist's</b> <b>copy</b> and photostat of the manuscript) (pp.13–128) of the originals preserved by the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|R
5000|$|Baldwin’s 57-year {{marriage}} {{to his wife}} Winifred, who collaborated as <b>copy</b> editor and <b>typist</b> for many of his publications, produced three children and seven grandchildren, of these three obtained a college degree in physics. Baldwin was an avid amateur astronomer, grinding his own lenses and building his own telescopes; fisherman; self-taught pianist, entertaining friends by playing by ear; and historical researcher. [...] One of Baldwin’s notable accomplishments was locating an inscription left by the Dominguez-Escalante expedition of 1776, discovered originally in 1884 by his father on a surveying expedition in northern Arizona. Baldwin organized the 1995/1996 Museum of New Mexico expeditions that found the Escalante inscription and documented this in the Journal of the Southwest (1999).|$|R
50|$|The same {{argument}} shows why {{at least one}} of infinitely many monkeys will produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human <b>typist</b> <b>copying</b> it from the original. In this case Xn = (1 − (1/50)6)n where Xn represents the probability that none of the first n monkeys types banana correctly on their first try. When we consider 100 billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys n increases, the value of Xn - the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text - approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for n going to infinity, is zero. So the probability of the word banana appearing at some point after an infinite number of keystrokes is equal to one.|$|R
5000|$|A related model, the Diablo 1620, {{included}} a keyboard and strongly resembled a slightly overgrown Selectric typewriter. In fact, a [...] "local/remote" [...] switch permitted {{it to be}} used as an offline typewriter as well as an interactive computer terminal. Unfortunately for a typist (in either role), the daisy wheel mechanism hides the area just printed. Firmware in the machine would make the carriage move quickly {{to the right of the}} typing position, revealing the most recently typed characters, after a few moments of inactivity. The result was still unsatisfactory to many users. Only a very slow typing speed would allow the wheel to get out of the way after every character; faster typing speeds resulted in the wheel continuously hiding the typed <b>copy</b> until the <b>typist</b> paused. This made checking the copy for errors a bit more awkward and slow than on actual typewriters or on Selectric-based terminals.|$|R
5000|$|Carlson wrote over 400 {{ideas for}} new inventions in his {{personal}} notebooks while working at Bell Labs. He {{kept coming back to}} his love of printing, especially since his job in the patent department gave him new determination to find a better way to copy documents. [...] "In the course of my patent work," [...] wrote Carlson, [...] "I frequently had need for copies of patent specifications and drawings, and there was no really convenient way of getting them at that time." [...] At the time, the department primarily made <b>copies</b> by having <b>typists</b> retype the patent application in its entirety, using carbon paper to make multiple copies at once. There were other methods available, such as mimeographs and Photostats, but they were more expensive than carbon paper, and they had other limitations that made them impractical. The existing solutions were 'duplicating' machines—they could make many duplicates, but one had to create a special master copy first, usually at great expense of time or money. Carlson wanted to invent a 'copying' machine, that could take an existing document and copy it onto a new piece of paper without any intermediate steps.|$|R
