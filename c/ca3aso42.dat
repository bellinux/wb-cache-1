50|$|Calcium arsenate is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula <b>Ca3(AsO4)2.</b> A colourless solid, {{it was originally}} used as a pesticide and as a germicide. It is highly soluble in water, as compared with lead arsenate, which makes it more toxic. The minerals Rauenthalite Ca3(AsO4)2·10H2O and Phaunouxite Ca3(AsO4)2·11H2O are hydrates of calcium arsenate.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s, it {{was made}} in large vats by mixing calcium oxide and arsenic oxide. In the United States, 1360 metric tons were {{produced}} in 1919, 4540 in 1920, and 7270 in 1922.The composition of commercially available calcium arsenate varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. A typical composition is 80-85% of <b>Ca3(AsO4)2</b> [...] a basic arsenate probably with a composition of 4CaO.As2O5 together with calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate.|$|E
