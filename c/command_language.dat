5|$|Although its {{ultimate}} {{aim was to}} help defeat the communist forces in the Soviet Union, the Corps was used almost exclusively to fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest operational unit. The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger émigrés and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian émigrés living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its <b>command</b> <b>language</b> was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained {{good relations with the}} Nedić administration.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, Jääkarhu {{became the}} first Finnish {{icebreaker}} to adopt Finnish as the <b>command</b> <b>language.</b> Since the officers {{and most of the}} crew spoke Swedish as their first language, this resulted in negative comments from the Swedish-speaking minority, which considered Finnish to be [...] "the language of the peasants", and even concerns about the safety of navigation. Captain Juho Lehtonen, who had replaced Rosqvist in July 1926, even received hate mail from Swedish-speaking citizens, some of whom questioned his professional competence after a minor collision with a Swedish steamer Yrsa on 18 January 1927.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the power}} user's or programmer's perspective, Unix systems are {{characterized}} by a modular design that is sometimes called the [...] "Unix philosophy", meaning that the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and <b>command</b> <b>language</b> to combine the tools to perform complex workflows. Aside from the modular design, Unix also distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language that allowed Unix to reach numerous platforms.|$|E

40|$|Unifying {{programming}} and <b>command</b> <b>languages</b> is a promising idea {{that has yet}} to be thoroughly exploited. Most attempts at such unification have used Lisp or traditional languages, such as Pascal. This paper describes the <b>command</b> and programming <b>language</b> EZ, which attempts to unify command-and programming languages by using high-level string-processing concepts, such as those in SNOBOL 4 and Icon. EZ has particularly simple data abstractions that attempt to bridge the gap between the data abstractions of <b>command</b> <b>languages</b> and those of programming languages. This is accomplished by type fusion, which pushes the differences between some classes of types, such as strings and text files, out of the language and into the implementation. The language, its use, and its implementation are described...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the early}} {{examples}} of such a system was [...] Lotus Development's DataLens, initially known as Blueprint.

Unlike the later ODBC, Blueprint was a purely code-based system, lacking anything approximating a <b>command</b> <b>language</b> like SQL. Instead, programmers used data structures to store the query information, constructing a query by linking many of these structures together. Lotus referred to these compound structures as query trees.|$|E
