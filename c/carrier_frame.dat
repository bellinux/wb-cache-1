50|$|Lautering is the {{separation}} of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a <b>carrier</b> <b>frame</b> like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates {{at each end of the}} structure.

Unlike previous approaches that require maximal weight scheduling or target simple MAC protocols without hidden terminals, our problem formulation considers a realistic IEEE 802. 11 -based MAC layer model. The resulting formulation being non-convex, we propose a simple scheme to transform this non-convex problem into a convex one. We derive a simple distributed algorithm to solve the problem via Lagrangian dual decomposition.

In our UAS landing experiments, two cameras placed {{on both sides}} of the runway are used to capture the moving UAS. When the UAS is captured, the joint algorithm uses frame difference to detect the moving target (UAS). As soon as the Faster R-CNN algorithm accurately detects the UAS, the detection priority is given to Faster R-CNN. In this manner, we also perform motion segmentation and object detection in the presence of changes in the environment, such as illumination variation or “walking persons”. By combining the 2 algorithms we can accurately detect and track objects with a tracking accuracy rate of up to 99 % and a frame per second of up to 40 Hz.

A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating <b>carrier</b> <b>frame,</b> which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Planet bearings are susceptible to skidding at low input torque...|$|E

His main works in this area include: integrated gradient method for finding the global extremum of functionals on many variables; method for solving multiobjective optimization problems; overdetermined contour collocation method for solving boundary problems in the theory of plates and shells; compilation methods for solving nonlinear problems of the theory of constructions. A cycle of his work devoted to the creation of direct design methods, well-founded principles of new energy, is the basis of the formation of constructions with a simple external and complex internal geometry. Based on them, the following were created and implemented: architectural construction systems RAMPA, IKAR, DOBOL, intended for housing and civil engineering; a family of gantry and bridge cranes up to 800 tons, etc. Architectural construction system RAMPA (abbreviation: panel frame) is an alternative to panel housing and is intended for the design and construction of five to six story residential buildings, hotel complexes, facilities of social and cultural purpose, health protection facilities, three to four story garage parking for automobile motor transport, cottages, health resorts and other facilities of housing and civil purposes. It was built on the principle of the organic compound of the best qualities of carcass and frameless systems (Fig. 1). The basis of the architectural and construction system RAMPA is a catalogue of its products made of precast reinforced concrete. At the same time, the catalogue has a limited set of elements that generate an infinitely large variability of their combination into dimensional compositions. These elements include flat panel frames and floor panels. Panels of slab together with the frames are the basic framework elements, which are being built according to the principle of children’s erector set. Four orthogonally jointed frames and two panels of slab create a «cube», which allows free jointing with other structural cells. A cellular regular or irregular, but nevertheless, fractal structure resulting from joining of the «cubes», is in some sense similar to the bionic <b>carrier</b> <b>frames.</b> At the same time, the use of conventional or lightweight reinforced concrete is limited only by bearing elements.

40|$|Abstract-A turbo code codec is {{implemented}} as {{a portion of}} a modem in a software radio. The performance of this software radio is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation and on a hardware testbed. The codec uses two punctured rate 1 / 2 constituent codes and a 16383 -bit pseudo-random interleaver to produce a net rate ~ 1 / 2 turbo code. The modem generates a binary phaseshift keyed modulation on a 200 kHz <b>carrier.</b> <b>Frame</b> headers are inserted between interleaver blocks for synchronization of the receiver’s deinterleaver and to detect loss of carrier or symbol synchronization. Bit error rate performance curves are reported. The Monte Carlo simulation shows an implementation loss of about 0. 5 dB at threshold (i. e., an E b/N o of about 1 dB). This implementation loss is attributed to carrier and bit synchronization errors. The hardware testbed displayed a total implementation loss of about 2. 5 dB. The additional 2 dB loss over the Monte Carlo results can be attributed to detector mismatch and inter-symbol interference caused by unmodeled band-limiting filters of the hardware. Some of these filterinduced losses should be recoverable if an equalizer is added to the modem software. I...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} question in studying speech production is whether articulations {{are the result}} of pre-planned movement patterns or whether on-line sensory feedback is used to help guide the movements. Many previous studies addressing this issue have returned conflicting results. One extreme theoretical position is that every detail of an articulatory movement is planned out well before execution, so that little on-line adjustment is needed. At the other extreme one may argue that planning goes only as far as some canonical form of the underlying articulatory target, and the implementation of the underlying targets is done with continual guidance and correction directed by sensory feedback. The pitch-shift auditory feedback paradigm developed in recent years (Burnett et al., 1998; Hain et al., 2000; Larson et al., 1995) presents a convenient tool for providing answers to questions concerning articulatory planning and the role of sensory feedback in speech production.

40|$|The work {{described}} {{here has been}} {{the development of a}} technique for fabrication of absorber patterns made of tungsten. Highly adhesive low stress tungsten layers of several micrometer thickness have been made by magnetron sputtering and subsequently patterned by reactive ion etching. Then the titanium layer together with the tungsten patterns is transferred to a <b>carrier</b> <b>frame.</b> The advantages of the subtractive patterning process of a tungsten film include good adhesion, even of tiny absorber patterns, on the mask carrier foil and the homogeneous thickness of the absorber independent of the line width across the whole mask area. As the film is deposited and patterned under vacuum conditions, less defect density can be achieved. Using the substractive process absorber patterns of only 0. 5 #mu#m width have been fabricated which are 2 mm long and 2. 5 #mu#m in height. To achieve X-ray masks with small distortions of the absorber patterns tungsten films with little internal stresses must be prepared. Low stress tungsten films with isotropic stress distribution have been manufactured by rotation of the substrates during film application. Vertical absorber structures have been prepared by reactive ion etching with both CF_ 4 and SF_ 6 as etching gases. The addition of oxygen to the etching gases improves the selectivity of etching from tungsten to titanium so that {{there is no need for}} an additional etch stopping film. Nickel has been used as masking material in reactive patterning; it excels by minimum removal rates, especially in SF_ 6 etching in the range of high generator powers. (orig.) Dissertation of K.

40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A cable drawn farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move irrigation structure as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine <b>carrier</b> <b>frame</b> and attachment structural requirements. An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An automatic cable gripping device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers.

Now we intend to emphasize the latest developments and extended application areas of the system. Due to the increasing demand of the transportation authorities for rapid, accurate data acquisition about the road pavement, a mobile mapping system has been developed primarily for road surface detection. Our system involves a data archiving and system control unit (notebook), an imaging unit (two industrial cameras), a positioning unit (combined GPS/IMU system with built-in Kalman filtering), a marker unit (point-projection by laser diode array) and the mobile platform (pickup with special <b>carrier</b> <b>frame</b> and specified power supply). The first reported results were about creating the digital road surface model and detecting the cracks on the pavement. The system is now in test-phase at the road maintenance company of Budapest city (Municipal Public Service); during the practical tests several new demands have been raised. For the complex transportation management (scheduling road construction works, reconstruction etc.) the roads have to be classified into coarse categories. Therefore the resulted digital surface model has to be transformed into basic numeric form. Internationally, the so-called IRI (International Roughness Index) is used to represent the road condition. Besides the digital surface model of the road pavement, the INS measurements can be used without the images to derive data that indicate the pavement condition. Our experiments showed that vertical acceleration and the roll/pitch values are strongly correlated with the road roughness and waviness. Based on the single INS measurements, the roads can be classified into categories, our tests and initial results are also discussed in the paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVery early {{times in}} the order of 2 - 3 s {{from the end of the}} {{turn-off}} ramp for time-domain electromagnetic systems are crucial for obtaining a detailed resolution of the near-surface geology in the depth interval 0 - 20 m. For transient electromagnetic systems working in the off time, an electric current is abruptly turned off in a large transmitter loop causing a secondary electromagnetic field to be generated by the eddy currents induced in the ground. Often, however, there is still a residual primary field generated by remaining slowly decaying currents in the transmitter loop. The decay disturbs or biases the earth response data at the very early times. These biased data must be culled, or some specific processing must be applied in order to compensate or remove the residual primary field. As the bias response can be attributed to decaying currents with its time constantly controlled by the geometry of the transmitter loop, we denote it the Coil Response'. The modelling of a helicopter-borne time-domain system by an equivalent electronic circuit shows that the time decay of the coil response remains identical whatever the position of the receiver loop, which is confirmed by field measurements. The modelling also shows that the coil response has a theoretical zero location and positioning the receiver coil at the zero location eliminates the coil response completely. However, spatial variations of the coil response around the zero location are not insignificant and even a few cm deformation of the <b>carrier</b> <b>frame</b> will introduce a small coil response. Here we present an approach for subtracting the coil response from the data by measuring it at high altitudes and then including an extra shift factor into the inversion scheme. The scheme is successfully applied to data from the SkyTEM system and enables the use of very early time gates, as early as 2 - 3 s from the end of the ramp, or 5 - 6 s from the beginning of the ramp. Applied to a large-scale airborne electromagnetic survey, the coil response compensation provides airborne electromagnetic methods with a hitherto unseen good resolution of shallow geological layers in the depth interval 0 - 20 m. This is proved by comparing results from the airborne electromagnetic survey to more than 100 km of Electrical Resistivity Tomography measured with 5 m electrode spacing...|$|E

Through the design of a versatile glucoside key intermediate, bearing terminal azido groups useful in several coupling schemes, a new, fluorescently-labelled CyPLOS analog has been synthesized, found to be a more active ion transporter than the previously prepared congeners and allowing a detailed investigation on its mechanism of action and localization within the phospholipid bilayers...|$|R
