A dry version of the PSU–NCAR Mesoscale Model is used to first investigate the dynamic aspects of the interaction. A deceleration of about 2 m s 21 and then more northward movement, similar to that observed for Typhoon Robyn, could have been produced by an interaction with the mesoscale convective vortex of the type modeled in the control run.

40|$|Rapid, {{effective}} {{separation of}} phases {{is an essential}} step in many hydrocarbon conversion gas-solid processes. In heavy oil upgrading, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and biomass pyrolysis, for example, very fast separation of reacting gases from catalytic or heat-bearing solids is required to inhibit further reaction. The primary functions of a rapid separator {{in the context of}} a gas-solid flow are, first, to terminate contact between the reacting gases and the catalytic or hot solid particles and, second, to recover the isolated product vapors. Uninterrupted vapor-solid contact results in degraded, overcracked and generally less valuable products. Increasing interest in rapid separation has led in the past 25 years to a wide variety of proposed separator designs in the literature. Centrifugal separation is the fundamental principle underlying cyclone operation and most rapid gas-solid <b>separation</b> processes. Traditional <b>cyclones</b> rely on centrifugal separation and are very widely applicable. They are used for the removal of solid particulate matter from gas or liquid streams, for gas demisting, and in hydrocyclones. Most FCC processes employ traditional cyclone configurations for secondary and tertiary separation. The review briefly summarizes important topics studied in reverse flow cyclone operation. For initial separation, however, most fast gas-solid separators in the literature feature only partial <b>cyclone</b> layouts. <b>Separation</b> typically occurs more quickly in these devices relative to traditional cyclones, likely at the expense of separation efficiency. The current review places emphasis on experimental results and novel separation techniques in the context of fast gas-solid separation. Several recent methods of rapid gas-solid separation employ co-current or 2 ̆ 2 uniflow 2 ̆ 2 centrifugal arrangements. Hence, particular attention is directed to co-current centrifugal separators. These devices have been studied much less intensively than their reverse flow counterparts. Fast co-current separators, with their novel, partial cyclone layouts, are interesting for their performance characteristics in relation to popular commercial designs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the most common reverse flow type of cyclones where the flow enters the cyclone through a tangential inlet and leaves via an axial outlet pipe {{at the top of}} the cyclone. Numerical computations of two different cyclones were based on the so-called Stairmand cyclone. The difference in geometry between these two cyclones was basically characterized by the geometrical swirl number Sg of 3. 5 and 4. Turbulent secondary flows inside a straight square channel have been studied numerically by using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in order to verify the implementation process. Prandtl’s secondary motion calculated by LES shows satisfying agreement with both, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and experimental results. Numerical calculations were carried out at various axial positions and at the apex cone of a gas cyclone separator. Two different NS-solvers (a commercial one, and a research code), based on a pressure correction algorithm of the SIMPLE method have been applied to predict the flow behavior. The flow was assumed as unsteady, incompressible and isothermal. A k − epsilon turbulence model has been applied first using the commercial code to investigate the gas flow. Due to the nature of cyclone flows, which exhibit highly curved streamlines and anisotropic turbulence, advanced turbulence models such as RSM (Reynolds Stress Model) and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) have been used as well. The RSM simulation was performed using the commercial package CFX 4. 4, while for the LES calculations the research code MISTRAL/PartFlow- 3 D code developed in our multiphase research group has been applied utilizing the Smagorinsky model. It was found that the k − epsilon model cannot predict flow phenomena inside the cyclone properly due to the strong curvature of the streamlines. The RSM results are comparable with LES results in the area of the apex cone plane. However, the application of the LES reveals qualitative agreement with the experimental data, but requires higher computer capacity and longer running times than RSM. These calculations of the continuous phase flow were the basis for modeling the behavior of the solid particles in the cyclone separator. Particle trajectories, pressure drop and the <b>cyclone</b> <b>separation</b> efficiency have been studied in some detail. This thesis is organized into five chapters. After an introduction and overview, chapter 2 deals with continuous phase flow turbulence modeling including the governing equations. The emphasis will be based on LES modelling.

Using Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) and mixed multiphase flow model (Mixture) of FLUENT (fluid calculation software) and combined with the constitutive equation of apparent viscosity of non-Newtonian fluid, the typical non-Newtonian fluid (drilling fluid, polymer flooding sewage and crude oil as medium) and Newton flow field (water as medium) were compared by quantitative analysis. Based on the research results of water, the effects of non-Newtonian rheology on the key parameters including the combined vortex motion index n and tangential velocity were analyzed. The study shows that: non-Newtonian rheology has a great effect on tangential velocity and n value, and tangential velocity decreases with non-Newtonian increasing. The three kinds of n values (constant segment) are: 0. 564 (water), 0. 769 (polymer flooding sewage), 0. 708 (drilling fluid) and their variation amplitudes are larger than Newtonian fluid. The same time, non-Newtonian rheology will lead to the phenomenon of turbulent drag reduction in the vortex flow field.

The interaction between particles and the gas phase was also taken into account. The numerical simulation results were {{in agreement with the}} experimental data. The simulation revealed that an unsteady spiral dust strand appeared near the cyclone wall and a non-axi-symmetrical dust ring appeared in the annular space and under the cover plate of the cyclone.

The axial distribution of particle concentration in the inner swirling flow (r/R⩽ 0.3) region showed that there existed serious fine particle entrainment within the height of 0.5 D above the dust discharge port and a short-cut flow at a distance of about 0.25 D below the entrance of the vortex finder.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an exploratory experimental and theoretical study of gasification of wood powder in a cyclone gasifier. The generated gas {{could be used}} to operate a gas turbine in a combined cyclone power plant. The objective has been to develop the understanding of cyclone gasification by experimental studies of the performance of a cyclone designed in principle as a <b>separation</b> <b>cyclone</b> and by comparisons between the experimental results and theoretical predictions. The experiments were carried out with commercial Swedish wood powder fuels, injected with air or steam/air mixture through two diametrically opposite tangential inlets and gasified at atmospheric pressure in cyclones of two different configurations with a volume of about 0. 034 m 3. The studies show that stable gasification of this fuel can be obtained for a specific fuel feeding rate of about 5 MW/m 3 cyclone volume for equivalence ratios above 0. 15 and that the equivalence ratio had to be kept below about 0. 4 in order to avoid material temperatures above 950 oC. A cyclone with a short outlet pipe, designed as a conventional <b>separation</b> <b>cyclone</b> was found to give lower char conversion than a modified cyclone with a long outlet pipe. The heating value of the gas was found to be approximately 4. 5 MJ/kg. The dust load in the product gas was measured to between 1000 and 2500 mg/Nm 3. It was possible to separate at least 40 - 60 % of the potassium and 60 - 90 % of the sodium supplied with the wood. The alkali that left the cyclone with the product gas appear to be in solid or melted phase in the unseparated char particles and consequently not vaporised during gasification. As the K and Na were assumed to remain within the particles during gasification, it was concluded that {{to reduce the amount of}} alkali metals in the product gas it would be necessary to improve the particle separation efficiency. The results of the theoretical modelling, using the existing models in the commercial software CFX 4. 2, show with 3 -dimensional modelling of the cyclone flow that RSM turbulence models give better agreement between predicted and observed velocity distributions than k-e models. Nevertheless, the latter give acceptable predictions as regards particle separation. Comparisons between predicted and experimental performance of cyclone gasifiers show that the heating value is over-predicted and the carbon conversion and alkali carry over are under-predicted. The results show that further development of the theoretical models is necessary. Godkänd; 1999; 20061117 (haneit...|$|R

This thesis has evaluated the performance of waste water incineration through a case study at AkzoNobel in Stenungsund. The primary aim of the process is the destruction of ammonia present in the waste water and ventilation gas feed streams. Secondary focus is to reduce the formation of NOx in the process. The waste water incineration process consists of two evaporators, one furnace, one dust <b>cyclone,</b> a <b>separation</b> step containing one quench and one separation unit, and lastly one electrostatic filter before the flue gases are emitted to the atmosphere via a flue gas fan and a stack. The evaluation was performed in three parts. The first part included mapping mass balances of the incinerator and the important units. The balances were based on real time data from the process. In the second part a chemical reaction modelling software was used to make a sensitivity analysis for the operating parameters with respect to the NOx formation. The third part consisted of experimental tests varying a set of parameters that were run over a period of around six days. The result of the mapping shows that the mass balance may be completed. The modeling results indicates that the most important parameters are temperature, amount of excess air and amount of water fed to the furnace. The Experimental test results are consistent with both literature and modeling outcome. The conclusion from this thesis work is that high temperature and high oxygen levels yields a low ammonia slip but increase the amount of NO formed. On the other hand, low temperatures and low oxygen levels gives low levels of NO but increase the amount of un-reacted ammonia in the stack. The flow of direct water also has a large effect on the performance of the furnace.

The model considers an analogy between the mass transfer chemical processes and some of the ore beneficiation mechanical processes, configuring a new macrophenomenological interpretation for them. The model aims at establishing new theoretical bases for phenomena taking place in operations such as: Comminution (grinding, crushing) and Separation with Mass Concentration (gravity <b>separation,</b> magnetic <b>separation,</b> <b>cyclones,</b> froth flotation, etc.). In the chemical industry, the direct operations yield two phases from a solution of one phase alone for example by means of the application or extraction of heat (the fractionated distillation and the fractionated crystallization belong to this type).

The meshed cyclone was then transferred into FLUENT software for simulation, where all the boundary condition is programmed in the software. After simulation completed, the data was then extracted and converted in the function of cyclone collection efficiency and pressure drop. The results show the influence of inlet velocity and exit tube size on cyclone performance and significant conclusion were made. The performances of turbulence model used in the simulation were then compared...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{behavior}} in hydrocyclone is quite complex. This complexity of fluid flow in a cyclone is basically {{due to the}} fact flow in cyclone is a swirling turbulent multiphase flow. A multiphase CFD model with individual sub models for the air-core, turbulence, and particle classification was used to simulate the various hydrocyclones. The predicted velocity field from the LES, DRSM turbulence models is compared with LDA measurements of Hsieh (1988) data for 75 mm cyclone. The LES with the modified Mixture model, particles with a feed size distribution is seems to promising in predicting classification curve accurately. Further the CFD model validation is attempted to compare with Renner (1976) data which was originally measured using high-speed sampling probe at different precisely controlled positions. A CFD multi-phase case was set-up with the same 6 inch cyclone design (Renner 1976) and operating conditions. The overall classification curve predicts close to the experimental data. From the validation of CFD with the Renner (1976) data it was observed that the predicted position sample size distributions are reasonably comparable with experimental data nearby wall positions and at bottom cone section, but considerably differ at nearby forced vortex region, and also nearby tip of vortex finder wall locations. Close to the forced vortex (inner position), the discrepancy between measured and predicted size distributions are large. This may be an effect of sampling turbulence due to probing the sample close to the unstable forced vortex. Usually the forced vortex is stable with an air-core formation. The CFD model shows no air-core formation at this low operating pressure, which suggests an un-usual/un-stable forced vortex based <b>cyclone</b> <b>separation</b> in this particular experiment...|$|E
40|$|In a fast {{pyrolysis}} {{process for the}} conversion of biomass into liquid and gas products, {{the role of the}} phase separation unit is critical to ensure the efficiency product recovery is high. For the pyrolysis system developed at Fakulti Kejuruteraan Kimia & Sumber Asli (FKKSA) Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP), the separation unit is designed with a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separation</b> system. Vapor product from the cyclone will enter condenser system to convert into liquid product. The collection efficiency of a cyclone separator depends on several factors including design parameters, such as dimensions of the cyclone separator, particle density, and operating temperature. The physical properties of fluid, namely the density and viscosity, and operating parameters such as the inlet velocity of the fluid into the cyclone and the outlet conditions also affect the cyclone efficiency. In this work, the effect of the particle size and temperature will be studied {{in order to get a}} higher efficiency of the separation process of cyclone system. Manual calculations of the collection efficiency were compared to the result of collection efficiency from CFD-Fluent simulation. It was found that the error is about 3. 55 %. Result shows that the increase of temperature vapor inside the cyclone system and particle size will decrease the separation of the cyclone system. As the temperature increase the air viscosity and density of the particle will decrease and it will lead to the lower separation efficiency of cyclone. This is same with particle size where separation efficiency decrease as the particle size increase due to the many of incomplete particle and most of the particle are stick to the cyclone wall and not being separated...|$|E
40|$|A {{tremendous}} amount of wet flue-gas desulfurization scrubber sludge (estimated 20 million metric tons {{per year in the}} US) is currently being landfilled at a huge cost to utility companies. Scrubber sludge is the solid precipitate produced during desulfurization of flue-gas from burning high sulfur coal. The amount of this sludge is expected to increase in the near future due to ever increasing governmental regulation concerning the amount of sulfur emissions. Scrubber sludge is a fine, grey colored powder that contains calcium sulfite hemihydrate (CaSO{sub 3 } {center_dot} 1 / 2 H{sub 2 }), calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 2 H{sub 2 }O), limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }), silicates, and iron oxides. This material can continue to be landfilled at a steadily increasing cost, or an alternative for utilizing this material can be developed. This study explores the characteristics of a naturally oxidized wet flue-gas desulfurization scrubber sludge and uses these characteristics to develop alternatives for recycling this material. In order for scrubber sludge {{to be used as a}} feed material for various markets, it was necessary to process it to meet the specifications of these markets. A physical separation process was therefore needed to separate the components of this sludge into useful products at a low cost. There are several physical separation techniques available to separate fine particulates. These techniques can be divided into four major groups: magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, physico-chemical separation, and density-based separation. The properties of this material indicated that two methods of separation were feasible: water-only <b>cycloning</b> (density-based <b>separation),</b> and froth flotation (physico-chemical separation). These processes could be used either separately, or in combination. The goal of this study was to reduce the limestone impurity in this scrubber sludge from 5. 6 % by weight to below 2. 0 % by weight. The resulting clean calcium sulfite/sulfate material can be oxidized into a synthetic gypsum that can be used in several markets which include: wallboard manufacturing, plaster, portland cement, and as a soil conditioner. Single stage water-only cycloning removed nearly 50 % of the limestone by weight from the scrubber sludge and maintained a weight recovery of 76 %. Froth flotation produced a calcium sulfite/sulfate that contained 4. 30 % limestone by weight with a 71 % weight recovery. These methods were successful in removing some of the limestone impurity, but were not able to meet the specifications needed. However, the combination of water-only cycloning and froth flotation provided a clean, useful calcium sulfite/sulfate material with a limestone grade of 1. 70 % by weight and a total weight recovery of nearly 66 %...|$|R
40|$|Operation of biofilters for piggery {{and poultry}} shed odour control in Korea, {{and in other}} parts of the world, has often been {{problematic}} for two reasons. Firstly, excessive dust in the incoming air can cause clogging of the organic biofilter material. Secondly, drying out of the organic biofilter can occur if the relative humidity of the incoming air is not close to 100 %. Dust is generated in sheds from the feed and bedding materials, and also dried out manure residue which is disturbed by animal movements. This is worse in hot dry summer conditions but may also be exacerbated in cold winter conditions where shed heating is used. Dust loadings from sheds are typically 1 mg/m 3 but may exceed 10 mg/m 3. Dust particles may vary in size from less than 1 µm to more than 100 µm, with typically half the volume of the dust is less than 10 µm in size. For bacteria on the biofilm to be healthy and actively reduced odour, the humidity of air spaces inside an organic biofilter material should be as close to 100 % as possible. This is achieved if the overall water content of the organic biofilter material is maintained at approximately 25 % w/w. If the air entering an organic biofilter has lower than 100 % humidity, the effect will be to dry out the organic biofilter material and the biofilm. The drier this air is, the more water is required to be sprayed onto the material and this may lead to poor organic biofilter performance. The combined effects of dust and water together often leads to clogging causing inhomogeneous flow, preferential flow channelling, poor utilisation of all of the organic biofilter medium and reductions in odour removal efficiency. This can result in a significant decrease in the effective life of the organic biofilter medium. Replacement is expensive and inconvenient to do on a regular basis. Recommended methods for air preconditioning are therefore :- 1) 	<b>Cyclone</b> Dust <b>Separation</b> (CDS) for coarse (> 10 µm) dust removal 2) 	Trickling Biofiltration (TBF) for fine (< 10 µm) dust removal, odour pre-treatment and humidification It may be necessary to use multiple cyclones with a small diameter to remove fine particles (less than 10 µm). Multiclones can be manufactured at relatively low cost and there are no moving parts so maintenance costs are minimal. Typical dust loadings are unlikely due cause clogging of the multiclone. Multiclones are therefore appropriate technology for intensive livestock industries. Trickling biofilters are also easy and cheap to construct, the only component of significant cost being the flow controller units. As the trickling biofilter material is inorganic, water flushing can be relatively heavy and continuous to flushout and remove dust build-up. This should lead to an essentially maintenance free dust elimination process. Relative humidity of the organic biofilter incoming air should also be close to 100 %...|$|R
40|$|Reverse flow {{cyclones}} {{are used}} most {{extensively in the}} chemical process industries for gas - solid <b>separation.</b> <b>Cyclones</b> are often employed to collect large particles (> 5 Ilm) {{that can be used}} not only as an air pollution control device, but also for recover particulate matter and size separation of particles. Common features found in locally designed cyclones are ineffective and crudely designed. Design of cyclone is more towards realizing a shape of the cyclone than the performance. Customized design approach gives a cyclone with greater collection efficiency, smaller in size or with lower pressure drop that would be found for a conventional standard design. Since the customized design procedure requires trial and error calculations, this research focused on the importance of the development of a computer package: "CycDesign". Using this package, a pilot scale reverse flow cyclone is designed and fabricated. This unit was used to examine the suitability of abating the air pollution caused due to dust generated from the fluidized bed dryers in tea industries. Trials were also done for sawdust, cement, quarry dust, talc powder and silica sand. Inlet and outlet particle size distributions were measured. Above 90 % Overall collection efficiencies were attained for all the types of dust tested. For tea dust 99. 2 % collected experimentally which was predicted as 100 % by the computer package. Also the computer package can be used to predict performance and dimensionless parameters for a cyclone design. It predicts that a continual decrease of Stokes number based on cut diameter, with increasing Reynolds number Re, for cyclones having different height to diameter ratio HID. According to predictions, collection efficiency increases with HID ratio of the cyclone. The declining patterns of fractional efficiency can be visualized with decreasing pressure drop across the cyelone and particle density. A decrease in fractional efficiency can be observed with the increasing of gas flow rate, gas temperature, and gas density...|$|R
