Stalin was an MLA in 1989 and 1996 when his father Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, and became Chennai's 44th mayor in 1996. In 2009, he was made the Deputy Chief Minister.|$|E
25|$|By nightfall, the Anzac Mounted Division {{had fought}} {{their way into}} the streets of Gaza, {{suffering}} very few casualties during this advance. While the attack in the centre by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was progressing, the 22nd Mounted Brigade had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the New Zealanders' left, and it was this attacking force that entered the town. Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had met stiff resistance from defenders holding entrenchments in the sand hills to the northwest of the town. Closest to the Mediterranean coast, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) met considerable opposition, but was eventually able to advance close up to the town.|$|E

25|$|The British had {{suffered}} no casualties and damage to their three frigates was light, most damage being to masts and rigging. South Carolina had {{a crew of}} about 466 men when captured, of whom she had lost six killed and eight wounded. Hope had 42 crewmen. Constance, with another thirty men, bought {{the total number of}} American prisoners to nearly 530. Fifty German and eight British prisoners that the Americans had recruited out of captivity in Philadelphia were released as they had once served as soldiers in General John Burgoyne's army. Because of the number of men involved, the British treated their American prisoners strictly, locking them under hatches not allowing more than two to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The game uses several {{different}} level types and layouts. The game starts {{out in a}} front yard, and progresses to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.|$|E
25|$|The Army of Italy was {{fortunate}} in having capable generals. Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon led {{the left wing}} while Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the right wing. Both became Marshals of France under Napoleon along with Joubert's chief of staff Louis Gabriel Suchet and division commander Emmanuel Grouchy. Joubert's generals wished to wait for Championnet's army to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their left around 20 August before advancing. However, Joubert believed that his orders to attack from the Directory were imperative and refused to delay. Saint-Cyr's wing moved north through the Bocchetta Pass and Gavi. At Serravalle Scrivia they besieged a castle held by four companies of Austrians. This position had been captured by Pyotr Bagration's 2,100-man Russian advance guard as recently as 9 August. Pérignon's wing had farther to march. This French column pushed some of Bellegarde's troops out of Terzo then swung east through Acqui Terme, Rivalta Bormida and Capriata d'Orba. Saint-Cyr arrived alone at Novi Ligure on 13 August, but Suvorov declined to attack, hoping to lure the French into the plains where his superior cavalry and artillery might prove decisive. That same day contact was established with Pérignon's approaching troops.|$|E

500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] long, [...] wide {{elevated}} road project connecting the port with Maduravoyal {{is under construction}} {{at a cost of}} [...] 16,550 million. Upon completion, this will be the country's longest four-way elevated expressway. The project was sanctioned in June 2007, and the foundation stone was laid in January 2009. The expressway starts from Gate No. 10 of the Chennai Port near the War Memorial and ends before Maduravoyal Interchange. It would run {{along the banks of the}} Cooum up to Koyambedu and would end along the Cooum near the Koyambedu grade separator. From there for a distance of three km up to Maduravoyal the elevated expressway would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Poonamallee High Road. There would be a total of four entry and exit ramps as part of the project. While the entry ramps would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Sivananda Salai and College Road, the exit points would be provided on Spurtank Road and Kamaraj Salai. The work at the Maduravoyal end began in December 2010. The project was initially expected to be completed by end of 2013. However, the project had been put on hold for years. In February 2014, the Madras High Court quashed the stop-work order of the state PWD and ordered the completion of the project.|$|E

The review of the concert in Manchester said it was [...] "shambolic" [...] and a [...] "car crash" [...] with Tricky often leaving the stage and continuously forgetting his words, leaving Topley Bird to carry the delivery of the tracks, resulting in many leaving early after repeated issues with Tricky's behaviour and shouts of [...] "wanker" [...] from the crowd.|$|E
