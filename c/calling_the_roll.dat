60|$|Almost out {{of breath}} with running, the hazers came into camp, {{accompanied}} by Hans and Tubbs. Masks, caps, and horns were pushed out of sight under cots, and then all sallied forth to join their various commands. <b>Calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> was already in progress.|$|E
60|$|On <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> {{after the}} action was over, {{it was found that}} the loss {{suffered}} by the gun-boat crew was two men killed and eighteen wounded--a very small number considering the time during which the affair had lasted, and the vigour with which the pirates had fought.|$|E
60|$|The 'tump-tump' of the puntabouts {{before the}} sides settled to games {{came through the}} open window. Winton, like his House-Master, loved fresh air. Then they heard Paddy Vernon, {{sub-prefect}} on duty, <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> {{in the field and}} marking defaulters. Winton wrote steadily. King curled himself up on a desk, hands round knees. One would have said that the man was gloating over the boy's misfortune, but the boy understood.|$|E

Fourteen chambers use a traditional manual roll-call system in which <b>the</b> clerk <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> orally, records each member's vote on paper, and then tallies the ayes and nays. Twelve chambers use a hybrid system in which <b>the</b> clerk orally <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll,</b> but each member's vote is then entered into a system.|$|R

60|$|The {{ground was}} indeed {{unfavorable}} for cavalry, and artillery. It was {{broken up with}} the spurs of the hill. Here and there great masses of rock cropped out of the ground, while patches of forest extended over a considerable portion of the ground. In one of these, standing upon rising and broken ground, Major Tempe halted his men; and opened so heavy a fire upon the enemy's cavalry, when the column appeared, that they were at once halted; and although, when the artillery arrived, a few shells were fired into the wood, the franc tireurs had already retired, and gained the forest without further molestation. Upon <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll,</b> {{it was discovered that}} six men, only, were missing. These had fallen--either killed or wounded--from the fire of the enemy's infantry, during the time that the operation at the bridge were being carried out.|$|E
6000|$|A {{professor}} of mathematics once brought a rowdy student {{from the back}} benches to a seat beside him, because: [...] "First, you'll be near the board; second, you'll be near me; and, third, you'll be near the door." [...] Chrystal soon discovered that students could be too near the door, and he took to <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> {{in the middle of}} the hour, which insured an increased attendance. It was a silent class, nothing heard but the patter of pencils, rats scraping for grain, of which there was abundance, but not one digestion in a bench. To smuggle in a novel up one's waistcoat was perilous, Chrystal's spectacles doing their work. At a corner of the platform sat the assistant, with a constable's authority, but, not formed for swooping, uneasy because he had legs, and where to put them he knew not. He got through the hour by shifting his position every five minutes; and, sitting there waiting, he reminded one of the boy who, on being told to remain so quietly where he was that he could hear a pin drop, held his breath a moment, then shouted, [...] "Let it drop!" [...] An excellent fellow was this assistant, who told us that one of his predecessors had got three months.|$|E
60|$|The doorkeepers, {{who must}} have been inspired, had already slammed the doors {{in the faces of}} those seeking wildly to escape. The clerk already had the little, short-legged desk before him and was <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> with {{incredible}} rapidity. Bewildered and excited as Wetherell was, and knowing as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed the woodchuck session, he began to form some sort of a notion of Jethro's generalship, and he saw that the innocent rural members who belonged to Duncan and Lovejoy's faction had tried to get away before the roll-call, destroy the quorum, and so adjourn the House. These, needless to say, were not parliamentarians, either. They had lacked a leader, they were stunned by the suddenness of the onslaught, and had not moved quickly enough. Like trapped animals, they wandered blindly about for a few moments, and then sank down anywhere. Each answered the roll-call sullenly, out of necessity, for every {{one of them was a}} marked man. Then Wetherell remembered the two members who had escaped, and Mr. Duncan, and fell to calculating how long it would take these to reach Fosters Opera House, break into the middle of an act, and get out enough partisans to come back and kill the bill. Mr. Wetherell began to wish he could witness the scene there, too, but something held him here, shaking with excitement, listening to each name that the clerk called.|$|E

60|$|The {{house was}} quite dark, like its neighbours, and yet {{after a few}} taps, he heard a {{movement}} overhead, a door opening, and a cautious voice asking who was there. The poet named himself in a loud whisper, and waited, not without some trepidation, the result. Nor had he to wait long. A window was suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops splashed down upon the doorstep. Villon had not been unprepared for something of the sort, and had put himself as much in shelter as {{the nature of the}} porch admitted; but for all that, he was deplorably drenched below the waist. His hose began to freeze almost at once. Death from cold and exposure stared him in the face; he remembered he was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing tentatively. But the gravity of the danger steadied his nerves. He stopped a few hundred yards from the door where he had been so rudely used, and reflected with his finger to his nose. He could only see one way of getting a lodging, and that was to take it. He had noticed a house not far away, which looked as if it might be easily broken into, and thither he betook himself promptly, entertaining himself on the way {{with the idea of a}} room still hot, with a table still loaded with the remains of supper, where he might pass the rest of the black hours, and whence he should issue, on the morrow, with an armful of valuable plate. He even considered on what viands and what wines he should prefer; and as he was <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> of his favourite dainties, roast fish presented itself to his mind with an odd mixture of amusement and horror.|$|E

5000|$|In contrast, the British artist Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler) {{explained}} that she [...] "never painted for the glory of war, but to portray its pathos and heroism." [...] The aftermath of battle was depicted in paintings like <b>Calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roll</b> After An Engagement, Crimea, which displayed at the Royal Academy in 1874. This perspective is also seen in Remnants of an Army which showed William Brydon struggling into Jalalabad on a dying horse. Dr. Brydon was the sole survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, in which 16,000 were massacred by Afghan tribesmen.|$|E
50|$|He was {{the first}} RMC cadet to attend the staff college course at Camberly (1895). He joined the 2nd Battalion of the Cheshire {{regiment}}. He served with his regiment and on the staff in India and Burma, often in instructional positions. He was fond of climbing and shooting tigers. He was an energetic man of great physical endurance who possessed an almost boyish enthusiasm. Lieutenant Colonel Taylor served as the sixth Commandant at RMC, (1905-9). At the time, about 80 cadets were in training. Cadets had to pass a competitive examination on entering, with half-yearly examinations afterwards to obtain diplomas. Although the college was organized on a strictly military basis, a thoroughly practical and complete course of study in civil engineering, civil and hydro-graphic surveying, physics, chemistry, French and English was provided. The practice of gymnastic drills and outdoor exercises of all kinds ensured good health and fine physical condition. Five commissions in the imperial army were awarded yearly to the cadets who stand highest. The length of the course was three years, in three terms of {{nine and a half}} months' residence each. The total cost of the course, including board, uniform, instructional material and all extras, was from $750 to $1,000. As Commandant, he indicated the difficulty involved if RMC graduates who did not take a commission in the British army or Canadian Permanent Active Force were required to serve for a stated time in the Non-Permanent Active Force. This compulsory military service would be difficult since graduates did not always live near militia units. He recommended that graduates be posted to a unit of their choice rather than simply be placed on the reserve of officers. In 1906, the practice began at the RMC club annual dinner of <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> by having each member rise in place in turn and announce their college number and name in order of seniority. In 1907, the loving cup was circulated for the first time around the table at the RMC club annual dinner. Although Taylor retired in 1916, he commanded the labour corps in France in 1917.|$|E
40|$|The {{odd couple}} {{partnership}} of Senator Edmund S. Muskie and President Lyndon B. Johnson {{in the passage}} of the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 is a story with several subplots and insights into their different approaches to the art of democratic governance. For Senator Muskie, the president’s proposal was based on valid concepts, but he doubted the legislation’s viability in the Senate and he had serious reservations about its timeliness and capacity to address the problems the legislation was supposed to solve. The President was determined that the ambitious initiative, developed by a secret task force he had commissioned, should be enacted as designed, as part of the Great Society program and a response to the threats of disruption and conflict in the nation’s largest cities. For Johnson, there was the challenge of increasingly restive Congress, chafing under the increasing costs of Great Society initiatives. For Muskie there was the challenge of a legislative assignment quite different from the pattern he had established in his work as chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution. There were also matters of Muskie’s and Johnson’s political style difference and a less than happy start to their relationship. When Ed Muskie was elected to the U. S. Senate in 1958, he paid a courtesy call on the majority leader, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. As Senator Muskie wrote in his memoir Journeys, Johnson talked to him “for a while about the difficulty of adjusting as a senator, especially as a senator who had been a governor. He said that the tough times were when you had to vote, when you went on record. ‘Many times, Ed. ’ He said, you won’t know how you’re going to vote until the clerk who’s <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> gets to the M’s. ’” After that advice, the majority leader went on to talk about pending rule changes. Johnson was pushing a change that would enable senators to end a filibuster with a two-thirds vote, something most of his southern colleagues could accept. Muskie was much more attracted to a three-fifths vote to end debate, but said nothing...|$|E
