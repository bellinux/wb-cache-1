40|$|The GEOTHER/VT 4 {{computer}} code is an improved {{version of the}} GEOTHER {{computer code}}. The GEOTHER/VT 4 code was applied to a two-dimensional simulation of a waste package in a high-level waste repository to predict the thermal-hydraulic environment where steam formation may occur. The thermal-hydraulic environment is important for assessing waste package <b>container</b> corrosion <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> swelling behaviors, <b>and</b> evaluation of the near-field geochemical conditions. The waste package {{was assumed to be}} situated in the Cohassett flow of the Hanford Site, located in Washington State. This analysis provides the first assessment of the duration and size of a two-phase environment for the waste package. The GEOTHER/VT 4 code has been developed at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) in support of Basalt Waste Isolation Project (BWIP) effort.

40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions <b>and</b> nonexplosive (storage) <b>containers,</b> <b>and</b> shipping <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>materials</b> (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: Incinerator for the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk <b>containers,</b> shells, <b>and</b> bombs; and Dunnage incinerator for the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a quench tower, venturi scrubber, scrubber tower, demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U. S. sites after the incinerators begin to work was estimated in the 1988 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to be from 11 months (at Lexington-Blue Grass Arm...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a thiosulfate-oxidizing bioreactor that allowed high elemental sulfur production and recovery efficiency. The reactor system, {{referred to as a}} Supernatant-Recycling Settler Bioreactor (SRSB), consisted of a cylindrical upflow reactor and a separate aeration vessel. The reactor was equipped with an internal settler <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> (structured corrugated PVC sheets) to facilitate both cell retention and the settling of the formed elemental sulfur. The supernatant from the reactor was continuously recirculated through the aerator. An inlet thiosulfate concentration of 100 mmol l − 1 was used. The reactor system was fed with 89 mmol l − 1 d − 1 thiosulfate reaching 98 to 100 % thiosulfate conversion with an elemental sulfur yield of 77 %. Ninety-three percent of the produced sulfur was harvested {{from the bottom of the}} reactor as sulfur sludge. The dry sulfur sludge contained 87 % elemental sulfur. The inclusion of an internal settler <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>material</b> in the reactor system resulted in an effective retention of sulfur and biomass inside the bioreactor, preventing the oxidation of thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfate in the aerator and, therefore, improving the efficiency of elemental sulfur formation and recovery.
