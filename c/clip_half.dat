40|$|This project {{seeks to}} clarify the {{mechanisms}} through which the media contribute to audiences 2 ̆ 7 understandings of social groups. It encompasses two inter-linked studies. ^ One study identifies two dimensions through which audiences evaluate the realism of media characters. It then investigates how one of these dimensions, character representativeness, {{is associated with the}} audience 2 ̆ 7 s level of familiarity with the society portrayed in the media text and with their sense of the variability of the represented society. Participants from two different societies, the US and Greater China, evaluated the characters in two film segments, one from a culture with which they were familiar and one from a society with which they were unfamiliar. They then evaluated the homogeneity of the films 2 ̆ 7 societies. I assessed the participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the characters 2 ̆ 7 representativeness through two measures. One measure supported the initial hypotheses of the study. Characters from socially distant societies were seen as significantly more representative than those from socially near ones. The other measure did not provide any support for this hypothesis. There was no consistent evidence that the perceived variability of a film 2 ̆ 7 s society moderates perceptions of the representativeness of the film 2 ̆ 7 s characters. ^ The second study investigates whether viewers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the representativeness of a text 2 ̆ 7 s characters shape the strength of the text 2 ̆ 7 s effect on viewers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. It also sought to determine whether the activation of particular category structures or viewer attributions of character behavior influenced effects. Volunteers saw a film clip and then completed a questionnaire about the representativeness of the characters and their perceptions of the source society. Before seeing the film <b>clip,</b> <b>half</b> the participants were primed with publication materials designed to activate the category structure of society membership. Neither the representativeness of the characters nor the variability of the film society is associated with the application of the characters 2 ̆ 7 attributes to the viewers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. There are no consistent differences between the priming and control groups on any of the outcome measures. There is no consistent evidence that audience members 2 ̆ 7 attributions shape the media representations 2 ̆ 7 effect. ^ Possible reasons for the studies 2 ̆ 7 failure as well as implications for future research are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Results {{from several}} {{experiments}} were reviewed {{to collect information}} {{on the value of}} piglet “needle-teeth” clipping. The incidence of facial and udder lesions generally is increased when teeth are left intact. However, {{there is no evidence that}} these lesions affect piglet mortality or weaning weight. Thus, based on the conditions of these experiments, there is no strong justification for teeth clipping. Many producers have abandoned teeth clipping. Besides saving labor, they report having fewer poor doing piglets and joint infections that can result from teeth clipping. Some producers have tried to stop clipping, but because of greasy pig disease problems they have resumed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and physical properties {{of a series}} of molecular clips derived from the concave molecule propanediurea. These molecular clips are cavity-containing receptors that can bind a variety of aromatic guests. This binding is a result of hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. Previous work on molecular clips has been limited to compounds derived from substituted glycoluril. Propanediurea, the compound on which the clips described in this thesis are based, is a molecule that is slightly more concave than glycoluril. A literature survey is presented on the synthesis of glycoluril derivatives and analogues, with special focus on propanediurea derivatives. Subsequently, synthetic efforts to prepare a variety of propanediurea derivatives are described, as well as the synthesis of a variety of molecular <b>clips</b> and <b>half</b> <b>clips</b> from the newly prepared propanediurea derivatives. The binding properties of these propanediurea-derived clips are investigated. It is shown that higher flexibility of the side walls increases the affinity for guests. A comparison is made between clips derived from propanediurea and clips derived from glycoluril. The former clips have a much higher affinity for resorcinol than the latter ones. It is shown that this difference is due to the slightly smaller distance between the carbonyl binding sites in the propanediurea-derived clips. Finally, a number of functionalizations of the propanediurea-derived clip molecules are treated, with the ultimate goal of using their exceptional binding properties in the construction of large supramolecular aggregates. Clips functionalized with porphyrin residues as well as studies on their complexation behavior are descibed. Resorcinol-functionalized polystyrene is used to form a columnar aggregate by self-assocation with clips functionalized at their convex sides with large aliphatic tails. In addition, a clip functionalized at its convex side with resorcinol residues is presented. This molecule can self-associate to form hyperbranched or dendrimer-like structure...|$|R

A total of 116 phytophagous insect species in 31 families and 5 orders were collected from kudzu in China, in six feeding guilds: foliage, sap, stem, terminal, seed and root feeders.

Data were provided to participants as 10 -min interictal and preictal <b>clips,</b> with approximately <b>half</b> of the 60 GB data bundle labelled (interictal/preictal) for algorithm training and half unlabelled for evaluation.

40|$|Acacia mellifera {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} encroaching woody plants in southern African savannas. Previous studies found that this species encroaches far more readily on rocky areas than on sandy substrates, although it grows larger on sandy substrates. Rocky substrates are known to retain more water than sandy substrates, which may be of vital importance during recruitment in semi-arid and arid environments. A number of studies have also indicated that competition with grasses may reduce the recruitment and biomass of tree seedlings. We created an experiment in a semi-arid environment (mean annual rainfall = 388 mm) that tested for the effects of rockiness on A. mellifera recruitment. We also tested the hypothesis that grasses effectively compete with A. mellifera in this environment by simulating the effect of grazing by <b>clipping</b> grasses from <b>half</b> the plots in both the rocky and sandy treatments. Significantly more A. mellifera seedlings established in plots where grasses were clipped than in control plots. A. mellifera seedlings had greater biomass on sandy substrates than on rocky substrates. No significant interaction effects were found between substrate and grass clipping treatment for either seedling number or biomass. We conclude that A. mellifera seedlings are more likely to encroach in habitats with low grass density, although they may achieve greater biomass on sandy soils. Thus, it may be the lower grass density rather than rockiness, which increases the encroachment observed in naturally rocky habitats. These results are also consistent with our observations that adult A. mellifera trees are larger on sandy soils than on rocky soils. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B. V. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Facial masking in Parkinson's {{disease is}} the {{reduction}} of automatic and controlled expressive movement of facial musculature, creating an appearance of apathy, social disengagement or compromised cognitive status. Research in western cultures demonstrates that practitioners form negatively biased impressions associated with patient masking. Socio-cultural norms about facial expressivity vary according to culture and gender, yet little research has studied {{the effect of these}} factors on practitioners' responses toward patients who vary in facial expressivity. This study evaluated the effect of masking, culture and gender on practitioners' impressions of patient psychological attributes. Practitioners (NÂ =Â  284) in the United States and Taiwan judged 12 Caucasian American and 12 Asian Taiwanese women and men patients in video <b>clips</b> from interviews. <b>Half</b> of each patient group had a moderate degree of facial masking and the other half had near-normal expressivity. Practitioners in both countries judged patients with higher masking to be more depressed and less sociable, less socially supportive, and less cognitively competent than patients with lower masking. Practitioners were more biased by masking when judging the sociability of the American patients, and American practitioners' judgments of patient sociability were more negatively biased in response to masking than were those of Taiwanese practitioners. Practitioners were more biased by masking when judging the cognitive competence and social supportiveness of the Taiwanese patients, and Taiwanese practitioners' judgments of patient cognitive competence were more negatively biased in response to masking than were those of American practitioners. The negative response to higher masking was stronger in practitioner judgments of women than men patients, particularly American patients. The findings suggest local cultural values as well as ethnic and gender stereotypes operate on practitioners' use of facial expressivity in clinical impression formation.

40|$|Desire, purchase, and {{consumption}} of fast-moving consumer goods often follow actual motivational states instead of habitual preferences. This {{has led to an}} increasing interest within health sciences to investigate the causes for irrational eating behaviours among consumers, particularly with the use of indirect measurements. However, literature results on the relationship between dynamic, motivational concepts (e. g., approach or avoidance tendencies) and evaluative concepts (e. g., positive or negative associations) remain inconclusive, possibly due to the use of different experimental manipulations and methodologies to operationalize these. Our aim with this study is to contribute to this line of research by developing a novel methodology that is based on structurally identical indirect measurement procedures. We measured explicit desire (motivation) and liking (evaluation) of two different foods (sandwich and sweets) on visual analogue scales, as well as implicit approach-avoidance tendencies and implicit positive-negative associations with two variants of the recoding-free Implicit Association Tests (IAT-RFs). At first, all participants (N= 108) unwrapped, smelled, and explicitly judged the two foods, then all watched a video <b>clip</b> (during which <b>half</b> of the participants were allowed to eat the sandwich but not the sweets), and finally they all performed the two indirect measurements. Thus, desire for the foods was experimentally manipulated between participants. We hypothesized that a valid measure should show an interaction of food category (manipulated within participants) and desire fulfilment. Hence, explicit desire and implicit approach motivation should be higher for participants that were not allowed to consume the sandwich and fulfil their desire, compared to the group that was able to eat the sandwich during the experiment. Results confirm our hypothesis. The motivational IAT-RF correctly assessed approach tendencies towards the sandwich in the group that did not eat, and approach tendencies towards the sweets in the group that just ate a sandwich. In contrast, the evaluative IAT-RF measure did not reflect a clear "preference" towards any of the two popular products in both groups. This research provides a potentially relevant methodology for consumer studies' by offering a chance to differentiate between implicit motivational and evaluative concepts within consumer behaviour. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the proximate mechanisms and ultimate functions of memory for emotional events. The theoretical basis of this Thesis is that in order to reach a full understanding of a biological phenomenon, it is important that both proximate and ultimate (functional) explanations for that phenomenon are explored. Chapters 2 and 3 present an examination of the proximate mechanisms involved in memory consolidation of emotional events. In Chapter 2, three experiments are presented each testing the hypothesis that stress hormone activation immediately following viewing an emotional event enhances memory for that event. Each of the three experiments failed to find an enhancing effect of stress hormone activation on memory consolidation. Chapter 3 describes an investigation into whether the reduced feedback from the body to the brain, which occurs as a result of total spinal cord transection, diminishes the intensity of emotional experience and therefore impairs memory for emotional events. The results of this investigation revealed no differences between spinal cord transection patients and matched control participants in emotional expressivity, emotional awareness and in memory for emotional material. Chapters 4 and 5 explore how memory and emotion may interact differently for males and females and in manner that facilitates their survival and reproduction. Evolutionary theory argues that males should be more concerned than females about threats to their social status, whereas females should be more concerned about threats to their physical appearance and sexual reputation. Chapter 4 describes two experiments testing whether a) males have enhanced emotional arousal and memory for words implying they are of low social status; b) females have enhanced emotional arousal and memory for words implying they are physically unattractive and sexually untrustworthy. The results of these experiments showed that females had enhanced memory for words relating to physical appearance, and partial evidence that males have 2 enhanced memory for words relating to social status. Chapter 5 tests the evolutionary theory that males should be more emotionally aroused and thus have greater memory for cues relating to sexual infidelity (the thought of their partner having sex with another man), whereas females should be more emotionally aroused and have greater memory for cues to emotional infidelity (the thought of their partner forming a close emotional attachment with another woman). It also examines whether relationship status affects emotional arousal and memory for these cues. The results did not find any support for these hypothesised sex difference in memory. However, those ‘currently in a relationship’ did show enhanced emotional arousal to cues to sexual infidelity compared to those ‘currently not in a relationship’. Chapter 6 presents an investigation concerning the evolutionary hypothesis that individuals tend to have enhanced recognition memory for the faces of deceivers or ‘liars’. This chapter describes a study in which participants viewed a series of short video <b>clips</b> of individuals, <b>half</b> of whom were lying, half telling the truth. Participants’ memory for the individuals that appeared in the video clips was tested but {{there was no evidence of}} enhanced memory for the faces of ‘liars’. Chapter 7 provides a general discussion of the findings of this thesis. The failure to find an enhancing effect of post learning stress hormone activation on memory for emotional material, and the failure to find an impairment in memory for emotional material in people with total spinal cord transection contradict two established views on the proximate mechanisms involved in emotion, and emotions effect of the brain. How these findings relate to the established mainstream views on emotion and memory are discussed. The findings of studies concerning the functional interaction of memory and emotion presented in this thesis are also discussed in relation to previous research.
