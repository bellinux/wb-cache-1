40|$|Motion-induced {{blindness}} (MIB) and {{binocular rivalry}} (BR) {{are examples of}} multistable phenomena in which our perception varies despite constant retinal input. It {{has been suggested that}} both phenomena are related and share a common underlying mechanism. We tried to determine whether experimental manipulations of the target dot and the mask systematically affect MIB and BR in an experimental paradigm that can elicit both phenomena. Eighteen observers fixated the center of a split-screen stereo display that consisted of a distracter mask and a superimposed target dot with different colour (isoluminant Red/Green) in corresponding peripheral areas of the left and right eye. Observers reported perceived colour and disappearance of the target dot by pressing and releasing corresponding keys. In a within-subjects design the mask was presented in rivalry or not—with orthogonal drift in the left and right eye or with the same drift in both eyes. In control conditions the mask remained stationary. In addition, the size of the target dot was varied (small, medium, and large). Our results suggest that MIB measured by normalized frequency and duration of target disappearance and BR measured by normalized frequency and duration of <b>colour</b> <b>reversals</b> of the target were both affected by motion in the mask. Surprisingly, binocular rivalry in the mask had only a small effect on BR of the target and virtually no effect on MIB. The overall pattern of normalized MIB and BR measures, however, differed across experimental conditions. In conclusion, the results show some degree of dissociation between MIB and BR. Further analyses will inform whether or not the two phenomena occur independently of each other...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{programs}} of the departments providing design education, students mostly carry out computer assisted/computer-based studies, and computer-based devices are used during this process. There are differences between colour models and practices of computer-assisted/based devices and the colour theories and practices that students have tried and learned themselves in Basic Design, {{which is one of}} the introductory courses. Such colours as red, green or blue are just terms; however, they do not define spectral components of reflecting light of an object. The eyes and mind perceive the spectral information, which is the basis of colour perception. In publishing systems, there is no device that is capable of producing all colours that human eye can see. Every device operates in a certain colour range or certain colour universe that can be produced. Each sector having something to do with colours and using colours as a part of their business utilize colour models that suit them best. In this context, what does colour model mean? What is the purpose of a colour model? What is it used for? What are the types of colour models? What are their analogous and different sides? Why are there so many colour models that make <b>colour</b> <b>reversal</b> possible? What are the reasons for colours' not matching up with each other in design devices and what colour models do these devices use? Do colour models depend on devices or is there a colour model that does not depend on them? In this study, literature review method was used. The study is limited to the basic devices used in graphics design process and the software used with these devices. As a result of the study, it is understood that the purpose of a colour model is to facilitate colour specification through certain standards in a commonly acceptable way. It is seen that the colour model specifies the relationship between values and the colour universe defines the absolute meaning of these values as a colour. It is also found that some colour models (such as CIELAB) have a fixed colour universe since they are directly related with humans' perception of colours and these models are defined independently of the device.
