5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about <b>celestial</b> <b>mechanics</b> and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of <b>celestial</b> <b>mechanics.</b> If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used his {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in <b>celestial</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E

5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (<b>celestial)</b> <b>mechanics</b> by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.

40|$|We {{suggest that}} the {{irregular}} structure in Saturn’s B ring arises from the formation of shear-free ring-particle assemblies of up to ∼ 100 km in radial extent. The characteristic scale of the irregular structure is set by the competition between tidal forces and the yield stress of these assemblies; the required tensile strength of ∼ 10 5 dyn cm − 2 {{is consistent with the}} sticking forces observed in laboratory simulations of frosted ice particles. These assemblies could be the nonlinear outcome of a linear instability that occurs in a rotating fluid disk in which the shear stress is a decreasing function of the shear. We show that a simple model of an incompressible, non-Newtonian fluid in shear flow leads to the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which is widely used to model the formation of structure in binary alloys and other systems.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} – 2 – The recent {{discovery of}} the 2003 EL 61 collisional family in the Kuiper belt (Brown et al. 2007) is surprising because the formation of such a family is a highly improbable event in today’s belt. Assuming Brown et al. ’s estimate {{of the size of}} the progenitors, we find that the probability that a Kuiper belt object was involved in such a collision since primordial times is less than roughly 0. 001. In addition, it is not possible for the collision to have occurred in a massive primordial Kuiper belt because the dynamical coherence of the family would not have survived whatever event produced the currently observed orbital excitation. Here we suggest that the family is the result of a collision between two scattered disk objects. We show that the probability that a collision occurred between two such objects with sizes similar to those advocated in Brown et al. (2007) and that the center of mass of the resulting family is on an orbit typical of the Kuiper belt can be as large as 47 %. Given the large uncertainties involved in this estimate, this result is consistent with the existence of one such family. If true, this result has implications far beyond the origin of a single collisional family, because it shows that collisions played an important role in shaping the dynamical structure of the small body populations that we see today.

25|$|Orbital {{mechanics}} or astrodynamics is {{the application}} of ballistics and <b>celestial</b> <b>mechanics</b> to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control. <b>Celestial</b> <b>mechanics</b> treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems {{under the influence of}} gravity, including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers. General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sun).|$|E

40|$|Pierre Simon de Laplace had a {{plan for}} {{understanding}} everything. To this <b>celestial</b> <b>mechanic,</b> it looked simple: The particles of matter produce forces, and those forces in turn move the particles. So {{if we could just}} measure all the forces and motions at any one instant, we could calculate the entire history of the universe—past, present and future. Two centuries of progress in the sciences have not fulfilled Laplace’s vision; on the contrary, quantum mechanics, and lately chaos theory, have undermined faith in his program. But let’s pretend. If we study a computational model of the universe rather than the real thing, we really can track all the forces and motions. The laws of physics can be kept as simple as we please, since we invent and enforce them. In this toy universe, we can banish all quantum uncertainties, and trace every last detail of every microscopic event. Yet even in such an open and transparent world, total knowledge is still elusive. Although we can follow the individual particles, we have trouble seeing how they act in the aggregate. For example, we may well fail to predict basic thermodynamic phenomena such as boiling and freezing. We could know the whereabouts of every molecule of water in an artificial ocean, but not know whether the stuff is solid or liquid or vapor. The prototypical system for exploring issues of this kind is called the Ising model. It is a model of matter pared down to its barest essentials—just about the simplest imaginable system in which large numbers of particles might be expected to produce some kind of cooperative behavior. If Laplace’s plan can be made to work anywhere, it should succeed here. But the Ising model has proved a difficult challenge, even when attacked with some heavy-duty mathematics and computer science. Indeed, the most important version of the model remains without an exact solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Periodic orbits in an {{arbitrary}} 2 nd degree and order uniformly rotating gravity field are studied. We investigate the four equilibrium points in this gravity field.

The algorithm convergeswell, especially for stable periodic orbits. Using the searching procedure, which is relatively automatic, we find five basic families of periodic orbits in the rotating second degree and order gravity field for planar motion, and discuss their existence and stability at different central body rotation rates.

40|$|Although {{most of the}} marginalist economists’ {{methodology}} {{was influenced}} by 19 th century classical physics, the work of second generation marginalist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth represents the highest point of classical physics influence {{to the development of}} mainstream economic methodology. Edgeworth’s close parallelism between <b>celestial</b> and social <b>mechanics</b> expressed in his analogies between utility and energy and the principle of utility maximization to maximum energy, are important indications of the physics scientific ideal for economics. Subsequent leading theorists were not as explicit, although economic theory continued to be influenced by physics scientific ideal as the work of Pareto, Fisher and Samuelson indicates. However, the physics methodological framework has made a recent reappearance in the relatively new field of econophysics. Although there are methodological similarities, there are also important differences between mainstream economics and econophysics. Econophysicists’ emphasis to statistical mechanics rather to mechanical models, their reservations towards rational agent theory and their rejection of many standard assumptions of mainstream economics, are examples of such differences. This might also explain the resistance of mainstream economic theorists to incorporate econophysics into economics. The paper examines the above from a methodological viewpoint. It also discusses the possible reasons for this historical development and its implications for economic methodology. ...|$|R
