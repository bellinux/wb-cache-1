They are applicable to vehicles that are driven {{along the same}} route everyday such as buses, refuse-collecting vehicles (RCVs) or delivery vehicles. Drive <b>cycle</b> <b>identification</b> {{can be used to}} identify what power transients can be expected to prepare the power train to operate under these conditions.

Given that RCVs always drive in similar drive cycles, drive cycle has been modeled and its main characteristics parameterized. The model is separated into different drive cycles which are related to different power-consumption modes. In this paper, a new method to identify drive cycles and the energy left to finish a route is proposed.

Management of energy is one of essential elements {{in the implementation of}} HEV. The parameters of HEV control strategy are always optimized on some one standardized driving cycle, but the different city has its own driving cycle. So the great advantage of parallel HEV is limited. This paper proposes an intelligent management for parallel HEV based on driving <b>cycle</b> <b>identification</b> using support vector machines (SVM). SVM is great in model identification. The intelligent energy management of parallel HEV identifies the driving cycle and changes the parameters of the control strategy.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a load history generation approach for full-scale accelerated fatigue tests. Primary focus {{is placed on the}} load <b>cycle</b> <b>identification</b> such as to minimize experimental time while having no significant effects on the new generated load history. The load cycles extracted from an original load history are identified into three kinds of cycles namely main, secondary and carrier cycles. Then the principles are presented to generate the load spectrum for accelerated tests, or a large percentage of small amplitude carrier cycles are deleted, a certain number of secondary cycles are merged, and the main cycle and the sequence between main and secondary cycles are maintained. The core of the generation approach is that explicit criteria for load <b>cycle</b> <b>identification</b> are established and equivalent damage calculation formulae are presented. These quantify the damage for accelerated fatigue tests. Three validation examples of its application for the generation approach of accelerated load histories are given in the paper. Good agreement of experimental lives between the original and generated load histories is obtained. Finally, the generation approach of accelerated load histories is applied to the full-scale accelerated fatigue test of helicopter tail, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed approach. <br/...|$|E

The model of a socio-economic system can be represented {{in the form of}} cognitive maps that are directed signed weighted graphs with cause-and-effect relationships and <b>cycles.</b> <b>Identification</b> and selection of target factors and effective control factors of a system is carried out as a solution to the optimal control problem. The influences are determined by the solution to optimization problem of maximizing the objective function, leading to matrix symmetrization.

This approach provides the real computational domain and correctness of solving the optimal control problem. In addition, it does not impose requirements for graphs to be ordering relationships, to have a matrix of special type or to fulfill stability conditions.

40|$|Several {{problems}} {{are involved in}} the Virtual Enterprise (VE) formation process. One of the most important problems is the lack of understanding that may arise during agents ’ interaction, due to both the structural and semantic concepts representation heterogeneity. In the VE life <b>cycle</b> <b>identification</b> of needs, for example, it is necessary to describe the needed product or service {{in a way that it}} can be understood by all the participants. The easier way of solving this problem is to use either a common ontology or a shared one which may be understood by all the enterprise delegate agents participating in the process. However, each agent may have one of the existing different ontologies and a shared ontology will not be universal. Thus, the enterprises will not waste time converting all the content of their ontology if the new one is not considered a universal one. Due to these facts we have created an Ontology-based Service Agent which finds correspondence (similarity) between the concepts (products) of two ontologies through their respective concept’s names, characteristics, relations and concept’s descriptions. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{constitutive}} modeling {{approach for}} {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) wire by {{taking into account the}} microstructural phase inhomogeneity and the associated solid-solid phase transformation kinetics is reported in this paper. The approach is applicable to general thermomechanical loading. Characterization of various scales in the non-local rate sensitive kinetics is the main focus of this paper. Design of SMA materials and actuators not only involve an optimal exploitation of the hysteresis loops during loading-unloading, but also accounts for fatigue and training <b>cycle</b> <b>identifications.</b> For a successful design of SMA integrated actuator systems, it is essential to include the microstructural inhomogeneity effects and the loading rate dependence of the martensitic evolution, since these factors play predominant role in fatigue. In the proposed formulation, the evolution of new phase is assumed according to Weibull distribution. Fourier transformation and finite difference methods are applied to arrive at the analytical form of two important scaling parameters. The ratio of these scaling parameters is of the order of 10 (6) for stress-free temperature-induced transformation and 10 (4) for stress-induced transformation. These scaling parameters are used in order to study the effect of microstructural variation on the thermo-mechanical force and interface driving force. It is observed that the interface driving force is significant during the evolution. Increase in the slopes of the transformation start and end regions in the stress-strain hysteresis loop is observed for mechanical loading with higher rates...|$|R

Because these two species have different transmission <b>cycles,</b> <b>identification</b> of these parasites to the species level in clinical samples may provide laboratory data of crucial importance in epidemiologic investigations. To date, the most reliable way to differentiate C. hominis and C. parvum is based on DNA sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons. Although this approach is very effective for differentiation of Cryptosporidium species, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming compared with methods {{that do not require}} DNA sequencing analysis as an additional step and that have been successfully used for specific identification of a number of pathogens. In this study, we describe a novel Luminex-based assay that can differentiate C. hominis from C. parvum in a rapid and cost-effective manner. The assay was validated by testing a total of 143 DNA samples extracted from clinical specimens, environmental samples, or samples artificially spiked with Cryptosporidium oocysts. As few as 10 oocysts per 300 μl of stools could be detected with this assay. The assay format includes species-specific probes linked to carboxylated Luminex microspheres that hybridize to a Cryptosporidium microsatellite- 2 region (ML- 2) where C. hominis and C. parvum differ by one nucleotide substitution.
