5|$|The Theme of Sicily (θέμα Σικελίας, thema Sikelias) was {{responsible}} for Sicily and the imperial possessions in south-western Italy (<b>Calabria).</b> Once the bastion of Byzantine naval strength in the West, by the late 9th century it had greatly diminished in strength, and disappeared after the final loss of Taormina in 902. Distinct tourmarchai are attested for Sicily proper and <b>Calabria.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{writing his}} senior thesis on Kenyan {{education}} under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor's degree in history, Johnson declined the postgraduate scholarship {{that he was}} awarded and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain. Johnson played professional basketball in the Lega Basket Serie A and Legadue Basket in Italy and Liga Española de Baloncesto in Spain, one season each for Gorizia Pallacanestro A2, Viola Reggio <b>Calabria,</b> Adecco Milano/Ducato Siena, Casademont Girona and Montepaschi Siena. He played two seasons with the Avellino in Italy from 2000–2002. He had a seven-year professional career before becoming a coach. In 1998, he won an Italian Second Division championship as a starter for Gorizia Pallacanestro. In 1999, he earned another league championship with for Reggio <b>Calabria,</b> and in his final professional season in 2004 he earned a league title with Siena. With Reggio <b>Calabria,</b> he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver, and Manu Ginóbili to win a championship.|$|E
5|$|Bolzano had {{a fairly}} uneventful peacetime career, which {{primarily}} consisted of naval reviews for Italian and foreign dignitaries. She saw extensive {{action in the}} first three years of Italy's participation in World War II. She took part in the Battles of <b>Calabria,</b> Taranto, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. The ship was lightly damaged at <b>Calabria,</b> but she emerged from the other engagements unscathed. She also frequently escorted convoys to North Africa in 1941 and 1942 and patrolled for British naval forces in the central Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calabria</b> {{was built}} at the La Spezia dockyard, with her keel being laid down in February 1892. She was {{launched}} on 20 September 1894, and fitting-out work was completed by mid-1897; the new cruiser was commissioned into the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) on 12 July. <b>Calabria</b> spent long periods abroad in her first decade of service. She was operating in Chinese waters in 1899 when the Boxer Rebellion broke out. She joined an international fleet that included representatives from the fleets of the Eight Nation Alliance {{in the mouth of}} the Hai River while a contingent of 475 soldiers traveled to Beijing to reinforce the Legation Quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{first arrived}} in Southern Italy in 1015 from {{northern}} France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As they were paid with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, <b>Calabria,</b> and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and <b>Calabria</b> were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.|$|E
5|$|Although Sicily was lost, {{the general}} Nikephoros Phokas the Elder succeeded in taking Taranto {{and much of}} <b>Calabria</b> in 880, forming the nucleus for the later Catepanate of Italy. The successes in the Italian Peninsula opened a new period of Byzantine {{domination}} there. Above all, the Byzantines were beginning to establish a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea, and especially the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio <b>Calabria.</b> Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the <b>Calabria</b> region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
5|$|J. Rendel Harris {{pointed out}} that the menology of the Ferrar group {{contains}} saints which appear to be peculiar to <b>Calabria</b> or Sicily. Abbe Martin had previously stated that certain palaeographical traits to be observed in these manuscripts were characteristic of Calabrian scriptoria.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Apulia, and <b>Calabria,</b> {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine {{moved to}} Europe {{to spend the}} 1998–1999 and 1999–2000 seasons with Italian team Basket Viola Reggio <b>Calabria.</b> In 1999, he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver and Sydney Johnson to earn {{promotion}} from the Italian 2nd Division to the Italian 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Basil II is {{considered}} among the most capable Byzantine emperors and his reign as {{the apex of the}} empire in the Middle Ages. By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to <b>Calabria</b> in Southern Italy in the west. Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of Bulgaria to the annexation of parts of Georgia and Armenia, and the reconquest of Crete, Cyprus, and the important city of Antioch. These were not temporary tactical gains but long-term reconquests.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century {{mainland}} southern Longobard and Byzantine {{powers were}} hiring Norman mercenaries, who were {{descendants of the}} Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily, taking {{it away from the}} Arab Muslims. After taking Apulia and <b>Calabria,</b> Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of Sicily and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but the most crucial battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calabria</b> was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calabria,</b> alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E
5|$|Desperate {{to conquer}} Constantinople, Simeon planned a large {{campaign}} in 924 and sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah, who possessed a powerful navy which Simeon needed. The caliph agreed and sent his own representatives {{back with the}} Bulgarians to arrange the alliance. However, the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at <b>Calabria.</b> Romanos offered peace to the Arabs, supplementing this offer with generous gifts, and ruined their union with Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Dyrrhachium (near present-day Durrës in Albania) {{took place}} on October 18, 1081 between the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118), and the Normans of {{southern}} Italy under Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and <b>Calabria.</b> The battle was fought outside the city of Dyrrhachium (also known as Durazzo), the Byzantine capital of Illyria, and ended in a Norman victory.|$|E
5|$|After {{starring}} {{with the}} Azzurrini in Italy's under-16, under-19, and under-21 sides, Totti earned his first senior cap for Italy under the recently appointed international manager Dino Zoff during a 2–0 Euro 2000 qualifying victory against Switzerland on 10 October 1998. Totti scored his first goal for Italy on 26 April 2000 in a 2–0 friendly win over Portugal in Reggio <b>Calabria.</b> He scored his first brace for Italy in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match in a 4–3 home win over Belarus, on 13 October 2004. In total, Totti made 58 appearances for Italy between 1998 and 2006, scoring nine goals.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served with}} the main fleet in the interwar period, where they were {{primarily}} occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, Gorizia evacuated Italian nationals and Pola took part in non-intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces. The ships {{took part in the}} battles of <b>Calabria</b> and Cape Matapan, and in the latter engagement, Zara, Pola, and Fiume were all sunk in a ferocious night action with three British battleships.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Empire {{was faced with}} new enemies. Provinces in {{southern}} Italy faced the Normans, who arrived in Italy {{at the beginning of}} the 11th century. During a period of strife between Constantinople and Rome culminating in the East-West Schism of 1054, the Normans began to advance, slowly but steadily, into Byzantine Italy. Reggio, the capital of the tagma of <b>Calabria,</b> was captured in 1060 by Robert Guiscard, followed by Otranto in 1068. Bari, the main Byzantine stronghold in Apulia, was besieged in August 1068 and fell in April 1071. The Byzantines also lost their influence over the Dalmatian coastal cities to Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia (r. 1058–1074/1075) in 1069.|$|E
5|$|Both Conte di Cavour and {{her sister}} ship, , participated in the Battle of <b>Calabria</b> in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed. She was deliberately grounded, with most of her hull underwater, and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. The ship was then captured by the Germans, but they made no use of her. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized seven days later. Conte di Cavour was eventually scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium {{had been}} {{absent from the}} affairs of {{southern}} Italy for almost a century, but the accession of Basil the Macedonian changed this: from 868 on, the imperial fleet and diplomacy were employed {{in an effort to}} secure the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raids, re-establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia, and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy. Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873, and Bari in 876. According to the Byzantine sources, during his tenure in Italy Nikephoros recovered numerous towns taken by the Arabs in the previous years, including Taranto, Bari, Santa Severina, Rhegion and Taormina, Tropai and especially Amantia, which Maxentios had previously attacked without success. According to the continuators of Georgios Monachos, he was besieging Amantia when news came of Emperor Basil's death and his own recall by Leo VI; Nikephoros kept the news a secret until he had persuaded the Arab garrison to surrender on guarantee of safe passage. During his time in Italy he also took steps to strengthen the Byzantine position by settling many Armenians in the region, as well as 1,000 manumitted slaves donated by Emperor Basil's old benefactor, the widow Danielis. The 11th-century historian John Skylitzes furthermore reports that Nikephoros brought an end to abuse against the local population, by ending the practice of returning Byzantine soldiers carrying off local Italians to be sold off in the East as slaves. According to Skylitzes, the grateful Italians dedicated a church in his honour. By the time of his departure, he had extended Byzantine control over most of Apulia and <b>Calabria.</b> These victories were followed up by his successors and laid the foundation of a resurgence of Byzantine power in southern Italy, culminating in the establishment of the theme of Longobardia in ca. 892. The regions of Apulia, <b>Calabria</b> and Basilicata would remain firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool gained four battle honours and {{was seriously}} damaged in two attacks by Italian torpedo bombers. The cruiser {{operated}} variously with the naval {{stations in the}} East Indies and China and with the Mediterranean and Home fleets. While assigned to the China Station in January 1940, the cruiser instigated a diplomatic incident with Japan when she intercepted the liner Asama Maru {{off the coast of}} Japan. Liverpool fought in the battles of the Espero Convoy and <b>Calabria,</b> the Arctic Convoys, and Operation Harpoon during the Malta Convoys. An aerial attack on 14 June 1942, during Operation Harpoon, proved to be the ship's final combat of the war. For the remainder of the conflict, Liverpool underwent repairs and refitting at Rosyth, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Eagle {{spent the}} first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German {{commerce}} raiders. During the early part of the war, the Fleet Air Arm was desperately short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of <b>Calabria</b> in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever Eagle was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.|$|E
5|$|HMS Dainty was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. Dainty was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battle of <b>Calabria</b> in July 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties until she was sunk by German bombers off Tobruk on 24 February 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, the Grand Master's fleet {{anticipated}} and repelled eight Turkish vessels which {{attempted to}} infiltrate {{the island of}} Gozo. During the same year, the Grand Master sent part of his fleet to also repel a Turkish unit which was threatening <b>Calabria.</b> Headed by the commanding knight of Langon, the fleet managed to sink an admiral ship. In the following year the commanding knight of Langon was defeated at sea after attacking an Algerian admiral vessel. Nevertheless, the Maltese fleet emerged victorious. Between 1713 and 1715, the fleet of the Order patrolled all the coasts around the Mediterranean succeeding in various important undertakings.|$|E
5|$|In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen {{opened the}} gates to the Normans. The Norman army {{proceeded}} to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, <b>Calabria,</b> and Campania were in revolt. He {{also learned that}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was {{at the gates of}} Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.|$|E
5|$|In its heyday, el-Mansuriya was {{the capital}} of a state that {{encompassed}} most of North Africa from Morocco to Libya, as well as Sicily, although it had to guard against attack from the Byzantine Empire and from King Otto I of Germany, both active in southern Italy. In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of <b>Calabria</b> from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of <b>Calabria,</b> Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in <b>Calabria.</b> This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Planned at short notice, {{the mission}} {{followed}} an offer by the Italian government {{to open the}} ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The airborne division was selected to undertake the mission, {{but at the time}} they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at <b>Calabria.</b> Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast in working order.|$|E
5|$|Severely {{wounded and}} {{subsequently}} {{captured by the}} Germans, Verity {{was taken to a}} field hospital and underwent an operation. Taken by boat across the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, Verity first went to a hospital in Reggio <b>Calabria</b> and was then transported for two days by train to Naples. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at Caserta. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31 July, and was buried with full military honours. His grave was later moved from the town's cemetery to the military cemetery established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{had been}} planned at short notice, {{following}} an offer by the Italian government to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The 1st Airborne Division was selected to undertake the mission, {{but at the time}} they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at <b>Calabria.</b> Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed, and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast, in working order.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hohenstaufen authority Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily. These revolts resulted in some acts of violence, and the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under Frederick II. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to Lucera in Apulia and Girifalco in <b>Calabria,</b> where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen {{for the benefit of}} the king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under Charles II of Naples, and many of its inhabitants sold into slavery. The Jewish community was expelled after {{the establishment}} of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Battle of <b>Calabria</b> in July 1940, when Giulio Cesare was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed. She was grounded with most of her hull underwater and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. Conte di Cavour was scrapped in 1946. Giulio Cesare escorted several convoys, and {{participated in the}} Battle of Cape Spartivento in late 1940 and the First Battle of Sirte in late 1941. She was designated as a training ship in early 1942, and escaped to Malta after Italy surrendered. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Soviet Union in 1949 and renamed Novorossiysk. The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when a mine exploded in 1955. She was scrapped in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though they}} lifted {{the siege of}} Barletta upon seeing Skanderbeg's {{approaching}} men the week before, Angevin forces remained active. Once Skanderbeg arrived, Ferdinand put him {{in command of the}} fortress of Barletta whereas the King himself went to Ariano Irpino. Once left in command of the fortress, Skanderbeg moved against Ferdinand's rivals. Among them were Giovanni Orsini, Jean d'Anjou (the Duke of <b>Calabria),</b> Piccinino, and Francesco del Balzo. They had stationed themselves in Andria, where the Albanian assaults continued. The Albanian cavalry's light armament, swift horses and loose ranks allowed them to quickly overcome the more heavily armed Italian cavalry, which fought in tight formations. In one of their operations, an Albanian warrior captured Alois Minutulo, the lord of the Castle of Monte Sant'Angelo who was imprisoned in the Fortress of Barletta. Three years later, Ferdinand would present Skanderbeg with the castle as a token of his gratitude.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's opponents, under Piccinino's main command, {{tried to}} open battle with Skanderbeg, but due to the {{combined}} strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces, they withdrew from the Andrian fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti. News of Piccinino's retreat reached Venice who {{sent a message to}} Francisco Sforza. Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto, where Giovanni Orsini was prince. Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him, but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini's faithfulness, so Skanderbeg continued raiding Orsini's territory. He split his army into three parts, one under Moisi Arianit Golemi, the other under Vladan Gjurica, and the last under his command. He led attacks against Ferdinand's enemies in three directions without halt, thoroughly exhausting them. During the month of October, Skanderbeg continued to pillage Orisini's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in <b>Calabria,</b> where he recaptured Cosenza and Castrovillari. At this point, Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected. On 27 October, Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of Gisualdo. Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted, believing that peace was near.|$|E
