5|$|HDMI {{has a few}} {{advantages}} over DisplayPort, such as ability to carry Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) signals, and electrical <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> DVI (though practically limited to single-link DVI rates). Also, HDMI can sustain full bandwidth for up to 10 meters of cable length and there are certification programs to ensure this; DisplayPort cables, conversely, don't ensure full bandwidth beyond 3 meters.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2017, games may be {{promoted}} with additional icons that denote <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> hardware enhancements found in newer Xbox One models, including support for high-dynamic-range (HDR) colors (on Xbox One S and Xbox One X), native rendering at 4K resolution (Xbox One X), and specific optimizations for Xbox One X.|$|E
5|$|There is no upgrade path to Windows 10 for devices running Windows RT. Windows 10 Mobile, {{based on}} Windows Phone, was {{unveiled}} {{for use on}} future tablets and smartphones with ARM architecture.

5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which was perceived {{as a way of}} lessening the amount of work needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> pkgsrc proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV {{software}} was introduced {{with a new}} user-interface, an integrated TV guide from TitanTV and <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> Apple remotes. The interface {{was similar to that}} of other Apple products. An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E

5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, it was left out in 1950 for reasons of <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> the new international standard.|$|E
5|$|Some Western {{academics}} cautiously {{view the}} hadith collections as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations {{which have been}} compiled in later periods, but judge them {{in the context of}} history and {{on the basis of their}} <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> the events and figures. Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place a greater emphasis on the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable chain of transmission (isnad); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable in their eyes.|$|E

5|$|Szabó's {{first feature}} film, The Age of Illusions (1964), is a partly autobiographical {{film about the}} struggles of Szabó’s {{generation}} in starting a career, encountering the obsolescence of the older generation, and establishing romantic relationships. The appearance of a poster for François Truffaut's The 400 Blows {{in the background of}} a scene suggested Szabó's artistic <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> Truffaut and the French New Wave. The film won the Silver Sail for Best First Work at the Locarno International Film Festival and a Special Jury Prize for Best Director at the Hungarian Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The EyeTV Diversity is a USB-powered {{device with}} dual tuners for {{receiving}} {{over the air}} television broadcasts. The tuners can be used simultaneously for an optimized signal, or one tuner {{can be used to}} record a channel, while another is used to watch a separate show. Diversity was first introduced in November 2006. A driver in 2009 added <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> Windows 7. A review in TechRadar gave EyeTV Diversity five out of five stars. PC Advisor and Pocket-Lint both gave it four out of five stars.|$|E

5|$|The main {{microprocessor}} is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7.6 MHz. The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub-processor, mainly used {{to control}} the sound hardware and provide backward <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> the Master System. The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors at once from a palette of 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.|$|E
5|$|This is made {{possible}} by the presence of an x86 Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation which Apple has provided on top of EFI. Installing any additional operating system other than Windows is not supported directly by Apple. Though Apple's Boot Camp drivers are only for Windows, it is often possible to achieve full or nearly full <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> another OS by using third-party drivers.|$|E
5|$|To ensure {{baseline}} compatibility {{between different}} HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward <b>compatibility</b> <b>with</b> the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability {{to use the}} YCbCr color space and higher color depths ("deep color") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), YCbCr 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or YCbCr 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces {{that can be used}} by HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.|$|E
