5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|Dion {{moved to}} Asbestos, Quebec after the {{conclusion}} of his hockey career and {{became involved in the}} local minor hockey movement, often in the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> referee. He helped establish an arena in the city, the Centre Récréatif d'Asbestos, in 1954, which was later renamed Aréna Connie Dion. Since 1991, the Asbestos Minor Hockey Association has held an annual tournament at the arena in his honor. He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations for the sport in Asbestos. He had a local tournament named after him in this sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann. He died on November 7, 2014 at the age of 96 at the Centre de Santé et Service Sociaux in Asbestos, following a two-week period of hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> photovoltaic {{power stations}} is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), {{which refers to}} the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} energy processes in switched-mode AC-AC converters of buck, boost and buck-boost types. The mathematical model of energy processes is obtained. The mathematical model is generalized to DC-DC and AC-AC converters, to three basic types of converters and considers possibility of autotransformer inclusion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor. It is shown {{that the use of}} bi-directional switches allows both DC and AC conversion of electrical energy regardless of the load type and also supports recuperation of electrical energy back to the source. It is shown that the maximum value of instant power in a load circuit in AC—AC converters exceeds twice the rated value of load power in comparison with DC—DC converters. It is shown that the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor in AC—AC converters exceeds twice the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> DC—DC converters at the identical rated power of conversion. It is shown that the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor in converters of buck and boost types depends on the ratio of input and output voltage. Also, the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor in converters of buck-boost type does not depend on the ratio of input and output voltage. It is shown that the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor in converters of buck and boost types is lower than the energy <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductor in the converter of buck-boost type...|$|R

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E
5|$|The regular main {{composer}} for the Tales {{series is}} Motoi Sakuraba. His first {{work on the}} series was for Phantasia, and has since contributed to nearly every main entry since there in the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> freelance composer. Sakuraba has become noted for his signature musical style, which {{is present in the}} majority of his Tales scores. He also frequently collaborates with Shinji Tamura. The entries Sakuraba has not worked on are Legendia, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and Innocence, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for Zestiria. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the artists are Garnet Crow (Eternia), Deen (Destiny/Hearts), Kokia (Innocence), Ayumi Hamasaki (Xillia/Xillia 2) and FLOW (Berseria). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with Symphonia, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first western release of a Tales title to feature the theme song used in Japan was Vesperia.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single fibre.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
