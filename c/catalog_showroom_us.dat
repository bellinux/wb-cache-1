50|$|Fred Meyer Jewelers {{started in}} 1973 as a <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> concept by Fred Meyer. As the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> fad started to die down, Fred Meyer was {{experiencing}} excellent sales {{growth in the}} fine jewelry category.

50|$|From the consumer's {{point of}} view, there are {{potential}} advantages and disadvantages. The <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach allows customers to shop {{without having to}} carry their purchases throughout the store as they shop. Possible downsides include that customers {{may be required to}} give their contact information when an order is placed, take the time to fill out order forms, and wait a period of time for their order to be available for purchase. This wait may be days long, one of the chief vulnerabilities of the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, Witmark {{experienced}} {{its fourth}} consecutive year of declining sales and earnings, {{and the company}} announced changes to its operating strategy. Unfortunately, vast barriers—such as long-term leases on real estate—limited the company's ability {{to adapt to the}} changing business climate. The following year, Witmark liquidated its assets and laid off its 700+ employees. Like the larger national chains of <b>catalog</b> <b>showrooms</b> (such as Best Products), the retail concept collapsed in the late 1990s due to overwhelming competition from big box stores and Internet shopping.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason behind}} {{offering}} the <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> approach to retailing {{was that it}} reduced the risk of merchandise theft (known in the industry as shrinkage) and also enabled customers to shop without the inconvenience of physically dragging purchases throughout the store. The downside to this approach was that it required the customers to give their names, addresses, and phone numbers with each order. The risk of identity theft made some customers wary of shopping in such stores, particularly when purchasing simple household items such as batteries.|$|R

50|$|Raymond Zimmerman, {{son of the}} {{original}} founders (who had been instrumental {{in the process of}} building the family business into a multibillion-dollar empire) resigned as Chairman of the Board in November 2000. The company subsequently attempted to pull itself out of bankruptcy once again in the summer of 2001, but the economic downturn following the September 11, 2001 attacks proved to be a hurdle the company could not clear.With only 200 <b>catalog</b> <b>showrooms</b> left, the stock valued at less than one cent per share, and no profitability in sight, Service Merchandise ceased operations and shuttered all of its remaining stores by early 2002.|$|R
50|$|The mall {{opened for}} {{business}} on May 16, 1991. Zamias Services, Inc. developed the property. Three of the anchor stores (Belk, J.C. Penney and Sears) moved from an existing mall called Rock Hill Mall, which {{closed in the}} early 1990s and later demolised in 2008, after losing those stores; the other anchors at the Galleria included Phar-Mor and Walmart. The former closed after only one year in business, and was replaced with a Brendle's <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> in October 1995, but the store closed after only six months in business following the chain's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|The center's big blow {{came during}} Christmas of 2000, as Montgomery Ward {{liquidated}} its assets and closed their store in early 2001 (the building {{has since been}} razed). Service Merchandise also began downsizing its operations considerably, eventually taking only half the space in its building. It closed its <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> business by 2003 (later to re-emerge as an online retailer, similar to Montgomery Ward) and razed the building in 2004 and the water tower in 2005. Sears Hardware closed in July 2006. The Farmer Jack store was shuttered (along {{with the rest of}} the chain) a year later, in July 2007, leaving the mall without an anchor tenant.|$|R
5000|$|General Growth Properties {{purchased}} the former Lord & Taylor, planning {{a new concept}} known as [...] "The Epicenter Collection", an Internet <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom.</b> Those plans were abandoned by December 2008, when the empty anchor was sold to Target Corporation, the building was demolished in March 2010 and Target opened October 10, 2010 http://www.ggp.com/content/docs/GGProfilesRetailerNewsletter.pdf. A new food court opened in Spring 2009 in space previously occupied by a movie theater. The original food court was converted to retail space. The 214000 sq ft Strawbridge's store was demolished and replaced with additional mall space and a new two-level, 140000 sq ft Nordstrom which opened on April 8, 2011.|$|R
50|$|Many {{companies}} {{in recent years}} have moved away from relying solely on catalog sales, augmenting them with on-line sales or direct retail. The move toward on-line sales includes long-established department store chains such as Sears and JCPenney that relied heavily on catalog sales. However, many long-established catalog merchants have gone out of business in recent years including Best Products, Brendle's, Ellman's, KeyMid, Montgomery Ward, Rink's, H. J. Wilson Co., Service Merchandise, Sterling Jewelry & Distributing Company and Consumers Distributing.The Houston Jewelry & Distributing Company division of Sterling Jewelry & Distributing Company was successfully reconfigured as a full service fine jewelry and gift store in 1993 and has been in operation ever since. Houston Jewelry remains the only former <b>catalog</b> <b>showroom</b> to successfully return to a traditional jewelry format.|$|R
