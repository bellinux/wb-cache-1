40|$|This booklet {{documents}} the bioclimatic maps {{that cover the}} south-western part of India corresponding to the Western Ghats and adjacent areas. The area is characterised by very steep climatic gradients determined by {{the interaction of the}} southwest monsoon winds with the relief barrier of the mountain of the Western Ghats. Data from more than 3, 000 stations and covering the period 1950 - 1980 were collected from various government and private sources. They were analyzed to produce two (North and South) 1 / 500 000 scale bioclimatic maps given as appendices. The present booklet details the methodology used to produce the maps, which are provided along with <b>climatic</b> <b>diagrams</b> illustrating the annual rainfall distribution and its inter-annual variability.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} dryness and drought {{phenomena}} {{in one of}} the subsidence areas of the Romanian Plain, namely Titu Plain, located in its central-north part, a region frequently affected by such phenomena, under the influence of persistent continental antyciclones. The topic approached in this study is in line with the current concerns of agriculture stakeholders to undertake climate change adaptation measures for a better management of water resources for crops in the the main agricultural regions of the country. In this paper we focused mainly on the impact of dryness and drought on agricultural landscape, although their direct and indirect effects affect not only agriculture, but also the whole economic activity of the region. The impact of these phenomena was assessed by using relevant statistical-climatological methods (e. g. the Helmann method, the Walter-Lieth <b>climatic</b> <b>diagrams),</b> applied on the monthly temparature and precipitation datasets from four weather stations located in the study region covering a 47 -year period of meteorological observations (1961 - 2007) : Târgovişte, Ploieşti, Titu şi Videle. The distribution of elements at risk within the Titu Plain region, included in the vulnerability analysis, was determined using land use map of the region extracted from CLC (Corine Land Cover, 2006), by reclassifying the primary land use classes under GIS, resulting six categories of vulnerable items to dryness and drought. Among these items, the agricultural lands have a share of 66. 5 % across the study region, the main crops being represented by cereals (wheat and corn), potatoes and sunflowers...|$|R

A new Combined Envelope (a quadratic logistic regression probability surface constrained by a Convex Hull envelope) was used in a Climate Change Trend Analysis to determine future climatic suitability for species at each site (defined as a change in probability of species' presence). Results indicate that the warming climate could favour {{a large proportion of}} plants on Scottish reserves (excepting montane species) and be less favourable for many plants on reserves in the south of England.

40|$|Presented work is {{continuation}} of the first comprehensive agroclimatological study of Žabcice area (Rožnovský, Svoboda, 1995) and focuses on the time period 1991 to 2005. The work contains some of the agroclimatological data, which are used by number of experts at our university working within area of the MZLU Agricultural Farm in Žabčice especially on project no. J 08 / 984321001. Results are based on data measured by the special agrometeorological station of Institute of Agrosystems and Bioclimatology at MZLU in Brno that is situated within trial area “Obora“ (altitude: 179 m; latitude: N 49 ° 01 ´; longitude: E 16 ° 16 ´). Measurements at Žabčice station follow methodology of Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (Slabá, 1972; Fišák, 1994). <b>Climatic</b> <b>diagram</b> according Walter and Leith is usually based on normal period (Rožnovský, Svoboda, 1995) {{but it is possible}} to prepare it for shorter period (in this case 1991 – 2005) and make a comparison. If the ratio of the temperature and precipitation axis is 10 : 30 (which is the most suitable according our experience) it may be stated that:•	During period 1961 – 1990 the curve of precipitation sums is under the curve of mean monthly temperature from the middle of July till beginning of October. This period is the period of drought for Žabčice. •	For the period from 1991 to 2005 the curve of precipitation sums is under the curve of temperature from mid April to mid June (just a slightly, but it can explain spring droughts appearances) and at the begining of August till {{the end of the first}} decade of September. In comparison with the normal pe- riod 1961 – 1990 and the long term mean 1901 – 1950 for station Židlochovice the probability of possible drought has increased. •	Mean annual temperature changed from 9. 2 °C to 10. 0 °C and precipitation changed from 480. 0 mm to 483. 0 mm however with different distribution as can be seen at the fig. 4. •	The mean monthly temperature of the coldest month increased from –  5. 4 °C to –  3. 9 °C and lowest measured temperature within this period was –  22. 3 °C in comparison with 1961 – 1990 when the value was –  29. 0 °C. •	Mean monthly temperature of the warmest month increased from 25. 2 °C to 27. 2 °C and absolute maximum increased from 36. 6 °C to 38. 47 °C. •	Months with the mean minimum monthly temperature below 0. 0 °C and months with absolute minimum below 0. 0 °C have also changed.

30|$|Crop yields are {{generally}} <b>composed</b> of trend, <b>climatic</b> fluctuation, and random components. Trend in yields reflects {{the contribution of}} factors that affect productivity development while the climatic fluctuation component of yield is the contribution of climate fluctuation, which is mainly associated with meteorological disasters. To investigate the relationship between drought intensity and winter wheat yield, a critical step is to separate the trend from the impact of climatic fluctuation. Therefore, four fitting methods—triple point moving average, exponential smoothing, Logistic, and HP filter—were compared in this study for the separation of trend in yield. The {{results indicate that the}} HP filter method has higher accuracy and can be recommended for this study. Therefore, the HP filter method was used for the detrending treatment of winter wheat yield, and the specific calculation algorithm {{can be found in the}} relevant literature (Harvey and Trimbur 2008).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Climate has {{direct effects}} on the surface features, vegetation, animals, agriculture, and human {{behaviours}} of a region. Agricultural Meteorology is briefly the application of climatology to agriculture. Planning and works to be performed without taking climatic conditions into account might lead to incorrect results and serious damages. Therefore, climate studies of the regions should be made, constantly monitored and renewed in certain periods. In this study; <b>climatic</b> conditions, climate <b>diagrams</b> and water budgets of Erzurum, Ağrı, Iğdır, Kars, and Ardahan provinces in basin of Aras were evaluated using their thirty-year data (1976 - 2005). The course and the relationships of temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and evaporation parameters were investigated for the selected period. As a result, the long term annual average temperature of Iğdır is twofold and more than the others. Long-term mean annual rainfalls of all provinces in Aras basin are less than Turkey’s average precipitation. Contrary to common belief, Iğdır has the lowest long term monthly and annual relative humidity values in Aras basin. Iğdır and Ardahan provinces have the highest and lowest long term average of total evaporation values, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Hemp {{concrete}} is {{a sustainable}} lightweight concrete that became {{popular in the}} field of building construction because of its thermal and environmental properties. However; available experimental data on its hygrothermal behavior are rather scarce in the literature. This paper describes the design of a large-scale experiment developed to investigate the hygrothermal behavior of hemp concrete cast around a timber frame through a spraying process; and then coated with lime-based plaster. The equipment is <b>composed</b> of two <b>climatic</b> chambers surrounding the tested wall. The experiment consists of maintaining the indoor climate at constant values and applying incremental steps of temperature; relative humidity or vapor pressure in the outdoor chamber. Temperature and relative humidity of the room air and on various depths inside the wall are continuously registered during the experiments and evaporation phenomena are observed. The influence of the plaster on the hygrothermal behavior of hemp concrete is investigated. Moreover; a comparison of experimental temperatures with numerical results obtained from a purely conductive thermal model is proposed. Comparing the model with the measured data gave satisfactory agreement...|$|R
30|$|Fire risk {{indices are}} <b>composed</b> of human, <b>climatic,</b> ecological, and biophysical {{variables}} (Vidal et al. 1994). One {{of the key}} biophysical variables is the LFMC. Thus, thorough knowledge about its behaviour, both in the different regions and in the selected vegetation types, is of great importance. The methodologies employed in this work to obtain IP from a LFMC product were satisfactorily applied. However, the general philosophy involved {{in the construction of}} the specific fire risk index must be considered in order to choose the best index. In our case, the fire risk index within which this study has been developed (Chuvieco et al. 2010) includes the physical probability that a fire starts (IP) or propagates, and the potential damages that it may cause. Specifically, IP from LFMC is combined with the IP derived from dead fuel moisture content, as well as fire ignition data from lightning and human causes. To integrate IP from LFMC with the other factors, we have previously relied on a linear inverse function between actual LFMC and ME thresholds (105 % for shrubs and 40 % for herbaceous species (Chuvieco et al. 2004 a). However, the results obtained in this study show the usefulness of the methodologies we have explored and how they can help to provide a more realistic IP model. These models could be specifically applied to the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian regions of the Iberian Peninsula territory.|$|R
