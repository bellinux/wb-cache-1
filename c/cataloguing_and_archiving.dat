40|$|Landscapes {{are both}} a {{synthesis}} and {{an expression of}} national, regional and local cultural heritages. It is therefore very important to develop techniques aimed at <b>cataloguing</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> their forms. This paper discusses the LDL (Landscape Digital Library) project, a Web accessible database that can present the landscapes of a territory with documentary evidence in a new format and from a new perspective. The method was tested in a case study area of the river Po valley (Northern Italy). The LDL {{is based on a}} collection of photographs taken following a systematic grid of survey points identified through topographic cartography; the camera level is that of the human eye. This methodology leads to an innovative landscape archive that differs from surveys carried out through aerial photographs or campaigns aimed at selecting "relevant" points of interest. Further developments and possible uses of the LDL are also discussed...|$|E

Computerized data are more fragile than paper archives but also more accessible via the Internet. This article explores the role of the Archaeology Data Service and examines some of the issues raised by the collection of digital data and their dissemination online and the implications for the future of archaeological publication. It discusses approaches to digital data preservation, the development of archival standards and ways of encouraging reuse. It explores the development of distributed online <b>catalogues</b> <b>and</b> <b>archives</b> <b>and</b> the need for metadata standards for cataloguing resources. Finally, it considers the role of XML as an emergent technology and introduces the European ARENA project which is developing a digital preservation and access infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 107 - 115). This research sketches {{the history}} of the Bleek-L 1 oyd collection by documenting the <b>cataloguing</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving</b> of material which has occurred in the years subsequent to the recording of the original manuscripts and certain related material during the closing decades of the nineteenth century. It attempts to track the processes by which material elements (notebooks, manuscripts, printed documents, artefacts, objects and original artworks, correspondence, newspaper clippings, pamphlets, books, photographs, paintings) became consolidated - or separated - as part of the making of what is now known as the Bleek-L 1 oyd archive. In addition, this research examinesthe various projects of knowledge production and writing which have emanated from the archive in the 80 years since {{a small part of the}} notebook texts, edited by Lucy Lloyd, was published in 1911. In particular, I examine ways in which the notebook texts have been deployed in the service of emerging and established academic disciplines including philology, "native studies", folklore and anthropology, archaeology and rock art interpretation.

40|$|The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS; [URL] is the {{umbrella}} project that encompasses the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s National Capability contaminant {{monitoring and surveillance}} work on avian predators. By monitoring sentinel vertebrate species, the PBMS aims to detect and quantify current and emerging chemical threats {{to the environment and}} in particular to vertebrate wildlife. As part of its chemical monitoring studies the PBMS receives and carries out post-mortem examinations on approximately 300 birds or prey each year. A range of tissues are taken from the carcasses. Around 100 addled and deserted eggs from various species are also submitted to the PBMS. The eggs are cracked open and the contents collected. The shells are retained for two years prior to being donated to the National Museums Scotland for <b>cataloguing</b> <b>and</b> <b>archiving.</b> The main purpose for collecting tissues and egg contents is for use in annual monitoring of pollutant concentrations by the PBMS. However, not all samples are used each year for chemical analyses and, even when samples are used, typically only a sub-sample is analysed. Samples that are not analysed or for which only a sub-sample is analysed are retained in the PBMS archive. Overall, the number of samples in the PBMS archive is approaching 50, 000 tissue and egg content samples. The material in the archive is used for research studies investigating chemical fate and behaviour, to trial new monitoring, and {{for a wide range of}} other studies, some of which are unrelated to pollutants. The purpose of this short report is to summarise the main holdings in the PBMS archive. This is done for the seven species for which we currently or used to obtain relatively large numbers of carcasses. We also draw attention to holdings of a small number of other species which may be of priority conservation concern. The information is broken down by type of sample that is held, the decade in which it was collected, and provenance as to whether samples were from England and Wales, or Scotland. In addition to information on numbers of samples from carcasses, we provide a description on the holdings for the number of egg contents for various species, again broken down by decade and provenance. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose ? The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects Web 2. 0 has on users' ability to browse online archive {{catalogues}} effectively. Design/methodology/approach ? Methods used included a review of the relevant scholarly literature, content analysis and semi?structured interviews with purposive samples of online <b>catalogues</b> <b>and</b> <b>archive</b> staff, respectively. Findings ? The Web 2. 0 technologies likely to improve browsability were identified. Web 2. 0 use was expected to be low, the results confirmed this. Results from the interviews showed that although Web 2. 0 may improve browsability for certain user groups, more fundamental improvements such as improved catalogue data were expected to be more effective. Interviewees did not see any clear benefits to Web 2. 0 implementation and had struggled to collect data on usage of some of the Web 2. 0 tools they used. Research limitations/implications ? The results provided confirmation of many points made in existing research. Data need to be collected from users if Web 2. 0 use and its effects on browsability are to be understood. At present the effects of Web 2. 0 on the browsability of online catalogues remains unclear. Originality/value ? This paper provides a starting point for further investigation into the effect of Web 2. 0 on the browsability of online catalogues. Web 2. 0 tools which could potentially improve browsability have been identified and a snapshot has been taken of their use across the sample cataloguesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Grids - {{infrastructure}} for using and managing widely distributed computing and data resources in the science environment - there is now an opportunity to provide a standard, large-scale, computing, data, instrument, and collaboration environment for science that spans many different projects and provides the required infrastructure and services in a relatively uniform and supportable way. Grid technology has evolved {{over the past several}} years to provide the services and infrastructure needed for building 'virtual' systems and organizations. We argue that Grid technology provides an excellent basis for the creation of the integrated environments that can combine the resources needed to support the large- scale science projects located at multiple laboratories and universities. We present some science case studies that indicate that a paradigm shift in the process of science will come about as a result of Grids providing transparent and secure access to advanced and integrated information and technologies infrastructure: powerful computing systems, large-scale data <b>archives,</b> scientific instruments, <b>and</b> collaboration tools. These changes will be in the form of services that can be integrated with the user's work environment, and that enable uniform and highly capable access to these computers, data, and instruments, regardless of the location or exact nature of these resources. These services will integrate transient-use resources like computing systems, scientific instruments, and data caches (e. g., as they are needed to perform a simulation or analyze data from a single experiment); persistent-use resources. such as databases, data <b>catalogues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>archives,</b> and; collaborators, whose involvement will continue for the lifetime of a project or longer.

40|$|The {{development}} and utilization of informational <b>archives</b> <b>and</b> databases started, in the Italian Astronet Project, {{in the middle}} of 1983. In that year, a small group of astronomers and some more technical people met together in an Astronet working group, with a common, painful experience in managing astronomical <b>catalogues</b> <b>and</b> <b>archives</b> with computers. Nowadays, some years later, some software packages and the contents of both, a relative general database and several local databases represent the work and the effort of the group. The systems have been conceived and developed keeping in mind the original goal of the group: to allow the single atronomer to make a free use of original data. The main package (DIRA) was rewritten, after some years of use, to fully take advantage of the several suggestions of the astronomer that used it and gathered experiences in the astronomical catalog's management. A more technical goal was to install the whole system, born and developed in the vms environment, on unix and unix-like systems. This new version, DIRA 2, has a new user interface, a query language with SQL style commands supporting numerical and character functions also and a set of commands to create new catalogues from existing data. The graphics commands are also more powerful with respect to the previous version. DIRA (and DIRA 2 of course) philosophy and design are very simple and proved to be very appreciated by astronomers, namely, to normalize and homogenize, at minimum, astronomical catalogues, to collect satisfactory astronomical documentation on their contents and, finally, to allow an astronomical approach to the dialogue with the database. DIRA 2 is currently used in most Italian astronomical institutes to retrieve data from a still growing database of about 140 well documented <b>and</b> controlled astronomical <b>catalogues,</b> for the identification of objects and the preparation of a 'medium size' survey, in astrometry and in the creation of new catalogues...|$|R
