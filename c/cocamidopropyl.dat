Objectives. To identify frequent allergens in children with and without atopic dermatitis suspected of having allergic {{contact dermatitis}}. Methods. A retrospective analysis of children aged 0 - 17 years patch tested between 1996 and 2013 was performed. Results. Of all 1012 children tested because of suspected contact dermatitis, 46 % developed one or more positive reactions, the proportions for children with (n= 526) and without (n= 395) atopic dermatitis being 48 % and 47 %, respectively. Children with atopic dermatitis reacted more often to lanolin alcohol (30 % pet., p= 0. 030), Amerchol L- 101 (p= 0. 030), and fragrances [fragrance mix I (p= 0. 048) and Myroxylon pereirae (p= 0. 005) ].

Paenan exhibits highly shear-thinning flow behavior at concentrations ≥ 0. 1 % in 0. 5 % NaCl. Because of its pronounced intermolecular network, it forms stable, weak gels, thereby delivering elasticity as well as thixotropy. Application-relevant flow behavior is obtained with 60 – 65 % less polymer as compared to the benchmark commercial products Xanthan and Gellan. In mixtures with surfactants (sodium lauryl ether sulfate, cetrimonium chloride, <b>cocamidopropyl</b> betaine, or lauryl glucoside), Paenan displays outstanding compatibility with every class of surfactant, making it superior to the partially incompatible Xanthan and Gellan.

Droplet surface angle measurements revealed that, following a period of acclimation of about 24 h, CAPB began to degrade and that primary degradation was complete within 120 h. Effective quantum yield (∆F/F(m) ') and relative growth rates (RGRs) were the most sensitive measures of phytotoxicity, with CAPB concentrations at and above 10 mg l(- 1) eliciting irreversible, time-dependent and/or dose-dependent responses. Cell membrane damage, estimated from measurements of ion leakage, was detected only at a concentration of 40 mg l(- 1) after 48 h of exposure to CAPB but by 120 h damage was evident at all measured concentrations above 10 mg l(- 1).

The incorporation of hydrophilic silica particles into the Ni composite coating during co-electrodeposition is so difficult due to the small size and the hydrophilicity of SiO 2 particle, generally less than 2 v% of silica is incorporated into the composite at different current densities, agitation speeds and silica concentrations. The effect {{of the presence of}} four surfactants, namely <b>cocamidopropyl</b> betaine (CAPB), decylglycoside (DG), cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) and ammonium lauryl ether sulfate (ALES), on overcoming this problem was investigated in this research, and the surfactants were found to greatly influence the surface charge of silica, silica incorporation percentage and the microstructure of the composite. In fact, upon increasing the internal stresses, the products prepared in the presence of CAPB and DG were found to crack to some degree. CTAC was found to lead to entrapment mode silica co-deposition in the Ni coating. Furthermore, the addition of ALES into an electrolyte bath negatively supercharged silica surfaces and increased silica dispersion, which led to a dramatic increase in the silica incorporation percentages to around 14 v%. The results showed that Ni–SiO 2 composites prepared in the presence of ALES had better corrosion resistance, hardness and wear properties.|$|E

Microbial populations are important factors to consider in remediation efforts due to their potential to alter soil geochemistry. This project focuses on measuring microbial metabolic responses to remediation amendments in batch and column studies using Deep Vadose Zone Sediments. Initial studies of the microbes from Hanford 200 area deep vadose zone sediment showed surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and <b>cocamidopropyl</b> betaine (CAPB) and remediation amendment calcium polysulfide (CPS) had no affect on microbial growth using BiologTM Ecoplates.

So the question arises—is the antimicrobial activity of oral rinses associated with any destructive changes in cell viability in vitro? To answer this question, we examined twelve oral rinses {{with respect to their}} antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. Antimicrobial activity was screened against five bacterial strains using disc diffusion. Cytotoxicity was determined by mitochondrial reductase activity with primary gingival fibroblasts, L 929 cells, and HSC- 2 epithelial cells.

Conclusive research {{on the extent of}} dangers for aquatic environments caused by PCPs is still scarce [36 – 39]. Extensive and continuous discharge of PCPs into the water compartment, however, gives reason for concern as some ingredients are biologically active compounds similar to pharmaceuticals [36]. Some PCPs are readily degraded; others are persistent [40]. For example, many studies have been conducted for synthetic musks highlighting their presence and stability in the environment and their (eco-)toxicological effects [41 – 43]. <b>Cocamidopropyl</b> betaine and lauryl alcohol, classified as dangerous for the aquatic environment, are frequently used as ingredients of PCPs such as shampoos. The amounts entering the aquatic compartment can be substantial making the relevant concentrations measurable, as is this case with the ingredients OTNE or HHCB [44]. As the number of ingredients in PCPs is massive, the task of assessing these risks is daunting and often beyond budget allocations, particularly in developing countries. Furthermore, the situation and research needs in developed countries compared to developing countries are impacted by different climatic conditions, different technical levels of water treatment and/or various portions of indirect reuse of water.

The aim of our study was to evaluate if the cytotoxic effect of SLS is reduced by the association with different tensides also at concentrations well below the CIVIC.

Surfactant was added either in a (1). temporally dynamic mode (1 - 3 g surfactant m(- 2) growing area d(- 1)) as effected by automatic addition of a 300 ppm surfactant solution to meet plant water demand, or (2). continuous mode (2 g surfactant m(- 2) growing area d(- 1)) as effected by slow addition (10 mLh(- 1)) of a 2000 ppm surfactant solution beginning at 4 d after planting. SLES showed rapid primary degradation in both experiments, with no accumulation 24 h after initial addition. CAPB and AE were degraded less rapidly, with 30 - 50 % remaining 24 h after initial addition, but CAPB and AE levels were below detection limit {{for the remainder of the}} study. No reductions in vegetative growth of wheat were observed in response to SLES, but biomass was reduced 20 - 25 % with CAPB and AE. Microbial communities associated with both the plant roots and wetted hardware surfaces actively degraded the surfactants, as determined by monitoring surfactant levels following pulse additions at day 20 (with plants) and day 21 (after plant removal). In order to test whether the biofilm communities could ameliorate phytotoxicity by providing a microbial community acclimated for CAPB and AE decay, the continuous exposure systems were planted with wheat seeds after crop removal at day 21. Acclimation resulted in faster primary degradation (> 90 % within 24 h) and reduced phytotoxicity.

As parameters for cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, cell membrane integrity and cell metabolism were assessed by cell counts, thymidine incorporation, MTT conversion, and Neutral Red uptake. In order to increase the sensitivity of the in vivo evaluation, bioengineering methods for assessment of the effects of test products on the skin were employed. Whereas all 4 in vitro methods ranked the tensides according to their toxicity in the following order: CAPB>SLS>TW 20 >TW 80, both in vivo methods agreed in identifying SLS as the most irritating substance. Moreover, as compared with the irritation potential on human skin, all 4 in vitro tests overestimated the toxicity of CAPB.

40|$|Addition {{of small}} amounts of lauric acid (LA) to a micellar {{solution}} of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 11. 5 wt%) and <b>cocamidopropyl</b> betaine (CAPB, 3 wt%) has a dramatic effect on the rheological properties and phase behaviour of the system. The viscosity increases {{by more than one}} order of magnitude up to a weight ratio LA/SDS = 0. 17 and decreases for further LA loading. The decrease in viscosity is associated to the formation of a birefringent liquid crystalline phase. The evolution of the system from isotropic micelles in absence of LA to lyotropic liquid crystals up to a weight ratio LA/SDS = 0. 30 was probed by a combination of 23 Na NMR quadrupolar splitting, measurements of water and surfactant self-diffusion coefficients via 1 H-PGSE-NMR and rheology. The evolution of the water self-diffusion coefficients indicates that LA induced a dramatic increase in the anisotropy of disk shaped micelles. Birefringent samples always showed a well developed 23 Na quadrupolar splitting with a line shape typical of monodomain samples. This suggests that the whole sample is easily oriented within the spectrometer electromagnet as usually observed for nematic liquid crystals. Sample spinning first destroys the alignment (only a single peak is discernible in the 23 Na NMR spectrum). Then, upon prolonged spinning, the alignment develops again. This indicates that the system is composed by disk-like micelles aligning themselves with their normal perpendicular to the magnetic field. On the other hand, the linear viscoelastic response close to the nematic transition shows features usually observed in wormlike micellar systems (e. g. nearly Maxwellian behaviour). To reconciliate the rheological data and the NMR evidences of discoid micelles, the formation of columnar stacks of discoid micelles is proposed. The rheology of the isotropic phase can therefore be interpreted in terms of entanglements of “living columnar stacks” of discoid micelles, and the nematic phase observed at high LA content could be attributed to a nematic columnar phase NCol formed by the alignment of such stacks...|$|E
