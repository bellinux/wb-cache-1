40|$|Background: <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> <b>L.</b> (Compositae) {{has been}} used in Iranian {{traditional}} medicine for treatment of diabetes. In this study, anti-diabetic effect of its hydroalcoholic extract was compared with that of glibenclamide. Methods: Male white Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups of six each: nondiabetic control; diabetic control; diabetic treated with hydroalcoholic extract of Carthamus tinctorius (200 mg kg - 1 BW); diabetic rats treated with glibenclamide (0. 6 mg kg - 1 BW). Alloxan was administered (120 mg kg - 1 BW), intraperitoneally to induce diabetes. Fasting blood samples were collected three times, before injection of alloxan, two weeks and six weeks after injection of alloxan and fasting blood sugar (FBS), Hb A 1 C, insulin, cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL-C, triglyceride, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured each time. Results: FBS, triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL-C and VLDL-C had a meaningful decrease in diabetic rats treated with Carthamus tinctorius and diabetic rats treated with glibenclamide as compared with diabetic rats with no treatment. Insulin level increased significantly in diabetic groups received treatment (glibenclamide or <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> <b>L)</b> in comparison with diabetic group with no treatment.

In this study, pulping and papermaking potential of three varieties of weeds including Xanthium spinosum, <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> and Cyperus papyrus have been considered.

According to the results, the amount cellulose, lignin and extractives have been measured for the Xanthium spinosum % 38. 15, % 13. 5 and 4. 72, respectively. Theses parameters have been estimated about % 38. 25, % 10. 3 and % 2. 95 for <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> and % 38. 8, % 19. 2 and 4. 4 in case of papyrus.

40|$|C-Glycosyl quinochalcones {{are unique}} {{components}} in <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> <b>L.</b> The reported C-glycosyl quinochalcones {{have the same}} quinochalcone skeleton with a hydroxyl group at the 5 '-position and a glucose linked to this position with a carbon-carbon bond. In this study, the standard hydroxysafflor yellow A and water-extracted fraction of <b>Carthamus</b> <b>tinctorius</b> <b>L.</b> were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOFMS) in {{both positive and negative}} ion modes. The fragmentation pathways of C-glycosyl quinochalcones were interpreted and validated by accurate mass measurement. Their fragmentation showed a special cleavage at the C-C bond except for the typical internal cleavage at the sugar moiety of other C-glycosyl flavonoids. In positive ion mode, cleavage of the 5 '-glucose produced an [M+H- 162](+) ion by a neutral loss, while cleavage of the 5 '-glucose in negative ion mode led to an [M-H- 163](-) ion by radical cleavage. The cleavage from the carbonyl group produced fragment ions containing an A or a B ring. The fragment ions containing an A ring were common product ions of seven compounds in both ion modes, and fragment ions containing the B ring were used to judge the different substituent groups at the 3 '-position. The fragmentation patterns of seven structurally related C-glycosyl quinochalcones were analyzed systematically and the formation of the fragment ions in two modes is explained in detail in this report. UPLC/Q-TOFMS is an effective tool for characterizing a complex sample, which gives higher resolution separation and generates accurate mass measurement of the product ions.
