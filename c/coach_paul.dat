5|$|Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis {{attended}} Ohio State University, {{where he}} joined the track and football teams. He {{was part of a}} Buckeyes football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State <b>coach,</b> <b>Paul</b> Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} the 1947 {{season with a}} 12–1–1 win-loss-tie record and beat the New York Yankees to win its second straight AAFC championship. While the team was successful in those {{first two years of}} existence, head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Brown made numerous roster changes before the 1948 season. He brought in linebacker Alex Agase and defensive tackle Chubby Grigg via a trade with the Chicago Rockets. Tommy James, a defensive back who stayed with the team through the 1955 season, came from the National Football League's Detroit Lions. Defensive back Warren Lahr also joined the team but did not play in 1948 after breaking a leg in the preseason.|$|E
5|$|The AAFC's Baltimore Colts signed Humble in 1947, but the Browns {{acquired}} {{him in a}} trade {{before the}} season. Humble became an anchor on Cleveland's offensive line, helping the team win three straight AAFC titles in the late 1940s. When the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Cleveland moved to the NFL and won another championship in 1950. Humble, who remained in the Marine Reserves, was called into service in the Korean War after the season. He was expected to return to Cleveland the following year, but head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Brown traded him to the Texans before the 1952 season began. He retired after one year in Dallas.|$|E

5|$|The Midshipmen, using {{a triple}} option {{offensive}} scheme under head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Johnson, had gained the most rushing yards of {{any team in}} the nation and had a record of 4–4 through the first eight games of the season. In their ninthgame the team defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in triple overtime, ending a 43-year losing streak in the Notre Dame–Navy rivalry and improving the team's record to 5–4. With threegames remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least one more to become bowl eligible. Sponsors had arranged for Navy (which was unaffiliated with any college football conference) to play in the Poinsettia Bowl if they won six games. The Midshipmen defense allowed an average of 38.8 points per game.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{independent}} Navy Midshipmen, {{who finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 9–2 record, accepted an invitation {{to play in the}} game on November 22, 2004. Eight days later, the 7–4 New Mexico Lobos agreed to fill the open spot reserved for a Mountain West Conference team. Leading up to the game, sports writers predicted that a major highlight of the contest would be the rushing offenses of Midshipmen head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Johnson and Lobos head coach Rocky Long; both teams ranked in the top rushing offenses in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The Lobos also ranked as one of the nation's top rushing defenses.|$|E
5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E

5|$|Following that loss, Virginia Tech {{head coach}} Frank Beamer {{announced}} that backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor, {{who had previously}} been expected to sit out the season on redshirt status, would play in the Hokies' second game, against Furman. Both Taylor and starting quarterback Sean Glennon performed well against the Paladins, and Tech won, 24–7. Tech's third game came against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, who were employing a new offensive system, the option offense, under first-year head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Johnson. Unlike the game against Furman, Taylor started the game and remained at quarterback throughout, guiding the Hokies to their first ACC victory of the season, a 20–17 win that later gave Tech a crucial head-to-head tiebreaker against the Yellow Jackets, fellow members of the Coastal Division. The Hokies' fourth {{game of the season}} came against the North Carolina Tar Heels, who were defeated by the same margin of victory as Tech's win against Georgia Tech, 20–17.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2013, the Wolves {{announced}} that Owumi would be returning for another {{season with the}} team. Head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> James hoped to build the team around the Nigerian guard in their upcoming season.

On September 28, 2013, to start his second BBL season, Owumi scored 18 points and added two rebounds and two assists in a 117–60 win over the Surrey Scorchers. On December 1, Owumi scored a season-high 30 points to guide the Wolves past the Durham Wildcats. In a rematch with Durham on January 10, 2014, Owumi notched 27 points to extend his team's winning streak to seven. On March 31, he put up 11 points as the Wolves defeated the Glasgow Rocks to win the BBL Trophy. In May, Worcester also claimed the BBL Championship title behind Owumi's 14 points and six rebounds. By the end of the season, he was averaging 17.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.3 steals in BBL Championship play.|$|E
5|$|The win {{lifted the}} Midshipmen's record for that season to 10–2, Navy's second 10-win season {{in its history}} and first in 99 years. It was the first bowl game victory for the Midshipmen since the 1996 Aloha Bowl. As {{a result of the}} win, the team {{finished}} the season ranked 24th in both the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Poll, the first time since 1978 that the Midshipmen finished the season ranked in any major poll. For his coaching accomplishments that year, head <b>coach</b> <b>Paul</b> Johnson was awarded the 2004 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. The next season, Navy played in the inaugural 2005 Poinsettia Bowl, defeating the Colorado State Rams 51–30. In November 2012, Navy accepted an invitation to Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, the newest name for the Emerald Bowl, based on the team's positive experiences from this game.|$|E
