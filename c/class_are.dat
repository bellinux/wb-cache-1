40|$|The {{research}} of land capability classification survey is {{held on the}} area of water capturing (DTA) of Danau Toba. Land capability classification is fulfilled by using scoring methods based on the land unit in DTA of Danau Toba.

5|$|All {{the ships}} of this <b>class</b> <b>are</b> built using DMR 249A special grade high-tensile steel, {{produced}} by the state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. The main machinery is raft mounted, and each gear unit and its associated engines are mounted on a common raft. The diesel engines are license built by Kirloskar under SEMT Pielstick of France. DCNS supplies the noise-suppressing raft-mounted gearbox for CODAD propulsion. Wärtsilä India manufactures the low-vibration diesel alternators to power the on-board electronics.|$|E
5|$|During the Croatian War of Independence one ship, Vlado Ćetković, was {{captured}} by Croatian forces while being overhauled. It was eventually commissioned with the Croatian Navy as Šibenik and is still in use. The remaining five ships were relocated to Montenegro, entering service with the new FR Yugoslav Navy, with three of them being decommissioned in the early 2000s. The last two ships of the <b>class</b> <b>are</b> planned to be modified as patrol boats for service with the Montenegrin Navy.|$|E

No individual drug <b>class</b> <b>was</b> associated with TSPO binding (all p[*]>[*]. 10).

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size <b>class</b> <b>are</b> small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper <b>class</b> <b>are</b> front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
50|$|A <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{stationary}} {{if it has}} a nonempty intersection {{with every}} closed unbounded class. All superclasses of closed unbounded <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> stationary, and stationary <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> unbounded, but there <b>are</b> stationary <b>classes</b> that <b>are</b> not closed and stationary classes that have no closed unbounded subclass (such as the class of all limit ordinals with countable cofinality). Since the intersection of two closed unbounded <b>classes</b> <b>is</b> closed and unbounded, the intersection of a stationary class and a closed unbounded <b>class</b> <b>is</b> stationary. But the intersection of two stationary <b>classes</b> may <b>be</b> empty, e.g. the class of ordinals with cofinality ω with the class of ordinals with uncountable cofinality.|$|R
