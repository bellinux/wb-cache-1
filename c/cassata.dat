25|$|British {{traditions that}} {{live on in}} Malta include an {{efficient}} civil service, a military {{that is based on}} the British model, a Westminster-style parliamentary structure, a governmental structure premised on the rule of law, and a legal system based on common law. Another British legacy in Malta is the widely popular annual Christmas pantomime at the Manoel Theatre. Most Maltese families have adopted turkey and plum pudding as Christmas treats in place of the more traditional Maltese rooster and <b>cassata.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{well-known}} part of Sicilian cuisine is the rich sweet dishes including ice creams and pastries. Cannoli (singular: cannolo), a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough filled with a sweet filling usually containing ricotta cheese, is in particular strongly associated with Sicily worldwide. Biancomangiare, biscotti ennesi (cookies native to Enna), braccilatte (a Sicilian version of doughnuts), buccellato, ciarduna, pignoli, bruccellati, sesame seed cookies, a sweet confection with sesame seeds and almonds (torrone in Italy) is cubbaita, frutta martorana, <b>cassata,</b> pignolata, granita, cuccidati (a variety of fig cookie; also known as buccellati) and cuccìa are amongst {{some of the most}} notable sweet dishes.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} a long history of {{producing}} a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed God's Kitchen because of this. Every part of Sicily has its speciality (for example <b>Cassata</b> is typical of Palermo, even if available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita, a Catania speciality). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be healthy, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, aubergines, onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the success of}} Italian cuisine is its heavy {{reliance}} on traditional products; Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with coffee (especially espresso) make up {{a very important part of}} the Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and <b>cassata</b> are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.|$|E
500|$|In {{northern}} France, a wide {{assortment of}} {{waffles and wafers}} was eaten with cheese and hypocras or a sweet malmsey as issue de table ("departure from the table"). The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as épices de chambre ("parlor spices") and were taken as digestibles {{at the end of}} a meal to [...] "close" [...] the stomach. Like their Muslim counterparts in Al-Andalus|Spain]], the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe. Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its comfits, nougat candy (torrone, or turrón in Spanish) and almond clusters (confetti). From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries; <b>cassata</b> alla Siciliana (from Arabic qas'ah, the term for the terra cotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, sponge cake and sweetened ricotta and cannoli alla Siciliana, originally cappelli di turchi ("Turkish hats"), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.|$|E
2500|$|The Sicilian {{influence}} on Maltese culture is extensive, and is especially {{evident in the}} local cuisine, {{with its emphasis on}} olive oil, pasta, seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables (especially the tomato), traditional appetizers such as caponata (Maltese: [...] "kapunata") and rice balls (arancini), speciality dishes such as rice timbale (Maltese: [...] "ross fil-forn"), and sweets such as the <b>cassata</b> and kannoli.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cassata</b> was {{established}} in 1975 as an alternative school for {{students who did not}} respond to a traditional educational environment. <b>Cassata</b> High School was started as the vision of Sister Bonaventure Magnan. She wished to create a school where students could obtain an education despite barriers which they faced in their lives. The school started in Fort Worth (still in its original location) within the building donated by the Laneri family, which opened as the Laneri College. Laneri College closed with the creation of Nolan Catholic High School. Sister Bonaventure used the vacant building to open <b>Cassata</b> High School. She petitioned the then Bishop of Fort Worth, Bishop <b>Cassata,</b> to open the school. He denied her petition, but she opened the school without sanction during his absence from the Diocese while he travelled. [...] He had trouble closing the school upon his return due to it being dedicated to him. To date, more than 3,000 students have graduated from <b>Cassata</b> High School.|$|E

5000|$|... in Israel, {{ice cream}} {{sandwich}} is {{commonly known as}} [...] "Kasata" [...] (קסטה in Hebrew).

5000|$|In {{and around}} Northeast Ohio, {{particularly}} in the Cleveland area, the term [...] "cassata cake" [...] refers to a sponge cake soaked in syrup or rum, filled with strawberries and custard, and covered with sweetened whipped cream. This Cleveland version of the <b>cassata</b> {{first appeared in the}} early 1920s at LaPuma Spumoni & Bakery in Cleveland. The children of the owners did not like traditional <b>cassata</b> cake, made with sweetened ricotta, chocolate chips, and candied fruit. Using what they had in the bakery, Tomasso LaPuma created what was to become known as the Cleveland <b>cassata</b> cake. The fifth generation of this bakery, now located in the city's eastern suburb of Chesterland, still continues to make the original version of this cake, as do many other Italian bakeries in the area.|$|E
