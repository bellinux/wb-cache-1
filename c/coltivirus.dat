25|$|<b>Coltivirus</b> is a genus of viruses. Viruses are {{intracellular}} parasites that do {{not have}} the necessary means to reproduce on their own, so they have to hijack the machinery of a host cell instead. Only then can they synthesize their viral proteins and make progeny. There are two types of viruses, distinguished by their type of genetic material. DNA viruses have genomes consisting of deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA), while RNA viruses, like <b>Coltivirus,</b> have an RNA (ribonucleic acid) genome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coltivirus</b> is a genus {{of viruses}} (belonging to the Reoviridae family) that infects vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. It {{includes}} the causative agent of Colorado tick fever. Colorado tick fever virus {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, photophobia, myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. Children, in particular, may develop a hemorrhagic disease. Leukopenia with both lymphocytes and neutrophils is very common for Colorado tick fever virus. In either case, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Coltivirus</b> virions {{are about}} 60-80 {{nanometers}} {{in diameter and}} are not enveloped, and are generally a spherical shape with icosahedral symmetry. Each virion has two concentric capsid shells surrounding a core of about 50 nanometers in diameter. The surface of the particle is relatively smooth. The virus loses its infectivity when the surrounding fluid becomes acidic, around a pH of three, but is stable when the pH is between seven and eight. It also stops being a threat when the temperature becomes about fifty-five degrees Celsius.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coltiviruses</b> have twelve {{segments}} of linear, double-stranded RNA. When the genome is processed with gel electrophoresis, the segments migrate as three class sizes (three bands). Each segment is replicated, {{and the largest}} segment encodes RNA polymerase. Locations of other proteins along the genome {{have yet to be}} determined.|$|R
25|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} virus can be {{detected}} in a patient with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), where even a single virion and its genetic material {{can be detected}}. The antigens to the virus can also be detected using immunofluorescence. There is currently no known vaccine or treatment available to treat these <b>Coltiviruses,</b> but 3'-fluors-3'-deoxyadanosine, a nucleoside analog, halts replication of Colorado tick fever virus in vitro.|$|R
25|$|The main {{species of}} <b>Coltivirus,</b> Colorado tick fever virus (CTF), infects the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). This species of tick {{can be found}} in areas with shrubs, lightly wooded locations, grasslands, and on hiking or biking trails. All life stages of this tick can infect {{vertebrates}} with Colorado tick fever virus (larva, nymph, and adult). Unfortunately, mature D. andersoni prefer to feed on medium or large mammals that are walking around the knee-high plants. Oftentimes, this infection takes place when the tick larvae feed on rodents, like squirrels, that are already infected with virus. The tick's saliva then contains the virus, and it becomes infectious for life. The adult tick then transmits the virus to humans through a bite, where it infects bone marrow cells.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Coltivirus" [...] {{is derived}} from the main member in the family, the Colorado tick fever virus ("Colorado tick"). <b>Coltivirus</b> is in the family Reoviridae, which {{contains}} eight genera. Orthoreovirus, Orbivirus, <b>Coltivirus,</b> Rotavirus, Aquareovirus, Cypovirus, Phytoreovirus, and Fijivirus. [...] <b>Coltivirus</b> and Orbivirus together contain about 109 serotypes, and only four of these cause human disease. Ticks are the main vectors of Coltiviruses (5). The type species of <b>Coltivirus</b> is Colorado tick fever virus, but European Eyach virus is another member of the genus. Colorado tick fever was originally recorded in the 19th century, and today {{it is one of the}} most common tick-borne diseases in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Eyach virus (EYAV) is a viral {{infection}} (genus <b>Coltivirus)</b> in the Reoviridae family transmitted by a tick vector. It has been isolated from Ixodes ricinus and I. ventalloi ticks in Europe. It {{is closely related}} to Colorado tick fever virus, the type virus of <b>Coltivirus.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Coltiviruses</b> {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm {{in cells}} of both arthropods and vertebrates, {{but they are}} only transmitted by the arthropods. When the virus replicates, the virion outer shell has to be removed in order for RNA polymerase to be activated to continue the replication of the virion's RNA. Reassortment of the RNA segments in progeny is common, and this {{plays a role in}} some of the genetic diversity between the serotypes. Sometimes, this can lead to fast changes in the properties of the viruses.|$|R
50|$|The virus particle, {{like other}} <b>coltiviruses,</b> is about 80 nm in {{diameter}} and is generally not enveloped. The double-stranded RNA viral genome is about 20,000 bp long and is divided into 12 segments, which are termed Seg-1 to Seg-12. Viral replication in infected cells is associated with characteristic cytoplasmic granular matrices. Evidence suggests viral presence in mature erythrocytes {{is a result of}} replication of the virus in hematopoitic erythrocyte precursor cells and simultaneous maturation of the infected immature cells rather than of direct entry and replication of CTFV in mature erythrocytes.|$|R
40|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} (CTF) virus elicits an acute illness in humans, {{producing}} nonspecific flu-like symptoms and a biphasic fever in approximately 50 % of patients. The disease is transmitted by the adult Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and therefore incidence {{is limited by}} the habitat and life cycle of that vector. The early symptoms of infection are difficult to distinguish from those of several other agents, especially Rickettsia rickettsii. Serologic testing is usually unable to provide evidence of CTF viral infection during the acute phase because of the late appearance of the various antibodies. Here we report the development and clinical application of a test to diagnose this disease during the acute stages. Oligonucleotide primers to the S 2 segment of CTF (Florio) virus were made, and these were used in the amplification of a 528 -bp fragment of DNA, transcribed from the double-stranded CTF virus RNA template by reverse transcriptase PCR. RNAs processed from 16 CTF virus isolates yielded similar results when analyzed on agarose gels. These were distinguishable from their antigenic relatives Eyach, S 6 - 14 - 03, and T 5 - 2092 and from other <b>coltiviruses</b> and an orbivirus but not from the antigenically distinct CTF virus-related isolate 720896. A mouse model demonstrated the utility of this method with whole-blood specimens, and CTF virus was successfully detected in human sera from the initial day of the onset of symptoms to 8 days later. The reverse transcriptase PCR method is a promising tool for the early diagnosis of CTF viral infection, or for ruling out CTF virus as th...|$|R

40|$|Coltiviruses are tickborne viruses of {{the genus}} <b>Coltivirus.</b> The type species, Colorado tick fever virus (from North America), has been {{isolated}} from patients with flulike syndromes, meningitis, encephalitis, and other severe complications. Another <b>coltivirus,</b> Eyach virus, has been isolated from ticks in France and Germany and incriminated in febrile illnesses and neurologic syndromes. Seadornaviruses are endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and China. The prototype virus {{of the genus}}, Banna virus (BAV), has been isolated from many mosquito species, humans with encephalitis, pigs, and cattle. Two other seadornaviruses, Kadipiro and Liao Ning, were isolated only from mosquitoes. The epidemiology of seadornaviruses remains poorly documented. Evidence suggests that BAV is responsible for encephalitis in humans. Infection with BAV may be underreported because it circulates in regions with {{a high incidence of}} Japanese encephalitis and could be misdiagnosed as this disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Molecular and serologic methods usable for the {{biological}} diagnosis of <b>Coltivirus</b> infection are reported. We designed a multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction system {{that allowed the}} simultaneous and specific amplification of three genomic segments from as little as 0. 01 plaque-forming units. Another system in the S 2 viral segment permitted the differential diagnosis of American and European viral isolates. We also discuss some improvements of previous ELISAs, and the results obtained with paired sera from Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus– infected individuals. Western blot analysis was developed that allowed the detection of antibodies to a 38 -kD viral protein in all tested sera. It also enabled the detection of anti-CTF virus antibodies in ELISA-negative sera. Specific IgM antibodies against a synthetic viral peptide could be detected in sera at the acute stage of the infection. Together, these results should permit the diagnosis of <b>Coltivirus</b> infection at any stage of the pathology. Colorado tick fever (CTF) is a severe tick-borne disease that is usually self-limited. This disease occurs in 11 western states in the United States and has also been reported in Canada. 1 Yearly, 200 – 400 cases are reported throughout the endemic states in the United States. 1, 2 The clinical manifes-tations appear following the bite of the infected adult Rock...|$|E

40|$|VP 6, VP 7, VP 9, VP 10, VP 11, and VP 12 of Colorado {{tick fever}} virus (CTF virus), a virus {{member of the}} genus <b>Coltivirus,</b> family Reoviridae, were {{expressed}} in bacteria with the pGEX- 4 T- 2 vector. A partial sequence of VP 7 (designated pVP 7) was chosen to elaborate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-CTF virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in humans. This was based on two observations: (i) among all expressed proteins, pVP 7 showed the highest immunoreactivity to an anti-CTF virus hyperimmune ascitic fluid; (ii) to provide the highest selectivity of antibody detection, the expressed sequence was chosen within a region which is highly divergent (49 % amino acid identity) from the homologous sequence of another <b>coltivirus,</b> the Eyach virus. The pVP 7 ELISA was evaluated with 368 serum samples from French blood donors and found to provide 98. 1 % specificity. Assays with the Calisher set of human serum samples, positive for anti-CTF virus antibodies (C. H. Calisher, J. D. Poland, S. B. Calisher, and L. A Warmoth, J. Clin. Microbiol. 22 : 84 - 88, 1985), showed that the pVP 7 ELISA provided 100 % sensitivity for the tested population.

40|$|ABSTRACTSeveral human {{diseases}} in Europe {{are caused by}} viruses transmitted by tick bite. These viruses belong to the genus Flavivirus, and include tick-borne encephalitis virus, Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus, louping ill virus, Powassan virus, Nairovirus (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus) and <b>Coltivirus</b> (Eyach virus). All of these viruses cause more or less severe neurological diseases, and some are also responsible for haemorrhagic fever. The epidemiology, clinical picture and methods for diagnosis are detailed in this review. Most of these viral pathogens are classified as Biosafety Level 3 or 4 agents, and therefore {{some of them have}} been classified in Categories A–C of potential bioterrorism agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Their ability to cause severe disease in man means that these viruses, as well as any clinical samples suspected of containing them, must be handled with specific and stringent precautions...|$|E
40|$|RNA viruses of {{filamentous}} fungi {{fall into}} two broad categories, those that contain double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes in rigid particles {{and those that are}} more closely related to positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with dsRNA replicative intermediates found within lipid vesicles. Effective infectivity systems have been described for the latter, using RNA transcripts, but not for the former. We report the characterization of a reovirus from Cryphonectria parasitica, the filamentous fungus that causes chestnut blight disease. The virus substantially reduces the virulence of the fungus and results in dramatically altered colony morphology, as well as changes in other associated fungal traits, relative to the virus-free isogenic strain. Virus particles from infected mycelium contained 11 segments of dsRNA and showed characteristics typical of the family Reoviridae. Sequences of the largest three segments revealed that the virus is closely related to the <b>Coltivirus</b> genus of animal pathogens, which includes the human pathogen Colorado tick fever virus. The introduction of purified virus particles into protoplasts from virus-free isolates of the fungus resulted in a newly infected mycelium with the same morphology and virus composition as the original virus-infected isolate. This represents the completion of Koch's postulates for a true dsRNA virus from a filamentous fungus and the description of a definitive fungal member of the family Reoviridae...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn aquareovirus was {{isolated}} from several fish {{species in the}} USA (including healthy golden shiners) that is not closely related to members of species Aquareovirus A, B and C. The virus, which is atypical (does not cause syncytia in cell cultures at neutral pH), was implicated in a winter die-off of grass carp fingerlings and has therefore been called ‘American grass carp reovirus’ (AGCRV). Complete nucleotide sequence analysis of the AGCRV genome and comparisons to the other aquareoviruses showed that it {{is closely related to}} golden ide reovirus (GIRV) (> 92 % amino acid [aa] identity in VP 5 (NTPase) and VP 2 (Pol)). However, comparisons with grass carp reovirus (Aquareovirus C) and chum salmon reovirus (Aquareovirus A) showed only 22 % to 76 % aa identity in different viral proteins. These findings have formed the basis for the recognition of AGCRV and GIRV as members of a new Aquareovirus species ‘Aquareovirus G’ by ICTV. Further sequence comparisons to other members of the family Reoviridae suggest that there has been an ‘evolutionary jump,’ involving a change in the number of genome segments, between the aquareoviruses (11 segments) and coltiviruses (12 segments). Segment 7 of AGRCV encodes two proteins, from two distinct ORFs, which are homologues of two <b>Coltivirus</b> proteins encoded by genome segments 9 and 12. A similar model has previously been reported for the rotaviruses and seadornaviruses...|$|E
40|$|Of {{more than}} 500 arboviruses {{recognized}} worldwide, 5 were first isolated in Canada and 58 were first {{isolated in the}} United States. Six of these viruses are human pathogens: western equine encephalitis (WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and Powassan (POW) viruses (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), LaCrosse (LAC) virus (Bunyaviridae, Bunyavirus), and Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus (Reoviridae, <b>Coltivirus).</b> Their scientific histories, geographic distributions, virology, epidemiology, vectors, vertebrate hosts, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical and differential diagnoses, control, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis are reviewed. In addition, mention is made of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), which periodically cause human and equine disease in North America. WEE, EEE, and SLE viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds; POW and CTF viruses, between wild mammals by ticks; LAC virus, between small mammals by mosquitoes; and VEE viruses, between small or large mammals by mosquitoes. Human infections are tangential to the natural cycle. Such infections range from rare to focal but are relatively frequent where they occur. Epidemics of WEE, EEE, VEE, and SLE viruses have been recorded at periodic intervals, but prevalence of infections with LAC and CTF viruses typically are constant, related {{to the degree of}} exposure to infected vectors. Infections with POW virus appear to be rare. Adequate diagnostic tools are available, but treatment is mainly supportive, and greater efforts at educating the public and the medical community are suggested if infections are to be prevented...|$|E
