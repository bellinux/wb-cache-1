5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast again showed Banksia coccinea {{to be the}} next closest relative of a group comprising Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri and only distantly related to other members of the series Banksia. This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> and combining it with earlier results.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast showed Banksia sceptrum and B.ashbyi to be each other's closest relatives, the two {{lying in a}} larger group {{made up of the}} members of the subseries Cratistylis plus Banksia lindleyana. This was reinforced in a 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> and combining it with earlier results.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B.ser. Tetragonae. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> and combining it with earlier results found that B.aculeata was sister to B.lemanniana and that B.caleyi was the next closest relative.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> {{of higher}} {{plants have been}} found to contain two {{chloroplast}} ribosomal RNA genes. The base sequences of these chloroplast ribosomal RNA genes in <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> have been studied by molecular hybridization. The results have shown that these genes have undergone little divergence in the evolution of either monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous plants...|$|R
25|$|Many <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> contain two {{inverted}} repeats, which separate a long {{single copy}} section (LSC) from a short single copy section (SSC).|$|R
25|$|The {{inverted}} repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. Similar {{inverted repeat}}s {{exist in the}} genomes of cyanobacteria {{and the other two}} chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceae), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.|$|R
5|$|Techniques {{based on}} DNA {{comparison}} suggest Aloe vera is relatively {{closely related to}} Aloe perryi, a species endemic to Yemen. Similar techniques, using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have also suggested it {{is closely related to}} Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata. With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan. The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> is not {{associated}} with true histones, in red algae, similar proteins that tightly pack each <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> ring into a nucleoid have been found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> are circular, and are {{typically}} 120,000-170,000 base pairs long. They {{can have a}} contour length of around 30-60 micrometers, and have a mass of about 80-130 million daltons.|$|R
50|$|The {{inverted}} repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. Similar {{inverted repeat}}s {{exist in the}} genomes of cyanobacteria {{and the other two}} chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> like those of peas and a few red algae have since lost the inverted repeats. Others, like the red alga Porphyra flipped one of its inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.|$|R
40|$|Chromatographically {{distinct}} isoacceptors of leucyl-tRNA from mature bean {{leaves were}} all observed to hybridize with bean <b>chloroplast</b> and nuclear <b>DNA</b> in a ratio {{similar to that}} exhibited by the unfractionated leucyl-tRNA. Under the same hybridization conditions, maize tRNA failed to form a stable hybrid with bean DNA, and levels of hybridization between bean-leaf leucyl-tRNA and nuclear or <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> from tobacco and maize were relatively small...|$|R
25|$|New chloroplasts {{may contain}} up to 100 copies of their DNA, though {{the number of}} <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> copies {{decreases}} to about 15–20 as the chloroplasts age. They are usually packed into nucleoids, which can contain several identical <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> rings. Many nucleoids {{can be found in}} each chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|The {{chloroplast}} genome {{most commonly}} includes around 100 genes that code {{for a variety}} of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis. As in prokaryotes, genes in <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> are organized into operons. Interestingly though, unlike prokaryotic DNA molecules, <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules contain introns (plant mitochondrial DNAs do too, but not human mtDNAs).|$|E
25|$|While usually {{thought of}} as a {{circular}} molecule, {{there is some evidence that}} <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules more often take on a linear shape.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> contain two {{inverted}} repeats, which separate a long {{single copy}} section (LSC) from a short single copy section (SSC).While a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, {{they are always}} very similar to each other, apparently resulting from concerted evolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} {{chemically}} synthesized deoxyoligonucleotides as hybridization probes {{for the detection}} of tRNA genes has been examined. Chloroplast tRNA genes were chosen for this study. Deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to highly conserved regions of chloroplast tRNA genes of both higher plants and Euglena gracilis were chemically synthesized. These synthetic probes have been used to detect tRNA genes by Southern hybridizations to restriction fragments of <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs.</b> This new method of tRNA gene mapping and the oligonucleotides synthesized may be of general application to many chloroplast genomes. This is illustrated by the detection of known and unknown tRNA genes of Euglena gracilis and spinach, and unknown tRNA genes of maize and cucumber <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The precise locus and polarity of the Euglena gracilis chloroplast tRNAPhe gene has been determined. We also describe experiments which relate to the effects of the time of hybridization, the stringency of washing, and of base pair mismatches on the hybridization signal...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} Brassica campestris mitochondrial and <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> from whole {{plants and}} from a 2 -year-old cell culture. No differences were observed in the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> (cpDNAs), whereas the culture mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was extensively altered. Hybridization analysis revealed that the alterations are due entirely to rearrangement. At least two inversions and one large duplication {{are found in the}} culture mtDNA. The duplication element is shown to have the usual properties of a plant mtDNA high frequency “recombination repeat”. The culture mtDNA exists as a complex heterogeneous population of rearranged and unrearranged molecules. Some of the culture-associated rearranged molecules are present in low levels in native plant tissue and appear to have sorted out and amplified in the culture. Other mtDNA rearrangements may have occurred de novo. In addition to alterations of the main mitochondrial genome, an 11. 3 kb linear mtDNA plasmid present in whole plants is absent from the culture. Contrary to findings in cultured cells of other plants, small circular mtDNA molecules were not detected in the B. campestris cell culture...|$|R
25|$|Currently, few {{extensive}} phylogenetic {{studies of}} the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker et al. explored subfamily and tribe relationships using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested {{the lack of a}} fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, homoplasy in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard DNA markers, and character polarization. However, hybridization has been observed among Orbignya and Phoenix species, and using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> in cladistic studies may produce inaccurate results due to maternal inheritance of the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA.</b> Chemical and molecular data from non-organelle DNA, for example, could be more effective for studying palm phylogeny.|$|E
25|$|In {{primitive}} red algae, the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> nucleoids {{are clustered}} {{in the center}} of the chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma.|$|E
25|$|Passion flowers {{have been}} a subject of studies {{investigating}} extranuclear inheritance; paternal inheritance of <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> has been documented in this genus. The plastome of the two-flowered passion flower (P. biflora) has been sequenced.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chloroplast</b> and {{mitochondrial}} <b>DNAs</b> {{from six}} races of annual teosinte (Guatemala, Huehuetenango, Balsas, Central Plateau, Chalco, and Nobogame), perennial teosinte, and maize were compared and grouped by restriction endonuclease fragment analyses. Three groups of <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> were detected: (i) perennial teosinte and Guatemala; (ii) Balsas and Huehuetenango; and (iii) all other teosintes. Four groups of mitochondrial DNAs were separated: (i) perennial teosinte; (ii) Guatemala; (iii) Nobogame; and (iv) all other teosintes. Separation of the teosinte and maize organelle DNAs into five groups (Guatemala; perennial teosinte; Balsas and Huehuetenango; Central Plateau and Chalco; Nobogame and maize) approximated the biosystematic relationships of the taxa. It was {{suggested that the}} evolutions of the <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNAs</b> may be independent of each other, that variation of organelle DNA within a species complex of an organism may be the common condition, and that the DNAs of the organelle and nuclear systems evolve in reasonable harmony...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of Candida albicans {{contains a}} large inverted duplication. As {{is the case}} with most <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> and one other mtDNA, the nonduplicated regions of the molecule occur in two orientations with respect to each other, indicating that internal recombination occurs. Like some other mtDNAs, the C. albicans mtDNA contains a single SalI restriction site located near one end of the large rRNA gene. In contrast to other cases, however, the inverted duplication does not appear to contain any sequences coding for rRNA...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{and digital}} imaging allow the selective visualisation and quantification of cellular components and can convey research findings in an appealing and intuitive way. These techniques are regularly used in biomedical research laboratories, but have less widespread application in marine sciences. We present here {{an approach to}} label and volumetrically quantify neutral lipids, <b>chloroplasts,</b> <b>DNA</b> and cell volumes in microalgae. Using fluorescence microscopy techniques on “turn-key” systems commonly available to environmental research labs, imaging facilities or accessible groups in other disciplines ensure that this approach can be widely reproduced...|$|R
25|$|A 2013 {{molecular}} {{study by}} Cardillo and colleagues using <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> found that B.rosserae was sister species to a clade {{made up of}} Banksia meisneri adscendens and Banksia pulchella, and the three together were sister to Banksia meisneri meisneri.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> (cpDNA) replication {{has not been}} conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led {{to the idea that}} <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mechanisms}} prevent biparental <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> inheritance, including selective {{destruction of}} chloroplasts or their genes within the gamete or zygote, and chloroplasts from one parent being {{excluded from the}} embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.|$|E
50|$|Grafting can {{transfer}} <b>chloroplasts</b> (specialised <b>DNA</b> in plants that can conduct photosynthesis), mitichondrial DNA {{and the entire}} cell nucleus containing the genome to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural genetic engineering.|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} DNA methylation of plastid DNA from {{fully ripened}} red fruits, green mature fruits, and green leaves of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Firstmore). Essentially identical restriction profiles were obtained between chromoplast and <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> by EcoRI digestion. BstNI/EcoRII and HpaII/MspI are pairs of isoschizomers that can discriminate between methylated and unmethylated DNAs. These endonucleases produced different restriction patterns of plastid DNAs from tomato fruits compared to tomato leaves. Moreover, {{we have found}} from Southern blots that methylation was not detected in DNA fragments containing certain genes that are actively expressed in chromoplasts, whereas DNA fragments bearing genes that are barely transcribed in chromoplasts are methylated...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the chloroplast genome (150, 613 bp) from the unicellular green alga Chlorella vulgaris C- 27 has been determined. The genome contains no large inverted repeat and has one copy of rRNA gene cluster consisting of 16 S, 23 S, and 5 S rRNA genes. It contains 31 tRNA genes, of which the tRNALeu(GAG) gene has not been found in land plant <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs</b> analyzed so far. Sixty-nine protein genes and eight ORFs conserved with those found in land plant chloroplasts have also been found. The most striking is the existence of two adjacent genes homologous to bacterial genes involved in cell division, minD and minE, which are arranged {{in the same order}} in Escherichia coli. This finding suggests that the mechanism of chloroplast division is similar to bacterial division. Other than minD and minE homologues, genes encoding ribosomal proteins L 5, L 12, L 19, and S 9 (rpl 5, rpl 12, rpl 19, and rps 9); a chlorophyll biosynthesis Mg chelating subunit (chlI); and elongation factor EF-Tu (tufA), which have not been reported from land plant <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNAs,</b> are present in this genome. However, many of the new chloroplast genes recently found in red and brown algae have not been found in C. vulgaris. Furthermore, this algal species possesses two long ORFs related to ycf 1 and ycf 2 that are exclusively found in land plants. These observations suggest that C. vulgaris is closer to land plants than to red and brown algae...|$|R
25|$|In land plants, some 11–14% of the DNA {{in their}} nuclei {{can be traced}} back to the chloroplast, up to 18% in Arabidopsis, {{corresponding}} to about 4,500 protein-coding genes. There have been a few recent transfers of genes from the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> to the nuclear genome in land plants.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{synthesis}} within chloroplasts {{relies on}} two RNA polymerases. One is coded by the <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{the other is}} of nuclear origin. The two RNA polymerases may recognize and bind to different kinds of promoters within the chloroplast genome. The ribosomes in chloroplasts are similar to bacterial ribosomes.|$|E
25|$|Late {{into the}} {{constriction}} phase, dynamin proteins assemble around the outer plastid-dividing ring, helping provide force {{to squeeze the}} chloroplast. Meanwhile, the Z-ring and the inner plastid-dividing ring break down. During this stage, the many <b>chloroplast</b> <b>DNA</b> plasmids floating around in the stroma are partitioned and distributed to the two forming daughter chloroplasts.|$|E

This technique is used for in vivo (within a living organism) transformation and has been especially useful in transforming monocot species like corn and rice.This approach literally shoots genes into plant cells and plant cell <b>chloroplasts.</b> <b>DNA</b> is coated onto small particles of gold or tungsten approximately two micrometres in diameter. The particles are placed in a vacuum chamber and the plant tissue to be engineered is placed below the chamber.

40|$|Abstract Background High {{throughput}} sequencing (HTS) {{technologies have}} revolutionized {{the field of}} genomics by drastically reducing the cost of sequencing, making it feasible for individual labs to sequence or resequence plant genomes. Obtaining high quality, high molecular weight DNA from plants poses significant challenges due to the high copy number of <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA,</b> as well as high levels of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides. Multiple methods {{have been used to}} isolate DNA from plants; the CTAB method is commonly used to isolate total cellular DNA from plants that contain nuclear DNA, as well as <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA.</b> Alternatively, DNA can be isolated from nuclei to minimize <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> contamination. Results We describe optimized protocols for isolation of nuclear DNA from eight different plant species encompassing both monocot and eudicot species. These protocols use nuclei isolation to minimize <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> contamination. We also developed a protocol to determine the number of <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> copies relative to the nuclear DNA using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). We compared DNA isolated from nuclei to total cellular DNA isolated with the CTAB method. As expected, DNA isolated from nuclei consistently yielded nuclear <b>DNA</b> with fewer <b>chloroplast</b> and mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> copies, as compared to the total cellular DNA prepared with the CTAB method. This protocol will allow for analysis of {{the quality and quantity of}} nuclear DNA before starting a plant whole genome sequencing or resequencing experiment. Conclusions Extracting high quality, high molecular weight nuclear DNA in plants has the potential to be a bottleneck in the era of whole genome sequencing and resequencing. The methods that are described here provide a framework for researchers to extract and quantify nuclear DNA in multiple types of plants. </p...|$|R
