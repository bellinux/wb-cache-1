40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the models, algorithms and implementation {{results of a}} computerized scheduling system for the steelmaking – continuous casting process of a steel plant in Austria. The basis for the scheduling task is a preliminary production schedule for the <b>continuous</b> <b>casters</b> (sequence of charges that must be consecutively cast and their allocation to the <b>continuous</b> <b>casters).</b> The scheduling task can be structured as four subproblems: (1) Scheduling the <b>continuous</b> <b>casters.</b> (2) Allocation of the charges to the parallel facilities at the upstream stages (converter and refining facilities). (3) Sequencing the charges at the converters and refining facilities. (4) Exact timing of all operations. The heuristic algorithm consists of three planning levels: (1) Scheduling the <b>continuous</b> <b>casters,</b> considering the capacity restrictions at the upstream stages and the limited availability of hot metal. (2) Scheduling of the converter and refining facilities according to priorities, performing allocation and sequencing. (3) Improving the schedule {{by means of an}} LP model. The system visualizes the schedules as Gantt charts. Extensive numerical tests with real-life data and more than two years of experience with the implementation demonstrate that the system produces reasonable schedules and is accepted by the planner...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model and a {{solution}} approach for integration of steel <b>continuous</b> <b>casters</b> and hot strip mills to provide more responsive steel production at lower unit cost. We describe the production environment and survey existing methods for planning <b>continuous</b> <b>casters</b> and hot strip mills. Since these processes lie at the solid/liquid interface we use "virtual" slabs, corresponding to possible solid forms of liquid steel, in order to integrate schedules for these two processes. We model the planning problem as a hybrid network. Our model is solved {{using a combination of}} mathematical programming and heuristic techniques and we show that the solutions provided are very nearly optimal. The approach which we describe has been implemented at several steel mills worldwide and has demonstrated significant savings...|$|R

40|$|Mechanisms for mold flux {{entrainment}} {{in continuous}} casting molds include vortexing and suction down the SEN due to asymmetric fluid flow, excessive upward flow impingement on the meniscus, surface level fluctuations, argon bubble effects, and shear-layer instability. The latter mechanism, also called Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, {{is a crucial}} phenomenon which has been investigated previously only with over-simplified theoretical models and room-temperature physical models using surrogate fluids, both of which behave very differently from steel casters. This paper critically reviews previous literature on entrainment mechanisms. It then presents a realistic numerical model to investigate the Kelvin-Helmholtz entrainment mechanism in steel <b>continuous</b> <b>casters</b> and validates it with a simplified analytical solution of this phenomenon. Finally, the critical meniscus velocity to avoid mold flux entrainment via this mechanism is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A novel 1 D spray-cooling {{control system}} is {{described}} {{that has been}} implemented on a commercial caster. The system provides the desired shell surface temperature by employing a hybrid open-loop/closed-loop shell surface temperature estimator, and proportional-integral controller. A 2 D through-thickness temperature regulation is then addressed by deriving a full-state feedback control law that stabilizes the two-phase Stefan problem {{with respect to a}} reference solution using control of the Neumann boundary condition. A simple Dirichlet controller is also considered, and is used to design a boundary-output-based estimator that, in combination with full-state feedback controllers, yields a plausible output feedback control law with boundary sensing and actuation. Finally, a control approach is proposed for eliminating distortions in mold oscillation systems which are problematic in some <b>continuous</b> <b>casters.</b> 1. Introduction: Sinc...|$|R

40|$|To take maximum {{advantage}} of a new ingot mold stripping fa-cility, which was installed in 1984 at the Bethlehem Plant, we developed a two-phase, computer-based procedure for select-ing optimal ingot dimensions and internal ingot mold dimen-sions. Phase 1 generated feasible ingot and internal ingot mold dimensions consistent with the new stripper's capability and with foundry, steelmaking, metallurgical, mill, and ship-ping yard constraints. Phase 2 then used a set-covering ap-proach to select the optimal ingot and internal ingot mold sizes from among the feasible sizes. Based on model results and following trial mill tests, full production use of new mold sizes has affected the entire plant operation, resulting in over $ 8 million annual realized savings.

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict temperature, distortion and residual stress in the mould of thin slab <b>continuous</b> <b>casters.</b> Geometrically, {{there are two kinds of}} mould to achieve high-speed casting: funnel-shaped and parallel mould. The mould shape and high casting speed leads to higher mould temperatures and shorter mould life than in conventional slab casters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the heat flux and the effects of mould shape on distortion of the mould in a thin slab caster. Mould wall temperature measured in the plant was analyzed to determine corresponding the heat-flux profiles in thin slab moulds using an Inverse Heat Conduction model, and this data was then used in an elastic-visco-plastic analysis to investigate the deformation of the moulds in service for different the mould shapes. The model predictions of temperature and distortion during operation match plant observations. During operation, the hot face temperature reaches 430 oC and the copper plates bend toward the steel, with a maximum outward distortion of about 0. 3 mm. This occurs just above the center of the wide faces, and is smaller than the distortion of a conventional slab mould...|$|R

30|$|The {{third and}} last {{category}} of lot-sizing models uses a continuous time representation for modelling the production activities. In this regard, it also combines issues of lot sizing and scheduling in a realistic way. Motivated {{by the early}} development of continuous time-based model formulations for scheduling chemical batch operations (see Mouret et al. 2011 for a comprehensive overview), Grunow et al. (2003) developed a continuous time-based approach for scheduling production campaigns in a supply network of the chemical–pharmaceutical industry. From their model formulation, the basic block planning approach (Günther et al. 2006), was derived as a single-stage model formulation primarily for application in high-variant production systems with volatile demand. This modelling approach was coined block planning which is a common term in industry for cyclical scheduling of product variants belonging to the same product family. Applications of the block planning approach {{can be found in}} Lütke Entrup et al. (2005) for scheduling yogurt production lines, in Günther et al.

40|$|A simple, but {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} heat transfer and solidification of the continuous {{casting of steel}} slabs is described, including phenomena in the mold and spray regions. The model includes a 1 -D transient finite-difference calculation of heat conduction within the solidifying steel shell coupled with 2 -D steady-state heat conduction within the mold wall. The model features a detailed treatment of the interfacial gap between the shell and mold, including mass and momentum balances on the solid and liquid interfacial slag layers, {{and the effect of}} oscillation marks. The model predicts shell thickness, temperature distributions in the mold and shell, thickness of the re-solidified and liquid powder layers, heat flux profiles down the wide and narrow faces, mold water temperature rise, ideal taper of the mold walls, and other related phenomena. The important effect of non-uniform distribution of superheat is incorporated using the results from previous 3 -D turbulent fluid flow calculations within the liquid pool. The FORTRAN program, CON 1 D, has a user-friendly interface and executes {{in less than a minute}} on a personal computer. Calibration of the model with several different experimental measurements on operating slab casters is presented along with several example applications. In particular, the model demonstrates that the increase in heat flux throughout the mold at higher casting speeds is caused by two combined effects: thinner interfacial gap near the top of the mold, and 2 thinner shell towards the bottom. This modeling tool can be applied to a wide range of practical problems in <b>continuous</b> <b>casters.</b> I...|$|R
