40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Despite the {{importance}} of movement ecology studies, the field faces a prevailing challenge of methodological limitations in tracking individual organisms. This research investigated {{the utility of the}} stable isotope technique to trace movements of ducks in southern Africa. I sampled and analysed feathers of ten duck species for stable isotope proportions of Carbon (δ 13 C), Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and Hydrogen (δD), from five wetlands (Strandfontein and Barberspan in South Africa, the Manyame catchment in Zimbabwe, Lake Chuali in Mozambique, and Lake Ngami in Botswana) as test cases. Sampling was carried out at different seasons to account for seasonal isotope signature variations. Isotope signatures of feathers grown at different moulting locations were compared to test whether southern Africa shows stable isotope spatial patterns (distinct isotopic regions). Feathers grown at different life-phases were compared to test whether different sites had been used and if more mobile species showed more and stronger isotope distinctions. Finally, growing flight feathers grown at moulting locations were compared across species to query how much information on diet and foraging behaviour can be inferred from southern African duck feather stable isotopes. Feather isotope signatures were distinct by site in {{at least one of the}} tested isotopes, for the majority of ducks tested. Strandfontein had more and stronger distinctions of isotope signatures between feathers grown at different life phases. This site is the closest to the sea and most likely to have marine-influenced isotope signatures especially in δ 15 N, it falls within the Mediterranean climatic conditions experiencing winter rainfall unlike all the other sites. Vegetation compositions (C 3 and C 4 plant distributions) therefore vary across sites influencing δ 13 C patterns. More mobile species (only Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus from Strandfontein, and Cape Shoveler Anas smithii from Barberspan; determined by mobility scores from other studies) had more and stronger distinctions between flight and body feathers. All the other species did not comply with mobility scores. They showed weaker and fewer tissue signature distinctions than their mobility scores suggested. There were high isotopic signature overlaps in δ 13 C and δ 15 N across and within feeding guilds at each moulting site implying dietary overlaps during moulting. More overlaps occurred during the dry seasons (summer in Strandfontein and winter in Lake Chuali, Manyame catchment site, and Lake Ngami). Higher isotopic variances (higher dietary flexibility) were associated with isotope signature divergence to mobility scores especially in <b>Cape</b> <b>Teals</b> and Yellow-billed Ducks. The isotope technique is flawed with uncontrollable sources of variation which potentially confound movement inferences. It is best used when accompanied by conventional methods to detect and counter against species specific biology and dietary behaviour imposed biases in tissue isotope signatures. Further research on how species specific biological processes affect the reflection of spatial patterns of isotopes in feathers is recommended. Multi-isotope time explicit approaches and trace element analysis were also recommended. Scientists should be wary about basing management strategies or building theory about movement patterns of species based on the technique at least in stochastic environments such as southern Africa. My results provide empirical evidence that the technique is unreliable at this scale of analysis. In particular, the majority of ducks in this region are not good candidates for use of isotopic signatures in distinguishing movement patterns of southern African ducks. 498...|$|R

50|$|Upwards of 170 native {{bird species}} have been recorded, but the {{presence}} or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed weaver, southern red bishop, African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, green-backed heron, purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are red-knobbed coot, fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{helminth}} {{communities in}} 25 yellow-billed ducks (Anas undulata), 21 red-billed ducks (Anas erythrorhyncha), ten <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas capensis) and seven Cape shovellers (Anas smithii) that had overwintered at Barberspan, revealed differences in community structure. Infracommunities in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high eveness, and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low eveness values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks. The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks, however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shoveller included several core species. <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks. Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two. Two recurrent groups, consisting of eight and two species, were identified in the compound community. Each group consisted of species found predominantly in <b>Cape</b> <b>teal</b> and Cape shovellers. Patterns seen in the helminth communities of the various hosts reflected differences in diet, but other factors, including feeding behaviour, spatial segregation and host specificity, may also have had an effect.

40|$|Monogamy {{is thought}} to be the usual mating system in dabbling ducks and docum ented cases of bigamy are very rare for any Anas species (Lebret 1961). The {{following}} observations on wild-caught <b>Cape</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas capensis, breeding in flight pens, show th a t bigamy is pos sible in this species and suggest th a t it may be expected to occur in wild birds. On 3 May 1976, 11 full-winged <b>Cape</b> <b>Teal</b> (5 males, 6 females) were released in a flight pen measuring 27. 5 m x 27. 5 m x 3. 6 m (described in McKinney 1967). These birds had been captured as adults at S trandfontein, Cape Province, South Africa in 1974. They were in dividually m arked with coloured plastic nasal discs (females) or nasal saddles (males). Observations were made for 3 hours, starting at first light, on 2 of every 3 mornings from 4 May to 24 August (to ta l 228 hours). O ther watches at various tim es of day totalled 36 hours. One pair-bond existed before the birds were released (pair A) bu t after a period of intense social courtship 2 more pairs had form ed by 13 May.

The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|E
40|$|Waterbirds {{are often}} {{overlooked}} as predators in aquatic ecosystems, {{despite the fact}} that waterbirds congregate in great numbers in and around waterways, notably estuaries. To fully appreciate the effect that aquatic feeding waterbird species may have on aquatic prey communities and the role that they play in estuarine food webs, stable isotopes and fatty acid profiles were employed to examine the seasonal diet of selected waterbirds in the Kowie Estuary, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Population counts were conducted every month for four seasons to examine the demography of waterbirds in the lower reaches of the estuary. The mean monthly energy consumption, along with dry matter intake of all waterbird species observed, were calculated and compared to similar estuaries in South Africa and elsewhere. Three duck species, one migrant sandpiper and one piscivore were selected for more detailed investigation at several temporal scales. This thesis has revealed that stable isotope analysis of waterbird tissues provides more informative data than fatty acid analysis for investigating waterbird diet and basal resource-tertiary consumer nutrient coupling. Stable δ 15 N and δ 13 C isotopes from several body tissues, in conjunction with SIAR models, were used to determine the seasonal diet of each waterbird species, while fatty acid profiles were investigated to examine the trophic transfer of fatty acids from basal resources to waterbird predators via the benthic fauna. Stable isotopes revealed that Cape Shoveller, <b>Cape</b> <b>Teal</b> and Yellow-Billed Duck shifted their diet over both long and short temporal scales, while the migratory Ruff and piscivorous Little Egret maintained a relatively consistent diet over time. Isopods, amphipods, copepods and Mysidacea were the main foods of all three duck species and the Ruff (> 30 %). Little Egret fed mainly on flathead mullet throughout the year. Fatty acid analysis revealed evidence for trophic transfer of specific fatty acids from basal resources to waterbirds in the Kowie Estuary but provided little information on seasonal diet of waterbirds. Waterbirds foraging in the Kowie Estuary appeared to shift their diet to coincide with resource abundance pulses, but also displayed seasonal dietary overlap. This study highlights the role that waterbirds play in aquatic food webs. The subject requires more attention so that we can better understand all the predatory drivers on aquatic communities...|$|E
