40|$|A {{title that}} {{critically}} reviews the decommissioning and decontamination processes and technologies available for rehabilitating sites used for nuclear power generation and <b>civilian</b> <b>nuclear</b> facilities, from fundamental issues and best practices, to procedures and technology, and onto decommissioning and decontamination case studies. $bOnce a <b>nuclear</b> <b>installation</b> {{has reached the}} end of its safe and economical operational lifetime, the need for its decommissioning arises. Different strategies can be employed for nuclear decommissioning, based on the evaluation of particular hazards and their attendant risks, {{as well as on the}} analysis of costs of clean-up and waste management. This allows for decommissioning either soon after permanent shutdown, or perhaps a long time later, the latter course allowing for radioactivity levels to drop in any activated or contaminated components. It is crucial for clear processes and best practices to be applied in decommissioning such installations and sites, particular where any significant health and environmental risks exist. This book critically reviews the nuclear decommissioning processes and technologies applicable to nuclear power plants and other <b>civilian</b> <b>nuclear</b> facilities. Part one focuses on the fundamental planning issues in starting a nuclear decommissioning process, from principles and safety regulations, to financing and project management. Part two covers the execution phase of nuclear decommissioning projects, detailing processes and technologies such as dismantling, decontamination, and radioactive waste management, as well as environmental remediation, site clearance and reuse. Finally, part three details international experience in the decommissioning of nuclear applications, including the main nuclear reactor types and nuclear fuel cycle facilities, as well as small nuclear facilities and legacy nuclear waste sites...|$|R
