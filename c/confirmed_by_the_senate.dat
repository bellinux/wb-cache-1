5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism.

The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E
