40|$|When in the 1970 s {{and later}} many governments of ACP {{countries}} had to reform their economies and {{cut back on}} public expenses, veterinary services were not spared the suffering. One reaction was for commercial enterprises to jump into this service gap. Privately-run artificial insemination, pest control programmes and clinical services {{are but a few}} examples of this. At the same time, the idea that rural communities had to develop self reliance in many ways started to gain ground. This do-it-your-self thinking also applied to animal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services for farm animals and <b>community-based</b> animal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> (CBAHC) was born. In two well-documented publications, the Intermediate Technology Development Group East Africa (ITDG-EA) have laid down their experiences in years of supporting and setting up community based services in this field. <b>Community-based</b> animal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in East Africa describes the history of CBAHC services in Kenya and gives a step-by-step overview on how to set up a CBAHC service and how to operate it, evaluate it and consequently re-direct it. The book offers advice on training requirements for CBAHC workers and trainers, and presents 13 case studies of Kenyan CBAHC services. The role of <b>community-based</b> animal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in rural development builds on the previous book and can be considered more as a handbook on CBAHC and is a reference book for rural development workers throughout East Africa.

40|$|<b>Community-based</b> primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{describes}} {{a model of}} service provision that is oriented to the population health needs and wants of service users and communities, and has particular relevance to supporting the growing {{proportion of the population}} with multiple chronic conditions. Internationally, aspirations for <b>community-based</b> primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> have stimulated local initiatives and influenced the design of policy solutions. However, the ways in which these ideas and influences find their way into policy and practice is strongly mediated by policy settings and institutional legacies of particular jurisdictions. This paper seeks to compare the key institutional and policy features of Ontario, Québec and New Zealand that shape the ‘space available’ for models of <b>community-based</b> primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> to take root and develop. Our analysis suggests that two key conditions are the integration of relevant health and social sector organisations, and the range of policy levers that are available and used by governments. New Zealand has the most favourable conditions, and Ontario the least favourable. All jurisdictions, however, share a crucial barrier, namely the ‘barbed-wire fence’ that separates funding of medical and ‘non-medical’ primary care services, and the clear interests primary care doctors have in maintaining this fence. Moves in the direction of system-wide <b>community-based</b> primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> require a gradual dismantling of this fence...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRomania is {{currently}} making efforts to deinstitutionalize residents of its mental health hospitals and initiate {{a system of}} <b>community-based</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> To be successful, the system of <b>community-based</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> must include a network of caring and responsible people {{who are committed to}} helping those who are mentally ill meet their needs while reintegrating into and remaining a part of the community. Therapeutic farm communities (TFC), or care farms (CF) as they are known in Europe, can serve as a critical component in efforts to assist mentally ill individuals regain their stability and independence. TFCs, which often focus on individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, promote self-sufficiency through their therapeutic use of farming-related activities, including organic farming and animal care. In addition to farm maintenance activities, programming may include mood management, dialectical behavior therapy, creative expression, equine assisted learning, meditation, education, money management training, and independent living skills activities (planning, shopping, cooking, healthy living), and medication management.
