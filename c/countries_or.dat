5|$|While genetic {{influences}} {{are important}} to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> globally. Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, {{the cause of the}} shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|Mares can be {{of several}} origins and be listed as facteur de selle français. Thoroughbred, AQPS, pure or {{crossbred}} Anglo-Arabians and French Trotting horses may also qualify under this designation, as do mares that {{are the product of}} two facteur de selle français horses. Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union (EU) are also listed in this category. Pure and crossbred Arabians, saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an individual basis by performing at a high level in show jumping, three-day eventing or dressage competition. If mares come from <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> territories that {{do not have access to}} high-level competitions, they may be granted special listing status.|$|E
5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based.

5|$|The Turkish Armed Forces {{consists}} of the Land Forces, the Naval Forces and the Air Force. The Gendarmerie and the Coast Guard operate as parts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in peacetime, although they are subordinated to the Army and Navy Commands respectively in wartime, during which they have both internal law enforcement and military functions. The Chief of the General Staff is appointed by the President and is responsible to the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation {{of the armed forces}} to defend the country. However, the authority to declare war and to deploy the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> to allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that {{care must be taken}} when comparing large numbers between languages or <b>countries,</b> <b>or</b> when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of circumcision {{is thought to}} have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of their many expulsions from European <b>countries,</b> <b>or</b> by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In {{the second half of the}} 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish dietary restrictions are still found among Bantu tribes.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home <b>countries</b> <b>or</b> some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E
