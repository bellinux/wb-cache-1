5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum brake arrangement {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around [...] Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>storage</b> tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately.|$|E

Two <b>Compressed</b> <b>Air</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> systems were analysed: <b>Compressed</b> <b>Air</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> (CAES) and <b>Compressed</b> <b>Air</b> Energy <b>Storage</b> combined with Thermal Storage (CAES-TS) connected to a district heating network. The maximum output of the CAES was 100 MWe and {{the output of the}} CAES-TS was 100 MWe and 105 MWth. The study shows that 308 GW h/year of electricity and 466 GW h/year of fuel are used to generate 375 GW h/year of electricity. During the compression of air 289 GW h/year of heat is generated, which is wasted in the CAES and used for district heating in the CAES-TS system. Energy efficiency of the CAES system was around 48 % and the efficiency of CAES-TS was 86 %. Exergoeconomic analysis shows that the exergy cost of electricity generated in the CAES was 13. 89 ¢/kW h, and the exergy cost of electricity generated in the CAES-TS was 11. 20 ¢/kW h. The exergy cost of heat was 22. 24 ¢/kW h in the CAES-TS system.
