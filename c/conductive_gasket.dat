40|$|A gasket {{assembly}} for {{securing a}} pair of surface together wherein an electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>gasket</b> base having a central opening is provided with {{a pair of}} layers secured to opposite sides of the gasket base, with the layers being a fusible alloy, a brazing alloy or a synthetic, thermoplastic material which will melt, without degrading, when the gasket base is heated. The surfaces may be secured to each other by a plurality of bolts to squeeze the gasket assembly there between or by some other clamping means. An electrical current is passed through the gasket base to heat it to a temperature sufficient to melt the layers to seal the surfaces to opposite sides of the gasket base...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the impact}} of higher and higher frequencies, {{shielding}} gaskets at frequencies above 1 GHz are needed for the so called ‘in-cicuit’ and ‘on board’ shielding applications. In this paper, the importance of a continuous conductivity between all parts of an enclosure, and the homogeneous distribution of the conductivity in the frequency range up to 40 GHz are demonstrated, using a stripline methodology for characterising the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of <b>conductive</b> <b>gaskets.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{are often}} a source of EMI, but they must usually couple their energy to larger objects such as heatsinks, circuit board planes and cables to radiate significantly. On integrated circuits, important means of reducing EMI are: the use of bypass or decoupling capacitors on each active device (connected across the power supply, {{as close to the}} device as possible), rise time control of high-speed signals using series resistors, and IC power supply pin filtering. Shielding is usually a last resort after other techniques have failed, because of the added expense of shielding components such as <b>conductive</b> <b>gaskets.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the survey of}} actual tendencies, accepted in micro satellites’ thermal control concepts. Available literature and INTERNET information and lessons learned during the elaboration of micro satellites Magion (1994, 1996), BIRD (2001) have served as sources for survey. The description of most widely used passive thermal control principles for satellite at all and for autonomous temperature regulation for sen-sitive satellite components is given. The practical means for realization of passive thermal control satellite design as multilayer insulation, optical coatings, heat conduc-tive elements, heat insulation supports, thermal <b>conductive</b> <b>gaskets</b> are briefly described. Specialties of important stages of micro satellite creation as thermal modeling and ther-mal testing are surveyed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the usage of modeling techniques to predict and improve the shielding effectiveness of rectangular, metallic Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) EMI cages. These cages house bi-directional SFP+ transceiver modules that can operate at data rates up to 11. 1 Gbps. The simulation tools used for this investigation are Ansoft HFSS TM, a full wave 3 D EM simulator and CST Microstripes TM. The usage of simulation tools allows for a more rigorous investigation of the application of alternative materials inside the SFP+ cages and for comparison with more traditional EMI springs and <b>conductive</b> elastomeric <b>gasketing...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{periodic}} {{structure has}} been used to design a new type of packaging technique to improve the isolation between microwave components within a module. In contrast to the conventional packaging technique, the new technique relaxes the requirement for using vias in the substrate and using <b>conductive</b> adhesive or <b>gasket</b> material within a typical multiple compartment microwave modules. On the other hand it uses a periodic structure of metal pins to form a lid for the microwave module. The achieved level of isolation in X-band and Ku-band for a two compartment test circuit is better than 65 dB which is better than the existing packaging technique within the band of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is introduced. A short {{overview}} of the regulatory EMC requirements in Europe and in the United States is presented. An explanation is given why {{it is important for}} people in the electronics business to understand the need for EMC regulations. Electromagnetic shielding is a often used as an electromagnetic barrier for attenuation of disturbances from radiating sources. An orientation over the concept of electromagnetic barriers is presented. Ways to characterize barriers are presented and measurement methods are reviewed. Results from transfer impedance measurements show that <b>conductive</b> <b>gaskets</b> made of tin coated stainless steel, can give as good shielding performance as gaskets made of beryllium copper in the entire frequency interval of the investigation. The results show that the difference in shielding performance with gaskets made of tin coated stainless steel and of beryllium copper can be insignificant compared to the influence of a very small change in contact pressure. The difference between gaskets with and without tin coating is small with beryllium copper as base material. With stainless steel as base material the difference is about 10 dB at 2 MHz and less at higher frequencies. A method to describe electromagnetic barriers such as filters, shielded cables and connectors etc. with circuits consisting of linear discrete components is presented. By comparing a barrier with a multi-conductor transmission line a lumped circuit can be constructed where component values are designated by the per-unit length transmission line parameters. For barriers that cannot be viewed as transmission lines a method for determining equivalent circuits outgoing from measured S-parameters has been developed. Different measurement fixtures were constructed in order to obtain accurate S-parameter values. Derived models have been used in SPICE simulations and validated by comparison with measurements. The current distributions on the surface of a printed log periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) have been investigated. A position scanned magnetic field probe was used to obtain values of the magnitude and phase of the magnetic field at each point of the scan. From the measurements the time variant instantaneous values of the magnetic field and the instantaneous currents on the LPDA were derived. The wave nature of the current distribution can be readily observed and problems with the design such as standing waves on the feeder lines are highlighted. Measured current distributions are compared with predicted distributions obtained from Method of Moments (MOM) analysis of the LPDA structure. Measured and predicted far field radiation patterns are also compared. Godkänd; 2000; 20070318 (ysko) </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of superconducting millimeter and submillimeter-wave circuits often requires RF ground connections. These are usually made by soldering, wire bonding, conductive adhesive or <b>conductive</b> wire <b>gaskets.</b> The difficulty of assembly increases with frequency as chip {{dimensions and tolerances}} shrink. The assembly issues, and also the throughput requirements of large radio astronomy projects such as ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array), suggest the need of a beam lead technology for these circuits. Beam lead processes are already established for silicon and gallium arsenide wafers. However, niobium circuits on quartz substrates present unique difficulties. SIS junctions introduce additional thermal and chemical constraints to process development. For quartz, wet etches are isotropic and dry etches with high etch rates require large ion energies. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} develop a conventional process in which gold pads on the substrate surface are formed into beam leads by a backside etch. Instead we have developed a topside process in which, after the mixer circuits are completed, dicing cuts are made at the finished chip dimensions but only partly through the wafer. The dicing cuts are then filled with a sacrificial material in a non-CMP process, and planarized. Gold plated pads are then defined, overhanging the planarized cuts. The sacrificial material is then removed from these cuts, leaving the gold beam leads. The wafer is then backside lapped into the cuts to the desired thickness, separating the individual chips. We discuss the new planarization scheme developed for this beam lead process and compare a variety of sacrificial materials. Index terms- beam leads, Nb, SIS, quartz, epox...|$|R
