In addition, protocols are constantly evolving with new functionality and message formats that render the previously defined specifications incomplete or deprecated.

The approach can be used on top of existing protocol reverse engineering techniques allowing it to be applied to both open and <b>closed</b> <b>protocols.</b> This approach also has the advantage of capturing unpublished or undocumented features automatically, thus obtaining a more complete and realistic specification of the implemented protocol.

40|$|Abstract. The {{communication}} between computer systems is dictated by network protocols, which {{determine how the}} network components interact with each other. Knowing the specification of a network protocol can greatly improve the security and dependability of both {{the design of the}} protocol and the applications implementing it. The specification can be used, for example, to verify if the application’s implementation is correct and in accordance, or even to aid in the creation of specific firewall rules or IDS filters to block messages that do not comply with the defined standard. However, the protocol specification is not always available, which makes assessing the correctness and security of such protocols difficult. Protocol reverse engineering has been used to overcome this problem, by deducing the specification of <b>closed</b> <b>protocols</b> from their utilization alone and without any assumption about their structure or operation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} aspects of conducting clinical research is the ability to successfully recruit participants. Pediatric clinical research presents unique recruitment challenges that relate to the need for parental consent on behalf of a minor, child assent, and school attendance. Yet, this has been less well studied. We conducted a survey of investigators performing human subjects research in a single large academic pediatric hospital to better understand characteristics of studies with successful recruitment. We conducted a web-based survey from September 2011 to December 2011 of all principal investigators with an Institutional Review Board approved human subjects protocol at Boston Children's Hospital, a pediatric Academic Medical Center. The survey captured various characteristics of the protocols including study design, staffing, resources, and investigator experience and training as well as respondents' perceived barriers and facilitators to recruitment. We used chi square tests and Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend {{to examine the relationship between}} selected predictor variables and the binary outcome of successful vs. unsuccessful recruitment and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the simultaneous influence of potential predictors on each outcome. Among the 349 eligible investigators, 52 % responded to the survey, and 181 with valid data were included in the analyses. Two-thirds of the 87 <b>protocols</b> <b>closed</b> to enrollment reached 80 % or more of their target enrollment, whereas, only one-third of the 94 protocols actively recruiting were meeting 80 % of their target. Recruitment method appeared to be the only significant and independent factor associated with achieving 80 % or more of target enrollment in <b>closed</b> to enrollment <b>protocols.</b> <b>Closed</b> to enrollment <b>protocols</b> that used recruitment in person were 4. 55 times (95 % CI 1. 30 to 15. 93; p = 0. 02) more likely to achieve 80 % or more of their target enrollment when compared to those that used other recruitment methods. Other potentially modifiable factors such as number of study visits, study duration and investigator experience were suggestive of being meaningfully related to recruitment. Recruiting in person may promote reaching an acceptable target enrollment in pediatric as well as adult clinical research. Future research is needed on larger and more diverse samples to gain a better understanding of how the characteristics and qualifications of the individuals who conduct recruitment influence participant enrollment as well as how best to approach patient and families for their participation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, Sugihara {{proposed}} an innovative causality concept, which, {{in contrast to}} statistical predictability in Granger sense, characterizes underlying deterministic causation of the system. This work exploits Sugihara causality analysis to develop novel EEG biomarkers for discriminating normal aging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hypothesis of this work is that scalp EEG based causality measurements have different distributions for different cognitive groups and hence the causality measurements {{can be used to}} distinguish between NC, MCI, and AD participants. The current results are based on 30 -channel resting EEG records from 48 age-matched participants (mean age 75. 7  years) — 15 normal controls (NCs), 16 MCI, and 17 early-stage AD. First, a reconstruction model is developed for each EEG channel, which predicts the signal in the current channel using data of the other 29 channels. The reconstruction model of the target channel is trained using NC, MCI, or AD records to generate an NC-, MCI-, or AD-specific model, respectively. To avoid over fitting, the training is based on the leave-one-out principle. Sugihara causality between the channels is described by a quality score based on comparison between the reconstructed signal and the original signal. The quality scores are studied for their potential as biomarkers to distinguish between the different cognitive groups. First, the dimension of the quality scores is reduced to two principal components. Then, a three-way classification based on the principal components is conducted. Accuracies of 95. 8 %, 95. 8 %, and 97. 9 % are achieved for resting eyes open, counting eyes closed, and resting eyes <b>closed</b> <b>protocols,</b> respectively. This work presents a novel application of Sugihara causality analysis to capture characteristic changes in EEG activity due to cognitive deficits. The developed method has excellent potential as individualized biomarkers in the detection of pathophysiological changes in early-stage AD...|$|R

Among all these barriers, the safety issue is {{the first and most}} important one. The safety issue is addressed using the three following principles: 1) ECPs suggests a modification or modifies ventilation settings only within the alarms prescribed on the respirator; 2) there are stop rules implemented in ECPs that interrupt <b>closed</b> loop <b>protocols</b> in specific situations (if input data are not available for example); 3) Most of the ECPs in closed loop are first developed and tested for the management of the weaning phase.
