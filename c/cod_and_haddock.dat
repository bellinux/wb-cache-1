25|$|In Britain and Ireland, <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> appear most {{commonly}} as the fish used for fish and chips, but vendors also sell many {{other kinds of}} fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock or coley, plaice, skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear {{most commonly}} in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock, due to their regular availability in a common catch.|$|E
25|$|Breakfast usually {{consists}} of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch {{may take the}} form of a smörgåsbord. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> but also salmon, herring, and halibut. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as hangikjöt) or salt-preserved (saltkjöt). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as slátur, which {{consists of}} offal (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.|$|E
25|$|Grimsby is {{strongly}} {{linked with the}} sea fishing industry, which once generated wealth for the town. At its peak in the 1950s, {{it was the largest}} and busiest fishing port in the world. As a result of the Cod Wars with Iceland, this industry has been in decline for many years. In 1970 around 400 trawlers were based in the port, by 2013 only 5 trawlers remain based there. By comparison, 15 vessels are used to maintain offshore wind farms in the North Sea. The town still has the largest fish market in the UK, but most of what is sold is now brought overland from other ports or Iceland via containerisation. Of the 18,000 tonnes of fresh fish sold in Grimsby fish market in 2012, almost 13,000 tonnes, mainly <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> came from Iceland.|$|E

60|$|Ah, the {{pickerel}} of Walden! when I {{see them}} {{lying on the}} ice, or in the well which the fisherman cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit the water, I am always surprised by their rare beauty, {{as if they were}} fabulous fishes, they are so foreign to the streets, even to the woods, foreign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> whose fame is trumpeted in our streets. They are not green like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue like the sky; but they have, to my eyes, if possible, yet rarer colors, like flowers and precious stones, {{as if they were the}} pearls, the animalized nuclei or crystals of the Walden water. They, of course, are Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in the animal kingdom, Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught here--that in this deep and capacious spring, far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the Walden road, this great gold and emerald fish swims. I never chanced to see its kind in any market; it would be the cynosure of all eyes there. Easily, with a few convulsive quirks, they give up their watery ghosts, like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven.|$|E

5000|$|The Scottish {{demersal}} fleet has been facing economically difficult times {{for several years}} due to the decline of <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> in the North Sea, which were the mainstay of catches. The fleet has declined from around 800 vessels in 1992 to just over 400 in 2004. This sector catches a diverse range of species and, although <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> are important components, togetheraccounting for 40% of the total landings, in absolute value they represent only a modest turnover of £55m. Commercial performance of the sector {{has been dominated by}} the difficulties over cod, particularly in recent years with the implementation of the European [...] "Cod Recovery Plan", but have also been affected by a scarcity of haddock and other demersal species. In recent years much of the demersal industry has been supported by the abundant 1999 year-class of haddock.|$|E

40|$|The diet {{composition}} of North-East Arctic <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) are examined from stomach content data. Fish {{were collected in}} the southern part of the Barents Sea from 1984 to 1986. A total of 4790 <b>cods</b> <b>and</b> 1361 <b>haddocks</b> were divided according to season (winter, spring and fall) and fish size in 10 cm size classes. Only fish bigger than 10 cm length were considered. Diet overlap between the two species for each size group in each season was calculated using the Schoener's index. North-East Arctic cod show a size dependent shift in the diet. Fish smaller than 20 cm prey mainly on crustaceans (euphauiids, deep sea shrimp and amphipods). Above 20 cm, cod incorporate fish in the diet to a larger degree, the degree increasing with the size of the predator. Some seasonal changes are described. Haddock, a less ichthiophagous, bivalves and polychaetes. In general the diet overlap is low except in spring and fall when the smaller size groups of both species prey on euphausiids. The results are compared with previous information on cod-haddock interaction...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the third in a series of FSP surveys of <b>cod,</b> <b>haddock</b> <b>and</b> whiting in the Irish Sea. The first surveys took place in spring 2004 and 2005. Programme 3 in 2005 used the commercial whitefish otter trawler FV Isadale (Fleetwood) for 15 days between 21 February and 9 March (44 valid tows), and the mid-water trawler Benaiah IV (Kilkeel) for 15 days during the period 12 February to 8 March (38 valid tows). The surveys are designed to provide time-series data on catch-rates, distribution and age compositions of <b>cod,</b> <b>haddock</b> <b>and</b> whiting. The Isadale (skipper Steve Whelan) fished with an otter trawl (80 mm codend) throughout the eastern Irish Sea whilst Benaiah IV (skipper Denis Jones) fished with a semi-pelagic trawl (100 mm codend) in the western Irish Sea, North Channel and the outer Clyde. The maps show the distribution of <b>cod,</b> <b>haddock</b> <b>and</b> whiting in the 2006 FSP. The cod fishery closures in outer Clyde and Irish Sea are indicated on the cod map. Note that catch rates of the Benaiah IV and Isadale are not comparable in absolute terms because of the different gear and mesh size used. 55...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the dietary}} {{behaviour}} of whales differ among species {{as well as}} season, location and availability of prey. For example, sperm whales' prey primarily consists of mesopelagic squid. However, in Iceland, they are reported to consume mainly fish. In addition to krill, minke whales are known to eat {{a wide range of}} fish species including capelin, herring, sand lance, mackerel, gadoids, <b>cod,</b> saithe <b>and</b> <b>haddock.</b> Minke whales are estimated to consume 633,000 tons of Atlantic herring per year in part of Northeast Atlantic. In the Barents Sea, it is estimated that a potential net economic loss of five tons of <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> herring per fishery results from every additional minke whale in the population due the fish consumption of the single whale.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-1960s}} fishing fleets in the North Sea {{comprised}} drifters and trawlers, with the drifters primarily targeting herring while the trawlers caught <b>cod,</b> plaice, skate <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> etc. By the mid-1960s the catches were greatly diminishing, particularly the herring. Consequently, the drifter fleet disappeared {{and many of}} the trawlers were adapted to work as service ships for the newly created North Sea oil rigs.|$|R

50|$|It may be {{surprising}} {{to learn that}} the UK shellfish industry is vast. Wild-caught shellfish landings have now overtaken <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock,</b> the traditional mainstays of the fleet. Of the 417,000 tonnes of seafood landed into the UK in 2006, shellfish contributed just over 133,000 tonnes or 32% of the volume. Demersal finfish (such as flatfish, cod, haddock etc.) and pelagic finfish (such as herring and mackerel) each contributed around 141,000 tonnes, approximately 34% of the total volume each.|$|E
50|$|Since phytanic acid is not {{produced}} in the human body, individuals with Refsum disease are commonly placed on a phytanic acid-restricted diet and avoid the consumption of fats from ruminant animals and certain fish, such as tuna, <b>cod,</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock.</b> Grass feeding animals and their milk are also avoided. Recent {{research has shown that}} CYP4 isoform enzymes could help reduce the over-accumulation of phytanic acid in vivo. Plasmapheresis is another medical intervention used to treat patients. This involves the filtering of blood to ensure there is no accumulation of phytanic acid.|$|E
5000|$|Fisheries {{managers}} {{have only recently}} begun to {{understand the importance of}} intraguild predation on the availability of fish stocks as they attempt to move towards ecosystem-based management. IGP interactions between sharks and seals may prevent seals from feeding in areas where commercially important fish species are abundant, which may indirectly make more of these fish available to fishermen. [...] However, IGP may also negatively influence fisheries. Intraguild predation by spiny dogfish and various skate species on economically important fishes like <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> have been cited as a possible reason for the slow recovery of the groundfish fishery in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|Fishing {{trials were}} {{performed}} simultaneously using commercial bottom trawl and longline {{in an investigation}} that was primarily designed to explore the effects of seismic airgun shooting on catch rates of <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) <b>and</b> <b>haddock</b> (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Fish density, species and length composition in the experimental area were determined from a combined acoustic and bottom trawl survey. The seismic shooting led to lower fish density and changes in size and species composition, and analyzing catch data obtained before and after shooting {{made it possible to}} compare the species and length compositions of trawl and longline catches at two different stock levels. The fishing trials showed that both the species and size compositions obtained by the two gears were significantly different. Relatively more haddock were caught by longline than by trawl, and longline fishing was found to catch less undersized <b>cod</b> <b>and</b> more undersized <b>haddock</b> than trawling. It appeared that the size compositions of the longline catches were affected by the fish density and size composition in the area.
