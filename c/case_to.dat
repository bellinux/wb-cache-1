5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Brugada syndrome, {{a disease}} {{burdened}} by elevated risk of sudden unexpected cardiac death, often affects young aged subjects that have structurally healthy heart. The diagnostic itinerary is complex: anamnesis, ECG, pharmacological test and electrophysiological study. Its phenotypes are three. METHOD We have identified 13 cases (10 men and 3 women), 12 estimated at the Cardiological Outpatients’ Department and 1 at the First-aid Station. RESULTS 2 <b>cases</b> belonged <b>to</b> phenotype 1, 4 <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> phenotype 2 and 7 <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> phenotype 3. CONCLUSIONS Our work of specialists in internal medicine, toward this syndrome, is: an accurate anamnesis, a correct interpretation of ECG, fast sending of high risk <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> advanced level cardiological competences, {{a selection of}} <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> submit to pharmacological test, to address middle risk patients to cardiological competences, offering our cooperation in the follow-up...|$|R

40|$|Test suite {{augmentation}} {{techniques are}} used in regression testing to identify code elements affected by changes and <b>to</b> generate test <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> cover those elements. Whereas methods and techniques to find affected elements have been extensively researched in regression testing, how to generate new test <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> cover these elements cost-effectively has rarely been studied. It is known that generating test cases is very expensive, {{so we want to}} focus on this second step. We believe that reusing existing test cases will help us achieve this task. This research intends to provide a framework for test suite augmentation techniques that will reuse existing test <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> automatically generate new test <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> cover as many affected elements as possible cost-effectively...|$|R

5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion <b>case</b> <b>to</b> Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the conviction of U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined {{the legality of the}} curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui.|$|E

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking his <b>case</b> <b>to</b> {{the people that}} dramatic action on industrial relations was needed.

5|$|After {{a newborn}} baby rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe {{division}} agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first <b>case</b> <b>to</b> implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K.

5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands.
