40|$|Abstract: Blue nevus is {{a benign}} melanocytic lesion whose most {{frequent}} variants are dendritic (common) blue <b>nevus</b> and <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus.</b> Atypical <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> presents an intermediate histopathology between the typical and a rare variant of malignant blue nevus/melanoma arising in a <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus.</b> An 8 -year-old child presented a pigmented lesion in the buttock since birth, but with progressive {{growth in the}} last two years. After surgical excision, histopathological examination revealed atypical <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus.</b> Presence of mitoses, ulceration, infiltration, cytological atypia or necrosis may occur in atypical <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus,</b> making it difficult to differentiate it from melanoma. The growth of blue nevus is unusual and considered of high-risk for malignancy, being an indicator for complete resection and periodic follow-up of these patients...|$|R
40|$|Cutis verticis gyrata {{is a rare}} skin {{condition}} characterized by swelling of scalp resembling {{the surface of the}} brain. Various conditions, like cerebriform intradermal nevus (CIN), may give rise to this clinical entity. Moreover, its association with <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> is extremely rare and has not been reported so far. Here, we report a 28 -year-old male with a huge cerebriform swelling covering the occipital lobe along with multiple nodules all over the body. Histology of the scalp swelling showed solitary or clusters of nevus cells in the dermis and from the body lesions showed features of <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus.</b> The diagnosis of CIN with <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> was confirme...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> is {{a variant}} of blue nevus and arises in the dermis. It usually penetrates into the {{subcutaneous}} tissue, and many cases with local extension of the nevus {{have been reported in}} the literature [1, 2). However, cases of <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> associated with intracranial involvement are rare [3), and MR imaging of this condition has not been reported previously. Case Report A 9 -year-old boy had had a large nevus of the scalp since birth. When he was 3 years old, the nevus was excised. The histologic diagnosis was <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus.</b> Two years later a follow-up CT scan showed a high-density mass in the base of right middle cranial fossa (Fig. 1).

40|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> consists in the presence, in its histologic picture, of numerous hypertrophic nerves and nerve-like figures, positive for histochemical and immunohistochemical methods for nerve fibers and myelin sheaths. These findings, first described in Masson's original article and repeatedly highlighted {{in the past}} for their possible histogenetic significance, are currently considered as merely coincidental. However, the thin conventional histologic sections, catching only short tracts of the nerves, preclude a correct observation of their route and do not allow us to verify if there is an architectural relationship between them and the nevus as a whole. With this aim, we observed a few specimens of <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> on digitally overlapped images of contiguous 25 -[mu]m-thick sections, processed with Winkelmann's technique of silver impregnation for nerve fibers, which supplied an overall, 3 -dimensional view of the lesions and the nerves running through them. In these images, the lobular form of the nevus could be seen gathering around a branching hypertrophic nerve, whose stem stretched vertically from the depth to the most superficial tract of the lesion. The nevus cell aggregates invested the stem and the limbs individually, and these followed the curvilinear contour of the nevus lobules. Our images represent evidence of a preferential perineural aggregation of <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus,</b> at least in its lobular form. This indicates that the numerous nerves and the neuroid figures, observed in detail-but within a limited perspective- in the conventional sections, are not merely coincidental and they could indeed be a sign of neural differentiation and/or a clue to the possible neural origin of the nevus...|$|R

The origin of the bleeding was a giant congenital <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> (CBN) of the scalp. The report illustrates the crucial role of immediate and aggressive volume resuscitation, suturing of the skin dehiscence, and firm external compression. This therapy was combined with whole-body hypothermia. The neurological outcome of the patient was normal. A shiny blue mass on the scalp should alert neonatologists to the possibility of a blue nevus of the scalp, rather than a simple scalp hematoma. Final diagnosis is made by biopsy and histologic examination. Early surgical intervention is necessary to prevent malignant degeneration and metastasis. A multidisciplinary approach involving a pediatrician/neonatologist, dermatologist, and surgeon is thus needed for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up.

40|$|A {{case of a}} 41 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of nodular {{melanoma}} (NM), associated with an indurated dome-shaped blue-black nodule with a diameter of 1. 2 [*]cm in the gluteal region, is presented. Clinical diagnosis of the lesion, present from birth, was blue nevus. Recently, the nodule has been showing a mild enlargement and thus complete resection was performed. Histological analysis revealed a pigmented lesion with an expansive pattern of extension into the dermis and the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The lesion displayed an alveolar pattern as well as a pigmented dendritic cell pattern. The histology was consistent with <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> (CBN); however, the history of NM which was excised one year earlier, as well as the clinical information about the slow growing lesion, included a differential diagnosis of CBN, borderline melanocytic tumor, and malignant blue nevus. Additional immunohistochemical (HMB- 45, p 16, and Ki- 67) and molecular (BRAF V 600 E mutation) analyses were performed on both lesions: the CBN-like and the previously excised NM. Along with lesion history and histological analyses, p 16 staining and BRAF were useful diagnostic tools for confirming the benign nature of CBN in this case...|$|R
40|$|Intracranial {{invasion}} of <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> (CBN) {{from the skin}} is extremely rare and such a condition with malignant transformation is even rarer. A case of meningeal melanoma with malignant transformation which was derived from an Ota   nevus is presented in this report.   A 21 -year-old man with a neurocutaneous syndrome since childhood was referred with headache and mild left hemiparesia. CT scan and MRI demonstrated intracranial lesions and conjunctival biopsy leads to the pathologic diagnosis of blue nevus. Thereafter his parietal lesion was operated by craniotomy with total gross excision. On histopathological examination, diagnosis of malignant melanoma was confirmed. Approximately 2 months after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, he afflicted to diplopia and blurred vision on the leftside due to enlargement of orbital and cavernous sinus lesion. Following one year follow-up,he was survived and thrived with diffuse leptomeningeal nodular enhancement in favor of melanoma dissemination. Primary intracranial melanomas are though rare, {{but it should be}} suspected especially in the presence of periorbital blue nevus or nevus of Ota. Moreover, although CBN is considered benign, scalp or periorbital CBN has the potential for intracranial invasion and malignant ransformation...|$|R
40|$|Blue nevi are {{characterized}} by a collection of pigment-producing melanocytes in the dermis. These lesions clinically present as well demarcated cerulean-blue or bluish black colored papules or plaques that usually measure less than 1 cm in diameter. They are typically found on the dorsal surface of the hands and feet or {{in the head and}} neck region; however, they are rarely found in the oral cavity. These lesions are usually benign and stable over time. However, malignant melanomas developing in or associated with a blue nevus (which is also called malignant blue nevus) have been only rarely reported. A malignant blue nevus might develop in a common blue or <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus,</b> a giant congenital nevus or in a nevus of Ota, or it may be malignant from the start. Malignant blue nevi most commonly are found on the scalp. A malignant blue nevus of the lip has not been previously reported in the medical literature. We report here on a patient with a malignant melanoma associated with a blue nevus of the lip. The malignant melanoma was presumed to have developed from a blue nevus that was present on the upper lip of a 50 -year-old male...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of a conjunctival blue nevus and review the {{literature}} pertaining to these pigmented lesions in this location, describing clinical and histological report of a patient with a blue nevus of the palpebral conjunctiva with a literature review. A 64 -year-old white female was evaluated for a darkening pigmented lesion of the left lower palpebral conjunctiva. Examination revealed a 3 mm x 6 mm blue-black lesion with sharply demarcated edges and an irregular border. Histopa - thology showed plump spindle-shaped, pigmented melanocytic cells revealing a branching network of dendritic processes with small, elongated, and hyperchromatic nuclei consistent with a common blue nevus. No recurrence was noted at 9 -month follow-up. Blue nevi of the conjunctiva are lesions that have a low risk for malignant transformation but can appear clinically similar to primary acquired melanosis or melanoma. Blue nevi of the conjunctiva are rare and represent 0. 5 %- 3. 0 % of pigmented conjunctival lesions.

40|$|Genes and {{pathways}} {{that allow}} cells {{to cope with}} oncogene-induced stress represent selective cancer therapeutic targets that remain largely undiscovered.

Short-term treatment of nascent melanoma tumors with PAK inhibitors that block RhoJ signaling halts the growth of BRAF mutant melanoma tumors in vivo and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro via a BAD-dependent mechanism.

40|$|Abundant mucin {{deposition}} is {{an unusual}} finding for melanocytic lesions. This notion, however, should be toned down since mucin may be present in distinct melanocytic lesions. Indeed, following the first description of mucin depositions in neural differentiated naevi by Maize and Ackerman in 1987 1 this phenomenon was repeatedly observed. 2, 3, 4, 5 Especially in blue naevi mucin deposition is a peculiar observation. For blue naevi 5 variants are distinguished to avoid the misdiagnosis of melanoma with stromal mucin deposition 6 : (i) neural nevus, (ii) myxoid intradermal <b>nevus,</b> (iii) alveolar <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus,</b> (iiii) ancient melanocytic nevus, (v) sclerosing blue nevus. In 2003, Rongioletti and Innocenzi described the first two examples of sclerosing blue naevi with an abundant mucinous stroma. Herein, we describe the third case of this rare entity. It should be noted, that particularly this uncommon variant of a blue naevus is easily mistaken as desmoplastic-neurotropic melanoma in which the present stromal deposition of mucin is a more typical finding. A specimen from the right lower leg of a 53 -year old man was referred to our dermatopathology department with the clinical diagnosis of a dermatofibroma. Clinically, the tumor appeared as a brown lesion with a regular and sharp border. The histopathological work up revealed a symmetrical, well circumscribed papule; the fibro-mucinou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Blue nevi {{that arise}} from the Müllerian tract are rare melanocytic lesions. Several histopathologic {{variants}} of cellular blue nevi have been described. The angiomatoid variant {{is characterized by a}} vascular component, and {{is considered to be a}} rare variant. Few studies have explored the influence of pregnancy on melanocytic lesions. Case A 29 -year-old woman was presented with a pigmented vaginal lesion that increased gradually during pregnancy. A full term gynecologic examination showed a tumor mass protruding into the vaginal canal. The mass was resected during cesarean-section under the clinical impression of vaginal hemangioma. Result Gross examination revealed a cystic mass measuring 6. 0 × 4. 3 × 3. 5 cm, which was filled with dark friable material. Histologically, the mass showed a subepithelial cellular proliferation of heavily pigmented dendritic melanocytes with prominent vascular stroma. Cytologic pleomorphism, junctional activity, atypical mitosis, and necrosis were not found. The proliferation was immunoreactive for HMB- 45, S- 100 and melan-A, and non-immunoreactive for CD 34, smooth muscle actin, and AE 1 /AE 3. The MIB- 1 proliferative index was less than 1 %. The patient had a postoperative course without complication. Conclusions Angiomatoid giant <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> arising from the vagina during pregnancy is extremely rare. The low proliferative index and absence of cytologic pleomorphism, or necrosis, supports a benign biological behavior. Clinical follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence at one year after the resection of the mass. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{differential diagnosis}} between melanotic schwannoma, primary leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions and <b>cellular</b> blue <b>nevus</b> can be challenging. Correct diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma {{is important to}} select patients who need clinical evaluation for possible association with Carney complex. Recently, we described the presence of activating codon 209 mutations in the GNAQ gene in primary leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions. Identical codon 209 mutations have been described in blue nevi. The aims {{of the present study}} were to (1) perform a histological review of a series of lesions (initially) diagnosed as melanotic schwannoma and analyze them for GNAQ mutations, and (2) test the diagnostic value of GNAQ mutational analysis in the differential diagnosis with leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions. We retrieved 25 cases that were initially diagnosed as melanotic schwannoma. All cases were reviewed using established criteria and analyzed for GNAQ codon 209 mutations. After review, nine cases were classified as melanotic schwannoma. GNAQ mutations were absent in these nine cases. The remaining cases were reclassified as conventional schwannoma (n = 9), melanocytoma (n = 4), blue nevus (n = 1) and lesions that could not be classified with certainty as melanotic schwannoma or melanocytoma (n = 2). GNAQ codon 209 mutations were present in 3 / 4 melanocytomas and the blue nevus. Including results from our previous study in leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions, GNAQ mutations were highly specific (100 %) for leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions compared to melanotic schwannoma (sensitivity 43 %). We conclude that a detailed analysis of morphology combined with GNAQ mutational analysis can aid in the differential diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma with leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions...|$|R
