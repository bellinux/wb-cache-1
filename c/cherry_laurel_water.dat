40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} consumers interest and demand for traditional foods, which have {{an important role in the}} diets. Traditional foods can also be a valuable contribution to the development and economic sustainability of rural areas and the preservation of biodiversity. The aim of this study was to determine the proximate composition in traditional vegetable and fruit based recipes from Black Sea Area countries, in the frame of the European Project BaSeFood. The determination of the nutritional composition of selected traditional foods from Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine is being carried out within the frame of the BaSeFood Project. Six foods from the vegetables group were analysed: Ukrainian borsch; Transcarpathian green borsch; Nettle sour soup; Nettles with walnut sauce; Rodopian dried beans and Kale soup. From the fruits group, five traditional foods were analysed: Uzvar; Plums jam; Churchkhela; Rose jam and Fruit of the evergreen <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel.</b> <b>Water</b> content, ash, total protein, total fat, total sugars and total dietary fibre are being determined at an accredited laboratory by ISO/IEC 17025 or by successful participation in Proficiency testing schemes. Most vegetable based foods have water and ash content higher than fruits. The values for water ranged from 14. 2 to 92. 4 g/ 100 g for Rose jam and Nettle sour soup, respectively. With respect to total fat content, generally fruit based foods have lower levels (< 0. 15 g/ 100 g) than vegetables (5. 02 g/ 100 g). For total protein, Nettles with walnut sauce presented the highest content (9. 6 g / 100 g) and Rose jam the lowest content (0. 3 g/ 100 g). For total dietary fibre, the values varied between 0. 3 and 6. 44 g/ 100 g. All analytical values are expressed per 100 g of edible portion. The proximate composition of the selected traditional foods from Black Sea Area Countries is important in order to elucidate their role in the dietary pattern of populations. The analysed samples present a high moisture content and low fat content. Foods with high water content are usually low in calories. Therefore, vegetable and fruit based traditional foods are not energy dense foods, while they are considered rich in other essential nutrients.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: <b>Cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> {{has been}} used as an anti-diabetic drug. In this study, we aimed to {{evaluate}} its anti-diabetic activity at standard living conditions and under stress by an experimental study. Material and Method: Forty Wistar-Albino rats weighing 300 – 350 grams were used in this study. Four groups were structured: control, diabetic, glibenclamide and <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> extract. Streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) was injected to induce diabetes. <b>Cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> extract was obtained from the seed of the fruit. Routine blood glucose, insulin, pre- and intra-anesthesia blood glucose levels were measured and compared. The One-way ANOVA followed by Duncan post-hoc test was used for statistical analysis. Results: After the second week of the experiment, Extract 300 and Extract 600 groups had the lower glucose levels (p< 0. 05). Also, insulin levels measured at the last week of the study revealed that Extract 300 and Extract 600 groups had the highest results (p< 0. 01). Glucose levels under stress conditions significantly changed for Extract 300 and glibenclamide group (p< 0. 05). Glucose level changed more obviously in the Extract 600 group (p< 0. 001) that means irregularity. Conclusion: <b>Cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> extract exhibits an anti-diabetic effect, with administration leading to elevated insulin levels, and regulating glucose levels under stress conditions like anesthesia. These preliminary results indicate that further evaluation is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Encapsulation protects {{sensitive}} food ingredients against heat, oxygen, {{moisture and}} pH {{until they are}} released to the system.

The objective of this research was to study the effects of centrifugation, different coating materials and homogenization methods on microencapsulation of powders obtained from <b>cherry</b> <b>laurels.</b> In this study, maltodextrin and mixture of maltodextrin:whey protein with a ratio of 1 : 3 (w/w) were chosen as coating materials. Total solid content of coating materials was kept constant as 10 % (w/w). Capsules were obtained from powders of freeze-dried <b>cherry</b> <b>laurels</b> through encapsulation process by silent crusher homogenizer or microfluidization. Freeze-dried <b>cherry</b> <b>laurels</b> were core materials and core to coating ratio was chosen as 1 : 10 by weight. To homogenize the mixture, high speed homogenizer was used at 4000 rpm for 5 min. Then, silent crusher or microfluidizer was used to complete encapsulation process. The mixtures were treated either by silent crusher for 1 min at 75000 rpm or microfluidizer at 50 MPa for 3 passes. Freeze drying for 48 hours was applied to emulsions to obtain capsules in powder form. After these steps, dry capsules were grounded manually into a fine powder. The microcapsules were analyzed for total antioxidant activity with DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging method. Prior to high speed homogenization, the samples were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 1 min). Centrifugation was found to have positive effect on total antioxidant activity of capsules. Microcapsules treated by microfluidizer were found to have higher total antioxidant activities than those treated by silent crusher. It was found that increasing whey protein concentration in coating material (using maltodextrin:whey protein 1 : 3 mixture) had positive effect on total antioxidant activity for both silent crusher and microfluidization methods. Therefore, capsules prepared by microfluidization of centrifuged mixtures can be selected as the best conditions for encapsulation of <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> powder by considering their total antioxidant activity. In this study, it was shown that capsules prepared by these methods can be recommended to be incorporated into foods in order to enhance their functionality by increasing antioxidant activity...|$|R

As no information is available yet about the epidemiology of this quarantine bacterium in <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel,</b> molecular typing of Xap isolates can considerably improve our understanding of pathogen spread between various <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> production systems in different regions of the Netherlands and pathogen relatedness among different disease outbreaks. In this study, the genotypic diversity within a population of 25 Xap isolates isolated from different <b>cherry</b> <b>laurel</b> cultivars grown in different locations in the Netherlands between 2008 - 2010, was assessed using Multiple-locus variable-number analysis (MLVA). The identity of these Xap isolates was initially determined based on the EPPO standard PM 7 / 64. Confirmation of the identity of these Xap isolates was additionally achieved with diverse methodologies, including gyrase subunit B (gyrB) sequence typing, BOXand ERIC-PCR, AFLP, and Xap-specific PCR’s: one based on the previously described Pagani primers (2004) (conventional-PCR and its TaqMan-PCR variant) and one based on the recently described Pothier primers (2011 c). Based on the results of the MLVA analysis, the Dutch population of Xap isolates could be divided into two groups; however no correlation with the geographical origin or any other character of these isolates could be established. Additionally, based on colony morphology, a panel of 5 look-a-likes were isolated from symptomatic leaves of P. laurocerasus which reacted in the Xap-specific PCR described by Pagani (2004) but that did not react in the Xap-specific PCR described by Pothier et al. (2011 c). Further characterisation of these look-a-like isolates with AFLP, BOXand ERIC-PCR, and gyrB sequencing showed that the Xap-specific PCR described by Pagani does not discriminate between Xap and the look-a-like isolates. Similarly to Pagani PCR, the performance of a pathogenicity test with a pure culture of the isolate was not always discriminative between Xap and the look-a-like isolates, unraveling a complexity in Xanthomonas pathogenicity. Therefore, in routine screening based on the EPPO standard PM 7 / 64, complementary techniques such as BOX- ERIC-PCR, gyrB sequencing, Xap-specific PCR described by Pothier (2011 c), MLVA and AFLP should be used to obtain a reliable diagnosis of Xap and avoid false positive results...|$|R
