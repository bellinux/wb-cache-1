This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditure</b> is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

For many applications, {{such as those}} focusing on the impacts of tourism or benefits systems, such binomial assumptions are not satisfactory.

We set out a general model for the treatment of <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> and illustrate its application through the case of university students.

40|$|Economic {{policies}} are often judged {{by a handful}} of statistics, some of which may be biased during periods of change. We estimate the income growth implied by the evolution of food demand and durable good ownership in post-reform Brazil and Mexico, and find that changes in consumption patterns are inconsistent with official estimates of near stagnant incomes. That is attributed to biases in the price deflator. The estimated unmeasured income gains are higher for poorer households, implying marked reductions in "real" inequality. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that post-reform income growth was low and did not benefit the poor.
