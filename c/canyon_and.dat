5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> could not change its course.|$|E

Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was {{a wide-ranging}} genus in both time and space. The rock units {{from which it}} is known {{can be divided into}} two groups by age: the older Horseshoe <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and {{equivalents}} is also known as Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.|$|E
5|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} {{south of the}} <b>canyon</b> <b>and</b> in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.|$|E

5|$|It took Varno {{six weeks}} to write the script, the {{original}} working title of which was Creature from Galaxy 27. The story was partially influenced by the real-life Space Race and the Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World (1951). Screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith gave Varno uncredited assistance with the dialogue. With a budget of about $68,000, it was shot over seven days at the Charlie Chaplin Studios, Bronson <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> a television station on Mount Lee in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Lekson {{developed}} a theory called the Chaco Meridian, {{which is based}} on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco <b>Canyon,</b> <b>and</b> Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico. He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude (107°57'25"), and this indicates a ceremonial connection between them. The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the trails}} in the {{watershed}} are biking and equestrian trails {{located in the}} lower portion of the watershed, in the immensely popular Aliso <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> its tributary, Wood Canyon. Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail, the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek (Wood Canyon Creek). There is also a bikeway along Sulphur Creek and along parts of English Canyon.|$|E

5|$|SR52 begins {{just west}} of I-5 at {{the eastern end of}} La Jolla Parkway. Before {{entering}} San Clemente Canyon, the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I-5. The canyon is part of Marian Bear Natural Park. The freeway runs north of the Rose Canyon Fault, composed of Late Cretaceous rock estimated to be 90million years old, and Mount Soledad. Following exits with Clairemont Mesa Boulevard / Regents Road and Genesee Avenue, SR52 intersects I-805 before exiting the <b>canyon</b> <b>and</b> traveling along the southern edge of the MCAS Miramar military base.|$|E
5|$|State Route 16 {{begins in}} Colusa County near Wilbur Springs at the {{junction}} with State Route 20. SR 16 goes south alongside Bear Creek, which enters a narrow <b>canyon</b> <b>and</b> joins with Cache Creek near the Yolo County line. SR 16 continues in the canyon, running close to the river, passing Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park, and emerging from the canyon north of Rumsey. This section is so prone to rock slides that there are permanent gates at each end.|$|E
5|$|The canyon {{was most}} likely formed by San Diego Creek cutting through the rising San Joaquin Hills over a span of about 1.22 million years. At some point, however, the creek changed course, and the water gap it had formed was walled off by the {{mountains}} and became a separate watershed. The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> the San Diego Creek watershed is very small, allowing for the canyon's modern use as a transportation route.|$|E
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat for}} ferruginous hawks are the arid and semiarid grassland regions of North America. The countryside is open, level, or rolling prairies; foothills or middle elevation plateaus largely devoid of trees; and cultivated shelterbelts or riparian corridors. Rock outcrops, shallow <b>canyons,</b> <b>and</b> gullies may characterize some habitats. These hawks avoid high elevations, forest interiors, narrow <b>canyons,</b> <b>and</b> cliff areas.|$|R
5000|$|Colorful escarpments, calico-colored mountains, maze-like <b>canyons</b> <b>and</b> broad, majestic bajadas come {{together}} here. Steep <b>canyons</b> <b>and</b> cliff-like walls form dry falls along deep drainage channels, creating cascades during heavy rain storms. More {{than a half}} dozen natural water [...] "tanks" [...] sit within the lava flow. Two of the tanks, Hidden Tank and Deep Tank, hold thousands of gallons of water, drawing wildlife.|$|R

5|$|The {{first serious}} {{interest}} in the road came in mid-1969, when the National Park Service approved a plan to develop the facilities with Amistad. The Rough <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> Diablo East portions of the park were given particular focus, since {{they were the only}} two that were in existence at the time. Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, in an attempt to increase tourism.|$|E
5|$|Turquoise {{was very}} {{important}} to the people of Chaco. Around 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco <b>Canyon,</b> <b>and</b> workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. The turquoise was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. Over 15,000 turquoise beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican <b>canyon</b> <b>and</b> various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the <b>canyon,</b> <b>and</b> that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Yosemite National Park, tourists began to travel into the Merced <b>Canyon</b> <b>and</b> Yosemite Valley as early as 1855. The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s. The first was Coulterville Road, followed by Big Oak Flat Road, a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon. Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. With {{the creation of the}} national park tourism to the Valley and the Merced River increased significantly, leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed. Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed, including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest.|$|E
