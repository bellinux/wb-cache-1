50|$|Caldillo de congrio (Spanish for <b>Cusk-eel</b> stock) is a Chilean fish dish. The dish {{is made of}} congrio Dorado (pink <b>cusk-eel)</b> or Colorado (red <b>cusk-eel),</b> a <b>cusk-eel</b> species {{common in}} the Chilean Sea. The dish is made by boiling {{together}} fish heads, onion, garlic, coriander, carrots and pepper. Once these are boiled, only the stock is used.

50|$|Juvenile <b>cusk-eels</b> {{have been}} found to {{associate}} with P. placenta, either hiding underneath it or between the long spines on its aboral surface. The fish are believed to receive protection from predators among the spines and may be able to feed in areas with few natural refugia.|$|E
50|$|The tadpole cod is {{distinct}} from the tadpole fish, Raniceps raninus. This fish was formerly classified in the family Ranicipitidae, called the tadpole cods, as its sole member. The family {{was placed in a}} different order of fish, the Ophidiiformes (<b>cusk-eels</b> and brotulas). However, it is now regarded {{as a member of the}} same family as cods, Gadidae.|$|E
50|$|Ophidiiformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish that {{includes}} the <b>cusk-eels</b> (family Ophidiidae), pearlfishes (family Carapidae), brotulas (family Bythitidae), and others. Members of this order have small heads and long slender bodies. They have either smooth scales or no scales, a long dorsal fin and an anal fin that typically runs into the caudal fin. They mostly come from the tropics and subtropics, and live in both freshwater and marine habitats, including abyssal depths. They have adopted a range of feeding methods and lifestyles, including parasitism. The majority are egg-laying, but some are viviparous.|$|E

40|$|Aporocotyle mariachristinae n. sp. and A. ymakara Villalba & Fernández, 1986 were {{collected}} from the bulbus arteriosus and ventral aorta of pink <b>cusk-eels,</b> Genypterus blacodes (Forster, 1801) from Patagonia, Argentina. A. mariachristinae n. sp. can be distinguished from all the species of Aporocotyle by the asymmetrical extension of posterior caeca (right posterior caecum longer, terminating at the area between mid-level of ovary and posterior body end; left posterior caecum shorter, terminating at the area between mid-level of cirrus sac and posterior to reproductive organs), the distribution of spines along the ventro-lateral body margins {{and the number of}} testes. The new species clearly differs from A. ymakara, from the same host species, in the esophagus / body length ratio, the absence of distal loops at caeca, the anterior caeca / posterior caeca length ratio, and the number of testes. Additionally, in A. ymakara the left posterior caecum may be longe...|$|E
40|$|Understanding factors {{controlling}} {{the distribution and}} reproduction of fishes is crucial for developing ecosystem models of fish populations. Yet, these observations are difficult to make on {{the same time and}} space scales as physical forcing events. A hydrophone was used to record fish sound production associated with reproduction at the LEO- 1. 5 ocean observatory to determine the relationship between variation in fish calling behavior and oceanographic variation. Sound production was dominated by Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, weakfish Cynoscion regalis, and striped cusk-eel Ophidion marginatum. Striped <b>cusk-eels</b> called with a crepuscular pattern, with a strong peak at dusk, less sound production during the night, and a lesser peak in sound production at dawn. Sciaenids called mostly at dusk and night. Nine advection events bringing colder waters to the LEO- 15 site were correlated with greatly reduced levels of sound production in Atlantic croaker and weakfish on daily time scales. Our results show how ocean observatories with passive acoustics can study tightly coupled physical oceanographic influences on fish behavior on daily time scales...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{reports of}} high {{frequency}} sound production by <b>cusk-eels</b> cannot be explained adequately by known mechanisms, i. e., a forced response driven by fast sonic muscles on the swimbladder. Time {{to complete a}} contraction-relaxation cycle places a ceiling on frequency and is unlikely to explain sounds with dominant frequencies above 1 kHz. We investigated sonic morphology in the fawn cusk-eel Lepophidium profundorum to determine morphology potentially associated with high frequency sound production and quantified development and sexual dimorphism of sonic structures. Unlike other sonic systems in fishes in which muscle relaxation is caused by internal pressure or swimbladder elasticity, this system utilizes antagonistic pairs of muscles: ventral and intermediate muscles pull the winglike process and swimbladder forward and pivot the neural arch (neural rocker) above the first vertebra backward. This action stretches a fenestra in the swimbladder wall and imparts strain energy to epineural ribs, tendons and ligaments connected to the anterior swimbladder. Relatively short antagonistic dorsal and dorsomedial muscles pull on the neural rocker, releasing strain energy, and use a lever advantage to restore the winglike process and swimbladder to their resting position. Sonic components grow isometrically and are typically larger in males although the tiny intermediate muscles are larger in females. Although external morphology is relatively conservative in ophidiids, sonic morphology is extremely variable within the family. Peer reviewe...|$|E
