40|$|The {{growth of}} self-assembled InN {{nanostructures}} on GaN by MBE {{has been studied}} using two different nitrogen sources.

With a low V:III ratio, we did not detect InN growth, and instead observed the formation of irregularly shaped indium islands on the GaN surface. With higher VAII ratios, nanostructure growth was observed for thin (approximate to 2 ML) layers. Further deposition resulted in the growth of polycrystalline material. The differences between the two pressure regimes may be explained in terms of the interplay between equilibrium thermodynamics and growth kinetics.

40|$|Abstract. Increasing {{density is}} the best way to {{increase}} the performance of powder metallurgy materials. Conventional powder metallurgy processing can produce copper green compacts with density less than 8. 3 g/cm 3 (a relative density of 93 %). Performances of these conventionally compacted materials are substantially lower than their full density counterparts. Warm compaction, which is a simple and economical forming process to prepare high density powder metallurgy parts or materials, was employed to develop a Ti 3 SiC 2 particulate reinforced copper matrix composite with high density, high electrical conductivity and high strength. Copper matrix composites reinforced with 5, 10 and 15 mass. % Ti 3 SiC 2 particulate were prepared by compacting powder with a pressure of 700 MPa at 145 °C, then sintered at 1000 °C under <b>cracked</b> <b>ammonia</b> atmosphere for 60 minutes. Their density, electrical conductivity, ultimate tensile strength and elongation percentage decrease with the increase in particulate concentration, while hardness increases with the increase in particulate concentration. A small addition of Ti 3 SiC 2 particulate can increase the hardness and the wear-resistivity of the composite without losing much of electrical conductivity. Using warm compaction technique, sintered composite with 5 % Ti 3 SiC 2, has an ultimate tensile strength of 201 MPa with an elongation of 8. 1 %, a hardness of HB 68 and a resistivity of 11. 04 x 10 - 8 Ω m...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most promising materials for energy storage during the last decade with considerable research having been undertaken to demonstrate the use of the molecule in power production systems. However, hydrogen presents drawbacks in terms of global commercialisation and deployment since its distribution is only feasible with significant dedicated infrastructure investment including liquefaction or if it is combined with other gases such as methane. The latter will still produce carbon emissions, whilst the former is not economically viable with current technologies. Therefore, an alternative is to use ammonia as a hydrogen storage vector. Ammonia, a molecule that has been used for more than a century, is a well-known material distributed across the world. Moreover, its properties allow its liquefaction at a relatively low pressure under atmospheric temperature compared to hydrogen, serving as a compound that can be used from fertilising to industrial processes. For power generation, ammonia has demonstrated to have a very slow reaction hence flame speeds, thus one option is to dope the fuel with a more reactive molecule such as hydrogen, which conveniently can be obtained from <b>cracking</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Hence, this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental campaign where a 50 : 50 (vol%) ammonia-hydrogen blend was used for lean premixed combustion in a generic swirl combustor used in gas turbine studies. The results show that whilst the mixture can produce a good flame velocity similar to methane with the mixture having near equivalent laminar flame speed characteristics, the high diffusivity of hydrogen under these conditions leads to a narrow operational envelope with the potential for boundary layer flashback. High NOx emissions are produced due to the excess production of OH and O radicals. Recommendations for further studies and future developments are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{deals with}} the {{catalytic}} hydrogen production for mobile application, for example for the use in fuel cells for electric cars. Electric powered buses with fuel cells as driving system are well known, but the secure hydrogen storage in adequate amounts for long distance drive is still a topic of discussion. Methanol is an excellent hydrogen carrier. First of all it has a high H:C ratio and therefore a high energy density. Secondly the operating temperature of steam reforming of methanol is comparatively low (250 °C) {{and there is no}} risk of coking since methanol has no C-C bond. Thirdly methanol is a liquid, which means that the present gasoline infrastructure can be used. For the further development of catalysts and {{for the construction of a}} reformer it is very important to characterize the catalysts very well. For the dimensioning and the control of an on-board production of hydrogen it is essential to draw accurately on the thermodynamic, chemical and kinetic data of the reaction. At the first part of this work the mesoporous Cu/ZrO 2 /CeO 2 -catalysts with various copper contents were characterized and their long-term stability and selectivity were investigated, and the kinetic data were determined. Carbon monoxide is generated by reforming of carbon containing material. This process is undesired since CO poisons the Pt electrode of the fuel cell. The separation of hydrogen by metal membranes is technically feasible and a high purity of hydrogen can be obtained. However, due to their high densitiy this procedure is not favourable because of its energy loss. In this study a concept is presented, which enables an autothermal mode by application of ceramic membrane and simultaneously could help to deal with the CO problem. The search for an absolutely selective catalyst is uncertain. The production of CO can be neither chemically nor thermodynamically excluded, if carbon is present in the hydrogen carrier. Since enrichment or separation are unfavourable for energetic and economic reasons, it is reasonable to investigate another reaction system, which is free of carbon. At the last part of this study the catalytic production of hydrogen from <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking</b> was investigated. <b>Ammonia</b> is an interesting alternative: it has a high hydrogen densitiy, it is available and cheap. Since the Pt electrode is sensitive to reactive substances, it must be ensured, that for example no hydrazine is produced during the <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking.</b> A new type of <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking</b> catalyst was investigated in this study, which unlike the conventional catalyst is not based on metal. Four different zirconium oxynitrides: ß’ ZrON, ß” ZrON, Zr 2 ON 2 and Zr 0. 88 Y 0. 12 O 1. 72 N 0. 15 (Y 2 O 3 doped ZrON) were prepared by various methods and subsequently tested for their activity in <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking.</b> A long-term study was carried out on the best catalyst and no hydrazine was detected.

Small amount of nickel improves strength and corrosion resistance and promotes wetting of carbides. Addition of manganese together with nickel increases fracture toughness.

50|$|Brass is {{susceptible}} to stress corrosion <b>cracking,</b> especially from <b>ammonia</b> or substances containing or releasing ammonia. The problem is sometimes known as season cracking after it was first discovered in brass cartridges used for rifle ammunition during the 1920s in the British Indian Army. The problem was caused by high residual stresses from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by annealing the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Anhydrous ammonia {{is one of}} {{the medium}} where the steel is easy to suffer stress {{corrosion}} cracking. Many stress corrosion <b>crack</b> accidents of <b>ammonia</b> storage tanks have been reported all over the world for recent years. 16 MnR low alloy steel with good composite mechanical properties is the most common used pressure vessel steel in China, it has better anticorrosion properties than the low alloy high strength steel, especially in anhydrous ammonia environments. Many stress corrosion crack researches have been done for 16 MnR steel in wet hydrogen sulfide service for last decades, but less has been done in anhydrous ammonia environments. Stress corrosion tests with eight constant strain pre-cracked specimen were carried out in this work. The pre-cracked specimen were loaded with loading bolts and put into the special ammonia storage tank for tests, they were taken out from the tank periodically to measure crack length. The stress corrosion crack growth rate and the threshold stress intensity factors KISCC of 16 MnR steel in anhydrous ammonia environments were measured. Based on test results, the effects of environmental factors and steel strength on stress corrosion cracking of 16 MnR steel in anhydrous ammonia service were analyzed. It could be concluded that specimen cracks of the 16 MnR steel in anhydrous ammonia environments almost do not grow, threshold stress intensity factors KISCC are higher than 90 MPa m...|$|R
40|$|Copper based alloys are {{frequently}} used in marine water systems. They have indeed an attractive price and offer interesting mechanical characteristics associated {{to a relatively}} good resistance to corrosion in sea water. Nevertheless, they can suffer from certain forms of corrosion such as localised corrosion with sulphides pollution, crevice corrosion, or stress corrosion cracking in sea water more or less polluted with ammonia. A high strength copper nickel alloy (Nibron) and a Nickel Aluminium Bronze (A 45) are respectively compared to classical CuNi 90 - 10 (CuNi 10 Fe 1 Mn) and CuAl 9 Ni 3 Fe 2, elsewhere well known for their experimental feedback in sea water.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} a high {{temperature}} proton exchange membrane (SPEEK-type) fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) energy system fuelled with hydrogen obtained by reforming of ammonia (NH 3) and coupled with a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) energy system. This system was designed for distributed electric power generation, mainly for production of electric power systems with potential future applications in smart-grid. The use of ammonia as hydrogen rich gas source allows to avoid hydrogen tanking with metal hydrides, giving the opportunity to lighten and simplify the storage section of the system {{with respect to the}} pure hydrogen fed systems. The hybrid fuel cell/ORC configuration allows to increase the efficiency of standard power generation technologies. In other words, the ORC subset represents the most appropriate solution, in terms of sustainability, for extracting the excess heat produced during the H 2 combustion maintaining the PEMFC working temperature at 120 °C and for reducing the temperature of the exhausts. The objective of the work is to optimize the electric output of the system (PEMFC + ORC), thus improving the overall efficiency. To this end, a numerical model is implemented and tested. A validation of the numerical scheme is carried out comparing the prediction of the reforming phase with experimental results obtained by the authors. The thermal and electrical energy balance is also assessed. Furthermore, the operation conditions of the reformer are studied in detail to determine the settlements leading to a proper <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking</b> to produce nitrogen and hydrogen.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of urea-water into hydrogen {{was investigated in}} a downward flow packed-bed reactor using a Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. This was conducted at atmospheric pressure under molar steam to carbon ratios (S:C) of 4 - 7, and at temperatures between 500 and 700 °C. The urea and water conversions, selectivity to the hydrogen containing products H 2, CH 4 and NH 3, selectivity to the carbon containing products CO 2, CO and CH 4, and the hydrogen yield, were {{very close to the}} calculated equilibrium values at and above S:C of 5 and temperatures at and above 600 °C. CO 2 dominated the carbon products, in agreement with equilibrium trends. The selectivity to ammonia decreased abruptly from 20 % to below 5 % when the temperature increased from 500 to 550 °C, and exhibited a small sensitivity to the steam to carbon ratio. High selectivity to NH 3 was accompanied by a low urea conversion to CO, CO 2 and CH 4, and poor hydrogen yield below 500 °C. Up to 99. 3 % of the ammonia generated was easily separated from the syngas by condensation in the excess water. Experiments replacing the Ni-bed with Al 2 O 3 pellets showed no significant H 2 yield, while the main H-product was overwhelmingly NH 3. Aqueous <b>ammonia</b> <b>cracking</b> experiments indicated a reaction further away from equilibrium than the equivalent urea-water experiments, indicative of a hydrogen formation mechanism from urea to water that {{was more than just a}} sequence of urea decomposition, HNCO hydrolysis and NH 3 cracking. Looking for signs of deactivation, the catalyst was characterised with N 2 adsorption, TEM-EDX, and powder XRD.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence {{and patterns of}} use of crack and cocaine hydrochloride among heroin users in Spain. To explore if the expansion of heroin smoking {{is accompanied by a}} similar phenomenon for cocaine. DESIGN: Cross sectional study in 1995. Face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. SETTING: Three cities with different prevalences of heroin use by smoking: high (Seville), intermediate (Madrid), and low (Barcelona). PARTICIPANTS: 909 heroin users, 452 in treatment and 457 out of treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Last month prevalence of crack use was 62. 3 % in Seville, 19. 4 % in Madrid, and 7. 7 % in Barcelona. Most users in Madrid (86. 5 %) and Barcelona (100 %) generally prepared their own <b>crack,</b> usually with <b>ammonia</b> as alkali; in Seville most users (69. 7 %) bought preprocessed crack. The proportion of users who began taking cocaine (crack or cocaine hydrochloride) by smoking has increased progressively since the seventies, rising to 74. 1 % in Seville, 61. 5 % in Madrid, and 28 % in Barcelona in 1992 - 1995, with the earliest increase in Seville. The factors associated with crack use were: residence in Seville (odds ratio (OR) = 16. 3), cocaine hydrochloride use mainly by smoking (OR = 5. 0), by sniffing (OR = 2. 7) or by injecting (OR = 2. 5), heroin use mainly by smoking (OR = 2. 8) and weekly use of cannabis (OR = 1. 9). CONCLUSIONS: In Spain smoking cocaine may be progressively diffusing from the south west to the north east, similar to what has happened with smoking heroin, but beginning later in time. The factors associated with smoking cocaine are basically ecological or cultural in nature (characteristics of the available drugs and the main route of heroin administration in each city) ...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{decomposition}} in {{an integrated}} Catalytic Membrane Reactor for hydrogen production was studied by numerical simulation. The process is based on anhydrous NH(3) thermal dissociation inside a small size reactor (30 cm(3)), filled by a Ni/Al(2) O(3) catalyst. The reaction is promoted {{by the presence of}} seven Pd coated tubular membranes about 203 mm long, with an outer diameter of 1. 98 mm, which shift the NH(3) decomposition towards the products by removing hydrogen from the reaction area. The system fluid-dynamics was implemented into a 2 D and 3 D geometrical model. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>cracking</b> reaction over the Nil Al(2) O(3) catalyst was simulated using the Temkin-Pyzhev equation. Introductory 2 D simulations were first carried out for a hypothetic system without membranes. Because of reactor axial symmetry, different operative pressures, temperatures and input flows were evaluated. These introductory results showed an excellent ammonia conversion at 550 degrees C and 0. 2 MPa for an input flow of 1. 1 mg/s, with a residual NH 3 of only a few ppm. 3 D simulations were then carried out for the system with membranes. Hydrogen adsorption throughout the membranes has been modeled using the Sievert's law for the dissociative hydrogen flux. Several runs have been carried out at 1 MPa changing the temperature between 500 degrees C and 600 degrees C to point out the conditions for which the permeated hydrogen flux is the highest. With temperatures higher than 550 degrees C we obtained an almost complete ammonia conversion already before the membrane area. The working temperature of 550 degrees C resulted to be the most suitable for the reactor geometry. A good matching between membrane permeation and ammonia decomposition was obtained for an NH(3) input flow rate of 2. 8 mg/s. Ammonia reaction shift due to the presence of H(2) permeable membranes in the reactor significantly fostered the dissociation: for the 550 degrees C case we obtained a conversion rate improvement of almost 18 %.

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the growth of}} InN epilayers by high-pressure chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) and structural, optical properties of HPCVD grown InN layers has been studied. We demonstrated that the HPCVD approach suppresses the thermal decomposition of InN, and therefore extends the processing parameters towards the higher growth temperatures (up to 1100 K for reactor pressures of 15 bar, molar ammonia and TMI ratios around 800, and a carrier gas flow of 12 slm). Structural and surface morphology studies of InN thin layers have been performed by X-ray diffraction, {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectroscopy, infrared reflection, transmission, photoluminescence spectroscopy studies have been carried out to investigate the structural and optical properties of InN films grown on sapphire and GaN/sapphire templates. InN layers grown on a GaN (0002) epilayer exhibit single-phase InN (0002) X-ray diffraction peaks with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) around 200 arcsec. Auger electron spectroscopy confirmed the cleanliness of the surface, and low energy electron diffraction yielded a 1 × 1 hexagonal pattern indicating a well-ordered surface. The plasmon excitations are shifted to lower energies in HREEL spectra due to the higher carrier concentration at the surface than in the bulk, suggesting a surface electron accumulation. The surface roughness of samples grown on GaN templates is found to be smoother (roughness of 9 nm) compared to the samples grown on sapphire. We found that the deposition sometimes led to the growth of 3 dimensional hexagonal InN pyramids. Results obtained from Raman and IR reflectance measurements are used to estimate the free carrier concentrations, which were found in the range from mid 10 ^ 18 cm- 3 to low 10 ^ 20 cm- 3. The optical absorption edge energy calculated from the transmission spectra is 1. 2 eV for samples of lower electron concentration. The Raman analysis revealed a high-quality crystalline layer with a FWHM for the E 2 (high) peak around 6. 9 cm^- 1. The results presented in our study suggest that the optimum molar ratio might be below 800, which is due to the efficient <b>cracking</b> of the <b>ammonia</b> precursor at the high reactor pressure and high growth temperature...|$|R
