50|$|A {{fore-edge}} {{painting is}} a scene painted {{on the edges of}} the pages of a book. There are two basic forms, including paintings on edges that have been fanned and edges that are closed; thus with the first instance a book edge must be fanned to see the painting and in the second the painting is on the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> itself and thus should not be fanned.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid image segmentation method based edge detection and seeded region growing (SRG) methods. Our method is robust for selecting the initial seeds automatically. Also, the segmentation process is simplified and becomes very fast due to applying the proposed method to edge pixels instead of whole pixels as well-known image segmentation techniques. The method begins by obtaining closed unit-width segment boundaries using an optimum edge detection method suitably modified {{to detect and}} fill the edge holes and thinned if required. Automatically seeded SRG is used to obtain all <b>closed</b> <b>edges</b> in the image. The image is partitioned into sub-images according to the <b>closed</b> <b>edges,</b> where each sub-image contains segments, again detected using SRG, by eliminating all pixels contained in or on the sub-image. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated using acquired images {{from a range of}} different shapes and compared with established methods...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} question: How many edge guards {{are needed to}} guard an {{orthogonal}} polyhedron of e edges, r of which are reflex? It was previously established [3] that e/ 12 are sometimes necessary and e/ 6 always suffice. In contrast to the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> guardsused for these bounds, we introduce a new model, open edge guards (excluding the endpoints of the edge), which we argue are in some sense more natural in this context. After quantifying the relationship between closed and open edge guards, we improve the upper bound to show that, asymptotically, (11 / 72) e (open or <b>closed)</b> <b>edge</b> guards suffice, or, in terms of r, that (7 / 12) r suffice. Along the way, we establish tight bounds relating e and r for orthogonal polyhedra of any genus. ...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{research}} on the two-dimensional crystal structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) {{has suggested that the}} physical properties of h-BN can be tailored for a wealth of applications by controlling the atomic structure of the membrane edges. Unexplored for h-BN, however, is the possibility that small additional edge-atom distortions could have electronic structure implications critically important to nanoengineering efforts. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory, that covalent interlayer bonds form spontaneously at the edges of a h-BN bilayer, resulting in subangstrom distortions of the edge atomic structure. Orbital maps calculated in 3 D around the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> reveal that the out-of-plane bonds retain a strong π* character. We show that this <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> reconstruction, strikingly different from the equivalent case for graphene, helps the material recover its bulklike insulating behavior and thus largely negates the predicted metallic character of open edges...|$|E

The method includes the steps: performing pixel-wise support vector machine classification for the remote images which are subjected to preprocessing and characteristic extraction; performing edge detection for the remote images which are subjected to preprocessing and characteristic extraction so as to obtain a discontinuous one-pixel wide edge map; performing edge connection for the discontinuous one-pixel wide edge map subjected to noise edge removal so as to obtain a <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> map; and integrating the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> map to a map subjected to pixel-wise support vector machine classification so as to obtain a classified result map integrating the edge information.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of position changes of plasma strike points before and after edge localized modes (ELMs) in JET was carried out. A hypothesis being tested is that in an ELM previously <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> field lines would open up, releasing plasma current and leading {{to the formation of}} a new, smaller separatrix. It was observed that after each ELM strike points have shifted a few centimetres towards the plasma centre (up in JET). In some cases a transient ( 10 cm) jump of strike positions was observed first. It was followed by an equally fast jump down to the shifted strike positions. Such behaviour has not been described in previous computational models of the ELM. Therefore two novel instability mechanisms are presented, which contribute to explain the changes in strike point position: an X-point instability, due to positive toroidal current density at the X-point, and a diamagnetic instability, due to negative inboard toroidal current density...|$|E
40|$|Graphene nanodisk is a {{graphene}} derivative with a <b>closed</b> <b>edge.</b> The trigonal zigzag nanodisk with size $N$ has $N$-fold degenerated zero-energy states. A nanodisk can be interpletted as {{a quantum}} dot with an internal degree of freedom. The grand state of nanodisk {{has been argued}} to be a quasi-ferromagnet, which is a ferromagnetic-like states with a finite but very long life time. We investigate the spin-filter effects in the system made of nanodisks and leads based on the master equation. The finite-size effect on spin filter is intriguing due to a reaction from the polarization of incoming current to a quasi-ferromagnet. Analyzing the relaxation process {{with the use of}} the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we explore the response to four types of incoming currents, namely, unpolarized current, perfectly polarized current, partially polarized current and pulse polarized current.

40|$|Silicene is a honeycomb-structure silicon atoms, which shares many {{intriguing}} properties with graphene. Silicene {{is expected}} to be a quantum spin-Hall insulator due to its spin-orbit interactions. We investigate the electronic properties of silicene nanodisks, which are silicene derivatives with <b>closed</b> <b>edge.</b> In case of the simplest model of graphene nanodisks, the number of the zero-energy modes is given by the lower bound of the Lieb theorem. They are standing wave states. When the spin-orbit interaction is introduced and the system becomes a topological insulator, they begin to propagate around a nanodisk. Helical edge currents flow around the edge of a nanodisk though the crystal momentum is ill-defined. We have newly found the counting rule of the zero-energy states, and constructed the low-energy theory of zigzag triangular silicene. We also show the validity of the bulk-edge correspondence in nanodisks with rough edge by calculating the local probability amplitude and current. Finally, the signatures of the topological phase transition in silicene nanodisks under an external electric field are revealed. Our results will be observable by means of STM experiments.
