5000|$|In 1965, Turner {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to draw his first <b>colour</b> comic <b>strip,</b> based on the Gerry Anderson TV series Stingray, for TV Century 21 Stingray Extra (a holiday special issue of the weekly comic TV Century 21). The following year, Turner began contributing to TV Century 21 {{on a regular basis}} with his first continuing <b>colour</b> comic <b>strip,</b> [...] "The Daleks", featuring the mechanical villains from the TV series Doctor Who. Turner replaced the strip's previous artist Richard Jennings, initially for issues 50 and 51 (January 1966) and then on a regular basis from issue 59 (March 1966).

Thunderbirds (1965 [...] - [...] 66) was not featured until issue 52, {{but one of the}} series' main characters, the aristocratic Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, appeared from issue 1. Fireball XL5, Stingray and Lady Penelope were the first three <b>colour</b> <b>strips</b> whose origins {{can be traced to the}} first issue.

5000|$|... minus is a large-format <b>colour</b> <b>strip,</b> {{drawn and}} painted on 15x20" [...] {{illustration}} boards. On the strip's Web page, Armand {{states that he}} imagined minus as [...] "a comic strip for a newspaper in the early 20th century", in reference to both the art style and amount of space given (far greater than the usual three or four panel layout of most newspaper strips). He has cited the works of Shigeru Mizuki, and Winsor McCay's Little Nemo as stylistic influences, referring to the latter as [...] "a playground for bizarre ideas which are ends in themselves"; a similar approach to storytelling {{is used in the}} minus comic strips. He also cites John Steinbeck's Cannery Row and the films of Takeshi Kitano as other examples of stories that eschew straightforward plot development and conflict and focus just on characters and the small events that happen to them.|$|E
5000|$|Sari was {{the main}} costume for women in Vedic culture. Women used to wrap it around their waist, pleated in front over the belly and drape it over their {{shoulder}} covering their bust area and fastened it with a pin at the shoulder. ‘Choli’ or blouse, as an upper garment {{was introduced in the}} later Vedic period with sleeves and a neck. A new version of sari, little smaller than sari, called dupatta, was also incorporated later and it was used to wear along with ghaghara (frilled skirt up to feet). The word sari is derived from Sanskrit शाटी [...] which means 'strip of cloth'and शाडी [...] or साडी [...] in Prakrit, and became [...] in Hindi.Most initial attires of men in those times were dhoti and lungi. Dhoti is basically a single cloth wrapped around the waist and by partitioning at the center, is fastened at the back. A dhoti is from four to six feet long white or <b>colour</b> <b>strip</b> of cotton. Generally, in those times, no upper garment was worn and Dhoti was the only single clothing that men used to drape it over their bodies. Later on, many costumes evolved like kurtas, pajamas, trousers, turbans, etc. Wool, linen, diaphanous silks and muslin were the main fibres used for making cloth and patterns with grey strips and checks were made over clothes.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of totally chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching reagents to a heterogeneous wastepaper mixture consisting of unbleached krait pulp, with similar to 12 % mechanical pulp, (incoming Kappa number 63) was studied. The TCF bleaching sequence stages were: acid treatment, low consistency (LC) oxygen delignification, high consistency (HC) oxygen delignification and ozone bleaching, {{as well as}} in situ produced dimethyldioxirane and hydrogen peroxide bleaching. Ozone consumption was limited to less than 1. 3 % to achieve as high as possible brightness improvement without fibre damage. Results presented in this paper suggest that a selected TCF bleaching sequence applied to the LC oxygen pulped wastepaper furnish, without wash-deinking, can produce a <b>colour</b> <b>stripped,</b> high brightness pulp (82. 7 % ISO at an overall yield of 75 %), and showing only moderate colour reversion and tear index decrease...|$|R
40|$|A divided {{visual field}} {{presentation}} of the Stroop colour-word {{test was used to}} study interhemispheric (transcallosal) function in schizophrenic and normal subjects. The modified test used a <b>colour</b> <b>strip</b> paired with either an incongruent, neutral or congruent colour word. Interference and facilitation were defined as the difference between the mean reaction times for incongruent stimuli and neutral stimuli and that between neutral stimuli and congruent stimuli, respectively. The stimuli were presented tachistoscopically with the two components either separated across the midline centrally, up or down from the midpoint (bilateral presentation), or presented to a single visual half-field (unilateral presentation). The inclusion of the 'up' and 'down' bilateral conditions controlled for the reaction time advantage for central compared with unilateral stimulus presentations noted in an earlier study (David, 1993 a). The difference in reaction time to an incongruent compared with a congruent colour-word pairing, the Combined Stroop Effect (CSE), was not affected significantly by stimulus presentation position (bilateral vs. unilateral) in either the control or schizophrenic group, unlike in the earlier study of David. For controls, interference was significantly greater than facilitation for both bilaterally- and unilaterally-presented stimuli. Schizophrenics had a significantly smaller interference effect for bilaterally-presented stimuli, indicating reduced interhemispheric interference in this group. For the control group, {{there was no significant difference}} between right and left CSEs, interference being significantly greater than facilitation on both visual half-field presentations. For schizophrenics, the CSE for left-presented stimuli was significantly greater than that for right-presented stimuli. In addition, left-field facilitation was significantly greater than right-field. Reduced Stroop facilitation with right-field presentations in schizophrenic subjects may reflect increased vulnerability of colour-naming by word-reading in the left hemisphere-evidence for the non-unitary nature of attentional processes and disintegration of these in schizophrenia...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a novel idea {{of using}} ozone {{oxidation}} {{at the end of}} reactive dyeing process was explored in order to achieve zero discharge dyeing. An advanced oxidative treatment was given during the dyeing process to remove unfixed and hydrolyzed reactive dyes from cotton substrate. Three different shades were dyed using vinylsulphone reactive class of dyes. At the end of fixation step, washing of fabrics was carried out using appropriate quantities of ozone in the process. Ozone oxidation continued until the liquor was decolorized around 95 - 100 % and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) was reduced about 80 - 90 %, thus achieving zero liquid discharge dyeing process. The decolouration efficiency of wastewater was regarded as an indicative of removal of dyes from the textile materials because fabric was being washed continuously in the same liquor. Fabric samples dyed with conventional and new methods were compared in terms of change in shade, colourfastness properties, <b>colour</b> <b>stripping,</b> and fabric appearance. Overall results showed that the use of ozone during reactive dyeing can result in less water consumption, reduced process time, and zero discharge of coloured effluents from textile dyeing factories...|$|R

40|$|SIRAD badge {{dosimeters}} are a {{new type}} of personal dosimeter designed to measure radiation exposure up to 200 R and give a visual qualitative measurement of exposure. This is performed using the active dosimeter window, which contains a radiochromic material amalgamated in the badge assembly. When irradiated, the badges active window turns blue, which can be matched against the given colour chart for a qualitative assessment of the exposure received. Measurements have been performed to analyse the absorption spectra of the active window, and results show that the window automatically turns a blue colour upon irradiation and produces two peaks in the absorption spectra located at 617 nm and 567 nm. When analysed with a common computer desktop scanner, the optical density response of the film to radiation exposure is non-linear but reproducible. The net OD of the film was 0. 21 at 50 R exposure and 0. 31 at 200 R exposure when irradiated with a 6 MV x-ray energy beam. When compared to the calibration <b>colour</b> <b>strips</b> at 6 MV x-ray energy the film’s OD response matches relatively well within 3. 5 %. An approximate 8 % reduction in measured OD to exposure was seen for 250 kVp x-rays compared to 6 MV x-rays. The film provides an adequate measurement and visually qualitative assessment of radiation exposure for levels in the range of 0 to 200 R...|$|R
