25|$|Statues, {{images and}} temples {{have been a}} part of the Traditional Religions of the {{indigenous}} people of the Americas. The Incan, Mayan and Aztec civilizations developed sophisticated religious practices that incorporated idols and religious arts. The Inca culture, for example, has believed in Viracocha (also called Pachacutec) as the creator deity and nature deities such as Inti (sun deity), and Mama <b>Cocha</b> the goddess of the sea, lakes, rivers and waters.|$|E

50|$|Generally, in animals, nasal {{turbinates}} (<b>cochae)</b> are convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone or cartilage {{located in the}} nasal cavity. These are lined with mucous membranes that can perform two functions. They can improve the sense of smell by increasing the area available to absorb airborne chemicals, and they can warm and moisten inhaled air, and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air to prevent desiccation of the lungs. Olfactory turbinates are found in all living tetrapods, and respiratory turbinates are found in most mammals and birds.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles {{and more}} {{primitive}} synapsids have conchae, but these plates of bone {{are involved in}} sensing smell rather than preventing desiccation. While the maxilloturbinates of mammals {{are located in the}} path of airflow to collect moisture, sensory <b>cochae</b> in both mammals and reptiles are positioned farther back and above the nasal passage, away from the flow of air. Glanosuchus has ridges positioned low in the nasal cavity, indicating that it had maxilloturbinates that were in the direct path of airflow. The maxilloturbinates may not have been preserved because they were either very thin or cartilaginous. The possibility has also been raised that these ridges are associated with an olfactory epithelium rather than turbinates. Nonetheless, the possible presence of maxilloturbinates suggests that Glanosuchus may have been able to rapidly breathe without drying out the nasal passage, and therefore could have been an endotherm.|$|R
