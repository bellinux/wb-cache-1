5|$|In animals, OCD is {{considered}} a developmental and metabolic disorder related to <b>cartilage</b> growth and endochondral ossification. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of <b>cartilage,</b> and OCD is the term used when this affects joint <b>cartilage</b> causing a fragment to become loose.|$|E

50|$|Trabecular <b>cartilages</b> (trabeculae cranii, {{sometimes}} simply trabeculae, prechordal <b>cartilages)</b> are paired, rod-shaped <b>cartilages,</b> which {{develop in}} {{the head of the}} vertebrate embryo. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the cranial base, and are derived from the cranial neural crest cells.|$|R
50|$|The trabecular <b>cartilages</b> {{generally}} {{appear as}} a paired, rod-shaped <b>cartilages</b> at the ventral side of the forebrain and lateral side of the adenohypophysis in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the trabecula communis. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most parachordal <b>cartilages.</b>|$|R

5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} <b>cartilage</b> paste grafting is {{a surgical}} procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and <b>cartilage</b> paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
5|$|While the arthroscopic {{classification}} of bone and <b>cartilage</b> lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging {{is the main}} form of staging used in this article. StagesI and II are stable lesions. StagesIII and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the <b>cartilage</b> has allowed synovial fluid between the fragment and bone.|$|E

5000|$|The cuneiforms are paired <b>cartilages</b> {{that sit}} {{on top of}} and move with the arytenoids. [...] They are located above {{and in front of}} the corniculate <b>cartilages,</b> and the {{presence}} of these two pairs of <b>cartilages</b> result in small bulges {{on the surface of the}} mucous membrane.Covered by the aryepiglottic folds, the cuneiforms form the lateral aspect of the laryngeal inlet, while the corniculates form the posterior aspect, and the epiglottis the anterior.|$|R
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of <b>cartilage</b> in the trachea and smaller plates of <b>cartilage</b> in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support <b>cartilage</b> and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline <b>cartilage.</b> While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline <b>cartilage</b> and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E
5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} <b>cartilage</b> or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the <b>cartilage</b> layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} {{borders of}} the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth <b>cartilages</b> present heel-like projections at the points of greatest convexity.

5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and <b>cartilage</b> edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular <b>cartilage</b> and bone under the <b>cartilage,</b> including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular <b>cartilage</b> to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of <b>cartilage</b> flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of <b>cartilage</b> plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the <b>cartilage</b> of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular <b>cartilage</b> it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both <b>cartilage</b> and bone, and the free movement of these bone and <b>cartilage</b> fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
50|$|The {{digestive}} system: {{there is}} one pair of radula <b>cartilages.</b> The digestive tract is short and consist of a single loop. The rectum does not penetrate the heart. The radula consist of 1.4% of body volume in juveniles and radula <b>cartilages</b> consist of 2.6% of body volume in juveniles.|$|R
25|$|Beneath {{the upper}} lateral-cartilages lay the lower lateral-cartilages; the paired lower lateral-cartilages swing outwards, from medial attachments, to the caudal septum in the midline (the medial crura) to an {{intermediate}} crus (shank) area. Finally, the lower lateral-cartilages flare outwards, above {{and to the}} side (superolaterally), as the lateral crura; these <b>cartilages</b> are mobile, unlike the upper lateral <b>cartilages.</b> Furthermore, some persons present anatomical evidence of nasal scrolling—i.e., an outward curving of the lower borders of the upper lateral-cartilages, and an inward curving of the cephalic borders of the alar <b>cartilages.</b>|$|R
50|$|As clearly {{seen in the}} lamprey, Cyclostome {{also has}} a pair of {{cartilaginous}} rods in the embryonic head {{which is similar to}} the trabecular <b>cartilages</b> in jawed vertebrates.However, in 1916, Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, Alf Johnels reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal <b>cartilages</b> in jawed vertebrates. Recent experimental studies also showed that the <b>cartilages</b> are derived from the head mesoderm. Today, the “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular <b>cartilages</b> were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.|$|R
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of <b>cartilage</b> and connective tissue. <b>Cartilage</b> is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The Dermestidae {{are often}} used in {{taxidermy}} and {{in the preparation of}} scientific specimens, to clean soft tissue from bones. Larvae feed on and remove <b>cartilage</b> along with other soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular <b>cartilage</b> do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular <b>cartilage</b> which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
50|$|The trabecular <b>cartilages</b> {{were first}} {{described}} in the grass snake by Martin Heinrich Rathke at 1839.In 1874, Thomas Henry Huxley {{pointed out that the}} trabecular <b>cartilages</b> are the modified viscerocranium: they assumed as the serial homologues of the branchial skeletons in the pharyngeal arches.The vertebrate jaw is generally thought to be the modification of the mandibular arch (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular <b>cartilages</b> appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular <b>cartilages</b> are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, the ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so called “premandibular arches”) anterior to the mandibular arch.The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e. g., Edwin Stephen Goodrich, Gavin de Beer). Moreover, Erik Stensio reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the Osteostracans (e.g., Cephalaspis; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) is rejected today, and the trabecular <b>cartilages</b> are not assumed {{to be one of the}} pharyngeal arches any more.|$|R

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative <b>cartilage</b> is inferior to healthy hyaline <b>cartilage</b> in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest is suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid <b>cartilage</b> and carina are fixed to the thyroid <b>cartilage</b> and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
