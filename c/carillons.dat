Older <b>carillons</b> can be transposing instruments, generally transposing upward. Most modern instruments sound at concert pitch. A carillon clavier has both a manual and a pedal keyboard.|$|E

The Sisters also ring the bells each time someone is executed by capital punishment in the United States.
