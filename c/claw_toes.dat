40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} normal gait, toes require {{to be in a}} rectus position during the propulsive phase. This requires a correct balance and sequence of activity of the intrinsic musculature of the feet. Alteration of this balance and sequence may lead to the development of <b>claw</b> <b>toes.</b> Atrophy of the lumbricals occurs in the development of <b>claw</b> <b>toes,</b> but it is not known if changes occur in any other intrinsic muscles, including flexor digitorum brevis. This study set out to investigate whether hypertrophic changes were evident in flexor digitorum brevis in feet with <b>claw</b> <b>toes.</b> Methods Four cadaver feet were investigated, two with rectus toes and two with <b>claw</b> <b>toes.</b> Flexor digitorum brevis was removed from each, and seven anatomically significant tissue sections from each muscle were routinely processed, cut and stained. One hundred and sixty muscle fibre cross sectional areas were measured from each section. Results The mean age of the donors was 81. 5 years, and three of the four were female. Results showed that the cross sectional area of fibres from feet with <b>claw</b> <b>toes</b> was 417 μg 2 significantly greater (p 2. Conclusions Although this study has several limitations, preliminary observations reveal that flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibre cross sectional area is significantly reduced in feet with <b>claw</b> <b>toes.</b> This would indicate a relationship between muscle fibre atrophy of flexor digitorum brevis and clawing of the lesser toes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background. Foot {{deformities}} {{have been}} related to diabetic neuropathy progression but their influence on plantar distribution during dynamic tasks is not completely understood. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the influence of metatarsal head prominence and <b>claw</b> <b>toes</b> on regional plantar pressures during gait in patients with diabetic neuropathy Methods Seventy-one adults participated in this study categorized into three groups: a control group (CG, n = 32), patients with diabetic neuropathy without any foot deformities (DG, n = 20), and patients with diabetic neuropathy with metatarsal head prominence and/or <b>claw</b> <b>toes</b> (DMHG, n = 19). Plantar pressure variables (contact area, peak pressure, and maximum mean pressure) were evaluated during gait on rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot using capacitive insoles (Pedar-X System, Novel Inc., Munich, Germany). A general linear model was applied to repeatedly measure and analyze variance relationships between groups and areas. Results. DMHG. presented larger contact areas at the forefoot and midfoot along with higher peak pressure at the rearfoot compared to the other two groups The DG showed higher mean pressure at the midfoot compared to:the other two groups. Conclusion. The coexistence of diabetic neuropathy and metatarsal head prominence in addition to <b>claw</b> <b>toes,</b> resulted in overloading the rearfoot and enhancing the contact area of forefoot and midfoot while walking. This plantar pressure distribution is a result of a different coordination pattern adopted in order to reduce plantar loads at the anterior parts of the foot that were structurally altered. Patients with diabetic neuropathy without any forefoot deformities presented a different plantar pressure distribution than patients with deformities suggesting that both neuropathy and structural foot alterations can influence foot rollover mechanisms.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to assess the value of {{transfer}} of the flexor into the extensor tendons of the toes in the treatment of <b>claw</b> <b>toes.</b> In the fully developed condition, with hyperextension of the metatarso-phalangeal joints and flexion of the interphalangeal joints, the long flexor tendons can no longer act as slings under the metatarsal heads, which become depressed. Painful callosities develop in relation to the new pressure areas, namely under the heads of the metatarsals and the tips of the toes, and over the dorsum of the proximal interphalangeal joints, from pressure against the shoe. The claw deformity deprives the interossei and the lumbricals of any function of flexing the toes at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints and all the strain of the push-off in walking now falls on the metatarsal heads. Indeed, once the deformity is established, the intrinsic muscles become adaptively shortened, and because the line of their action is now dorsal to the transverse axis of movement at the metatarso-phalangeal joints they act as extensors and perpetuate the deformity. For this reason the power of plantar-flexion of the metatarso-phalangeal joints, which is so essential for efficient function of the forefoot, is lost.

In this study we assess the efficacy of a modified Stainsby procedure {{for the treatment of}} <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity. Thirteen patients were operated on between 2002 and 2008. Eleven patients (13 feet) were available for review with the average follow-up period being 16 months. Clinical examination was performed and AOFAS forefoot scores were measured. All 13 (100 %) of the feet operated on had severe or moderate pain preoperatively. None had significant pain at review. Plantar callosities were reduced from 13 (100 %) feet preoperatively to 1 (9 %) foot postoperatively.

30|$|Musculoskeletal {{complications}} {{results from}} motor neuropathy that include progressive atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles leading to common foot deformities like hammer toes, <b>claw</b> <b>toes,</b> hallux valgus and prominent metatarsal heads. As a consequence, plantar pressure distribution is altered leading to {{higher risk of}} foot ulceration. High plantar pressure is an important etiopathogenic risk factor {{for the development of}} foot ulcers (Wang et al. 2015). Also diabetic foot ulceration is reported to be associated with frequent lower extremity amputation (Pham et al. 2000). However risk of ulcers can be predicted by biomechanical parameters which are determinative (Ahroni et al. 1999).|$|E
30|$|The first {{hypothesis}} assigns {{an important}} role in the pathogenesis of this skeletal deformity to overaction of the peronei in comparison with the antagonist tibialis anterior, secondary to the leg muscle’s amyotrophy pattern in the disease. In particular, it has been supposed that a weak peroneus brevis is overpowered by a relatively stronger tibialis posterior, causing adduction of the forefoot and inversion of the hindfoot. In addition, a weak tibialis anterior is overpowered by a stronger peroneus longus, causing plantar-flexion of the first metatarsal and anterior pes cavus [12, 39 – 41]. The intrinsic foot muscles develop contractures, while the long extensor to the toe muscles, recruited to assist in ankle dorsiflexion, causes <b>claw</b> <b>toes</b> deformity.|$|E
40|$|Differential muscle {{weakness}} {{can cause a}} cavus foot deformity. Presenting complaints in the hindfoot may include ankle instability, secondary arthritis, or peroneal tendonitis.

More general presenting complaints can include a drop-foot gait, decreased walking tolerance, and difficulty with shoe or orthotic fitting. To surgically correct the foot shape, soft tissue contractures need to be released, bone deformity corrected, and muscles balanced to optimize their strength and prevent recurrence of the deformity.

40|$|Objective: <b>Clawing</b> of the <b>toes</b> in the {{diabetic}} neuropathic foot {{is believed}} to be caused by muscle imbalance resulting from intrinsic muscle atrophy. However, experimental data that supports this mechanism is lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate this hypothesis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Research Design and Methods: In twenty neuropathic diabetic patients, ten with <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity and ten with normally aligned toes, multiple plane images of the foot and lower leg were acquired using T 1 -weighted spin-echo MRI. Atrophy of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles controlling the toes were assessed using a semi-quantitative 5 -point atrophy scale. An intrinsic-to-extrinsic foot muscle imbalance score was derived from these atrophy scores and correlation coefficients were established. Results: Mean (SD) intrinsic muscle atrophy score was 3. 1 (1. 1) for the toe deformity group and 2. 6 (1. 2) for the non-deformity group (not significantly different). Intrinsic muscle atrophy score was not correlated with degree of toe deformity (r = - 0. 18). Muscle imbalance score was not significantly different between study groups and not correlated with degree of toe deformity (r = - 0. 14). Conclusions: Neither intrinsic muscle atrophy nor muscle imbalance discriminated between neuropathic patients with or without <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity. This suggests that the role of these muscle factors in <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> development may not be primary or as straightforward as previously believed. These findings shed new light on the etiology of foot deformity in diabetes and suggest a more complex nature of development, potentially involving anatomical and physiological predisposing factor...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of the modified plantar plate tenodesis for correction of <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity. Materials and Methods: Modified plantar plate tenodesis was performed in ten fresh frozen cadaveric feet with <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity of the second toe. The plantar plate of the second metatarsophalangeal joint was anchored to the extensor digitorum longus tendon by a figure-of-eight suture. The figure-of-eight construct and the relationship of the digital nerve and the suture were studied. A clinical study was conducted to study the operative times, degree of correction and the improvement of AOFAS score between groups with the original plantar plate tenodesis (Group 1) and modified technique (Group 2). Any neural injury if present was also noted. Result: In the cadaveric study, the <b>claw</b> <b>toe</b> deformity was corrected and no nerve injury occurred in any specimen. There was flexor tendon tethering by the suture in 2 specimens. In the clinical study, the average operative time was 51 minutes for Group 1 and 31 minutes for Group 2. The improvement in AOFAS score averaged 44 in Group 1 and 43 in Group 2. The corrective power of the sagittal plane deformity at the metatarsophalangeal joint averaged 25 degrees in Group 1 and 23 degrees in Group 2. Conclusion: Plantar plate tenodesis was effective in correction of flexible <b>claw</b> second <b>toe</b> deformity by stabilization of the attenuated plantar plate. The modified technique allowed easier retrieval of the suture and shorter operative time. However, it may result in tethering of the flexor tendon.
