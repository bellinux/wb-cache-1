5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>The</b> Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} {{employed}} as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and steals the beer, thinking this will ensure hard {{work from the}} family. While there, Groundskeeper Willie discovers that Bart {{has the power to}} read his thoughts and says that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to <b>call</b> <b>him.</b> <b>The</b> deprivation of his two favorite things causes Homer to go insane and a ghostly Moe informs Homer he must kill his family {{in order to get a}} beer. Marge confronts Homer and locks him in the pantry until he has calmed down.|$|E
5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

500|$|Before Hill had {{revealed}} this information, he attacked Fielding's Amelia in the London Daily Advertiser on 8 January 1752. The book's title character, Amelia, {{was involved in}} an accident that damaged her face, and Hill, mocking the way Fielding described the scene, claimed that she [...] "could charm the World without the Help of a Nose." [...] In response to both the revelation and personal attacks, Fielding wrote on 11 January 1752: [...] "If the Betrayer of a private Treaty could ever deserve the least Credit, yet his Lowness here must proclaim himself either a Liar, or a Fool. None can doubt {{that he is the}} former, if he hath feigned this Treaty, and I think few would scruple to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> latter, if he had rejected it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} of his books are two large botanical treatises, Enquiry into Plants (Περὶ φυτῶν ἱστορία, generally known as Historia Plantarum), and On the Causes of Plants (Περὶ φυτῶν αἰτιῶν), which constitute the {{most important}} contribution to botanical science during antiquity and the Middle Ages, the first systemization of the botanical world; {{on the strength of}} these works some, following Linnaeus, <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> [...] "father of botany".|$|E
2500|$|Former U.S. President Bill Clinton's {{public image}} is most notably {{characterized}} by high public approval ratings, aided by his youthful appearance, {{as well as}} his charismatic, and soundbite-ready style of speech. His personal background and lifestyle led to Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> first [...] "black president". Clinton was also dogged by investigations throughout his presidency, particularly of sexual misconduct, damaging the public's beliefs of his trustworthiness, though his approval ratings remained high, even as his impeachment trial continued.|$|E
2500|$|In a move {{distinctly}} {{evocative of}} Songtsen Gampo, Lobsang Gyatso once again proclaimed Lhasa {{to be the}} capital of Tibet. [...] Assembling his government there, he [...] "appointed governors to the districts, chose ministers for his government, and promulgated a set of laws". [...] The young Dalai Lama also transformed his regent into a prime minister–or, as the Tibetans <b>call</b> <b>him,</b> <b>the</b> Desi.

2500|$|Dan Patch {{celebrated his}} ninth {{birthday}} in 1905, an {{age at which}} racehorses are considered past their prime. From this point onward, the expectation that he would set a new record on any given trial was lower, but the horse's popularity remained intact. Dan Patch made his first appearance {{of the year in}} September at the Minnesota State Fair before a crowd of 98,000, followed by a crowd of 55,000 at Indianapolis and more than 100,000 in Allentown. He then shipped to Lexington where he tied his own world record of 1:56 while surrounded by a cloud of dust, leading the New York Times to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Black Whirlwind". Two days later, Dan Patch outdid himself, setting his official record of 1:55, a time that would remain a record for over 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|This {{means that}} it is {{impossible}} to infer if Mara believed the resurrection happened or not, and leaves it up to speculation whether he was a Christian or a non-Christian who agreed with Christians as regarding Jesus as a [...] "wise king" [...] according to the Gospels. Given that the gospel portraits of Jesus' crucifixion place much of the blame for the execution of Jesus on the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate (with the Jewish mob merely acting as [...] agitators), some Gospels do agree with the Jews being to blame. And referring to [...] "king of the Jews" [...] rather than the Savior or Son of God indicates that the impressions of Bar-Serapion were not formed by Christian sources, although Jewish Christians did <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> king of the Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Near the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck {{take two}} on-the-run grifters aboard the raft. The younger man, {{who is about}} thirty, {{introduces}} himself as the long-lost son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the Lost Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France. The [...] "duke" [...] and [...] "king" [...] soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Sick Arab" [...] {{so that he can}} move about the raft without bindings.|$|E

2500|$|While {{traveling}} to the United States after visiting his summer home in Ireland in November 1928, Robert Henri suffered an attack of neuritis, which crippled his leg. (The underlying cause was metastatic prostate cancer.) He was hospitalized at St. Luke's Hospital in New York. Gradually he became weaker, until he died of cardiac arrest {{early in the morning}} of July 12, 1929. His illness was not generally known, and came as a surprise in art circles. Upon his death, artist and pupil Eugene Speicher said [...] "not only was he a great painter, but ... I don't think it too much to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> father of independent painting in this country." [...] At his death, it was reported that he was cremated, and his ashes buried in the family vault in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Border {{made his}} first Ashes tour and scored a half-century {{in each of the}} first two Tests. [...] "Border alone of the {{established}} players came through with reputation enhanced"; in the Fifth Test at Old Trafford when he batted with a fractured left finger. He reached a century in 377 minutes, the slowest Test hundred by an Australian, and remained unbeaten on 123 as Australia lost the match. In the final Test at The Oval, Border scored 106 not out and 84. During this latter sequence, he defied the English bowlers for more than 15 hours to score 313 runs before he was dismissed. Overall, he totalled 533 (at 59.22); this prompted Sir Leonard Hutton to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> best left-handed batsman in the world and resulted in his selection as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|People {{who worked}} for Disney (and its comic book licensees) {{generally}} did so in relative anonymity; stories would only carry Walt Disney's name and (sometimes) a short identification number. Prior to 1960 Barks' identity remained a mystery to his readers. However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style—he [...] "signed" [...] many stories with a small image of a barking dog—and began to <b>call</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Good Duck Artist, a label that stuck even after his true identity was discovered by fans in the late 1950s. Malcolm Willits {{was the first person}} to learn Barks's name and address, but two brothers named John and Bill Spicer became the first fans to contact Barks after independently discovering the same information. After Barks received a 1960 visit from the Spicer brothers and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as word of his identity spread through the emerging network of comic book fandom fanzines and conventions.|$|E
