40|$|A protein {{complex of}} high-molecular-mass {{proteins}} (PfRhopH) {{of the human}} malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum induces host protective immunity and therefore {{is a candidate for}} vaccine development. Clarification of the level of polymorphism and the evolutionary processes is important both for vaccine design and for {{a better understanding of the}} evolution of cell invasion in this parasite. In a previous study on 5 genes encoding RhopH 1 /Clag proteins, positive diversifying selection was detected in <b>clag</b> 8 and <b>clag</b> 9 but not in the paralogous <b>clag</b> 2, <b>clag</b> 3. 1 and <b>clag</b> 3. 2. In this study, to extend the analysis of <b>clag</b> polymorphism, we obtained sequences surrounding the most polymorphic regions of <b>clag</b> 2, <b>clag</b> 8, and <b>clag</b> 9 from parasites collected in Thailand. Using sequence data obtained newly in this study and reported previously, we classified <b>clag</b> 2 sequences into 5 groups based on the similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences and number of insertions/deletions. By the sliding window method, an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions was detected in the group 1 and group 2 <b>clag</b> 2 and <b>clag</b> 8 sequences. Population-based analyses also detected a significant departure from the neutral expectation for group 1 <b>clag</b> 2 and <b>clag</b> 8. Thus, two independent approaches suggest that <b>clag</b> 2 is subject to a positive diversifying selection. The previously suggested positive selection on <b>clag</b> 8 was also supported by population-based analyses. However, the positive selection on <b>clag</b> 9, which was detected by comparing the 5 sequences, was not detected using the additional 34 sequences obtained in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{product of}} the Plasmodium falciparum genes <b>clag</b> 3. 1 and <b>clag</b> 3. 2 plays a {{fundamental}} role in malaria parasite biology by determining solute transport into infected erythrocytes. Expression of the two <b>clag</b> 3 genes is mutually exclusive, such that a single parasite expresses only one of the two genes at a time. Here we investigated the properties and mechanisms of <b>clag</b> 3 mutual exclusion using transgenic parasite lines with extra copies of <b>clag</b> 3 promoters located either in stable episomes or integrated in the parasite genome. We found that the additional <b>clag</b> 3 promoters in these transgenic lines are silenced by default, but under strong selective pressure parasites with more than one <b>clag</b> 3 promoter simultaneously active are observed, demonstrating that <b>clag</b> 3 mutual exclusion is strongly favored but it is not strict. We show that silencing of <b>clag</b> 3 genes is associated with the repressive histone mark H 3 K 9 me 3 even in parasites with unusual <b>clag</b> 3 expression patterns, and we provide direct evidence for heterochromatin spreading in P. falciparum. We also found that expression of a neighbor ncRNA correlates with <b>clag</b> 3. 1 expression. Altogether, our results reveal a scenario where fitness costs and non-deterministic molecular processes that favor mutual exclusion shape the expression patterns of this important gene family...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The cytoadherence-linked asexual gene 9 (<b>clag</b> 9) of Plasmodium falciparum {{has been}} implicated in the cytoadherence of {{infected}} erythrocytes. To determine the immunogenicity of the <b>clag</b> 9 gene product (<b>CLAG</b> 9 protein) in humans, we measured antibody responses to 11 synthetic <b>CLAG</b> 9 peptides {{in a group of}} 177 asymptomatic children and adults subject to intense malaria exposure in Madang, Papua New Guinea. The <b>CLAG</b> 9 peptides were immuno-genic in adults and children. Antibody responses to peptides 4 and 10 were high across all age groups and detectable in a majority of children less than five years of age. While <b>CLAG</b> 9 peptides are immunogenic in humans, longitudinal studies will be required to determine the longevity of antibody responses to <b>CLAG</b> 9 and their role in protection from disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{propensity}} of isolates of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to delete {{a segment of}} chromosome 9 has provided positional information that has allowed us to identify a gene necessary for cytoadherence. It has been termed the cytoadherence-linked asexual gene (<b>clag</b> 9). <b>clag</b> 9 encodes at least nine exons and is expressed in blood stages. The hydrophobicity profile of the predicted <b>CLAG</b> 9 protein identifies up to four transmembrane domains. We show here that targeted gene disruption of <b>clag</b> 9 ablated cytoadherence to C 32 melanoma cells and purified CD 36. DNA-induced antibodies to the <b>clag</b> 9 gene product reacted with a polypeptide of 220 kDa in the parental malaria clone but not in clones with a disrupted <b>clag</b> 9 gene...|$|R

40|$|Background. : Many {{genes of}} the malaria {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum show clonally variant expression regulated at the epigenetic level. These genes participate in fundamental host-parasite interactions {{and contribute to}} adaptive processes. However, {{little is known about}} their expression patterns during human infections. A peculiar case of clonally variant genes are the 2 nearly identical <b>clag</b> 3 genes, <b>clag</b> 3. 1 and <b>clag</b> 3. 2, which mediate nutrient uptake and are linked to resistance to some toxic compounds. Methods. : We developed a procedure to characterize the expression of <b>clag</b> 3 genes in naturally infected patients and in experimentally infected human volunteers. Results. : We provide the first description of <b>clag</b> 3 expression during human infections, which revealed mutually exclusive expression and identified the gene predominantly expressed. Adaptation to culture conditions or selection with a toxic compound resulted in isolate-dependent changes in <b>clag</b> 3 expression. We also found that <b>clag</b> 3 expression patterns were reset during transmission stages. Conclusions. : Different environment conditions select for parasites with different <b>clag</b> 3 expression patterns, implying functional differences between the proteins encoded. The epigenetic memory is likely erased before parasites start infection of a new human host. Altogether, our findings support the idea that clonally variant genes facilitate the adaptation of parasite populations to changing conditions through bet-hedging strategies...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{infected}} erythrocytes show increased permeability to {{a number}} of solutes important for parasite growth as mediated by the Plasmodial Surface Anion Channel (PSAC). The P. falciparum <b>clag</b> 3 genes have recently been identified as key determinants of PSAC, though exactly how they contribute to channel function and whether additional host/parasite proteins are required remain unknown. To begin to answer these questions, I have taken a biochemical approach. Here I have used an epitope-tagged <b>CLAG</b> 3 parasite to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments using membrane fractions of infected erythrocytes. Native PAGE and mass spectrometry studies reveal that <b>CLAG</b> 3 participate in at least three different high molecular weight complexes: a ~ 720 kDa complex consisting of <b>CLAG</b> 3, RHOPH 2 and RHOPH 3; a ~ 620 kDa complex consisting of <b>CLAG</b> 3 and RHOPH 2; and a ~ 480 kDa complex composed solely of <b>CLAG</b> 3. Importantly, these complexes can be found throughout the parasite lifecycle but are absent in untransfected controls. Extracellular biotin labeling and protease susceptibility studies localize the 480 kDa complex to the erythrocyte membrane. This complex, likely composed of a homo-oligomer of 160 kDa <b>CLAG</b> 3, may represent a functional subunit, possibly the pore, of PSAC...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium falciparum {{erythrocyte}} {{membrane protein}} 1 (PfEMP 1) family members mediate the adherence of parasite-infected {{red blood cells}} (IRBCs) to various host receptors. A previous study {{has shown that the}} parasite protein, cytoadherence-linked asexual gene 9 (<b>CLAG</b> 9), is also essential for IRBC adherence. However, how <b>CLAG</b> 9 influences this process remains unknown. In this study, we show that <b>CLAG</b> 9 interacts with VAR 2 CSA, a PfEMP 1 that mediates IRBC adherence to chondroitin 4 -sulfate in the placenta. Importantly, our results show that the adherent parasites synthesize <b>CLAG</b> 9 at two stages—the early ring and late trophozoite stages. Localization studies revealed that a substantial level of <b>CLAG</b> 9 is located mainly at or in close proximity of the IRBC membrane in association with VAR 2 CSA. Upon treatment of IRBCs with trypsin, a significant amount of <b>CLAG</b> 9 (≈ 150 kDa) was converted into ≈ 142 -kDa polypeptide. Together these data demonstrate that a considerable amount of <b>CLAG</b> 9 is embedded in the IRBC membrane such that at least a portion of the polypeptide at either N or C terminus is exposed on the cell surface. In parasites lacking <b>CLAG</b> 9, VAR 2 CSA failed to express on the IRBC surface and was located within the parasite. Based on these findings, we propose that <b>CLAG</b> 9 plays a critical role in the trafficking of PfEMP 1 s onto the IRBC surface. These results have important implications for the development of therapeutics for cerebral, placental, and other cytoadherence-associated malaria illnesses...|$|R
40|$|The plasmodial surface {{anion channel}} mediates uptake of {{nutrients}} and other solutes into erythrocytes infected with malaria parasites. The <b>clag</b> 3 genes of P. falciparum determine this channel’s activity in human malaria, but how the encoded proteins contribute to transport is unknown. Here, we used proteases {{to examine the}} channel’s composition and function. While proteases with distinct specificities all cleaved within an extracellular domain of <b>CLAG</b> 3, they produced differing degrees of transport inhibition. Chymotrypsin-induced inhibition depended on parasite genotype, with channels induced by the HB 3 parasite affected {{to a greater extent}} than those of the Dd 2 clone. Inheritance of functional proteolysis in the HB 36 Dd 2 genetic cross, DNA transfection, and gene silencing experiments all pointed to the <b>clag</b> 3 genes, providing independent evidence for a role of these genes. Protease protection assays with a Dd 2 -specific inhibitor and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a variant L 1115 F residue on a <b>CLAG</b> 3 extracellular loop contributes to inhibitor binding and accounts for differences in functional proteolysis. These findings indicate that surface-exposed <b>CLAG</b> 3 is the relevant pool of this protein for channel function.

40|$|The plasmodial surface {{anion channel}} (PSAC) {{increases}} eryth-rocyte permeability to many solutes in malaria but has uncertain physiological significance. We used a PSAC inhibitor with dif-ferent efficacies against channels from two Plasmodium falci-parum parasite lines and found concordant effects on transport and in vitro parasite growth when external nutrient concentra-tions were reduced. Linkage analysis using this growth inhibi-tion phenotype in the Dd 2 HB 3 genetic cross mapped the <b>clag</b> 3 genomic locus, {{consistent with a}} role for two <b>clag</b> 3 genes in PSAC-mediated transport. Altered inhibitor efficacy, achieved through allelic exchange or expression switching be-tween the <b>clag</b> 3 genes, indicated that the inhibitor kills para-sites through direct action on PSAC. In a parasite unable to undergo expression switching, the inhibitor selected for ectopic homologous recombination between the <b>clag</b> 3 genes to in-crease the diversity of available channel isoforms. Broad-spec-trum inhibitors, which presumably interact with conserved sites on the channel, also exhibited improved efficacy with nutrient restriction. These findings indicate that PSAC functions in nu-trient acquisition for intracellular parasites.

It {{has been suggested that}} the <b>clag</b> gene family is essential in cytoadherence to endothelial receptors. Primers used in PCR and RT-PCR assays allowed us to determine that the gene encoding <b>CLAG</b> 3 (GenBank accession no. NP_ 473155) is transcribed in the Plasmodium falciparum FCB 2 strain. Western blot showed that antisera produced against polymerized synthetic peptides from this protein recognized a 142 -kDa band in P. falciparum schizont lysate. Seventy-one 20 -amino-acid-long nonoverlapping peptides, spanning the <b>CLAG</b> 3 (cytoadherence-linked asexual protein on chromosome 3) sequence were tested in C 32 cell and erythrocyte binding assays. Twelve <b>CLAG</b> peptides specifically bound to C 32 cells (which mainly express CD 36) with high affinity, hereafter referred to as high-affinity binding peptides (HABPs). Five of them also bound to erythrocytes. HABP binding to C 32 cells and erythrocytes was independent of peptide charge or peptide structure. Affinity constants were between 100 nM and 800 nM. Cross-linking and SDS-PAGE analysis allowed two erythrocyte binding proteins of around 26 kDa and 59 kDa to be identified, while proteins of around 53 kDa were identified as possible receptor sites for C- 32 cells. The HABPs’ role in Plasmodium falciparum invasion inhibition was determined.

40|$|Background: The {{expression}} of the clonally variant virulence factor PfEMP 1 mediates the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes in the host vasculature and contributes to chronic infection. Non-cytoadherent parasites with a chromosome 9 deletion lack <b>clag</b> 9, a gene linked to cytoadhesion in previous studies. Here we present new <b>clag</b> 9 data that challenge this view and show that surface the non-cytoadherence phenotype {{is linked to the}} {{expression of}} a non-functional PfEMP 1. Methodology/Principal Findings: Loss of adhesion in P. falciparum D 10, a parasite line with a large chromosome 9 deletion, was investigated. Surface iodination analysis of non-cytoadherent D 10 parasites and COS- 7 surface {{expression of the}} CD 36 -binding PfEMP 1 CIDR 1 a domain were performed and showed that these parasites express an unusual trypsin-resistant, non-functional PfEMP 1 at the erythrocyte surface. However, the CIDR 1 a domain of this var gene expressed in COS- 7 cells showed strong binding to CD 36. Atomic Force Microscopy showed a slightly modified D 10 knob morphology compared to adherent parasites. Trafficking of PfEMP 1 and KAHRP remained functional in D 10. We link the non-cytoadherence phenotype to a chromosome 9 breakage and healing event resulting in the loss of 25 subtelomeric genes including <b>clag</b> 9. In contrast to previous studies, knockout of the <b>clag</b> 9 gene from 3 D 7 did not interfere with parasite adhesion to CD 36.
