40|$|This Article {{explores the}} extent to which the dispute {{settlement}} system of the WTO would be suitable in resolving competition-related cases. It first recalls that under existing trade rules, national competition law and practice are not exempt from, but rather subject to, the application of the dispute settlement system. Both competition laws as such and their application in individual cases must comply with the current, substantive standards of the WTO Agreement, and complaints can be brought against both. Extending the application of the dispute settlement system to a new agreement to be negotiated in the area of competition would produce no qualitative innovation. Drawing a parallel to the area of trade remedies, this Article further argues that the standard of review applied in WTO dispute settlement would also be appropriate for competition cases. This standard of review excludes de novo review, but sets rather high standards for the national authorities 2 ̆ 7 duties of investigation and explanation. The dispute settlement system, however, shows significant weaknesses in connection to the fact-finding conducted by panels. Competition-related cases [...] as is usual in the area of economic law in general, and of trade remedies in particular [...] are very fact-intensive. In the dispute settlement system of the WTO, it is the task of the panels to establish the facts, whereas the Appellate Body addresses only questions of law. In order to achieve the objective of establishing the relevant facts of a <b>case,</b> <b>panels</b> can resort to experts. They can also seek information from WTO Members, who must respond, lest they should face the risk of negative inferences being drawn from their behavior. A serious weakness, however, exists with regard to the treatment of confidential information, for which no generally applicable rules of procedure exist to date. For the dispute settlement system to be able to apply effectively to a review of individual decisions under a future WTO competition agreement, it would be important to overcome this impediment, which, already today, regularly creates significant practical problems. Another weakness is rooted in the non-permanent character of the panels. A body composed of ad hoc selected members cannot be expected to conduct fact-finding with the same determination as a permanent body. It would therefore be beneficial to increase the structural independence of panel members...|$|E
40|$|Supermarkets {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} energy-intensive building groups in the commercial sector, consuming 2 to 3 million kWh/yr per store (ES- 1). Over half of this energy use is for the refrigeration of food display cases and storage coolers. Display cases are used throughout a supermarket for the merchandising of perishable food products. The cases are maintained at air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 35 F, depending upon the type of product stored. The operating characteristics and energy requirements of the refrigeration system are directly related to the refrigeration load. The sources of the display case refrigeration load consist of: (1) Moist and warm air infiltration through the open front of the case [...] air curtains are employed to inhibit this infiltration, but some ambient air is entrained, which adds a substantial portion to the refrigeration load. (2) Heat conduction through <b>case</b> <b>panels</b> and walls. (3) Thermal radiation from the ambient to the product and display case interior. (4) Internal thermal loads [...] the use of lights, evaporator fans, periodic defrosts, and antisweat heaters adds to the refrigeration load of the display case as well as directly consuming electric energy. The impact of each of these elements on the refrigeration load is very dependent upon case type (Figure ES- 1). For example, air infiltration is the most significant portion of the refrigeration load for open, multi-deck cases, while radiation is the largest part of the load for tub-type cases. The door anti-sweat heaters represent a major share of the refrigeration load for frozen food door reach-in cases. Figure ES- 2 shows the distribution of display cases in a typical supermarket (ES- 2). Open, multi-deck, medium temperature display cases typically comprise about half of the refrigerated fixtures in a store (ES- 3). In addition, medium temperature fixtures and storage coolers account for roughly 70 to 75 percent of the total store refrigeration load with open, multi-deck cases contributing about 3 / 4 of that fraction. Consequently, the focus of this investigation has tilted toward the open, vertical, multi-deck medium temperature case type. Various technologies and control methods are energy efficiency measures (EEMs) that could be applied to display cases and result in the reduction of the refrigeration load and of the energy consumption of the supermarket refrigeration system. An extensive evaluation of the EEMs was conducted in order to select those that met the following criteria: (1) Near-term implementation [...] All EEMs considered could be implemented with existing refrigeration hardware and technology. (2) Potential for energy-efficiency improvements [...] Energy savings and/or refrigeration load reduction must be obtained by the implementation of the EEM. (3) Enhancement of the ability to maintain target product temperature [...] Proper operation of the display case and maintenance of the stored product temperature could not be compromised by the use of the EEM. The energy impact of a number of viable display case EEMs was quantified by performing whole building hourly simulations. A special version of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE- 2. 3) program was used to develop a model of a supermarket. The model was then calibrated using available end-use monitored data to increase confidence in simulation results...|$|E

30|$|We {{find these}} {{features}} particularly appealing {{to examine the}} convergence process of the RULCs in the Eurozone. The main reason is that, although economies with different economic size and structure may appear to follow a similar development path, they may converge at different speeds and, therefore, may actually be {{at different stages of}} that same path. Moreover, although Phillips and Sul’s (2007, 2009) modelling allows for idiosyncratic behaviour, it also retains some commonality across the panel. In particular, it allows to check the convergence to a constant of the heterogeneous time varying idiosyncratic components, in which <b>case</b> <b>panel</b> convergence holds.|$|R

40|$|Different angle {{brackets}} for anchoring solid wooden panels were tested {{to learn about}} their response and basic mechanical properties on the acting load in two perpendicular directions. Namely, previous tests showed two distinct <b>cases</b> of <b>panel</b> deformation. In one <b>case</b> the <b>panel</b> mainly rotates around its compressed corner. In the other <b>case</b> the <b>panel</b> slips along foundation and deforms into parallelogram shape. Based on this knowledge, the tests were designed to simulate these two cases of deformation. The two tests were named »up-lift test« and »slip test«. The tests were carried out on cross laminated and unidirectional laminated wooden panels segments anchored by BMF and WÜRTH {{angle brackets}}. To obtain reliable mechanical characteristics three different loading protocols were applied. Loading protocols to simulate realistic loads on angle brackets were monotonous, according to standard EN 26891, and cyclic or semi-cyclic according to standard prEN 12512. The tests showed that the length of nails has greater influence on the results that their number. The test results show that cross laminated panel has better possibility for strong fixation than unidirectional laminated panel...|$|R
