5000|$|The SKS's ten-round {{internal}} box magazine can {{be loaded}} either by hand {{or from a}} stripper <b>clip.</b> <b>Cartridges</b> stored in the magazine can be removed by pulling back on a latch located forward of the trigger guard (thus opening the [...] "floor" [...] of the magazine and allowing the rounds to fall out). In typical military use the stripper clips are disposable. If necessary they can be reloaded multiple times and reused.|$|R
5000|$|In 1887 (until 1896), the Italian Army began {{converting}} the M1870 to a four-shot repeating rifle, {{based on the}} system designed by Italian Artillery Captain G. Vitali. This conversion added a box magazine fed from a Swiss-style fabricated Steel and wood stripper <b>clip</b> holding four <b>cartridges,</b> in the same caliber 10.4x47R mm as before. The clip is pressed into the magazine, until the last round catches under the Cartridge retainer, and then the clip is withdrawn using the [...] "Pull string" [...] in the top wooden frame of the <b>clip.</b> <b>Clips</b> of <b>cartridges</b> were supplied in a soldered sheet steel box, holding 6 clips.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{detail is}} {{the form of}} the [...] "interrupter", a {{specially}} designed part within the receiver, which helps prevent double feeding. The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle. Although {{the form of the}} interrupter was slightly changed, this alteration was subsequently borrowed back by the Commission for the Model 1891 Mosin-Nagant. During the modernization of 1930, the form of the interrupter was further changed, from a single piece to a two-piece design, as the part {{had turned out to be}} one of the least reliable parts of the action. Only the <b>clip</b> loading <b>cartridges</b> and the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate in subsequent models were designed by Nagant. Considering the rifle could be easily loaded without using a <b>clip,</b> one <b>cartridge</b> after another, the magazine spring attached to the magazine base plate is the only contribution of Nagant to all rifles after 1930.|$|R

2500|$|Overall, the Lee had a {{reputation}} for reliability in the field, though some issues were never overcome during the rifle's relatively short service life. [...] Beginning in 1898, during the Marine expeditionary campaign in Cuba, reports emerged from the field criticizing the floating extractor design. [...] The firing pin lock and bolt-lock actuator were relatively fragile, and would occasionally break or malfunction, while the tension in the en bloc <b>cartridge</b> <b>clips</b> proved difficult to regulate, occasionally causing failures to feed.|$|R
50|$|In battle, {{the manual}} of arms {{called for the}} rifle to be fired until empty, and then {{recharged}} quickly.

James Paris Lee patented a box magazine which held rounds stacked vertically in 1879 and 1882 and it was first adopted by Austria {{in the form of}} an 11mm straight-pull bolt-action rifle, the Mannlicher M1886.

2500|$|After {{inserting}} the clip, the charger {{was then}} given a second push to ready {{the first round}} for chambering.

[...] Unlike the M1892 Springfield (Krag) and the later M1903 Springfield rifle, the Lee straight-pull {{did not have a}} magazine cut-off to enable the cartridges in the magazine to be held in reserve in keeping with the prevailing small arms military doctrine of the day. [...] The Chief of Ordnance considered the Lee clip to be superior to either the Mauser stripper clip or the Mannlicher <b>clip,</b> as <b>cartridges</b> were not required to be stripped from the clip into the magazine (like the Mauser 'stripper clip' system), yet the Lee clip was not {{an essential part of the}} magazine (like the Mannlicher system), since it dropped out after the first cartridge was loaded, and since single cartridges could be loaded into an empty or partially loaded magazine to replace cartridges fired. [...] This conclusion was in conflict with the Naval Small Arms Board, which did consider the Lee clip to be an essential part of the magazine.|$|R

5000|$|The Mauser-inspired, {{non-rotating}} claw extractor (incompatible with a {{fully enclosed}} bolt head) was eliminated, {{and replaced with}} a small wedge-shaped extractor located within a lug of the bolt head. This type of extractor does not engage the cartridge rim as it rises from the magazine into the action, but rather <b>clips</b> over the <b>cartridge</b> rim after the cartridge has been pushed into the chamber and the bolt handle is turned down. This system is more vulnerable than the old system to jamming or being inadvertently closed on an empty breech (i.e., failing to load a new round) if operated under duress, especially if the rifle is held upside-down or on its side. In addition, the old extractor design served to stabilize the bolt while the action was open; without it, the new bolt {{did not have any}} such stabilization, and wobbled while fully open. This has since been fixed in later rifles, but it was nevertheless an obvious departure and certainly less elegant in function than the earlier models, which allowed the rifle to chamber cartidges smoothly from any position.|$|R
5000|$|By {{pulling back}} {{slightly}} {{on the operating}} handle, the operator would then free the breech block head from the hold open device and {{under pressure from the}} operating spring the breech block mechanism would straighten, driving the breech block head forward to push the topmost cartridge forward from under the feed lips of the <b>clip,</b> chambering the <b>cartridge,</b> and engaging the extraction groove {{around the base of the}} cartridge with the extractor. The extractor and the spring-loaded plunger type ejector were both built into breech block head. If the rifle was not immediately to be fired, the spring-loaded striker assembly (housed within the breech block head and body) could be locked by pushing the cross-bolt safety located in the breech body from right to left; this would also lock the breech block mechanism so that it could not be opened. (Army test reports identified the safety and the firing mechanism as weak areas of the T1 rifle: the safety, when applied, prevented clearing a loaded chamber and did not lock the trigger mechanism; the safety was also subject to damage. The striker was reported to have become stuck on some occasions, causing slam-fires).|$|R
5000|$|A {{feature of}} the Type 11 machine gun is its {{detachable}} hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. Instead of a belt or box magazine, the Type 11 was designed to hold up to six of the same <b>cartridge</b> <b>clips</b> used on the Type 38 rifle. The five-round clips were stacked lying flat above the receiver, secured by a spring arm, and the rounds were stripped from the lowest clip one at a time, with the empty clip thrown clear and the next clip automatically falling into place as the gun was fired. The system had the advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition and that the hopper could be replenished at any time. The relatively short barrel (17.5 inches) produced excessive flash with standard ammunition (initially intended for Type 38 rifles with barrel {{more than a foot}} longer). A new loading was introduced for this reason, which had a slightly lower muzzle velocity (under 100fps), but burned much more completely in the Type 11 short barrel and produced much less flash as a result. This new round was called the 6.5×50mm Arisaka genso round, the cartons identified by a circled [...] "G".|$|R
6000|$|It is a part, I think, of this {{disposition}} to investigate what makes everyone collect [...] "specimens" [...] of the war. Everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention.

I am the least collecting of men, but I have brought home Italian cartridges, Austrian cartridges, the fuse of an Austrian shell, a broken Italian bayonet, and a note that is worth half a franc {{within the confines of}} Amiens. But a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the Carso I contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity. And two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of Ammonites unknown to me, from the hills to the east of the Adige, partially wrapped in a back number of the Corriere della Sera, that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer, were unfortunately lost on the line between Verona and Milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter.

40|$|One {{would never}} think, {{to judge from}} the smiling faces of these men in this little German village, that but {{a few weeks before}} they were at death grips with the Germans in the Argonne. Yet such was their nature—if to fight, they fought like devils; if to relax, {{fighting}} over, they were good fellows, ready to joke or play. The Germans could not understand them. These boys entered Germany on December 1, 1918, after a five weeks' trek, a long, hard grind. When they left the battlefield they were loaded down with souvenirs of all kinds —helmets, pistols, rifles, bayonets. As the days wore on, the load grew heavier and heavier, and one by one these souvenirs went into the wayside ditches. The roads were littered with them. Our army entered Germany on a front of sixty miles. Treves (trevz) was the first big city reached, and with eyes straight ahead, <b>cartridge</b> <b>clips</b> filled, they marched in quiet, businesslike manner through silent streets lined with people whose secret hostility was shown in sullen, lowering looks. Our boys could not fail to note the contrast between this clean, prosperous city with its well-fed crowds, and the forlorn and devastated towns and villages of France they had left such a short time before. In comparison, Germany seemed a land o f peace and plenty. Finally this command reached its billet in this little town and characteristically the first thing the men did was to make friends with the children. We see no fear in the eyes of these German children surrounded by men of an alien army—they have learned that this army does not make war on children. The local shrine around which they are grouped is {{in the center of the}} village square...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps Lee's {{greatest}} individual {{impact on}} modern small arms development came with his invention for a spring-loaded column-feed magazine system for centerfire cartridge rifles. The main {{advance of the}} Lee magazine was that it carried its cartridges in two columns, rather than the single column which {{was typical of the}} time. This allowed twice the ammunition to be carried without making the magazine any deeper. When fitted with a charger bridge, the Lee magazine could be quickly reloaded with either single cartridges, like a tubular-feed magazine (which was in vogue for military rifles in certain nations of that era), or with a charger (aka stripper clip) holding five rounds. These charger clips were similar to the Lee or Mannlicher en bloc clip systems, except that the rounds were stripped off of the charger into the magazine, rather than the whole unit of <b>clip</b> and <b>cartridges</b> being placed into the weapon, {{as was the case with}} en bloc clips. This was desirable, because the main drawbacks of the en bloc clip are that the weapon cannot be loaded without a clip, it cannot be used as a single-shot weapon, and you cannot top-off a partially full magazine; all shots must be fired before a new clip can be loaded (which is inconvenient when a soldier finds himself between actions with only one or two shots left and no way to reload). The charger system avoided all this, allowing ammunition to be carried in units of five and rapidly loaded like an en bloc clip, but also allowing it to be easily used without the clips (albeit with somewhat slower loading). Although the charger clip was invented in by Paul Mauser in 1889, for the Mauser M1889, it was quickly adapted to the new Lee-Metford, the first rifle using Lee's action and magazine design (the second being the famed Lee-Enfield). The Lee magazine was perfectly compatible with the charger device, unlike tube-magazine guns, and had other advantages over the Mauser-style, five-shot, single column magazine. The Lee magazine differed in holding the ammunition in two vertical columns, rather than a single stack, allowing for ten rounds to be carried in a magazine that was no deeper than that of the M1889 (although later Mauser rifles, such as the Gewehr 1898 were influenced by the Lee magazine; they retained the five-shot capacity and remained non-detachable, but they adopted double-columns, allowing the entire magazine to fit within the stock, rather than protruding below in front of the trigger guard, like in the M1889, Mosin-Nagant, Carcano, Mannlicher or other designs of that era). Having a magazine holding ten rounds which is loaded via five-round charger clips also allows the soldier to reload the magazine every time he fires 5 shots, just like he would with a five-round magazine, only with a five-round reserve at all times. With a five shot magazine, you have to wait until the gun is empty before reloading with another charger; in an Enfield, the only time you need to completely empty the magazine is in cases of emergency. The rest of the time you can use it as a five-shot rifle with a five-round reserve. This is one reason why the UK never adopted 10 round chargers to go with the 10 round magazines. Another benefit of the detachable magazine was that with the magazine detached, the rifle became a single-shot weapon, a feature seen as desirable by some countries for training purposes or for maintaining control over sometimes unreliable colonial or indigenous troops, many of which were hardly familiar with breech-loaders at all, let alone repeating firearms. It also allowed the rifle to be used as a single shot weapon during long range volley fire, with the full magazine set aside for when the enemy closed and rapid fire was needed (the later magazine cutoff device was intended for a similar purpose). The Lee magazine was also adaptable to a variety of cartridges and bolt systems regardless of bullet shape or cartridge length, whereas a non-detachable magazine (such as used on the Mauser Gewehr 98) had to be designed and fitted integrally with the rest of the gun; in order to deepen the magazine of a Mauser, one would have to redesign the entire action, as the magazine is machined integrally with the receiver; the capacity of a tube magazine is constrained by the length of the weapon. Because the cartridges were stored in a double column and the magazine wasn't integral to the rifle, the Lee magazine could be easily deepened to store additional cartridges in keeping with evolving small arms doctrine. Although no Lee rifle ever carried more than ten rounds, the design served as the basis for what later became the universal standard for military rifles, the detachable, sheet-metal box magazine. In combat, the detachable magazine theoretically allowed a soldier to carry loaded magazines, thus speeding reloading time, although this was never practiced until much later on. At the time Lee's magazine was introduced, rifle magazines were expensive to fabricate and could not be regarded as expendable items. Lee's idea of carrying additional loaded magazines was not seen as an advantage by most major military forces at the time, who preferred to issue the soldier with loose cartridges or charger clips; loading by inserting a full new magazine did little to speed up the loading process over a stripper clip, and added a great deal of cost (one or two stripper clips can be made at a fraction of the price), and a metal magazine also weighs a great deal more, adding to a soldier's ammunition load. With the exception of handguns, it wasn't until rifles with magazine capacities of 20 rounds or greater were invented that detachable magazines were regularly used to carry ammunition in (although many pistols and most submachine guns adopted detachable magazines at a very early date). While the costs of carrying full magazines were not thought to outweigh the benefits in a rifle with a 5 or 10-round magazine, the time it took to load a 20 round magazine with stripper clips was considered excessive, and militaries switched to rifles with double-column, detachable magazines in the Lee style. Although video games and movies regularly, and incorrectly, depict soldiers armed with Lee-Enfield rifles loading by inserting a new magazine; in reality, the Lee-Enfield rifle was always loaded by stripping two 5-round charger clips into the magazine, both in WW1 and WW2. The only exception was that soldiers were sometimes equipped with a single spare magazine, as it was feared that the primary magazine might be accidentally detached and lost, something that wasn't a risk on weapons without detachable magazines. Lee's detachable column-feed magazine system eventually became the pre-eminent design after WW2, and served as the basis for the box magazines used in all modern military small arms.|$|R
