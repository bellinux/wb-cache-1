5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> Lake Vostok, {{discovered}} beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
25|$|The Great Lakes are {{the result}} of glacial scour and pooling of meltwater at the rim of the {{receding}} ice. When the enormous mass of the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> retreated, the Great Lakes began gradually moving south due to isostatic rebound of the north shore. Niagara Falls is also a product of the glaciation, as is the course of the Ohio River, which largely supplanted the prior Teays River.|$|E
25|$|The {{features}} that became Niagara Falls {{were created by}} the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris. Scientists argue {{there is an old}} valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.|$|E

25|$|The Saint Croix in Minnesota and Wisconsin {{is another}} {{important}} river in the Driftless Area, {{as it was the}} outlet for Glacial Lake Duluth, forerunner to Lake Superior, when the eastern outlet was blocked by the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> These rivers all have deep, dramatic canyons giving testimony to the immense quantity of water which once surged through them. The Wisconsin River drained Glacial Lake Wisconsin. Glacial River Warren, whose bed is now occupied by the Minnesota River, drained the colossal Glacial Lake Agassiz. There was ample water to dig a very deep, hundreds-of-miles-long gash into the North American bedrock.|$|E
25|$|During the Saalian Stage (230,000–130,000 years ago) {{the area}} of the present-day Lüneburg Heath was covered three times by a <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> In the last glacial period (110,000–10,000 years ago) the ice sheet no longer covered the Lüneburg Heath area; it reached only as far as the River Elbe. Due to the lack of vegetation, the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water, wind and by soil fluction; this {{resulted}} in valleys like the Totengrund. The material displaced by erosion, referred to as sediment (Geschiebedecksand), has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres (on slopes up to 1.5 metres).|$|E
25|$|Indian Rock in Montebello, New York {{is a large}} glacial erratic boulder {{of granite}} gneiss, formed in the Proterozoic (Precambrian) era, 1.2 billion to 800 million years ago. It is {{estimated}} to weigh ≈17,300 tons. The source area for the boulder was nearby in the Ramapo Mountains-Hudson Highlands. The boulder rests upon glacial outwash which in turn lies atop Triassic sedimentary red beds (sandstone and shale) of the Newark Basin (circa 145 million years old). The rock was carried to its current location by the internal flow of the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> during the last glacial maximum, circa 21,000 years ago. The base of the continental glacier scoured the bedrock terrain across which it moved, thus plucking large and small blocks of rock from {{their position in the}} Ramapo Mountains and Hudson Highlands. Indian Rock got as far as Rockland County before being liberated by the ice and deposited along with gravels shifted by glacial meltwater.|$|E

40|$|The Seasat- 1 radar {{altimeter}} data set acquired over both the Antarctic and Greenland <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> is analyzed to obtain corrected ranges {{to the ice}} surface. The {{radar altimeter}} functional response over the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> is considerably more complex than over the oceans. Causal factors identified in this complicated response include sloping surfaces, undulating ice surfaces with characteristic wavelengths on the same spatial scale as the altimeter beam-limited footprint, off-track reflections, and dynamic lag of the altimeter tracking circuit. Retracking methods using the altimeter return pulse waveforms give range corrections that are typically several meters. The entire set of Seasat- 1 altimetry over the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> is being retracked by fitting a multi-parameter function to each waveform. Many waveforms have double ramps indicating near-normal reflections from two distinct portions of the ice surface within the altimeter beam. Two independent range measurements differing by less than 25 m are obtained from retracking the double-ramp waveforms...|$|R

500|$|Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian {{processes}} are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as [...] "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> and 2% barren rock). Some of the barren rock {{is to be}} found in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that even evaporate ice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{valleys of}} {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{have been subject}} to landslides. [...] Most landslides occur in the Cretaceous shale formations many years ago following the receding of the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> [...] In 1953, a rapid flow landslide destroyed a portion of SK Hwy 35 near Fort Qu'Appelle in the Echo Creek Valley.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{part of the}} Carboniferous Period was {{a period}} of {{extensive}} and thick <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b> During the Carboniferous ice age, the repeated glacial - interglacial cycles caused major changes in the thickness and extent of <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b> When these <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> expanded in extent and thickness, eustatic sea level typically fell by over a 100 m. When these <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> shank in extent and thickness, eustatic sea level typically rose again by typically over a 100 m. As occurred during the Holocene Epoch for Meltwater pulse 1A and Meltwater pulse 1B, brief episodes of rapid melting of Carboniferous, Gondwanan <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> likely caused very rapid rises in sea level that would have abruptly inundated low-lying coastal swamps and drowned the forests growing on them. Based on the sedimentology of roof strata of surface and underground coal mines and cyclothems containing the fossils of upright and in situ tree trunks, geologists proposed that the flooding of coastal swamp by deglacial meltwater pulses resulted in the rapid flooding of coastal forests, particularly along preexisting coastal rivers and streams, over large areas of coastal swamp. During and after their submergence, upright trunks of drowned coastal forests were buried by tidally influenced sedimentation.|$|R

[...] The city {{is located in}} the Lower Illinois River Basin, in a large area known as Till Plain. Sangamon County, and the city of Springfield, are in the Springfield Plain {{subsection}} of Till Plain. The Plain is underlain by glacial till that was deposited by a large <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> that repeatedly covered the area during the Illinoian Stage.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Pleistocene time (about one million years ago), cooling temperatures provided conditions favorable for the creation of continental glaciers. Over the centuries, as snowfall exceeded melting and evaporation, a great accumulation of snow covered part of the continent, forming extensive ice fields. This vast <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> reached a thickness of about [...] in some areas. Sufficient pressure on the ice caused it to flow outward as a glacier. The glacier moved south out of Canada, damming rivers and creating lakes in Washington, Idaho and Montana.|$|E

5|$|Rohling's 2004 Bipolar model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves, causing their destabilisation and destruction.

2500|$|As the ice {{began to}} melt, the sea began to rise. Initially, sea level rose quickly, about [...] per 1,000 years, {{but then the}} rate declined. On Cape Cod, sea level rose roughly [...] per {{millennium}} between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago. After that, it continued to rise at about [...] per millennium. By 6,000 years ago, the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> had left on Cape Cod. The water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer Cape's shoreline through {{a process known as}} longshore drift. Those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of Cape Cod. The entire town of Provincetown, at the extreme tip of the Cape, is a spit consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore. Those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of Monomoy. So while other parts of the Cape have dwindled from the action of the waves, these parts of the Cape have grown through the deposition of sediment in just the last 6,000 years.|$|E
2500|$|The last maximum {{extent of}} glaciation, {{known as the}} Last Glacial Maximum, was {{approximately}} 18,000 years ago. This last returning advancement of glacial ice approaching the Ohio Valley began 30,000 years ago. West Virginia had no ice sheet buildup during this time. During the Last Ice Age smaller glaciation impounded lakes continued to collect precipitation on the plateau. These chilly lakes among mountain peaks were separated from the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> to the north. The deeply carved river valleys, such as the upper Canaan Valley to Blackwater Canyon and the Dolly Sods Wilderness to Cheat River areas, are called Paleozoic Plateaus. The [...] "Driftless Area" [...] drains into rivers having rugged regions of bluffs and valleys. According to the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey, the two large Ice Age lakes varied throughout the epoch. The last glacial lake, Monongahela, has been dated by Carbon-14 testing to between 22,000 and 39,000 years old. It reached {{as far south as}} Weston, West Virginia. The first ice-damming event was a pre-Illinoian (Stage) lake, which outburst during the earlier ice retreat towards the northwest Pittsburgh drainage basin. The last occurrence of the Monongahela Lake outburst was an outwash gravel dam backed up slackwater at Allegheny-Monongahela confluence during an Illinoian ponding event during the last glacial retreat. The last outburst drained the water to its present course in the central Allegheny Mountains or northern tributaries of the state feeding the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers.|$|E

5000|$|Oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) {{are useful}} in reconstructing SST because of the {{influence}} temperature has on the isotope ratio.

The volume of <b>ice</b> trapped in <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> can have an impact of the δ18O. Freshwater characterized by lower values of δ18O becomes trapped in the <b>continental</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets,</b> so that during glacial periods seawater δ18O is elevated and calcite shells formed during these times will have a larger δ18O value.|$|R
