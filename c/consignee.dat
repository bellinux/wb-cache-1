25|$|<b>Consignee</b> and {{consignor}} - as {{pertaining to}} auctions, the consignor (also called the seller, {{and in some}} contexts the vendor) is the person owning the item to be auctioned or the owner's representative, while the <b>consignee</b> is the auction house. The consignor maintains title until such time that an item is purchased by a bidder and the bidder pays the auction house.|$|E
25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one <b>consignee.</b> In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one <b>consignee.</b> FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Chinese {{authorities}} further {{control the}} export of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine through the voluntary use of the Letter of Non-Objection (LONO) system. China will not allow exports of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine without a positive affirmation by authorities in the importing country as to the bona fides of the <b>consignee.</b> For those countries that do not issue import permits, a letter of non-objection must be provided to Chinese authorities.|$|E
5000|$|South of Boston, protesters {{successfully}} compelled the tea <b>consignees</b> to resign. In Charleston, the <b>consignees</b> {{had been}} forced to resign by early December, and the unclaimed tea was seized by customs officials. There were mass protest meetings in Philadelphia. Benjamin Rush urged his fellow countrymen to oppose the landing of the tea, because the cargo contained [...] "the seeds of slavery". By early December, the Philadelphia <b>consignees</b> had resigned and the tea ship returned to England with its cargo following a confrontation with the ship's captain. The tea ship bound for New York City was delayed by bad weather; by the time it arrived, the <b>consignees</b> had resigned, and the ship returned to England with the tea.|$|R

25|$|Fanny and {{the freight}} (charges) were insured separately. An {{abandonment}} to the underwriter {{on the ship}} transfers the freight subsequently earned incident to the ship. Therefore where ship and freight were insured by separate sets of underwriters and the ship being a general ship, was captured and ship and freight were abandoned to the respective underwriters, who paid each a total loss; and the ship being recaptured; performed her voyage and earned freight; which was received from the <b>consignee</b> {{for the use of}} those who were legally entitled thereto. It was held that the underwriter on ship was entitled to recover the freight charges.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Parliament had {{repealed}} {{most of the}} Townshend taxes (keeping {{only the}} one on tea), and passed the Tea Act, which authorised the British East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea. [...] This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company's tea. In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis, since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship's arrival. [...] Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role {{in the choice of}} <b>consignee.</b> [...] Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed. [...] Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite citywide protests that the tea be sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed. [...] When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night and dumped the tea into the harbour.|$|E
50|$|After {{a recall}} is issued, FSIS conducts {{effectiveness}} checks {{to ensure that}} the company’s customers (or <b>consignees)</b> have received notice of the recall and are making every effort to retrieve and destroy the recalled product or return it to the recalling firm. FSIS personnel verify that the recalling firm has been diligent and successful in notifying and advising their <b>consignees</b> of the need to retrieve and control recalled product, and that the <b>consignees</b> have responded accordingly. FSIS has formal agreements with many state governments that allow those states to participate in effectiveness checks, thus improving the speed and effectiveness of recalls.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is three-fold. First, it maps the delivery structure for on-street <b>consignees</b> and <b>consignees</b> located at shopping centers. In general, micro-data regarding urban freight is sparse, thus this survey greatly contributes to the general knowledge about number of deliveries and number of freight vehicles in Oslo. This information is important to take into account for bottom-up calculations of traffic impacts. This includes private costs of freight, but also socio-economic external costs related to local and global emissions, noise, increased congestion and increased chances of traffic accidents. Second, through surveys amongst employees and drivers, car counts and GPS data, we have identified and quantified an important cost difference between on-street <b>consignees</b> and <b>consignees</b> at shopping centers, namely the increased cost due to lower capacity for on-street <b>consignees.</b> The expected additional cost per vehicle related to low capacity is estimated to be NOK 49 (the additional cost per delivery will obviously depend on number of deliveries per vehicle). This is important information from a policy perspective, and suggests that both (1) increasing capacity for on-street deliveries in the city center and (2) facilitating for shopping centers with dedicated unloading spaces will reduce both private costs for transport operators and <b>consignees,</b> and external costs related to emissions and congestion. Third, we give recommendations for mitigating the problem of space restrictions for on-street deliveries in the city center. This approach consist of two elements: (1) deliveries before or after stores’ opening hours and (2) deliveries to a buffer storage location with a dedicated unloading space...|$|R

2500|$|In 1873, the Peruvian {{government}} {{dictated the}} Ley del estanco del salitre, which limited the salitre production and authorized {{the government to}} purchase the whole production to a fixed price. But the plan failed and the law was withdrawn. In 1875, Peru's government expropriated the salitreras of Tarapacá {{in order to secure}} revenue from guano and nitrate by means of a monopoly, and in 1876 Antony Gibbs & Sons became <b>consignee</b> of the nitrate trade for the Peruvian government. President Mariano Ignacio Prado was [...] "determined to complete the monopoly" [...] and in 1876 Peru bought the nitrate licenses for [...] "El Toco" [...] auctioned by Bolivian decree of 13 January 1876. But the Chilean CSFA remained the most serious competitor and clearly weakened Peru's monopoly. President Pardo, Prado's predecessor, had urged Gibbs to secure the monopoly by limiting CSFA's output, and in fact, Henry Gibbs had warned the CSFA's directory board, in a letter on 16 April 1878, that CSFA's refusal to limit the output would bring administrative trouble with Peru and Bolivia as long and as intensive as it is made more and more to the interest of a neighboring Government that they should be so.|$|E

Forwarding agent is the idle an doing transactions between importers especially <b>consignees,</b> the customs department and the port management. Due to the coming AFTA, opening a forwarding agent company is actually grabbing an opportunity. After considering for about some tie we decided to open the office in Westport. It is because the location must be near the port for the tie in doing business can be saved. Considering the AFTA in 2003, we hope {{to increase the number}} of our <b>consignees</b> because our income depends on the number of transactions that was assigned by the <b>consignees.</b> We target that at the year 2003, the number of importers will grow.

To obtain the best possible price for the guano, the Peruvian state established a system of consignment to private companies, to sell the product in Europe and the United States. The <b>consignees</b> were important elements in the government's finances, because they delivered the cash and credits for the government's spending.
