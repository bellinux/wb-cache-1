40|$|AbstractTransferability of {{fracture}} toughness data obtained on small scale specimens to a full-scale cracked structure {{is one of}} the key issues in integrity assessment of engineering structures. In order to transfer {{fracture toughness}} under different constraints, both in-plane and out-of-plane <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> should be considered for the specimens and structures. In this paper both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effects of a crack in a reference reactor pressure vessel (RPV) subjected to pressurized thermal shocks (PTSs) are analyzed by two-parameter and three-parameter methods. The comparison between elastic and elastic–plastic analysis shows that the <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> varies with the material property. T 11 (the second term of William’s extension acting parallel to the crack plane) generally displays a reversed relation to the stress intensity factor (SIF) with the transient time, which indicates that the loading (SIF) plays an important role on the in-plane <b>constraint</b> <b>effect.</b> The thickness at the crack tip contributes more than the loading to the out-of-plane constraint, such that T 33 (the second term of William’s extension acting along the thickness) displays a similar relation to ε 33 (strain along the thickness direction) and a different relation to T 11 during the transient.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of cracked mechanical components {{can be assessed}} using the fracture toughness material property. The fracture toughness of a particular component is often dependent upon the component geometry {{as well as the}} nature of loading (e. g. uniaxial or biaxial loading). This dependence is interpreted as the <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> in fracture. Various methods have been developed to investigate the <b>constraint</b> <b>effect,</b> including the two parameter J-A 2 method. The J-A 2 method is a more accurate representation of the stress fields near the crack tip, as additional terms from the well-known HRR series solution are included. The current study applies the J-A 2 method to fracture toughness data of cracked cruciform specimens subjected to uniaxial and biaxial stresses. The J-A 2 results of the cruciform specimens are compared to those of other plane strain specimens described by ASTM standards, including three point bend and compact tension, to determine if loss of constraint exists. Finite element models of each specimen were analyzed to determine the A 2 parameter used to quantify the level of constraint based on geometry and loading. The results reveal loss of constraint for shallow cracked specimens when compared to deep cracked specimens, and also that uniaxial loading results in loss of constraint when compared to biaxial loaded specimens. In summary, the J-A 2 method appears to be a viable tool to predict failure including the consideration of the <b>constraint</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} evaluating <b>constraint</b> <b>effects</b> on probabilistic elastic [...] plastic analysis of cracks in ductile solids. It is based on fracture parameters J and Q, correlation between Q and J [...] resistance curve of the material, and J-tearing theory for predicting fracture initiation and instability in cracked structures. Based on experimental data from small-scale fracture specimens, correlation equations were developed for fracture toughness at crack initiation and {{the slope of the}} J [...] resistance curve as a function of constraint condition. The random parameters may involve crack geometry, tensile and fracture toughness properties of the material, and applied loads. Standard reliability methods were applied to predict probabilistic fracture response and reliability of cracked structures. The results suggest that crack-tip <b>constraints</b> have little <b>effect</b> on the probability of crack initiation. However, the probability of fracture instability can be significantly reduced when <b>constraint</b> <b>effects</b> are taken into account.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} a rational-expectations model {{of an economy}} in which firms are {{constrained}} to finance their advances to labor and their purchases of commodity inputs by borrowing from a domestic banking system, which constitutes the entire financial system of the economy. The major implication of this 2 ̆ 2 financial constraint 2 ̆ 2 is that the supply of output comes to depend positively on the real monetary base.;In the closed economy version of the model, a fully anticipated increase {{in the rate of}} growth of the monetary base or an anticipated temporary decrease in the level of the monetary base reduces the equilibrium level of output and affects the real wage rate and the real interest rate. Thus, money is not superneutral and the Fisher effect does not hold. In addition, permanent monetary shocks, mistakenly viewed as temporary, also have real effects.;The open economy version of the model distinguishes between tradable and nontradable goods. Here it is shown that the effect of changes in the exogenous variables on the levels of output can be decomposed into a 2 ̆ 2 financial <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 relative price effect 2 ̆ 2.;Under flexible exchange rates, the financial <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> always dominates the relative price effect. Hence, any monetary changes that leads to a decrease in output in the closed economy case, also leads to a decrease in the levels of output of both goods in the flexible exchange rate case. In addition, a permanent monetary decrease, mistakenly viewed as temporary, causes the exchange rate to 2 ̆ 2 overshoot 2 ̆ 2 relative to its full current information level.;Under fixed exchange rates, the output effects of anticipated changes in exogenous variables depend on the importance of the financial <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> as compared to the relative price effect. If the financial <b>constraint</b> <b>effect</b> is strong enough, an anticipated rise in the level of the government debt will increase the output of both commodities, while an anticipated rise in the price level of the tradable good or an anticipated devaluation will reduce them. Finally, neither unanticipated changes in the price level of the tradable good, nor an unanticipated devaluation affect the current level of output of either commodity. Both might lead to a contraction of output of both commodities in subsequent periods, however...|$|E
