40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of cow’s milk with fat contents of 3. 6 %, Dalia cheese with fat contents of 44 %, butter with fat contents of 80 % and margarine with fat contents of 24 % was determined after a heat treatment performed on <b>cooking</b> <b>plate</b> and microwave treatment, respectively of different durations. The biggest difference was obtained for oleic acid and elaidic acid since, {{with the exception}} of the margarine, in each case proportion of the cis-configurated oleic acid decreased while that of the trans-configurated elaidic acid increased. For all of the other fatty acids in the foodstuffs examined no such differences were obtained regarding change in fatty acid composition whose differences could influence healthy nutrition to considerable extent. Therefore we can take it as a fact that neither heat treatment performed on a traditional <b>cooking</b> <b>plate</b> nor microwave treatment affects considerably the composition of food fats...|$|E

The aim is to replace the use of tola bushes as heat source in traditional ovens. Each family bakes its bread one time per week in its own adobe oven, using in average 30 kg of tola. Due to the extreme arid climatic conditions and growing population, the impact of firewood collection {{is more and more}} visible. To protect the sparse vegetation, a solar bakery oven was developed using a fix focus Scheffler reflector with 8 m reflector area. The oven has a volume of about 200 liters. With an input power of about 3 kW it reaches temperatures of up to 350 °C. Alternatively the oven can be moved aside on rails and permits the use as <b>cooking</b> <b>plate.</b> For cooking use, a new type of <b>cooking</b> <b>plate</b> was developed, using a ceramic stove top to protect the secondary reflector from food dropping down...|$|E

A drop of each, in equal amounts, falls onto the super-heated steel plate of the firebox, where the water vaporizes and boosts the flames, thereby increasing the temperature from about 250 degrees Celsius to more than 800 degrees Celsius (the World Health Organisation (WHO) minimum burning standard for incinerators in developing countries). As the firebox gets hotter, the network of steel pipes that pass around the cooker produce hot water. As the rubbish burns, heat is distributed under 8 <b>cooking</b> <b>plates</b> {{on the top of}} the Cooker and 2 ovens in the sides of the Cooker.|$|R

40|$|We {{sought to}} prospectively study all {{injuries}} {{in children and}} adolescents up to 16 years of age presenting to a regional Emergency Department (ED), to ascertain detailed injury patterns and to use this data to recommend injury prevention priorities. Electronic injury surveillance was prospectively collected over a 10 year period (1997 - 2007) in a hospital with a paediatric catchment population of 75, 000 in a region with pockets of high social deprivation. All fatalities were obtained from data provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Over a 10 year period, there were 31 fatalities, 5, 408 admissions and 40, 817 new attendances due to injury. Males outnumbered females in a 3 : 2 ratio. Of all injuries 24, 317 (60 %) occurred at home. Peak injury presentation time was in the evening between 18 : 00 and 20 : 00. Minor injuries (bruises, minor head injuries, lacerations and sprains) accounted for 32, 456 (80 %) of total. Fractures resulting from high falls (n= 1, 194) tended to result from bunk beds, staircases, horses, walls and playground equipment. Burns (n= 630) involved hot liquids (tea, coffee), hot bath water, hot cooking oil and hot <b>cooking</b> <b>plates.</b> Pedestrian injuries (n= 251) were predominantly 'dart outs' in urban areas. Car passenger injuries (n= 869) showed low rates of documented car restraint use. Poisonings (n= 1, 153) were predominantly medicinal products. Cyclist injuries (n= 477) indicated low documented use of appropriate helmet wear. Prevention priorities should focus on home injuries, hot liquid burn and scald injuries and high falls from walls, beds and playground equipment. To prevent road-related injuries and deaths, further legislation, urban planning and greater police enforcement is required...|$|R

60|$|The {{houses and}} {{furniture}} {{are on a}} par with the food. A rude shed, supported on rough and slender sticks rather than posts, no walls, but the floor raised to within a foot of the eaves, is the style of architecture they usually adopt. Inside there are partition walls of thatch, forming little boxes or sleeping places, to accommodate the two or three separate families that usually live together. A few mats, baskets, and <b>cooking</b> vessels, with <b>plates</b> and basins purchased from the Macassar traders, constitute their whole furniture; spears and bows are their weapons; a sarong or mat forms the clothing of the women, a waistcloth of the men. For hours or even for days they sit idle in their houses, the women bringing in the vegetables or sago which form their food. Sometimes they hunt or fish a little, or work at their houses or canoes, but they seem to enjoy pure idleness, and work as little as they can. They have little to vary the monotony of life, little that can be called pleasure, except idleness and conversation. And they certainly do talk! Every evening there is a little Babel around me: but as I understand not a word of it, I go on with my book or work undisturbed. Now and then they scream and shout, or laugh frantically for variety; and this goes on alternately with vociferous talking of men, women, and children, till long after I am in my mosquito curtain and sound asleep.|$|R
5000|$|While {{some writers}} Wayne Swanson in Why the West Was Wild claim that cowboys seldom if ever had horses of their own, {{this is not}} only untrue but {{basically}} impossible. Ranchers routinely laid off 50 to 70% of their crews for the winter; these men had to search for new jobs or simply [...] "ride the grub line" [...] until spring. Ranches sometimes failed, and their hands were cast adrift. Or a cowboy might disagree with his boss or foreman, or simply get [...] "a hankering" [...] to see new country. Since he seldom had enough money to travel by train or stagecoach, his only option was horseback. (The misconception of the authors cited may come from the fact that each cowboy did have a [...] "string" [...] of ranch-owned horses [...] "cut" [...] to him upon hire, because all range ponies were grass-fed and had to be changed {{at least once a day}} when at heavy work, and because the cowboy himself seldom owned a well-trained specialized horse, such as a roping or cutting one.) And while he could legitimately claim food and lodging free of charge at any private home he came to (even if nobody was home at the time), distances in the West were such that he might sometimes be caught midway between around camping time, so he would also have to have a [...] "camp outfit" [...] (<b>cooking</b> utensils, <b>plate,</b> cup, cutlery), food supplies, and perhaps some fishing gear and trap lines. By the 1890s, if not before, he could purchase for this purpose a compact camping kit of all necessary basic items, including a [...] "skeleton stove" [...] (a steel grill on legs to place over the campfire); these were made by various companies and often advertised as [...] "patent." [...] They ranged from 15 to 53 pieces, weighed a maximum 80 lb., cost at most about $18, and could be packed up in a single unit of about one cubic foot pictures, Sears,; such an object could easily be slipped into a pannier and slung on one side of a pack saddle, balanced on the other side of the horse with a second one containing the cowboy's food (and perhaps a nosebag of oats or maize for each horse), while the rolled bedroll, being to some extent flexible, could be crammed between the forks of the saddle on top, and the whole neatly covered with a tarpaulin secured with a diamond hitch. Historians of the cowboy therefore speak of his [...] "personal horses." [...] He probably changed off each day, because his pack, being dead weight, would sit more heavily on the horse bearing it than would a human being of equivalent poundage.|$|R
60|$|The {{interior}} of the hut was chiefly occupied by two beds. One was empty, but composed of collected leaves, and spread with an antelope's hide. It seemed, from the articles of armour laid beside it, and from a crucifix of silver, carefully and reverentially disposed at the head, to be the couch of the knight himself. The other contained the invalid, of whom Sir Kenneth had spoken, a strong-built and harsh-featured man, past, as his looks betokened, the middle age of life. His couch was trimmed more softly than his master's, and it was plain that the more courtly garments of the latter, the loose robe in which the knights showed themselves on pacific occasions, and the other little spare articles of dress and adornment, had been applied by Sir Kenneth to the accommodation of his sick domestic. In an outward part of the hut, which yet was {{within the range of}} the English baron's eye, a boy, rudely attired with buskins of deer's hide, a blue cap or bonnet, and a doublet, whose original finery was much tarnished, sat on his knees by a chafing-dish filled with charcoal, <b>cooking</b> upon a <b>plate</b> of iron the cakes of barley-bread, which were then, and still are, a favourite food with the Scottish people. Part of an antelope was suspended against one of the main props of the hut. Nor was it difficult to know how it had been procured; for a large stag greyhound, nobler in size and appearance than those even which guarded King Richard's sick-bed, lay eyeing the process of baking the cake. The sagacious animal, on their first entrance, uttered a stifled growl, which sounded from his deep chest like distant thunder. But he saw his master, and acknowledged his presence by wagging his tail and couching his head, abstaining from more tumultuous or noisy greeting, as if his noble instinct had taught him the propriety of silence in a sick man's chamber.|$|R
40|$|As the world’s {{energy demand}} increases, {{more and more}} focus is {{directed}} towards different solar energy solutions. In many African countries, a great share of the population cook their food with firewood as the energy source. Since the use of firewood leads to deforestation and bad indoor climate, it is of interest to implement solar cookers in countries where the sun radiation is sufficiently strong. Most commercialized solar cookers are direct systems, meaning the cooking has to take place {{when the sun is}} present. To make the cooking more flexible in relation to time, solar cookers connected to a heat storage is of interest to develop. During this work a high-temperature thermal heat storage has been designed, constructed and tested. The heat storage is a part of an oil circulation system where the oil transports heat from an absorber connected to a solar capturing reflective trough. Eight aluminum cylinders, which are immersed in the circulating oil, are connected to the aluminum top plate of the heat storage. Each cylinder contains a solar salt phase change material. The solar salt is the material that stores most of the heat which can be used for cooking purposes. Since the cylinders are connected to the top <b>plate,</b> <b>cooking</b> pots placed on top of the heat storage will be heated by conduction from the solar salt. After the dimensioning of the heat storage was done, a computer-aided design (CAD) program called Autodesk Inventor was used to design drawings which the workshop would use during the construction of the heat storage. The heat storage has been analyzed through simulations done in the finite element method program COMSOL Multiphysics and through experiments in the laboratory. In addition to cooking tests, these analyses have had the main goal of examining the charging and discharging time of the heat storage. The results showed that the charging time decreases if the heat storage is being used on a daily basis. That is because the phase change material does not reach the temperature of the surroundings overnight, causing the next charging to start at a higher temperature than the first. The aim of the cooking tests was to boil one liter of water, which turned out to take at least 40 minutes. If modifications are to be done on the heat storage, one should have the charging time in mind. As the sun shines during a limited time period each day, the charging time, which was found to be between six and nine hours, cannot be allowed to become longer than these experiments indicated. </p...|$|R
