Richardson {{and members of the}} Polar Bear Expedition, part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War—for a return to New York on 15 October. In December, Congressman Charles H. Randall (Prohibitionist-CA) and his wife sailed on the Matoika to Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal.|$|E

5|$|First team coach Tony Mowbray was {{in charge}} for four games as {{caretaker}} manager, winning once, but he was replaced as manager by the permanent appointment of former Oldham Athletic, Everton and Manchester City manager Joe Royle, whose managerial <b>career</b> <b>had</b> previously yielded four promotions and one FA Cup victory; as a player, he had been named {{player of the year}} in his only full season at Ipswich's local rivals Norwich City.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson on grounds of cruelty in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing <b>career</b> <b>had</b> ended.|$|E
5|$|German {{grandmaster}} Karsten Müller wrote:Fischer, who {{had taken}} the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet chess empire, shook the whole world, not only the chess world, to its core.

Teaching chess or playing chess as a <b>career</b> <b>had</b> truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing <b>career</b> <b>had</b> started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were struggling in {{the bottom half of}} the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 after he had been in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|When Jocelin died, he {{was back}} at Melrose Abbey, where his <b>career</b> <b>had</b> begun. He may have retired to Melrose knowing his death was near. Jocelin {{certainly}} did die at Melrose, passing away on St Patrick's Day (17 March) 1199. He {{was buried in the}} monks' choir of Melrose Abbey Church. Hugh de Roxburgh, Chancellor of Scotland, was elected as Jocelin's replacement. The Chronicle of Melrose has only a short obituary.|$|E
5|$|A major {{scientific}} {{controversy over}} the origin of coral reefs {{took place in the}} late 19th Century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana, who early in his <b>career</b> <b>had</b> seen coral reefs in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray, who participated in the 1872–76 Challenger expedition. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that coral reefs formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz, who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine coral reefs in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.|$|E

5|$|A {{transfer}} to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro <b>career</b> <b>had</b> a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He {{broke into the}} first team in 1954, flourishing {{as part of the}} tactical system known as the Revie Plan. During this period he played in two consecutive FA Cup finals, as a loser in 1955 and a winner in 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to promotion in his first season. Barnes returned to Manchester City in 1970, and over more than two decades filled a variety of coaching roles, including overseeing the development of the youth team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although his Test <b>career</b> <b>had</b> finished, Loxton {{continued}} to play for his state. He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951–52, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71—his only fifty of the season—and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton’s unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them to hold on for a draw with one wicket intact. He {{continued to}} take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, {{who went on to}} win the competition.|$|E
5|$|At age 21, O'Brien {{retired after}} the 1968 Olympics, {{so he could}} {{concentrate}} solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming <b>career</b> <b>had</b> caused substantial financial stress for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, {{so that he could}} support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held for more than ten years. He then worked for Channel Ten for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the public}} {{strongly}} identified Leigh with {{her second husband}} Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned {{a reputation for being}} difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life she suffered from bipolar disorder as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her <b>career</b> <b>had</b> periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal <b>career</b> <b>had</b> been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} <b>career</b> <b>had</b> stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} positive {{reviews for}} his pianism, Bache's difficulties with the critics {{on behalf of}} Liszt's music had a negative backlash on his performing career. He was never invited {{to play with the}} Philharmonic Society, even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist. After printed inquiries by the Musical Standard, which openly questioned why Bache's <b>career</b> <b>had</b> not advanced despite his obvious talent, he was invited in 1874 to play at the Crystal Palace. While his playing was lauded, his choice of music (the Liszt arrangement of Weber's Polonaise Brillante for piano and orchestra) was derided as astoundingly impudent. He also appeared at concerts led by Hans Richter, as organist in Liszt's symphonic poem Die Hunnenschlacht and as pianist in Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Chopin's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Many fans {{hoped to}} see him play for Italy at Euro 2004, or with the 2004 Olympic squad that {{eventually}} managed a Bronze medal, {{but this was not}} to be the case. However, he was given an international send-off by Trapattoni at age 37 in a friendly match against Spain on 28 April 2004, in which he wore the number 10 shirt for the final time, as well as the captain's armband for part of the match. Although Baggio entertained the crowd with his creativity and skill, he was unable to score, despite winning a free-kick from which Vieri's equalising goal arose. The match finished 1–1 and Baggio was given a standing ovation after being substituted off for Fabrizio Miccoli. This was Baggio's 56th and final match for Italy, {{and it was the first}} time an Italian footballer's <b>career</b> <b>had</b> been celebrated this way since Silvio Piola retired.|$|E
5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own <b>career</b> <b>had</b> illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state.|$|E
