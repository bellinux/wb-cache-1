Here I directly compare {{the effects of}} plant species and genotypic diversity on arthropod communities and ecosystem functioning. Through behavioral observations, field experiments, and laboratory assays, I show contrasting mechanisms by which arthropod species richness and evenness are altered by each type of plant diversity. I then show how genotypic diversity of the <b>common</b> <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> (Oenothera biennis) reduces herbivory by changing herbivore behavior and physiology, ultimately decreasing consumption efficiency. Finally, I show how O. biennis genotypic diversity attenuates induced plant resistance to the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica), indirectly increasing plant susceptibility to three native seed predators. As a result, this highly invasive beetle actually increases the fitness of O. biennis by consuming it. Overall, I show that plant genotypic diversity contributes substantially to the structure and functioning of arthropod communities through both direct and indirect mechanisms. iv BIOGRAPHICAL SKETC...|$|E
40|$|Early-season {{herbivory}} {{can cause}} plants to induce resistance to subsequent herbivores, and this ubiquitous plant defense {{strategy has been}} shown to be adaptive when subsequent vegetative-feeding herbivores impact plant fitness. However, a growing number of studies show that leaf herbivory can also induce defenses in plant reproductive tissues, which may deter mutualists such as pollinators and seed dispersers, or antagonists such as florivores and seed predators. Due to their direct interaction with plant reproductive tissues, deterrence of these mutualists or antagonists may have large negative or positive effects on plant fitness. Despite numerous predictions, we know little regarding the fitness consequences of leaf-toreproductive tissue induction in nature. Here, using observations of natural populations and manipulative field experiments, we show that leaf herbivory by the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) induces an accumulation of jasmonic acid and complex phenolics in reproductive tissues of the <b>common</b> <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> (Oenothera biennis). Consequently, seed predation by three native Lepidoptera is reduced by 77 % on beetle-induced plants, while leaf herbivory itself has little impact on lifetime reproductive output. These results show that O. biennis benefits from being consumed by an invasive folivore, and that leaf-to-reproductive tissue induction can be an adaptive trait. Induced plant defenses can therefore be beneficial in a broader community context than previously realized...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this review, I {{consider}} the contribution that <b>common</b> <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> (Oenothera biennis) has made towards integrating the ecology, evolution and genetics of species interactions. Oenothera biennis {{was among the}} earliest plant models in genetics and cytogenetics and it {{played an important role}} in the modern synthesis of evo-lutionary biology. More recently, population and ecologi-cal genetics approaches have provided insight into the patterns of genetic variation within and between popula-tions, and how a combination of abiotic and biotic factors maintain and select on heritable variation within O. biennis populations. From an ecological perspective, field experi-ments show that genetic variation and evolution within populations can have cascading effects throughout com-munities. Plant genotype affects the preference and per-formance of individual arthropod populations, as well as the composition, biomass, total abundance and diversity of arthropod species on plants. A combination of experiments and simulation models show that natural selection on specific plant traits can drive rapid ecological changes in these same community variables. At the patch level, increasing genotypic diversity leads to a greater abundance and diversity of omnivorous and predaceous arthropods, which is also associated with increased biomass and fecundity of plants in genetically diverse patches. Finally, in questioning whether a community genetics perspective is needed in biology, I review several multifactorial experiments which show that plant genotype often explains as much variation in community variables as other eco-logical factors typically identified as most important in ecology. As a whole, research in the O. biennis system has contributed to a more complete understanding of the dynamic interplay between ecology, evolution and genetics...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} with a {{poor prognosis}} are <b>common.</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil (EPO) has beneficial biological effects and immunomodulatory properties. Since electrical activity {{plays a major}} role in neural regeneration, the present study investigated the effects of electrical stimulation (ES), combined with evening primrose oil (EPO), on sciatic nerve function after a crush injury in rats. In anesthetized rats, the sciatic nerve was crushed using small haemostatic forceps followed by ES and/or EPO treatment for 4 weeks. Functional recovery of the sciatic nerve was assessed using the sciatic functional index. Histopathological changes of gastrocnemius muscle atrophy were investigated by light microscopy. Electrophysiological changes were assessed by the nerve conduction velocity of sciatic nerves. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the remyelination of the sciatic nerve following the interventions. EPO + ES, EPO, and ES obviously improved sciatic nerve function assessed by the sciatic functional index and nerve conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve at 28 days after operation. Expression of the peripheral nerve remyelination marker, protein zero (P 0), was increased in the treatment groups at 28 days after operation. Muscle atrophy severity was decreased significantly while the nerve conduction velocity was increased significantly in rats with sciatic nerve injury in the injury + EPO + ES group than in the EPO or ES group. Totally speaking, the combined use of EPO and ES may produce an improving effect on the function of sciatic nerves injured by a crush. The increased expression of P 0 may have contributed to improving the functional effects of combination therapy with EPO and ES as well as the electrophysiological and histopathological features of the injured peripheral nerve...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{systems are}} {{challenged}} by invasions, extinctions, urbanization, and disturbance. Some species (or genotypes) persist despite these challenges, whereas others are lost. This dissertation asks [1] which species' attributes predict {{their ability to}} respond to environmental change, [2] how do changes in the composition of plant communities affect system functioning, and [3] can we use information about how species interact in diverse communities to inform the design of urban systems? Chapter 1 addresses the first question with an examination of plasticity among native and exotic congeners in response to altered competition and fertilization. We found that weedy exotics were not more plastic than natives, but instead that plasticity was more similar within genus. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 explore how changes in diversity impact natural systems. Species richness is generally increasing due to the introduction of exotic species, and Chapter 2 asks how changes in exotic versus native plant diversity impact plant productivity and arthropod community structure. We found that diverse exotic communities were equally, if not more, productive than native communities and that they recruited an equally abundant and diverse arthropod fauna. However, exotics diminished the relative fruit production of co-occurring native species and recruited fewer arthropod species than natives. Chapter 3 provides the first direct comparison of how changes in genotypic diversity compare to changes in species diversity. We show that increasing either genotypic diversity of <b>common</b> <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> (Oenothera biennis) or old-field species diversity resulted in nearly equivalent increases in aboveground primary production. Arthropod species richness also increased with both types of plant diversity. Finally, Chapter 4 integrates ecological principles from the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning literature into the design of vegetated rooftops. Most green roof plantings include only one or a few drought-tolerant species. We review the green roof and ecological literature to establish a clear research agenda for creating diverse and dynamic green roof ecosystems...|$|E
