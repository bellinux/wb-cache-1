25|$|In October 1973, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, Steven B. Epstein, and a {{childhood}} friend, New York lawyer Jeffrey H. Becker, formed “Epstein & Becker”, a firm focusing {{on health care}} law. Ronald M.

The firm was eventually incorporated and became “Epstein Becker & Green, P.C.”.

25|$|Construction {{began in}} April 1975 {{on the shore}} of Lake Burley Griffin, in the Parliamentary Triangle. The site is just to the east of the axis running between Capital Hill and the Australian War Memorial.

The neighbouring National Gallery was also designed by the firm of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs.

The building was completed in 1980 and the majority of the court's sittings have been held in Canberra since then.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the effect of parent brand perceived quality and perceived similarity on the evaluation of <b>corporate</b> <b>service</b> brand extensions. It is also the intention of this study to verify whether providing information cues about the characteristics of the extension contributes to the brand extension evaluation. The hypotheses were tested by means of three experiments involving 1, 131 subjects. The results of Study 1, conducted with fictitious brands as stimuli, demonstrated that the perceived quality of the parent brand played a more significant role than perceived similarity on the evaluations of brand extensions. In Study 2, where real brands were used as stimuli, the results were the same as in Study 1. Study 3 found that providing information cues about the characteristics of the extensions had a positive effect for one of the extensions of the high quality parent brand but not for the two proposed extensions of the low quality parent brand. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that the perceived quality of the parent-brand plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of <b>corporate</b> <b>service</b> brand extensions. The study also contributes several hypotheses for future studies and managerial implications for managers of <b>corporate</b> <b>service</b> brands...|$|R

40|$|This note {{describes}} {{a model that}} measures {{the quality of the}} project service of a D/B firm using quality function deployment (QFD). This model is an add-on to a model developed previously by the authors to measure the <b>corporate</b> <b>service</b> quality performance of D/B firms. The project service quality performance model makes use of 10 service quality factors and their relative weights (transferred from the <b>corporate</b> <b>service</b> quality performance model), three components of quality management systems in place in D/B projects (ranked by senior managers in D/B firms) and the relationships between service quality factors and quality system requirements (established by a professional quality system assessor). It uses QFD to calculate a quality performance index. The combined <b>corporate</b> and project <b>service</b> quality performance index can be used by D/B firms to benchmark themselves against their competitors or to monitor their own performance. It can also be used by owners to rank D/B firms relative to their service quality performance. Project service quality, design/build construction, quality function deployment,...|$|R
