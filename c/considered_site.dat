The model is developed {{by taking advantage of}} an extensive set of high-resolution radiosonde observations (RAOBS) collected in several sites worldwide. It predicts the statistics of oxygen attenuation along the path by retaining the accurate formulation for the specific oxygen attenuation included in the Liebe MPM 93 model, but it relies on simplified meteorological input values (namely the mean yearly ground temperature and the statistics of the ground water vapor content), rather than on full atmospheric vertical profile. Tested against attenuation estimates obtained from Liebe MPM 93 model coupled with the mentioned RAOBS data, the model provides a very good prediction accuracy in the full 10 - 350 GHz range, which turns out to be almost independent of the <b>considered</b> <b>site...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sandy barred beaches {{are often}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} rhythmic patterns such as crescentic bars. In this article, a linear stability analysis (LSA) model is used to characterize the morphological behaviour of the double bar system of Truc Vert beach. Using a limited number of combinations of representative bathymetries, wave classes and water levels, the morphodynamic response of the system is analysed, focussing on the geometrical characteristics of 3 D patterns generated with the model. These characteristics are described and then compared with available observations. The shapes and the wavelengths of the instabilities predicted by the model compare well with field observations. Thus, the use of the linear stability model, with representative hydrodynamic conditions and bathymetries of the <b>considered</b> <b>site,</b> allows a characterization of the global morphodynamic behaviour of a double-barred system.

40|$|As sea-level rises, the {{frequency}} of coastal marine flooding events is changing. For accurate assessments, several other factors must be considered as well, such as the variability of sea-level rise and storm surge patterns. Here, a global sensitivity analysis is used to provide quantitative insight into {{the relative importance of}} contributing uncertainties over the coming decades. The method is applied on an urban low-lying coastal site located in the north-western Mediterranean, where the yearly probability of damaging flooding could grow drastically after 2050 if sea-level rise follows IPCC projections. Storm surge propagation processes, then sea-level variability, and, later, global sea-level rise scenarios become successively important source of uncertainties over the 21 st century. This defines research priorities that depend on the target period of interest. On the long term, scenarios RCP 6. 0 and 8. 0 challenge local capacities of adaptation for the <b>considered</b> <b>site...</b>|$|E
