Based on Auslender’s results, Studniarski [4] proved necessary and sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> {{the problem of the}} feasible set defined by an arbitrary set. Moreover, Ward [5] derived necessary and sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> strict minimizer of order m in nondifferentiable scalar programs.

After some hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. As a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> Tchaikovsky's engagement, the Russian Musical Society required a list of works {{that he planned to}} conduct.

The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E

This {{paper is}} {{essentially}} a discussion of results found in the paper “Two sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> a graphic sequence to have a realization with prescribed clique size ” written by Jian-Hua Yin and Jiong-Sheng Li. We first define {{what is meant by}} a graphic sequence, then offer a few necessary and sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> a sequence to be graphic. Next we establish some sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> sequences to have graphic realizations with prescribed clique sizes, as well as sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> realizations that are one edge shy of containing a clique of predetermined size. Finally we use the theorems developed over the course of this paper to prove a number of recent results. Contents 1. Background 2 2.
