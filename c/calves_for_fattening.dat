40|$|Cylactin® {{consists}} of dehydrated cells of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is authorised for use in feeds for chickens, turkeys and pigs for fattening, piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and for fattening at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe for <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and for rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids for fattening and rearing. However, lambs for fattening are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or rearing were considered. Use of the additive with <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> significantly increased final body weight and/or daily gain in four of five trials when used at a dose of 1 x 109 CFU/kg complete feed. An additional study with calves for rearing confirmed these results at the same dose. As the mechanism of action of the additive can be reasonably assumed to be same, the positive results seen in <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing can be extrapolated to kids for rearing and fattening.

40|$|Forty {{crossbred}} calves (Holstein and Brawn Swiss xZebu) {{of approximately}} {{three to four}} months of age {{at the start of the}} trial were used. A]: 1 received molasses/urea plus residual milk after each milking and grazed from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon. The two treatments were 600 g/day of rice polishings or 2. 5 % liveweight of leucaena forage. No significant differences in the liveweight gains between the two treatments were observed nor were symptoms of toxicity. Therefore it is concluded chat leucaena at 2 % of liveweight could provide a good supplement for calves reared in restricted suckling systems after grazing. Key words: Restricted suckling, calf rearing, leucaena In milk production systems in the tropical regions of Mexico, Zebu and Zebu crosses using larger breeds such as Brown Swiss and Holstein are generally used in dual-purpose systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this survey was to determine herd level risk factors for mortality, unwanted early slaughter, and metaphylactic application of antimicrobial group therapy in Swiss veal calves in 2013. A questionnaire regarding farm structure, farm management, mortality and antimicrobial use was sent to all farmers registered in a Swiss label program setting requirements for improved animal welfare and sustainability. Risk factors were determined by multivariable logistic regression. A total of 619 veal producers returned a useable questionnaire (response rate= 28. 5 %), of which 40. 9 % only fattened their own calves (group O), 56. 9 % their own calves and additional purchased calves (group O&P), and 2. 3 % only purchased <b>calves</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> (group P). A total number of 19, 077 calves entered the fattening units in 2013, of which 21. 7 %, 66. 7 %, and 11. 6 % belonged to groups O, O&P, and P, respectively. Mortality was 0 % in 322 herds (52. 0 %), between 0 % and 3 % in 47 herds (7. 6 %), and ≥ 3 % in 250 herds (40. 4 %). Significant risk factors for mortality were purchasing calves, herd size, higher incidence of BRD, and access to an outside pen. Metaphylaxis was used on 13. 4 % of the farms (7. 9 % only upon arrival, 4. 4 % only later in the fattening period, 1. 1 % upon arrival and later), in 3. 2 % of the herds of group O, 17. 9 % of those in group O&P, and 92. 9 % of those of group P. Application of metaphylaxis upon arrival was positively associated with purchase (OR= 8. 9) and herd size (OR= 1. 2 per 10 calves). Metaphylaxis later in the production cycle was positively associated with group size (OR= 2. 9) and risk of respiratory disease (OR= 1. 2 per 10 % higher risk) and negatively {{with the use of}} individual antimicrobial treatment (OR= 0. 3). In many countries, purchase and a large herd size are inherently connected to veal production. The Swiss situation with large commercial but also smaller herds with little or no purchase of calves made it possible to investigate the effect of these factors on mortality and antimicrobial drug use. The results of this study show that a system where small farms raise the calves from their own herds has a substantial potential to improve animal health and reduce antimicrobial drug use...|$|E

The safe use level for pigs and dairy cows is 20, for piglets 12 and for poultry 10 mg/kg complete feed. The high use level of 5 mg/kg complete feed for linalyl acetate, linalyl butyrate, linalyl formate, linalyl propionate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol, α-terpineol and terpineol acetate and 4 -terpinenol is safe for all species with a margin of safety of 1. 2 to 12. For nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol, the maximum safe concentration is 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of the following compounds: linalool, nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 6 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. All compounds should be considered as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and as skin sensitisers. All compounds of CG 6 are predicted to be safe to the soil compartment when used at levels safe to the target species. Using predictions based on chemical structure, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol were estimated to be safe to aquatic compartments. In the absence of experimental data, safety to aquatic compartments could not be established for linalyl butyrate, linalyl isobutyrate, terpineol acetate, 4 -terpinenol, linalyl formate and linalyl propionate.

In the view of the FEEDAP Panel, the use with these additional avian species will not introduce hazards not already considered. Therefore, in the current assessment, the FEEDAP Panel has considered only the efficacy data <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and turkeys reared for breeding. Based on results of three trials carried out in turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> the Panel concluded that B. subtilis PB 6 has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance parameters at the dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg feed. This conclusion can be extended to turkeys reared for breeding...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to {{complete}} its former opinion on the maximum residue limits (MRL) of Clinacox 0. 5 % (diclazuril) <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and chickens reared for laying. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the diclazuril impurity/metabolite R 070016 {{and concluded that the}} compound is devoid of genotoxic activity. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel {{is in a position to}} adopt the already proposed ADI for diclazuril (1. 7 mg diclazuril per person per day). The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety. Consequently, no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} how forage triticale in diets <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers influence the body weight and weight gain of broiler chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The survey was conducted on 400 chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> provenance Ross 308 for a period of 42 days. On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion. The mortality of the groups of chickens for the entire period of the study was the lowest in O-II-group, at 2. 0 %, and the highest mortality was found in O-III-group (6. 0 %). The production index was the highest in O-II-group (202. 726) and the lowest in O-I-group. The results achieved in this research indicate that the use of tested triticale cultivars significantly affected the weight gain and body mass of chicks and have nutritional and economic justification.

40|$|To {{throw some}} light on the subject of succulence <b>for</b> winter <b>fattening</b> of lambs, with especial {{reference}} to the use of corn silage in that capacity, a series of experiments was conducted during three winters, beginning December, 1906. These experiments were planned to indicate the principal results attending the feeding of succulent feed to fattening lambs and to furnish a comparison between the old time special crops for this purpose, and corn silage, the only succulent feed practicable for winter use on an extensive scale. The immediate objects of the work were as follows: 1. To compare a ration of grain and hay <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs with rations containing succulent feed. 2. To compare sugar beets, mangels, turnips, rutabagas, cabbage, and corn silage as sources of succulence <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs. 3. To determine whether succulent feed is essential to rapid gains, high condition, and quality of finish...|$|R

40|$|Amaferm is the {{fermentation}} {{product of}} a non-pathogenic and non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus oryzae mixed with wheat bran as carrier. It is proposed {{to be used as}} feed additive to dairy cows and cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at doses between 2 and 5 g head- 1 day- 1 in order to improve production performance. According to Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should deliver an opinion on the efficacy and the safety of the product Amaferm for the target animals, consumers, users and the environment. Amaferm {{has been shown to be}} capable of producing a positive effect on milk yield of dairy cows. However, evidence has only been provided for a dose of 3 g head- 1 day- 1 instead of the minimum recommended dose of 2 g head- 1 day- 1 claimed by the Applicant. However, only one out of four studies with cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> showed a persistent improvement of weight gain and feed conversion with Amaferm. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers the data provided to be insufficient to draw final conclusions on efficacy of Amaferm in cattle <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> kept under common production conditions...|$|R
