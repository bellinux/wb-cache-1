40|$|International audienceTopographic {{influences}} {{are examined}} in an eddy-resolving model of oceanic channel flow forced by steady zonal winds. With small explicit lateral friction, transient eddies {{generated by the}} baroclinic instability of the mean flow transfer momentum downward to the bottom layer. In the flat-bottom <b>case,</b> <b>bottom</b> friction is the only efficient sink of eastward momentum. When bottom topography is present, the topographic form stress can replace the bottom friction sink in the momentum budget, and a large decrease of the zonal transport results. Large wale topography (of {{the scale of the}} forcing) provides the largest form stress. Topographic effects decay with height as suggested by the Prandit scaling, and therefore only topographic scales larger than the Rossby radius can affect the whole water column. In that case, the interfaces are deformed by standing eddies on topographic length scales, and standing eddies replace transient eddies in transferring momentum downward. The bottom-layer mean streamfunction tends to be correlated with the topography as in inviscid solutions. Because of this, {{only a small part of}} the flow (the larger scales) contributes to the domain-averaged momentum sink. On smaller scales, the topographic form stress is anticorrelated with the Reynolds stress and has no net effect on the transport. The energy level of the transients is less affected by the topography than is the mean energy. With topography, the space scale of the transients decreases and their time scale increases, and the ratio of potential and kinetic energies is higher...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of water}} depth and bottom {{boundary}} layer turbulence upon lee-wave generation in sill regions is examined. Their effect upon vertical mixing is also considered. Calculations are performed using a non-hydrostatic model in cross-section form with a specified tidal forcing. Initial calculations in deeper {{water and a}} sill height such that the sill top is well removed from the surrounding bed region showed that downstream lee-wave generation and associated mixing increased as bottom friction coefficient k increased. This was associated {{with an increase in}} current shear across the sill. However, for a given k, increasing vertical eddy viscosity A (v) reduced vertical shear in the across sill velocity, leading to a reduction in lee-wave amplitude and associated mixing. Subsequent calculations using shallower water showed that for a given k and A (v,) lee-wave generation was reduced due to the shallower water depth and changes in the bottom boundary layer. However, in this case (unlike in the deepwater case), there is an appreciable bottom current. This gives rise to bottom mixing which in shallow water extends to mid-depth and enhances the mid-water mixing that is found on the lee side of the sill. Final calculations with deeper water but small sill height showed that lee waves could propagate over the sill, thereby reducing their contribution to mixing. In this <b>case,</b> <b>bottom</b> mixing was the major source of mixing which was mainly confined to the near bed region, with little mid-water mixin...|$|E

40|$|The {{backscattering}} {{of sound}} by inhomogeneities {{of the ocean}} sediment may provide a remarkable effect on underwater acoustic wave propagation. It may {{also be used as}} a means of remotely estimating complicated sediment properties. In this paper, a theoretical model of acoustic waves backscattered from an inhomogeneous sediment is formulated based on the Born approximation. The model not only contains the formal homogeneous <b>bottom</b> <b>case</b> but is also extended to the more realistic stratified <b>bottom</b> <b>case.</b> A complex wavenumber, in which an attenuation coefficient is introduced, reveals significant changes of the penetration depth within the sediment. The model predicts that for the stratified bottom, the backscattering strength is rapidly oscillating and decreases sharply at small grazing angles owing to the refraction of the waves caused by the sound velocity gradient. In order {{to reduce the number of}} independent variables, Biot's theory is applied to relate three-dimensional density fluctuations to sound speed fluctuations through porosity. A transverse-isotropic model is also developed to access the three-dimensional sound speed fluctuation spectrum. Geoacoustic surface and cross-hole tomographic data acquired from different sites characterizing sandy and silty bottoms are used to obtain three-dimensional sediment volume inhomogeneities. Backscattering strengths are evaluated for those <b>bottom</b> <b>cases.</b> The results agree with intuition and other published data...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether deep water formation might have occurred in subtropical latitudes in the early Cenozoic is examined through use of a global ocean model forced by mixed boundary conditions. Zonal mean surface temperatures and wind stresses are derived from an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulation of the warm Paleocene/Eocene boundary interval (~ 55 Ma) and are held constant {{for a series of}} sensitivity tests. The control case for moisture flux (evaporation minus precipitation, E-P), also derived from the AGCM, is perturbed so that the sub-tropical evaporation increases and high latitude precipitation increases. A dramatic response is seen in the temperature and salinity structure of the model ocean, but the perturbation does not result in deep convection in subtropical latitudes. In all <b>cases,</b> <b>bottom</b> water is formed in the south-ern high latitudes and the global meridional overturning is characterized by a strongly asymmetric circulation. No multiple equilibria have been found for any particular E-P configuration. In the most extreme case (5 x the control E-P), the model oscillates between meridional overturning cir-culation “on ” and “off. ” Shorter-lived thermohaline slowing and reinvigoration is observed as a transient response under less extreme E-P perturbations.
