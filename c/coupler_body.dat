40|$|A new C-band {{accelerator}} {{structure for}} the SuperKEKB injector linac is under development. This structure corresponds to an upstream half part in a tandem connection of two structures. A measure against RF breakdown is required because the upstream structure is exposed to higher RF field {{than that of the}} downstream structure. In order to suppress a RF breakdown around a coupler iris, a fat and smooth iris is adopted for the structure. The coupler dimensions such as an aperture of the iris and a diameter of the coupler cavity is first optimized by computer simulation and then decided by cold model measurements. Electric field symmetry is retained by shifting the coupler cavity from a beam centre. An amount of offset is also decided by simulations. The <b>coupler</b> <b>body</b> is made with a milling machine. A rather rough surface of the inner coupler is finished by an electro-polishing method. This structure will be installed in the beam line of the KEKB injector linac this summer...|$|E
40|$|Injection molding is a {{most common}} and {{important}} of all plastic processing process. This process is extremely versatile, and can produce very complex shaped parts, {{with the use of}} multi-sided molds. This paper deals with the design development and mold flow analysis of injection mold tool for two components of same assembly and are of different materials (i. e., manifold and <b>coupler</b> <b>body).</b> The part was analyzed with high end analysis software and accordingly the design has been carried out. The tool has been manufactured after some trials and corrections. The mould flow analysis software is being used to predict the parameters like runner location, fill time and weld lines etc before production of the tool. Any product to be manufactured invariably requires machine and tool. Tool design and development is specialized and critical area, the tool design should match the machine specification and should be accurate and economical for good product...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reverse Engineering (RE), as the {{important}} {{technology for learning}} and mastering the advanced technology, as well as shortening the period of product design and development, has already become the highlight in the manufacturing industry. But there are some inner un-measurable parts, like couplers. The inner form information of the coupler {{can not be fully}} captured without any cutting, {{which is one of the}} bottlenecks in RE. Therefore, an effective method needs to be explored for reconstructing lumen model. Taking model reconstruction of coupler lumen as a case, an assembly reverse method is proposed by analyzing the parts functions and restraint relations in coupler. The method in detail is that, firstly, all parts are assembled in the <b>coupler</b> <b>body</b> lumen, then, according to assembly relations and the enveloping space determined by movement scope of individual parts, the coupler lumen shape can be obtained. The method proposed is successfully applied in model reconstruction of heavy haul coupler, and which provides a common solution of model reconstruction for inner un-measurable parts...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the design, manufacturing, {{characterization}} {{and analysis of}} the coupling ratio spectral response for Multimode Interference (MMI) couplers in Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology. The couplers were designed using a Si rib waveguide with SiO 2 cladding, on a regular 220 nm film and 2 Î¼m buried oxide SOI wafer. A set of eight different designs, three canonical and five using a widened/narrowed <b>coupler</b> <b>body,</b> have been subject of study, with coupling ratios 50 : 50, 85 : 15 and 72 : 28 for the former, and 95 : 05, 85 : 15, 75 : 25, 65 : 35 and 55 : 45 for the latter. Two wafers of devices were fabricated, using two different etch depths for the rib waveguides. A set of six dies, three per wafer, whose line metrology matched the design, were retained for characterization. The coupling ratios obtained in the experimental results match, with little deviations, the design targets for a wavelength range between 1525 and 1575 nm, as inferred from spectral measurements and statistical analyses. Excess loss for all the devices is conservatively estimated to be less than approximately 2 dB. All the design parameters, body width and length, input/output positions and widths, and tapers dimensions are disclosed for reference...|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} three bodies connected by gaiters, the two outer bodies with short cabinets. The chassis consisted of two short-coupled frames. Each of them contained two drive axles, one leading Bissel axle and one trailing Adams axle.The frames were - as with the Be 4/7 - coupled directly by a connecting rod and two auxiliary <b>couplers.</b> The outer <b>bodies</b> were fixed to the frames, while the centre body lay on a bridging slab, which did not transfer any tractive or pressure forces. The bridging slab rested on the outer frames over a pivot, and via horizontal springs between the inner drive axles and the Adams axles.|$|R
40|$|Measured {{propagation}} {{loss for}} capacitive body-coupled communication (BCC) channel (1 [*]MHz to 60 [*]MHz) is limitedly {{available in the}} literature for distances longer than 50 [*]cm. This is either because of experimental complexity to isolate the earth-ground or design complexity in realizing a reliable communication link to assess the performance limitations of capacitive BCC channel. Therefore, an alternate efficient full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation approach is presented to realistically analyze capacitive BCC, that is, the interaction of capacitive <b>coupler,</b> the human <b>body,</b> and the environment all together. The presented simulation approach is first evaluated for numerical/human body variation uncertainties and then validated with measurement results from literature, followed by the analysis of capacitive BCC channel for twenty different scenarios. The simulation {{results show that the}} vertical coupler configuration is less susceptible to physiological variations of underlying tissues compared to the horizontal coupler configuration. The propagation loss is less for arm positions when they are not touching the torso region irrespective of the communication distance. The propagation loss has also been explained for complex scenarios formed by the ground-plane and the material structures (metals or dielectrics) with the human body. The estimated propagation loss has been used to investigate the link-budget requirement for designing capacitive BCC system in CMOS sub-micron technologies. VINNOV...|$|R
