5|$|Developing and {{promoting}} his parachute had left Calthrop drained, both financially and physically. Failing health {{forced him to}} resign his position as <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> for the Barsi Railway in 1925, although he remained a director.

5|$|In most of Brassey's {{contracts}} {{he worked}} in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning {{of the details of}} the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> and below him another engineer {{who was in charge of}} the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.|$|E

5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
5|$|Gresley's initial Pacific {{project of}} 1915 was for an {{elongated}} {{version of the}} Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders. Finally realising {{that he was in}} a design impasse, he took as a model the new American Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914. This in turn had been updated from a series of prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole, Alco's Chief <b>Consulting</b> <b>Engineer</b> at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania's K29 Alco prototype of 1911, also designed by Cole. Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up-to-date locomotive.|$|E
5|$|HNTB, of Kansas City, Missouri, was the {{designer}} and <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> {{for both the}} new bridge {{as well as the}} original Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. The federal government provided $110 million to begin building {{the main part of the}} bridge consisting long spans supported by cables. The main superstructure construction began in December 2001. Massman Construction Company in a joint venture with Traylor Brothers, Inc. received the contract to construct two large piers in the river; these were built using both floating caissons and open caisson construction. The construction on the last main span section of the bridge was finished in April 2006.|$|E

5|$|John Kadlec, a <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> on the {{original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E
5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from <b>Consulting</b> <b>Engineer</b> Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to {{practise}} as a <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> at 141 Pitt Street, {{gaining a}} reputation for versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe {{set up a new}} office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed William Dixson as an engineer, who would later make a major donation of Australiana to the State Library of New South Wales. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land {{surveyor}} John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as resident engineer on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway {{when it opened in}} 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a <b>consulting</b> <b>engineer</b> in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He {{became a member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Boadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.|$|E
