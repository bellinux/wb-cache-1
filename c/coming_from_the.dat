5|$|Aarhus has {{the highest}} ratio of {{immigrants}} in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, when Earl Páll herd of Earl Rögnvaldr's {{arrival in}} Shetland, he held council {{and decided to}} {{immediately}} gather forces and attack Earl Rögnvaldr before he could be reinforced by the incoming men he knew were <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Suðreyjar. That night Earl Páll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships—this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to Rousay, where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further strengthened by arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl Rögnvaldr, about ten or twelve ships were spotted <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pentland Firth. Earl Páll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frakökk and Ölvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Ölvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl Páll was further strengthened by a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E

Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gay community.|$|E
5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} gas {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007.

A decreasing supply is <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field {{off the coast of}} County Mayo has yet to come on-line.

Large numbers of Cameroonians live as subsistence farmers, however. Since 1982 Paul Biya has been President, governing with his Cameroon People's Democratic Movement party. The country has experienced tensions <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> English-speaking territories.

5|$|Clydesdale (or Strathclyde) was {{the heartland}} of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde; by Donnchadh's day the Scots had settled many English and Continental Europeans (principally Flemings) in the region, and {{administered}} it through the sheriffdom of Lanark. Gaelic too had penetrated much of the old Northumbrian and Strathclyde territory, <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west, south-west and the north, a situation that led historian Alex Woolf to compare the region to the Balkans. The British language of the area, {{as a result of}} such developments, was probably either dead or almost dead, perhaps surviving only in the uplands of Clydesdale, Tweeddale and Annandale.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
