30|$|The peer-tree {{indexing}} structure {{can serve}} as a guideline for forwarding location updates and queries. When a target host represents a host whose location is under query or is being updated, a location query or update is always forwarded to the <b>closer</b> <b>friends</b> of the target host. A <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> of the target host should qualify two conditions. First, the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> is one of the neighbors surrounding the host which currently holds a location update or query. Second, the identifier of the <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> must share the longest suffix with the identifier of the target host. The selection of a <b>closer</b> <b>friend</b> can be imagined as searching in the peer-tree. The search starts at the root and moves toward the leaf node representing the identifier of the target host. The height of a peer-tree represents the maximum number of times that a location update or query can be forwarded.|$|R

25|$|Understanding {{consumer}} {{personality and}} how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of {{the harmful effects of}} binge drinking. People who valued <b>close</b> <b>friends</b> as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a <b>close</b> <b>friend.</b> People who were loners or who did not see <b>close</b> <b>friends</b> important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s <b>close</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|R

5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member.

During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E
5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's <b>closest</b> <b>friend</b> and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E
5|$|Anne, however, {{expected}} {{kindness and}} compassion from her <b>closest</b> <b>friend.</b> Sarah was not forthcoming {{in this regard}} and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, be admitted into the Privy Council. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw {{as a threat to}} her royal prerogative. Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to Lord Godolphin that she did not think she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.|$|E

40|$|Accuracy at reading nonverbal cues to {{emotions}} {{was examined}} for <b>close</b> <b>friends,</b> less <b>close</b> <b>friends,</b> and strangers. Forty-eight senders were videotaped {{talking about an}} experience during which they felt either very happy, very sad, or very angry. Half {{of the time they}} expressed their emotion clearly, and half of the time they concealed their emotion. Forty-eight judges watched these tapes without sound and attempted to identify the senders emotions. Each judge watched a videotape of both a platonic friend and a stranger. Overall, friends were more accurate than strangers at identifying the senders emotions, however, less <b>close</b> <b>friends</b> were better than <b>closer</b> <b>friends</b> at correctly judging concealed sadness and anger. In discussing these findings, we consider models of motivated inaccuracy, accommodatingness, and emotions as calls to action...|$|R
