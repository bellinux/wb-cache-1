40|$|The full {{complement}} of genes encoded by Orf virus (ORFV) is not yet known. A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA isolated 5 h post-infection from cells infected with ORFV in vitro and grown {{in the presence of}} cytosine arabinoside. Using 12 non-overlapping probes representing the entire genome of the Orf- 11 strain of the virus, cDNA clones representing individual genes expressed early in infection were isolated. Thirty-eight early genes were identified, either via isolation of their cDNA from the library or via Northern blotting. Twenty-nine of the isolated cDNAs represented orthologues of other poxvirus genes or had been identified previously as genes of ORFV, whilst seven appeared unrelated to any known poxvirus gene or indeed to any known gene in the DNA databases.

Previous studies have demonstrated the activity of (S) - 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]cytosine (HPMPC; cidofovir; Vistide) against orf virus in cell culture and humans. We have evaluated a broad range of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) against several orf virus strains in primary lamb keratinocytes (PLKs) and human embryonic lung (HEL) monolayers. HPMPC, (S) - 9 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]- 2, 6 - diaminopurine (HPMPDAP), and (R) - 9 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propoxy]- 2, 4 -diaminopyrimidine (HPMPO-DAPy) were three of the most active compounds that were subsequently tested in a virus yield assay with PLK and HEL cells by virus titration and DNA quantification. HPMPC, HPMPDAP, and HPMPO-DAPy were evaluated for their activities against orf virus replication in organotypic epithelial raft cultures from differentiated PLK cells. At the highest concentrations (50 and 20 microg/ml), full protection was provided by the three drugs, while at 5 microg/ml, only HPMPDAP and HPMPC offered partial protection. The activities of the three compounds in the raft culture system were confirmed by quantification of infectious virus and viral DNA. These findings provide a rationale for the use of HPMPC and other ANPs in the treatment of orf (contagious ecthyma) in humans and animals. status: publishe...|$|R

In the ovine/caprine host it causes <b>contagious</b> ecthyma (<b>contagious</b> <b>pustular</b> dermatitis, scabby mouth), but in humans it normally causes solitary or clustered orf lesions, typically on hands, arms or face. In addition to disease in the animals, the virus can be quite a nuisance as an occupational hazard in farmers and butchers. Clinical diagnosis is often possible, but laboratory diagnosis is sometimes necessary. For virus isolation, primary ovine or bovine cells, not routinely present, are needed. Serological methods exist, but electron microscopy is the most commonly used method. OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of orf zoonoses, without virus culture and without access to an electron microscope. STUDY DESIGN: A suitable primer pair was designed for orf polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the Oligo software and sequence information from GenBank. Orf positive controls and specimens were kindly provided by several public health centers. Molluscum contagiosum specimens were provided by a dermatologist. HSV- 1, HSV- 2 and VZV positive swab specimens came from our routine diagnostic service. Asymptomatic skin specimens were obtained from sheep heads from the abattoir, and swab specimens from the heads of asymptomatic sheep. Selected amplified orf PCR positive specimens were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the PCR products. Orf positive specimens were sent to another laboratory for electron microscopy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A robust PCR was developed, with very small inter-run variation. All specificity demands were met, and the sensitivity seems to be good or excellent. All negative specificity controls from cell cultures and non-orf viruses were negative. Twenty-two (95. 7 %) of 23 scab or swab specimens with suspected orf etiology were orf PCR positive. Five of eight skin specimens from sheep heads from the abattoir were positive, and all 11 swab specimens from asymptomatic sheep were negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated orf-like particles in orf-PCR positive specimens. This PCR seems to be suitable as a diagnostic test for orf in humans, but asymptomatic virus shedding in sheep or goats may complicate veterinary applications of the assay...|$|R
40|$|Parapoxviruses (PPVs) are {{zoonotic}} viruses {{which cause}} <b>contagious</b> <b>pustular</b> skin infections of sheep, goats and cattle worldwide. In addition, {{they have more}} recently been shown to infect other animals such as red deer, seals, camels and reindeer. Cases of <b>contagious</b> <b>pustular</b> stomatitis in Finnish reindeer have been reported for many years. This economically important disease occurs typically during winter and {{is more common in}} the southern parts of the reindeer herding districts than in the north. The first severe outbreak occurred in the winter 1992 - 1993, and during the winter of 1999 - 2000 and in the late winter 2007 outbreaks of the disease were again observed. Usual symptoms include diminished appetite, drooling, fever, and later erosions and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. The aims of this study were to establish specific and rapid detection methods for the causative agent of the disease and characterize the viruses circulating in Finland. The causative agent of reindeer pustular stomatitis was originally considered to be Orf virus (ORFV) of the genus Parapoxvirus. PCR methods amplifying different regions of the PPV genomes were developed to analyse clinical samples obtained from outbreaks of the disease in reindeer and later from viruses isolated from the disease of sheep and cattle in Finland. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the Finnish PPVs, known members of the genus Parapoxvirus and selected members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae were conducted to identify the virus species isolated from reindeer. The results showed that the reindeer PPV from 1999 - 2000 is most closely related to the cattle PPV Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) whereas the PPV strains from the winter of 1992 - 1993 outbreak grouped with sheep ORFV strains. Reindeer samples from the 2007 outbreak were identified as both PCPV and ORFV. Analysis of the similarity between genes of reindeer PCPV and ORFV isolates, Finnish sheep ORFV and cattle PCPV isolates indicated that these viruses have been circulating among Finnish reindeer, cattle and sheep at least ten years. Since the initial classification of the viruses causing pustular stomatitis in Finnish reindeer relied solely on the partial sequence analysis of virion core- and EEV envelope phospholipase protein sequences, the genome of PCPV-like reindeer isolate (F 00. 120 R) was sequenced by shotgun sequencing of plasmid sublibraries of cosmids covering the central region of the genome, and by sequencing transposon random insertion libraries of plasmids derived from each end of the genome. The F 00. 120 R and the genomic sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR 634) were annotated and analyzed in this study. This first characterization of PCPV genomes revealed that F 00. 120 R and VR 634 are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively. The organization of their genomes was found to be similar to that of other PPVs and both included 88 predicted genes that are conserved across all sequenced poxviruses. F 00. 120 R was found to have four, possibly fragmented, genes at the left terminus and another near the central region of the genome that are not present in ORFV or Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV; another PPV) genomes. In addition, the F 00. 120 R genome was found to lack six genes seen near the right genome terminus of other PPVs. Comparing the PPV proteomes and whole genome phylogenetic analyses confirmed the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the PPV genus and verified that the virus causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer in 1999 - 2000 can be classified as PCPV. The observed six gene deletion at the right terminus of the F 00. 120 R genome was further investigated in an attempt to use it in differentiating PCPV and ORFV causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer. The preliminary PCR analyses of wild type virus and early passages of F 00. 120 R implied that the deletion of genes may have arisen during cell culture of the virus. The sequence around the deleted region was determined by sequencing two cloned overlapping PCR fragments from F 00. 120 R wt virus isolated from lesion material. The same region was sequenced from an Italian PCPV field isolate (It 1303). Further PCR analyses together with sequence determination showed that a 5431 bp sequence containing genes 116 - 121 was likely to have been deleted from the F 00. 120 R genome prior to the 7 th passage in cell culture. In addition, genes 116 - 121 were present in It 1303 and in other isolates of reindeer and bovine PCPV isolated in Finland during the years 2005 - 2010. These results indicate that the genome of reindeer PCPV is about 140 kbp in length and has 137 genes instead of previously estimated length of 135 kbp and 131 genes; it contains homologues of all known ORFV genes and this analysis further reinforces the close genetic relationship between PCPV and ORFV...|$|R
