40|$|Objective—Effects on {{platelet}} aggregation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from damaged cells and from platelets undergoing exocytosis {{have not been}} clearly established. In this study {{we report on the}} effects of ATP on {{platelet aggregation}} in whole blood. Methods and Results—Aggregation, measured using a platelet-counting technique, occurred in response to ATP and was maximal at 10 to 100 mol/L. It was abolished by MRS 2179, AR-C 69931, and <b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase,</b> implying that conversion to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is required. ATP did not induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma, but aggregation did occur when apyrase or hexokinase was added. Aggregation also occurred after addition of leukocytes to platelet-rich plasma (as a source of ecto-ATPase), and this was potentiated on removal of adenosine by adenosine deaminase, indicating that adenosine production modulates the response. Dipyridamole, which inhibits adenosine uptake into erythrocytes, inhibited aggregation induced by ATP in whole blood, and adenosine deaminase reversed this. DN 9693 and forskolin synergized with dipyridamole to inhibit ATP-induced aggregation. Conclusions—ATP induces aggregation in whole blood via conversion of ATP to ADP by ecto-ATPases on leukocytes. This is inhibited by agents that prevent adenosine removal. Reduced aggregation at high concentrations of ATP (100 mol/L) may be a consequence of inhibition by ATP of ADP action at ADP receptors.

We previously demonstrated that like IgG, appropriately purified CRP could be thermally modified (H-CRP) such that it enhanced platelet activation in plasma and initiated platelet responses in isolated systems.

Complexes formed between CRP and one major ligand, the polycation, were found to share certain platelet activating properties with H-CRP, as does latex-aggregated CRP.

In washed human platelets prelabelled with [14 C] 5 HT and quin 2, OAG (10 – 50 μgml) induced no significant aggregation, [14 C] 5 HT secretion or rise in [Ca 2 +]i {{in the presence}} or absence of fibrinogen. However, addition of OAG (10 – 50 μgml) 10 s to 5 min before or 10 – 60 s after addition of threshold concentrations of thrombin (< 0. 03 Uml) resulted in a significant potentiation of aggregation and [14 C] 5 HT secretion without any effect on the thrombin-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i. Both EGTA, which abolished the latter and <b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase,</b> the ADP scavenger, totally inhibited the aggregation but only partially reduced [14 C] 5 HT secretion in response to thrombin plus OAG. At higher concentrations of thrombin, neither the rise in [Ca 2 +]i nor the extent of [14 C] 5 HT secretion was significantly altered by OAG addition.

The aggregometry of ATP-induced aggregation and the ultrastructure of ATP-aggregated platelets were compared and contrasted {{with those of}} adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -treated and collagen-treated samples. Human platelets were also studied alongside with rat specimens. Several lines of evidence indicate that the ATP-induced aggregation of rat platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is not a result of contaminating ADP in the ATP preparation. ATP did not cause aggregation of human platelets; it inhibited ADP- and collagen-induced human platelet aggregation. ATP pretreated with a <b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase</b> system caused similar rat platelet aggregation as did ATP not treated with this system. The aggregometry of ATP-induced aggregation of rat PRP {{was similar to that}} of collagen-induced aggregation but markedly different from that of ADP-induced aggregation.

Both ATP- and ADP-induced rat platelet aggregations were not affected by adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, or acetylsalicylic acid. The ultrastructure of ATP-aggregated platelets was similar to that of ADP-aggregated ones.

40|$|A potent {{platelet}} aggregation inducer, aggretin, was purified from Malayan-pit-viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom by ionic-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration chromatography and HPLC. It is a heterodimeric protein (29 kDa) devoid of esterase, phospholipase A and thrombin-like activity. Aggretin (> 5 nM) elicited {{platelet aggregation}} with a lag period in both human platelet-rich plasma and washed platelet suspension. EDTA (5 mM), prostaglandin E 1 (1 microM) and 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzoic acid 8 -(diethylamino) octyl ester ('TMB- 8 '; 100 microM) abolished its aggregating activity, indicating that exogenous bivalent cations and intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization {{are essential for}} aggretin-induced platelet aggregation. Neomycin (4 mM) and mepacrine (50 microM) completely inhibited aggretin (33 nM) -induced aggregation; however, <b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase</b> (5 mM, 5 units/ml) and indomethacin (50 microM) did not significantly affect its aggregating activity. Aggretin caused a significant increase of [3 H]InsP formation in [3 H]Ins-loaded platelets, intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization and thromboxane B 2 formation. Neomycin, a phospholipase C inhibitor, completely inhibited both the increase of [3 H]InsP and intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization of platelets stimulated by aggretin.

Cells dialyzed with K+ and 2 - 10 mM EGTA exhibited Ca action potentials that were reversibly decreased in duration and amplitude by NE. Ca channel currents were isolated from other channel contributions by using: (a) tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block gNa, (b) internal K channel impermeant ions (Cs or Na/N- methylglucamine mixtures) as K substitutes, (c) external tetraethylammonium (TEA) to block K channels, (d) internal EGTA to reduce possible current contribution from Ca-activated channels. A marked decline (rundown) of Ca conductance was observed during continual dialysis, which obscured reversible NE effects. The addition of 2 - 5 mM MgATP to the intracellular solutions greatly retarded Ca channel rundown and permitted a clear assessment of modulatory drug effects. The inclusion of an intracellular <b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase</b> nucleotide regeneration system further stabilized Ca channels, which permitted recording of Ca currents for up to 3 h. NE reversibly decreased both steady state Ca currents and Ca tail currents in Cs/EGTA/MgATP-dialyzed cells.

Cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP added to the intracellular solutions at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than the Kd for activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases did not block or mask {{the expression of the}} NE-mediated decrease in gCa.

The chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMet-Leu-Phe) induced a rapid elevation of cytosolic free calcium in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils {{but failed to}} increase the cytosolic calcium in platelets. On the other hand, when unloaded neutrophils were incubated together with autologous fura- 2 -loaded platelets, fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated a 6 -fold increase in platelet cytosolic calcium subsequent to a brief lag. Parallel experiments demonstrated that the addition of fMet-Leu-Phe to neutrophil/platelet incubates also elicited platelet aggregation and serotonin release. Platelet activation showed a positive correlation with the concentration of fMet-Leu-Phe added to the mixed cell population. Cell-free supernatants prepared from fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophils were capable of inducing platelet calcium mobilization, aggregation, and secretion. The amount of platelet-activating material present in the supernatant was proportional {{to the number of}} activated neutrophils. Preincubation of platelets with BN 52021, acetylsalicylic acid, SQ- 29, 548, or hirudin did not modify the aggregation response induced by the supernatant collected from fMet-Leu-Phe-activated neutrophils, suggesting that the material was not 1 -alkyl- 2 -acetyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (paf-acether), arachidonic acid, thromboxane A 2, or thrombin. Pretreatment of the neutrophil supernatant with an ADP (<b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase)</b> or a superoxide/peroxide (superoxide dismutase/catalase) scavenging system also had no effect on aggregation or secretion, indicating that these substances did not participate in platelet activation. The biological activity present in the neutrophil supernatant was destroyed by heat and inactivated by treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that it is a protein and most probably an enzyme with serine protease activity.

40|$|A {{rotational}} viscometer {{was modified}} to permit continuous measurement of platelet aggregation, dense granule release and intracellular calcium ion concentration during exposure to uniform shear stress {{in either the}} presence or absence of added chemical agonists. The shear stress intensity applied to a platelet suspension influences both the concentration of single, unaggregated platelets and the population volume distribution of formed aggregates in samples with and without added ADP. Direct evidence supports the postulate that large platelet aggregates formed in response to chemical and/or mechanical stimulus can dissociate into smaller particles upon additional shear stress exposure. The rate of platelet dense granule release is approximately a constant function of applied shear stress intensity in the absence of added chemical agonists. Addition of 0. 2 or 2. 0 μM ADP accelerates the rate of dense granule release in a concentration dependent way which is also potentiated by increased shear stress intensity. Application of shear stress alone results in bulk phase concentrations of ADP which are insufficient to induce aggregation in a stirred platelet suspension. Platelet ADP surface concentrations estimated from the continuously measured luminescence response indicate that application of shear stress alone results in local ADP concentrations which are sufficient to cause platelet aggregation which is consistent in rate and extent with that observed in response to ADP added to a stirred platelet sample. Increased intracellular calcium ion concentration ((Ca 2 +) i) is correlated with the formation of irreversible platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation which occurs in response to 0. 2 μM added ADP and/or low intensity shear stress is reversible and not accompanied by a rise in (Ca 2 +) i. Inhibitors of ADP induced platelet activation (<b>creatine</b> phosphate/creatine <b>phosphokinase,</b> apyrase, 5 '-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine) were effective in reducing, but not abolishing, shear stress induced aggregation.

This finding is consistent with the proposed role of AMP and the adenylate kinase reaction in the regulation of glycolysis. However, in the flight muscle of the honey-bee the ATP/AMP ratio is very low, so that glycolysis may be regulated by factors other than the variation in AMP concentration. The variation in the contents of arginine phosphate in muscle from the invertebrates is much larger than the variation in creatine phosphate in muscle from the vertebrates. The contents of hexose monophosphates and pyruvate are, in general, higher in the muscles of vertebrates than in those of the invertebrates. The contents of phosphoenolpyruvate are similar in all the muscles investigated, except for the honey-bee in which it is about 4 - 10 -fold higher. The mass-action ratios for the reactions catalysed by phosphoglucoisomerase and adenylate kinase are very similar to the equilibrium constants for these reactions.
