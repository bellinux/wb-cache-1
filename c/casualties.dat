5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy <b>casualties.</b> The Polish <b>casualties</b> {{were particularly}} severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and armored vehicles (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 <b>casualties</b> (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish <b>casualties</b> as up to 25,000.

5|$|The Japanese {{force at}} Arawe {{suffered}} much heavier <b>casualties</b> than the Allies.

Many authors have referred to as many as 28,000 Confederate <b>casualties,</b> and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg, documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing).

Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000–10,000 were killed. Horne writes that the Austro-Hungarians had 8,000 soldiers killed and 30,000 wounded in the battle, compounded by the loss of 46 cannons, 30 machine guns and 140 ammunition wagons.

50|$|In the {{technique}} taught by BSAC, the rescuer faces the <b>casualty</b> {{and uses the}} <b>casualty's</b> buoyancy compensator to provide buoyancy for both divers as the rescuer makes a controlled ascent.

5|$|By this time, the US 1st Cavalry Division {{suffered}} 770 killed, 2,613 wounded, 62 captured {{during its}} time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 600 <b>casualties,</b> with around 200 {{killed in action}} it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its <b>casualties.</b> South Korean <b>casualties</b> at the battle were difficult to predict, but also thought to be heavy. The ROK 1st Division had numbered 10,482 men September 1.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>casualty</b> is {{not capable}} of making an ascent, due to injury or unconsciousness, or the <b>casualty</b> cannot make a safe and {{controlled}} ascent, perhaps due to the loss or damage of the diving mask, the rescuer must control the <b>casualty's</b> ascent.

As the <b>casualty</b> is totally dependent on the rescuer, it is important if the two were to separate underwater the <b>casualty</b> should continue to ascend to the surface in a failsafe way.|$|R
