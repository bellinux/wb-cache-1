2500|$|On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada {{announced}} {{it would no longer}} <b>accept</b> American Express <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> [...] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> at its Canadian locations beginning January 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other {{attempts}} at creating a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> to rival MasterCard and Visa, such as Citibank's Choice card, the Discover Card gained a large national consumer base. It carried no annual fee, which was uncommon at the time, {{and offered a}} typically higher credit limit than similar cards. Cardholders could also earn a [...] "Cashback Bonus," [...] in which {{a percentage of the}} amount spent would be refunded to the account (from 1% to 5%), depending on how much the card was used. A 1989 study found that the Discover card had strong consumer adoption in the U.S.; the number of households with Discover cards increased by 2.1 million, or 14 percent, in 1989. The Discover Card was also noteworthy for being the only <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> by the U.S. Customs Service to pay customs duty, effective Feb. 19, 1987. Due to its not charging a percentage fee to retailers, unlike Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, Discover Card was also the only <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> at Sam's Club; the retailer has since started to accept MasterCard, and American Express (see below).|$|R

2500|$|These {{attempts}} by American Express to associate {{itself with the}} Olympics resulted in retaliatory advertising from Visa. In a continuation of an ongoing campaign promoting its exclusivity at certain venues and events, Visa ran advertising promoting that because of its sponsorship deal, {{it was the only}} <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>accepted</b> at Olympic venues and for purchasing tickets ("The Olympics don't take American Express"). American Express felt that Visa's advertisements were misleading, citing viewers who interpreted the ads as to believe that no other <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> were <b>accepted</b> anywhere in the host city during the Olympics (such as at shops and restaurants), rather than applying only for Olympic ticket sales and at venues. Prior to the 1992 Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics, American Express aired advertisements acknowledging these facts, explained with the tagline [...] "You'll need a passport, but you don't need a Visa." [...] Prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, the company also promoted a partnership with Iberia and Turespana that made American Express the [...] "official <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> of tourism in Spain" [...] (a campaign which factored the Olympics, as well as a world's fair occurring in the same year).|$|R

2500|$|A <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> issuing company, {{such as a}} bank {{or credit}} union, enters into {{agreements}} with merchants for them to <b>accept</b> their <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Merchants often advertise which <b>cards</b> they <b>accept</b> by displaying acceptance marks – generally derived from logos – or this may be communicated in signage in the establishment or in company material (e.g., a restaurant's menu may indicate which <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> are <b>accepted).</b> Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in [...] "We take (brands X, Y, and Z)" [...] or [...] "We don't take credit cards".|$|R
