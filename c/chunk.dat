5|$|In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 {{percent of}} the rock is {{interbedded}} sedimentary rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch <b>Chunk</b> Formation, and the Pocono Formation. These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed's upper reaches. The Mauch <b>Chunk</b> Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge. The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there, in addition to underlying the floodplain in the watershed. A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined.|$|E

30|$|Existing <b>chunked</b> {{codes are}} in two categories: {{overlapped}} <b>chunked</b> codes and coded <b>chunked</b> codes. In overlapped <b>chunked</b> codes, the <b>chunks</b> are subsets of the input packets with possibly non-empty intersections. The first several designs of <b>chunked</b> codes all belong to this category. However, the existing designs of overlapped <b>chunks</b> are mostly based on heuristics, and no rigorous performance analysis {{is available for}} the existing designs [10 – 12]. In coded <b>chunked</b> codes, <b>chunks</b> are generated by combining multiple input packets. By generalizing fountain codes and LDPC codes, nearly throughput optimal <b>chunked</b> codes have been designed, including BATS code [13, 14], Gamma code [15, 16], and L-chunked (LC) code [17]. Overlapped <b>chunks</b> {{can be viewed as}} a degraded class of coded <b>chunks</b> where <b>chunks</b> are generated using certain repetition codes.|$|R

40|$|The <b>chunking</b> {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} during the repeated exposure of stimulus material, information is organized into increasingly larger <b>chunks.</b> Many researchers have not considered the full power of the <b>chunking</b> hypothesis as both a learning mechanism and as an explanation of human behavior.

This paper illustrates the <b>chunking</b> hypothesis in the domain of nonword repetition, a task that is a strong predictor of a child’s language learning. A computer simulation of nonword repetition that instantiates the <b>chunking</b> mechanism shows that: (1) <b>chunking</b> causes task behavior to improve over time, consistent with children’s performance; and (2) <b>chunking</b> causes perceived changes in areas such as short-term memory capacity and processing speed that are often cited as mechanisms of child development. Researchers should be cautious when considering explanations of developmental data, since <b>chunking</b> may be able to explain differences in performance without the need for additional mechanisms of development...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} a novel multithreaded variable size <b>chunking</b> method, MUCH, which exploits the multicore architecture of the modern microprocessors. The legacy single threaded variable size <b>chunking</b> method leaves much to be desired in terms of effectively exploiting the bandwidth {{of the state of}} the art storage devices. MUCH guarantees <b>chunking</b> invariability: The result of <b>chunking</b> does not change regardless of the degree of multithreading or the segment size. This is achieved by inter and intra-segment coalescing at the master thread and Dual Mode <b>Chunking</b> at the client thread. We developed an elaborate performance model to determine the optimal multithreading degree and the segment size. MUCH is implemented in the prototype deduplication system. By fully exploiting the available CPU cores (quad-core), we achieved up to x 4 increase in the <b>chunking</b> performance (MByte/sec).
