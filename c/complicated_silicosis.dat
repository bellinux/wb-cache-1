40|$|Twenty-six coal miners, without {{associated}} functional chronic obstructive {{lung disease}} (COLD), assessed by normal airway resistance, {{were divided into}} 3 groups: (1) Group C, normal X-ray; (2) Group S 1, micronodular silicosis; and (3) Group S 2, <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis.</b> All subjects were evaluated while at rest and during exercise. Significant lung volume reduction was observed in the S 2 Group only. Blood gases, pulmonary pressure, and cardiac output {{were found to be}} within the normal range for all 3 groups when at rest. The pulmonary pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were higher, however, for the S 1 and S 2 Groups when compared to the C Group. During exercise, pulmonary hypertension was observed in 50 % of the patients with <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis.</b> When all data (N = 26) were included, the high values for pulmonary pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance correlated well with the loss in vital capacity (VC) and the decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1. 0). From the initial 26 patients, 19 were {{selected on the basis of}} their normal airway resistance and FEV 1. 0 /VC ratio. This selection did not alter the differences noted for the pulmonary pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance, which previously existed between the groups, even though the correlations were not statistically significant. We conclude that silicosis without associated COLD leads to minimal hemodynamic impairment at rest and during exercise, and that airway resistance does not detect impairment of flow as effectively as FEV 1. 0 reduction. The increased pulmonary vascular resistance observed, especially in <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis,</b> may be best explained by the loss of lung parenchyma and possible impairment of small airways.

40|$|AbstractSilicosis is {{a disease}} caused by {{inhalation}} and deposition of crystalline silica that produces a fibrous tissue reaction. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a noninvasive technique that allows identifying particles, thus characterizing exposure to mineral dust. The aim of this work was to study bronchoalveolar lavage as a mean of estimating the amount of alveolar particles in different forms of silicosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage {{was carried out in}} 27 silicotic pacients with simple (n= 12), complicated (n= 13), and acute (n= 2) forms of the disease and 7 healthy individuals as a control group. Macrophages were scored enumerating the percentage of cells with particles by polarizing light microscopy. Silicotic patients showed a marked increase in BAL cell particles compared to control population, however, relating simple to <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis,</b> no significant difference was observed. In acute silicotic patients with massive silica dust exposure, more than 70 % of BAL alveolar macrophages contained dust particles. When duration of exposure and retirement from work were evaluated, an inverse correlation between duration of exposure and the amount of alveolar dust, and a tendency to a smaller involvement on macrophages with the greater period of retirement from work were observed. These results suggest that particle analysis in BAL may be important in order to establish the nature and intensity of exposure. Rev Port Pneumol 2005; XI (5) : 457 - 47...|$|E
40|$|Background: Agate {{is a hard}} silica stone with {{bands of}} various colors, which is used in jewelry. The agate {{grinding}} workers are exposed to silica dust. Objective: To determine the prevalence of respiratory diseases in agate grinding workers and the associated factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 170 agate grinding workers from Mashhad, northeastern Iran, were examined. Medical and occupational history for respiratory illnesses was taken using respiratory questionnaire of the national program of silicosis control, lung examination, spirometry and chest radiography. Chest x-rays were interpreted according to the International Labor Office (ILO) classification system, 2000. Results: The mean±SD of age and work duration {{of the participants were}} 31. 2 ± 10. 1 and 13 ± 8. 2 years, respectively. The prevalence of silicosis among agate workers was 12. 9 % (95 % CI: 7. 9 %– 18. 0 %); 18 workers had simple and 4 had <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis.</b> There was a significant (p< 0. 05) relationship between contracting silicosis and exposure duration. 20 (11. 7 %) workers had symptoms consistent with chronic bronchitis and 8 (4. 7 %) showed asthma and asthma-like symptoms. The most frequent disorder observed in spirometry was the restrictive pattern (n= 43, 30 %). In the agate grinders, clinical and spirometry findings did not match with radiological findings. Conclusion: Agate grinding workers are at increased risk for respiratory diseases, specifically for silicosis and chronic bronchitis. The disease is related to silica dust exposure, poor ventilation and inappropriate personal protection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A 76 -year-old male {{died of lung}} cancer. At first, he was {{diagnosed}} as a silicosis, because he had worked for 30 years as a caster in shipyard and large opacities detected by chest x-ray and CT scanning. After the operation of lung cancer, numerous asbestos bodies were observed in the operated lung tissues. The detailed occupational inquiry revealed his asbestos use as a caster in shipyard. Early stage of asbestosis was suspected by chest CT scanning, but not definitely diagnosed in premortal examinations. Asbestosis, pleural plaques, silicosis and large cell carcinoma of the lung were histopathologically confirmed at the autopsy. A patient with asbestos-induced lung cancer <b>complicated</b> by <b>silicosis</b> was rarely published in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A 69 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to hospital 4 times from November 2007 to June 2009. The patient had <b>silicosis</b> <b>complicated</b> by broncholithiasis, esophagobronchial fistula, and relapsed tuberculosis. She {{had worked as a}} stone crusher for 3 years and was exposed to a large amount of quartz dust. Barium esophagography, gastroesophageal endoscopy, and biopsy suggested esophageal-related chronic inflammation and ulcer, which probably caused the repeated esophagobronchial fistulas observed. Bronchoscopy revealed a free broncholithiasis in the left main bronchus. The patient was readmitted a fourth time, for the relapse of silicotuberculosis. After 9 months of antituberculous therapy, she was doing well until the recent last follow-up visit...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} predicting radiological progression in silicosis in a prospective cohort study of patients with silicosis who were previously exposed to silica from granite dust.  METHODS—From among a total of 260  patients with silicosis contracted from granite work, 141  with available serial chest x ray films of acceptable quality taken {{over a period of}} 2  to 17  (mean 7. 5) years, were selected for study. Ninety four (66. 7 %) had ended exposure 5  or more years perviously (mean 10. 1  years, maximum 28  years). Radiological progression was assessed by paired comparison of the initial and most recent radiographs, with two or more steps of increase in profusion of small opacities according to the 12  point scale of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification of radiographs of pneumoconiosis, taken from the majority reading by a panel of three independent readers.  RESULTS—Overall, 37 % of patients with silicosis had radiological evidence of progression. From the initial radiographs, 24  (31. 6 %) of those with radiological profusion category 1,  15  (37. 5 %) of those with radiological profusion category 2, and 13  (52 %) of those with <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis</b> (including all seven with category 3  profusion of small opacities) showed radiological progression. As expected, progression was more likely to be found after longer periods of follow up (the interval between the two chest x ray films) with a 20 % increased odds of progression for every additional year of follow up. After adjustment for varying intervals of follow up, the probability of radiological progression was found to be significant if large opacities were present in the initial chest x ray film. Progression was also less likely to be found among those who had ended exposure to silica longer ago, although the result was of borderline significance (p= 0. 07). Tuberculosis was also associated with increased likelihood of progression (borderline significance).  CONCLUSIONS—There is a high probability of radiological progression in silicosis after high levels of exposure to granite dust among workers who were followed up for up to 17  years. A significant risk factor is the extent of radiological opacities in the initial chest x ray film. The probability of progression is also likely to be reduced with longer periods after the end of exposure.    Keywords: silicosis; radiological progression; granite quarr...|$|E
40|$|The {{two major}} lung {{diseases}} of miners are "blacklung" and silicosis. Blacklung, or pneumoconiosis, was first {{recognized as a}} disease of British coal miners in the 1600 s. However, investigations into the cause of blacklung disease did not begin until the 1900 s. The causative agent of pneumoconiosis in coal miners {{was thought to be}} silica until studies in the United Kingdom provided evidence that expo- sure to coal dust containing minimal silica could also cause pneumoconiosis. In the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP) was defined as "a chronic dust disease of the lung arising out of employment in an underground coal mine. " Diagnosis of CWP is generally based on chest x-ray findings and a patient's history of working in coal mines, usually for 10 or more years. In its early stages, CWP is called "simple CWP. " Miners with simple CWP are at increased risk of developing an advanced stage of the disease, called "progressive massive fibrosis" pMF) or "complicated CWP. " PMF (complicated CWP) is associated with significant decreases in lung function and oxygen- diffusing capacity. PMF is also associated with breathlessness, chronic bronchitis, recurrent chest illness, and episodes of heart failure. Coal miners with silicotic lesions or PMF have an increased risk of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. PMF may progress {{even in the absence of}} further dust exposure. This disease is also associated with increased mortality (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] 1995). The most recent study to determine the prevalence of CWP in coal workers was in the mid- 1990 s. The average prevalence of CWP was 2. 8 %, but for those with 30 or more years in the industry it was 14 %. For the 10 -year period from 1987 to 1996, 18, 245 deaths were attributed to CWP. The most frequently recorded occupation on the death certificate (70 %) was mining machine operator (NIOSH 1999). Silicosis may develop when inhaled respirable crystalline silica (quartz) is deposited in the lungs. The clinical diagnosis of silicosis is based on (1) recognition by the physician that the level of silica exposure is adequate to cause the disease, (2) the presence of chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with silicosis, and (3) the absence of other illnesses (e. g., tuberculosis or pulmonary fungal infection) that may mimic silicosis. The radiographic patterns are often the same for CWP and silicosis; thus, these diseases are sometimes distinguishable only by work history or pathological examination. Chronic silicosis commonly involves 15 or more years of exposure to silica. The characteristic microscopic feature is the silicotic nodule. Chronic silicosis is often asymptomatic and may manifest itself as a radiographic abnormality with small, rounded opacities of less than 10 mm in diameter, predominantly in the upper lobes. Lung function may be normal or show mild restriction. Chronic silicosis is also associated with a predisposition to tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections and with progression to <b>complicated</b> <b>silicosis...</b>|$|E
