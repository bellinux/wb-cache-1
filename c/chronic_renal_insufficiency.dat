25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
25|$|Etoricoxib, that is {{used for}} {{patients}} with chronic arthropathies and musculoskeletal and dental pain, is absorbed moderately when given orally. A study on its pharmacokinetics showed that the plasma peak concentration of etoricoxib occurs after approximately 1 hour. It has shown to be extensively bound to plasma albumin (about 90%), and has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 120 L in humans. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases in proportion to increased dosage (5–120mg). The elimination half-life is about 20 hours in healthy individuals, and such long half-life enables the choice to have once-daily dosage. Etoricoxib, like the other coxibs, is excreted in urine and feces and also metabolized in likewise manner. CYP3A4 is mostly responsible for biotransformation of etoricoxib to carboxylic acid metabolite, but a non CYP450 metabolism pathway to glucuronide metabolite is also at hand. A very small portion of etoricoxib (<1%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{do not appear to}} have different plasma concentration curve (AUC) compared to healthy individuals.

The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and {{the goal of this}} study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction. Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller * or fallen or slip * or trip * or (MeSH) accidental falls) and <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (<b>chronic</b> or <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease * or kidney disease * or <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> <b>chronic</b> or <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed. Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case–control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1. 18 and 1. 60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce. Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis.

It is an interesting problem to know the change of intracellular fluid brought by a rapid change of extracellular fluid. Abnormal pattern of electroencephalogram seen during blood dialysis is due to different rates of urea clearance between serum, cerebrospinal fluid and brain cells. To clarify the significance of intracellular electrolytes, studies were performed to determine intraerythrocytic concentration of potassium and non-protein nitrogen in normal human subjects, patients with acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiencies,</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> with and without edema, two cases done blood dialysis with the Kolff-type artificial kidney and a case given Amberlite IRP- 64.

The few perforating arteries in healthy and hypertensive patients had various resistance indices and flow toward the capsule. Perforating veins in these patients were much more common than perforating arteries. Perforating arteries with a lower mean resistance index than the mean interlobar resistance index and flow toward the capsule were detected in 76 % of kidneys in the patients with mild <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> failure and in 20 % of those in patients with severe <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> failure.

To evaluate whether the stimulatory or inhibitory hormones have a predominant effect, pancreatic exocrine function under conditions of mannitol perfusion of the duodenum and continuous intravenous cholecystokinin stimulation was studied in eight patients who had severe <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> failure and eight age-matched and sex-matched control subjects.

40|$|Summary: Patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> on {{hemodialysis}} develop lipoprotein abnormalities {{that may}} contribute to increased risk for atherosclerosis. The atherogenic risk for <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients and dialysis treated patients was assessed by measuring total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and calculating the ratio: TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. The examined group consisted of 18 cronic renal insufficiency patients and 60 patients on hemodialysis. The results were compared to a control group of 85 voluntary blood donors. Serum lipid parameters were examined by standard methods. All lipid parameters in hemodialysis patients were statistically different compared to the control group (p< 0. 05) while <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients showed significant difference only in triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. Hypertriglyceridemia was present in both examined groups of patients and HDL-cholesterol was lower within both groups.

Lipid parameters were compared between <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and hemodialysis patients but statistical significantly difference was obtained only for HDL-cholesterol (p< 0. 05). We conclude that increased values of triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol in <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients contribute to high incidence of cardiovascular disease. <b>Chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> patients have impaired reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral cells to lipoproteins, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia prevalence of small, dense LDL and increased levels of potentially atherogenic remnant particles.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of acetylcysteine to prevent contrast nephropathy after administration of radiocontrast media in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Methods We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing acetylcysteine and hydration with hydration alone for preventing contrast nephropathy in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> The trials were identified through a combined search of the BIOSIS+/RRM, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Current Contents Medizin, and The Cochrane Library Databases. We used incidence of contrast nephropathy 48 h after administration of radiocontrast media as an outcome measure. Findings Seven trials including 805 patients were eligible according to our inclusion criteria and were analysed. Overall incidence of contrast nephropathy varied between 8 % and 28 %. Since significant heterogeneity was indicated by the Q statistics (p= 0 · 016) we used a random-effects model to combine the data. Compared with periprocedural hydration alone, administration of acetylcysteine and hydration significantly reduced the relative risk of contrast nephropathy by 56 % (0 · 435 [95 % CI 0 · 215 – 0 · 879], P= 0 · 02) in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Meta-regression revealed no significant relation between the relative risk of contrast nephropathy and the volume of radiocontrast media administered or the degree of <b>chronic</b> <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> before the procedure.
