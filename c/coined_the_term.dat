5|$|Henry Piddington {{published}} almost 40 papers {{dealing with}} tropical storms from Calcutta between 1835 and 1855 in The Journal of the Asiatic Society. He also <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> cyclone, meaning the coil of a snake. In 1842, he published his landmark thesis, Laws of the Storms.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Mujo for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić.|$|E

He <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> hypertext and hypermedia in 1963 and published them in 1965. Nelson <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> transclusion, virtuality, and intertwingularity (in Literary Machines).|$|R

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|New Scientist <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{nominative}} contradeterminism {{for people}} who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Portland Chief of Police Danielle Outlaw, Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine, would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently {{changed his name to}} Jirgensohn, and the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Sin. The synonym inaptronym is also sometimes used.|$|E
5|$|Nhất Hạnh {{has also}} been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism {{movement}} (he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term),</b> promoting the individual's active role in creating change. He cites the 13th-century Vietnamese king Trần Nhân Tông with the origination of the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition.|$|E

5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (who <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> cybernetics). He began writing science fiction at age 18 and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, Amazing published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Thus he was a well-known pulp writer at 21 – but he had failed German and MIT had dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths. It is not true that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; nor that only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E

5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which {{began to be}} exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence {{on the development of}} modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The {{new wave}} of British heavy metal (commonly {{abbreviated}} as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe {{the emergence of new}} heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Tolkien's books {{has had a}} small but lasting effect {{on the use of}} language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish (alongside dwarfs and dwarfish), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been dwarrows or dwerrows.) He also <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> eucatastrophe, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage {{in the perception of}} dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
