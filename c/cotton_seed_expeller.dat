The purpose of the seed dealer survey and seed collection was to test the seed, through DNA fingerprinting, for purity and other traits (germination, moisture etc.). The survey was designed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and implemented by Innovative Development Studies (IDS). The sample selection of seed dealers involved three steps: i) identification of markets from where most of the survey households in our sample for the study purchase seeds; ii) preparation of a list of all <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers in these identified markets; and iii) selection of five seed dealers in each market and collect samples of three top selling varieties. The household survey identified that nearly 32 percent of the selected <b>cotton</b> growers purchased <b>seeds</b> from markets. These markets were located in 42 tehsils. Keeping in view the representation of all agroecological zones (AEZs) of cotton growing areas, 27 tehsil markets were randomly selected.

40|$|Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is {{a common}} stored grain pest for which {{a wide range of}} {{suitable}} resources has been recorded. These beetles are facultatively fungivorous and their resource range may extend to fungi associated with non-grain resources (e. g. <b>cotton</b> <b>seed)</b> and other decaying plant matter. Little is known with respect to fungi in terms of resource location by these beetles in the field. We, therefore, conducted a series of experiments in laboratory arenas, glasshouse cages and the field to determine how beetles respond to grain resources in relation to <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> (together with its lint stubble and associated fungal flora). Results from the tests conducted in relatively small arenas and cages in the laboratory and glasshouse reveal that the responses of T. castaneum adults to food resources were twice as strong when walking as when flying (as measured by the proportion of the released beetles that were trapped). Also, a clear preference for linted <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> was evident in walking T. castaneum, especially in small-scale arenas in the laboratory, where at least 60 % of beetles released preferred linted <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> over wheat and sorghum. Similarly, in cages (1 m 3) they responded five times more strongly to linted <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> than to conventional grain resources. However, this pattern was not consistent with those obtained from field trapping over 20 m and the beetles did not show any particular preference to any of the resources tested above.
