This cluster also includes Chondrogenesis-Associated Lipocalins beta and gamma (CAL beta, CAL gamma) and Extracellular Fatty Acid Binding Protein (Ex-FABP). The new gene <b>codes</b> for <b>a</b> <b>22</b> -kDa secreted protein with three cysteine residues {{and a series of}} sequence features well conserved in the lipocalin family. All the genes in the cluster are structurally similar presenting comparable exon/intron boundary positions and exon sizes. A phylogenetic analysis indicates the monophyletic grouping of these genes, and their relationship with the lipocalins alpha- 1 -microglobulin (A 1 mg), complement factor 8 gamma chain (C 8 GC), prostaglandin D synthase (PGDS), and neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The new cluster gene appears to be the ortholog of the mammalian C 8 GC and was thus named Ggal-C 8 GC. This orthology also suggests that this lipocalin was present in the ancestor common to reptiles and mammals. In addition to other expressing tissues, Ex-FABP, CAL beta and CAL gamma genes are highly transcribed in chondrocytes at late stages of chondrogenesis during endochondral bone formation and/or upon inflammatory stimulation. Here, we show that they are also transcriptionally induced when chondrocytes are subjected to various biological events as cell quiescence, cell shape transition, and hormonal stimulation.

Full-length cDNA obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR <b>codes</b> for <b>a</b> <b>22</b> -kDa protein. In L. infantum promastigotes an endogenous nuclear protein of 14 -kDa electrophoretic mobility was found by using an antiserum prepared against the fusion protein glutathione S-transferase–papLe 22. Its expression was also shown in L. infantum amastigotes and in Leishmania major and Leishmania guyanensis promastigotes. VL patients' sera showed anti-papLe 22 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG reactivities, indicating that a primary response against the leishmanial protein papLe 22 accompanied acute VL manifestations. Specific IgG levels were correlated with patients' clinical status. The presence of IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgG 3 subclasses suggested a mixed Th 1 - and Th 2 -type response; there was no correlation between subclass reactivity and the disease course. The recombinant papLe 22 specifically activated interleukin- 10 production by VL patients' {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} collected at diagnosis and after treatment-induced cure, indicating its contribution to VL pathogenesis and concomitant immunosuppression and its potential role in the reactivation of latent parasites.

The new cluster gene appears to be the ortholog of the mammalian C 8 GC and was thus named Ggal-C 8 GC. This orthology also suggests that this lipocalin was present in the ancestor common to reptiles and mammals. In addition to other expressing tissues, Ex-FABP, CALh and CALg genes are highly transcribed in chondrocytes at late stages of chondrogenesis during endochondral bone formation and/or upon inflammatory stimulation. Here, we show that they are also transcriptionally induced when chondrocytes are subjected to various biological events as cell quiescence, cell shape transition, and hormonal stimulation. By contrast, Ggal-C 8 GC transcripts are only barely detectable in chondrocytes, but are more abundant in liver, kidney, brain, heart, skeletal muscle and particularly in skin. Moreover, no expression induction was observed neither during chondrocyte differentiation, nor upon any of the stimulations mentioned above. This indicates that the Ggal-C 8 GC gene was co-opted for a novel function after the duplication events that gave rise to the cluster. The peculiar coordinated regulation of Ex-FABP, CALh and CALg, and the apparent divergent role of Ggal-C 8 GC suggest that these gene duplications may have been maintained during evolution by a sub-functionalization mechanism where some common function(s) are shared by several members of the cluster and some other specialized function(s) are unique to other members...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: S-(3, 4 -Dichlorobenzyl) isothiourea (<b>A</b> <b>22)</b> {{disrupts}} the actin cytoskeleton of bacteria, causing defects of morphology and chromosome segregation. Previous {{studies have suggested}} that the actin homologue MreB itself is the target of <b>A</b> <b>22,</b> but there has been no direct observation of <b>A</b> <b>22</b> binding to MreB and no mechanistic explanation of its mode of action. We show that <b>A</b> <b>22</b> binds MreB with at least micromolar affinity in its nucleotide-binding pocket {{in a manner that is}} sterically incompatible with simultaneous ATP binding. <b>A</b> <b>22</b> negatively affects both the time course and extent of MreB polymerization in vitro in the presence of ATP. <b>A</b> <b>22</b> prevents assembly of MreB into long, rigid polymers, as determined by both fluorescence microscopy and sedimentation assays. <b>A</b> <b>22</b> increases the critical concentration of ATP-bound MreB assembly from 500 nM to approximately 2000 nM. We therefore conclude that <b>A</b> <b>22</b> is <b>a</b> competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to MreB. <b>A</b> <b>22</b> -bound MreB is capable of polymerization, but with assembly properties that more closely resemble those of the ADP-bound state. Because the cellular concentration of MreB is in the low micromolar range, this mechanism explains the ability of <b>A</b> <b>22</b> to largely disassemble the actin cytoskeleton in bacterial cells. It also represents a novel mode of action for a cytoskeletal drug and the first biochemical characterization of the interaction between a small molecule inhibitor of the bacterial cytoskeleton and its target...|$|R
