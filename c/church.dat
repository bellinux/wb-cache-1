5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the <b>church,</b> the <b>church</b> has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service.

After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the <b>church,</b> last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the <b>church,</b> which left the maintaining of the <b>church</b> to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

5|$|Augustine built a <b>church</b> at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey.

Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the <b>church</b> was destroyed by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence.
