40|$|Abstract. In the {{preceding}} article, Buchner and Wippich used a guessing-corrected, multinomial process-dissociation analysis {{to test whether}} a gender bias in fame judgments reported by Banaji and Greenwald (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1995, 68, 181 - 198) was unconscious. Buchner and Wippich concluded that the gender-bias effect was not unconscious {{on the basis of}} finding no difference in model-estimated familiarity between previously presented nonfamous male and female names. This conclusion is questioned by noting that (a) the gender difference in familiarity that Buchner and Wippich modeled was different from the critical gender difference in criterion for fame judgments reported by Banaji and Greenwald, (b) the assumptions of Buchner and Wippich s multinomial model exclude processes that are plausibly involved in the fame judgment task, and (<b>c)</b> <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> Buchner and Wippich s that correspond most closely to Banaji and Greenwald s gender-bias interpretation are formulated so as to preclude modeling that interpretation.

30|$|We {{had five}} {{research}} aims. First, {{we were concerned}} to establish {{the relationship between the}} two clusters of items adapted from the existing measures, the SDHS and the STAI- 6. While problems of depression and anxiety are known to be experientially different, these two states have been found to be strongly associated and difficult to separate empirically, with correlations between measures of depression and anxiety typically in range of r = 0.80 and above (Feldman [1993]; Watson et al. [1995]). Approximately 85 % of patients with depression also experience significant symptoms of anxiety. Similarly, comorbid depression occurs in up to 90 % of patients with anxiety disorders (Gorman [1998]). There is much common content in measures of depression and anxiety (Endler et al. [1992]). Selection of items specific to the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> depression or anxiety can yield empirically separate tools (Stulz & Crits-Cristoph [2010]) but unless specifically developed in this way tend to be highly correlated. As such, at a higher order level these two theoretically separable dimensions may be combined to provide an overall index of positive functioning.|$|R

The technique of bone regeneration through tissue engineering in this study is quite different from traditional ones, which have attempted to regenerate bone directly by constructing a 3 -D implant [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. This study has used a novel method of experimental {{bone formation}} (intramembranous osteogenesis) in a defect. Our results have asserted that the bone defect, even when large, may be repaired by tissue-engineered bone membrane efficiently because of naturally induced angiogenesis. The materials of this tissue-engineered composite, which are derived from the allogenic and the xenogenic sources are cheap and abundant and, therefore, may be much more practical for widespread clinical use.|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} vapour (H 2 O 2) {{for its ability}} to inactivate Bacillus spores within a laboratory-scale heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) duct system. Methods and Results: Experiments were conducted in a closed-loop duct system, <b>constructed</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> internally lined or unlined galvanized metal. Bacterial spores were aerosol-deposited onto 18 -mm-diameter test material coupons and strategically placed at several locations within the duct environment. Various concentrations of H 2 O 2 and exposure times were evaluated to determine the sporicidal efficacy and minimum exposure needed for decontamination. For the unlined duct, high variability was observed in the recovery of spores between sample locations, likely due to complex, unpredictable flow patterns within the ducts. In comparison, the lined duct exhibited a significant desorption of the H 2 O 2 following the fumigant dwell period and thus resulted in complete decontamination at all sampling locations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that decontamination of Bacillus sporecontaminated unlined HVAC ducts by hydrogen peroxide fumigation may require more stringent conditions (higher concentrations, longer dwell duration) than internally insulated ductwork. Significance and Impact of the Study: These data may help emergency responders when developing remediation plans during building decontamination...|$|R

Through the mapping of the physical changes that have occurred in a particular place, by extracting information from historical maps and photographs, patterns can be identified that convey the continuity of urban form, active usage and building typology. The analysis can be measured to identify developments that are incongruous, and critically, a methodology of predictive urban form that is indicative of a consonant urban development.

The interacting region of LdTOPIL lies between residues 40 – 99 and 435 – 456, while for LdTOPIS it lies between residues 210 – 215 and 245 – 262.
