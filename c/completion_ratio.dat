40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{study focused}} on whether Asian students' social and {{academic}} integration positively affects their course completion rate at the community college. In this study, academic integration is considered in terms of experience with counseling/transfer centers, and faculty interaction, social integration, and peer group participation outside of class, while course completion is considered indicative of persistence.; The {{purpose of this study}} was to address the three hypotheses, each of which concerns course completion. Asian students' experience with academic advisors/counselors, interaction with faculty, and studying with others outside of class were hypothesized to be related to a higher ratio of courses completed.; The researcher analyzed data on Asian students in the Los Angeles Community College District, who consecutively enrolled in the Fall 2000 through Spring 2002 semesters. The study utilized several aspects of academic and social integration, as discussed by Tinto, taking into consideration cultural differences that define the integration of minority students.; The study did not find any correlation between experience with counseling and transfer center advisors/counselors and Asian students' course <b>completion</b> <b>ratios.</b> Nor was there a correlation found between peer group participation and course <b>completion</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, the study did find a weak positive correlation between instructor interaction and course completion ratios.; The study concludes with recommendations for researchers to develop more comprehensive models to understand minority student integration to the campus environment.

While participa-tory/pervasive sensing has gained wide adoptions by leveraging various onboard sensors on mobile devices, another powerful resource, the computational power on these mobile devices has been less frequently harnessed by researchers and practitioners. To fill this gap, we propose in this work the modeling, analysis, and implementation of participatory computing. Specifically, we propose REPC, a generic randomized task assignment frame-work for the participatory computing paradigm, which guar-antees the overall system performance with close to minimal workload at individual participating devices. To achieve these design objectives, we model the intrinsic relationship between the workload of individual devices and the probability they complete their assigned tasks. Based on our modeling results, we analyze the maximal system capacity for any given participatory computing system and derive the minimal workload for individual participating devices to achieve the overall system performance requirement. We have fully implemented our design on the Android platform and demonstrated its performance through a representative participatory computing application.

For the purpose of this analysis, the authors define course shopping as: (1) cyclic shopping, the pattern of dropping a course and adding another in its place; and (2) bulk shopping, the process of adding courses up front with the expectation of dropping some later. The research questions driving the analyses were: (1) What kinds of course shopping behaviors do students perform? (2) How prevalent is the activity? (3) Are there discernible demographic patterns of students who course shop? (4) Does course shopping differ by discipline or type of course? (5) Do students who course shop have significantly different GPAs or course <b>completion</b> <b>ratios</b> than student who do not practice this behavior? The findings indicate that the no shopping comparison group had a GPA of 2. 56, while the bulk shoppers had a GPA of 2. 46, true cyclic shoppers had a GPA of 2. 46, and mixed bag shoppers had a GPA of 2. 13.

40|$|This study uses {{longitudinal}} data from {{community college students}} enrolled in developmental reading classes to explore {{the impact of a}} success course on key momentum points and milestones. Working from an institutional database, a cohort of first semester students (N = 1, 427) from a public community college in New England was tracked from fall 2007 through spring 2013. Developmental reading students enrolled in a newly-instituted success course (N = 359) were compared to peers who did not enroll in the course. Chi square analyses addressed the relationship between reading level and success course enrollment and between success course enrollment and retention (2 nd and 4 th semester), momentum points (enrollment into developmental writing and gateway writing courses), and milestones (completing an associate’s degree or transfer- ready status). The results demonstrate a small (6 - 10 %) but consistent effect of enrollment in the success course in facilitating the acquisition of academic goals. Regression analyses evaluated the demographic characteristics associated with these variables. In individual predictive analyses, nonwhite, first generation, and female students were significantly less likely to complete momentum points or milestones; however, in the full model race was the most consistent predictor, with <b>completion</b> <b>ratios</b> for nonwhite students 2 - 5 times lower than white students.

" Although the model minority thesis was initially applied only to Japanese American's in Peterson's article, future research, literature, and popular notions extended the thesis to all Asian Americans consisting of: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian American groups. The latter group encompasses Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian, Filipino and Laotian groups. By aggregating all Asian Americans into a single group, conclusions taken from research were then generalized to all Asian Americans within the heterogeneous group.; The model minority thesis poses several problems for all Asian Americans groups, and especially the Cambodian and Laotian groups in the United States. The thesis fails to account for differences in immigration patterns, socioeconomic status, academic success, and parental education. Additionally, the thesis is poorly suited to describing the Cambodian and Laotian experience.; This study examines the inaccuracies of the model minority thesis as it relates to higher education experiences of specific Asian American groups in the Los Angeles Community College District. Specifically, this study argues that there is a mismatch between the actual characteristics of Southeast Asian community college students and the expected characteristics as derived from the model minority thesis. In particular, this paper investigates the variability of the actual students' parental levels of education, cultural related values of education, and student success and the extent of their divergence from the model minority stereotype.; Through exploring the contemporary variation that exists among Asian American groups at the community college level, this study found that Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Filipino students in general have more educated parents and different educational values than their Cambodian and Laotian counterparts. Moreover, in many instances, these differences could have affected Cambodian and Laotian students' scholastic performance.
