40|$|As a rat moves, grid {{cells in}} its entorhinal cortex (EC) {{discharge}} at multiple {{locations of the}} external world, and the firing fields of each grid <b>cell</b> <b>span</b> a hexagonal lattice. For movements on linear tracks, spikes tend to occur at successively earlier phases of the theta-band filtered local field potential during the traversal of a firing field – a phenomenon termed phase precession. The complex movement patterns observed in two-dimensional (2 D) open-field environments may fundamentally alter phase precession. To study this question at the behaviorally relevant single-run level, we analyzed EC spike patterns {{as a function of}} the distance traveled by the rat along each trajectory. This analysis revealed that cells across all EC layers fire spikes that phase-precess; indeed, the rate and extent of phase precession were the same, only the correlation between spike phase and path length was weaker in EC layer III. Both slope and correlation of phase precession were surprisingly similar on linear tracks and in 2 D open-field environments despite strong differences in the movement statistics, including running speed. While the phase-precession slope did not correlate with the average running speed, it did depend on specific properties of the animal’s path. The longer a curving path through a grid-field in a 2 D environment, the shallower was the rate of phase precession, while runs that grazed a grid field tangentially led to a steeper phase-precession slope than runs through the field center. Oscillatory interference models for grid cells do not reproduce th...|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} processes occurring within a living <b>cell</b> <b>span</b> {{a spectrum of}} scales in space and time, ranging from the nano- to the macro-scale. We note that a single cellular process often operates on multiple spatial and temporal scales, and thus it becomes necessary to combine modeling techniques in multiscale approaches, in which different levels of theory are synergized to describe a system {{at a number of}} scales or resolutions. In this work we apply a multiscale modeling framework to investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms governing the activation of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, a family of kinases which are commonly over-expressed or mutated in human cancers, with a focus on the HER 3 and HER 4 kinases. Our multiscale model of HER 3, a kinase which, until recently, has been considered kinase-dead, presents evidence of HER 3 catalytic activity and demonstrates that even a weak HER 3 signal can be amplified by other cellular signaling mechanisms to induce drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in silico. Thus HER 3, rather than the commonly-targeted EGFR and HER 2 kinases, may represent a superior therapeutic target in specific ErbB-driven cancers. In the second major study, we construct a multiscale model of activity in the HER 4 kinase, which has been shown to perform an anti-cancer role in certain tumor cells, by steering the cell toward a program of cellular differentiation and away from a program of uncontrolled proliferation. Our HER 4 model, which applies a combined computational and experimental approach, elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying this HER 4 -mediated ‘switch’ to the cellular differentiation program, with the ultimate aim of exploiting or modulating the HER 4 pathway as a potential therapy in specific ErbB-driven cancers. Furthermore, the model provides structural insights into the effects of several HER 4 somatic mutations which have recently been discovered in a subset of cancer patients, and which abrogate the anti-cancer effects of HER 4 activity. We have illustrated that multiscale modeling provides a powerful and quantitative platform for investigating the complexity inherent in intracellular signaling pathways and rationalizing the effects of molecular perturbations on downstream signaling events and ultimately, on the cell phenotype. ...|$|E

40|$|We present {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the worst-case and typical-case complexity of a context-free parsing pipeline via hard constraints derived from finite-state pre-processing. We perform O(n) predictions to determine if each word in the input sentence may begin or end a multi-word constituent in chart <b>cells</b> <b>spanning</b> two or more words, or allow single-word constituents in chart <b>cells</b> <b>spanning</b> the word itself. These pre-processing constraints prune the search space for any chart-based parsing algorithm and significantly decrease decoding time. In many cases cell population is reduced to zero, which we term chart cell “closing. ” We present methods for closing {{a sufficient number of}} chart cells to ensure provably quadratic or even linear worst-case complexity of context-free inference. In addition, we apply high precision constraints to achieve large typical-case speedups and combine both high precision and worst-case bound constraints to achieve superior performance on both short and long strings. These bounds on processing are achieved without reducing the parsing accuracy, and in some cases accuracy improves. We demonstrate that our method generalizes across multiple grammars and is complementary to other pruning techniques by presenting empirical results for both exact and approximate inference using the exhaustive CKY algorithm, the Charniak parser, and the Berkeley parser. We also report results parsing Chinese, where we achieve the best reported results for an individual model on the commonly reported data set. 1...|$|R

Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search.

P-gp actively extrudes chemotherapeutic drugs from cells, thus reducing their efficacy. As a typical ABC transporter, P-gp has four domains: two transmembrane domains, which form a pathway through the membrane through which substrates are transported, and two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation.
