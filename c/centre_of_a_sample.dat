40|$|A new {{measuring}} device – the Laser-camera- was tested under typical forest conditions. With the device, constructed of a Canon EOS 400 D digital reflex camera with an integrated Mitsubishi ML 101 J 27 laser line generator, diameters of trees {{can be measured}} from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> plot without having to visit the trees. The Laser-camera's principle {{is based on the}} reflection of a laser line and a point on a tree stem and the processing of digital images. The study material was gathered during the period in 2007 - 2008 from 13 circular sample plots and included a total of 728 diameter measurements from 265 trees. The standard error of the diameter observations, using semiautomatic interpretation, was 6 mm (5. 3 %). The accuracy of the diameter observations (standard error) was maximum for spruce (5. 0 mm, 4. 4 %, followed by birch (6. 4 mm, 3. 3 %) and pine (7. 6 mm, 7. 6 %). The most common errors were caused by the laser point not hitting the tree stem, branches in front of the stem hampering visibility or incorrect definition of the direction and height of the measurement. Overall tree diameter measurements can be obtained with a Laser-camera rapidly (10 s/tree) and with good reliability and efficiency. The future goal will be to integrate laser technique with an altimeter, data collection unit and GPS receiver inside a weatherproof Laser-camera device. This will enable ready checking of the measurement results in the field from the screen of the digital camera and the measuring of the diameters at any height of a tree, the heights, locations, as well as quality variables of trees...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{processing}} of vegetables {{involves the use}} of temperatures above the physiological limit which affect the cellular structures of the tissue and induce a series of events at cell level that will in turn be reflected in the transport properties of the tissue. One of the most important cellular structures from the mass transport point of view is the cell membrane since it represents the physical barrier to the transport of nutrients {{into and out of the}} cell. The effect of heat treatment above physiological limits on the cell membrane of vegetable tissues was studied using potatoes as a model tissue. In vitro studies of the thermal deactivation kinetics of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase showed a pseudo-first-order model characterized by the sum of two independent and simultaneous processes occurring at different rates. Study of the temperature dependence of the activity loss showed that the potato cell membrane undergoes functional breakdown at 55 °C, which is characterized by a sharp drop in the H+-ATPase activity and a drastic 7 -fold decrease in the energy of activation (Ea). As a result, the proton-motive force needed to provide the energy for the active solute transport is greatly affected and the ability of the cell to retain cytoplasmic solutes decrease. Since the H+-ATPase plays a key role in the transport of solutes across the cell membrane, results indicate that processing temperatures above 55 °C affect both mediate and active transport at cellular level. The cell membrane integrity of potato tissue was measured at different depths from the surface to the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> exposed to different heat treatments. Computer simulations using the finite-element method were performed in order to estimate the temperature distribution within the tissue during heat treatment. Treatment conditions were found to affect the degree of cell membrane integrity in the tissue, especially after heat treatment above 55 °C. In similarity to the thermal deactivation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, the kinetics of the reduction in cell membrane integrity was found to follow a pseudo-first-order model indicating theta the cell membrane integrity of the tissue is coupled to the thermal stability of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The temperature dependence of the cell membrane integrity after heat treatment did not follow Arrhenius’ law but a sigmoid pattern, as demonstrated by a slight decrease at low tissue temperatures followed by a sudden sharp decrease after the tissue reached temperatures above 50 °C. The absolute residual pectin methylesterase activity of the tissue was also measured at different depths and related the simulated temperature of the tissue. The activity of the enzyme was found to be strongly dependent on the degree of heat penetration and temperature distribution within the tissue. Thermally induced activation of the enzyme was detected at tissue temperatures above 52 °C. The simultaneous occurrence of thermal activation of the enzyme and the sharp decrease in cell membrane integrity of the tissue in the same temperature range suggest a coupling of the two processes. The activation of pectin methylesterase enzyme in the tissue may be the consequence of cell membrane disruption and subsequent leakage of cytoplasmic solutes towards the cell wall...|$|E
40|$|The Tasmanian {{sawmilling}} industry typically {{does not}} season eucalypt material specifically for furniture applications {{because of its}} highly refractory seasoning characteristics. Boards cut with wide faces parallel to the growth rings ('backsawn or 'flatsawn' boards), in particular, shrink significantly with drying and often experience surface checking (seasoning 'degrade'). It is standard practice to season timber batches under schedules designed to produce relatively high-grade structural material and sell the small proportion of boards that do not suffer seasoning degrade as furniture grade material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate optimum seasoning of backsawn material specifically for furniture applications to take advantage of the premium prices paid by furniture manufacturers for degrade-free material. Acoustic emission is a well known non-destructive testing tool. Acoustic emission results from stress waves generated by irreversible stress release activity such as the growth of small cracks in a solid material under load. Acoustic emission is typically used in homogeneous materials such as plastics and metals to determine the structural integrity of components in situ. Acoustic emission was first measured in timber subject to external load over thirty years ago and has subsequently been measured in drying timber specimens where differential drying rates between the surface and <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> may cause appreciable drying stresses. Acoustic emission appeared to be related to the severity of the drying conditions and the development of surface checking (Becker 1982, Noguchi et al. 1987). Under harsh drying regimes, surface checking occurred and a significantly higher AE rate was measured than in the same species subject to mild drying conditions. The 'AE rate' is a measure of the occurrence of high-energy bursts of acoustic waves during a particular time-period - the higher the AE rate, the more energetic bursts are measured. On this basis, it appeared feasible to measure acoustic emission in sample boards in a kiln during drying and adjust the drying conditions as the AE rate approached levels previously determined to correspond to surface checking. Various AE-based kiln control systems were reported in the literature (Honeycutt et al. 1985, Noguchi et al. 1987) but it appears acoustic emission was not satisfactorily related to surface check development. These control systems controlled the drying conditions based on arbitrary AE rates that were nominally selected as 'safe' without optimising the drying process. The heterogeneous structure of timber posed significant obstacles to forming a clear picture of the stress release processes occurring in timber. Acoustic emission measured in drying Tasmanian eucalypt boards was employed in this project as an online measure of the magnitude of the stresses during drying. Numerous batches of eucalypt boards were obtained from a sawmill during the project and dried under harsh conditions to induce surface checking. It was determined that the AE rate generated at the onset of surface checking in backsawn and quartersawn boards was effectively constant (within the variability of the material). This 'AE checking threshold' was independent of basic density and clearly independent of bulk stiffness (since the bulk tangential stiffness is effectively half the radial stiffness in the species studied). It appeared that the acoustic emission phenomenon was independent of the timber bulk material properties. It is proposed that acoustic emission waves propagate from irreversible slips or dislocations in the crystalline cellulose regions of cell walls under high stress. These slips are sudden, energetic stress release events which propagate stress waves from the local site. The amorphous regions of the cell structure behave in a rather plastic manner with local stress expected to be consumed by ductile flow processes that do not generate elastic waves. Dinwoodie (1968) reported the existence of such crystalline slips in spruce timber under external compression. Siau (1984) reported that the proportion by mass of cellulose in normal wood (as opposed to tension and compression wood) was remarkably constant and apparently independent of species. Further, the proportion of crystalline cellulose is also relatively constant (Siau 1984). This appears to be directly related to the remarkably constant AE rate measured at the onset of surface checking in this study. This finding led to the measurement of acoustic emission in other species. It was hoped that the same AE 'rate would be measured at the onset of checking in different woods. Acoustic emission was measured in backsawn radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The acoustic emission measured in radiata pine was significantly different from the acoustic emission measured in the eucalypt material, with relatively 'massive' AE rates detected in boards free of seasoning degrade. This behaviour was attributed to brittle failure in the resin canals, structural elements not present in the eucalypt genus. The characteristic AE responses measured in drying myrtle boards resembled the behaviour measured in the eucalypt boards, apparently due to the more similar structure. Surface checking was detected at approximately the same AE rate as that measured in the eucalypt boards. Much of the improved understanding of the acoustic emission phenomenon developed in this study was facilitated by the existence of a one-dimensional nonlinear drying model developed by Oliver (1991). Oliver wrote KILNSCHED (KILN SCHEDULING PROGRAM), a computer program based on this model, which simulates the drying behaviour of a single board, with arbitrary bulk material properties, subject to arbitrary drying conditions. KILNSCHED is particularly suited to low temperature drying of eucalypt materials. Kiln drying trials quickly revealed that 'green' Tasmanian eucalypt boards invariably suffered surface checking within 24 hours when subject to drying temperatures as low as 23 °C dry bulb temperature and 21 °C wet bulb temperature (at 0. 5 m/s airspeed). Such temperatures are significantly lower than those often employed in drying material direct off-saw in the timber industry but none-the-less are considered 'harsh' in this study. At the commencement of this study, KILNSCHED was used in a purely predictive mode to assess drying schedules prior to drying. The author of this thesis modified KILNSCHED to simulate drying using the real-time drying temperatures measured in the experimental kiln. This allowed measured acoustic emission during drying to be compared with the drying behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED. This modification revealed that Tasmanian eucalypt timber is far more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations than was previously expected. The reader must keep this material sensitivity to temperature and temperature change in mind at all times when reading this thesis. The AE rate measured during drying was successfully related to the instantaneous strain at a board surface calculated with KILNSCHED using the measured drying conditions. Instantaneous strain is the strain component employed as the failure criterion in the drying model. This enabled the author to place considerable confidence in behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED and the 'optimum drying' program SMARTKILN discussed below. This author modified KILNSCHED to incorporate an optimisation algorithm that determined the optimum drying conditions required to dry the timber in the minimum time at a preset arbritrary maximum surface instantaneous strain. The resulting program, SMARTKILN, develops drying schedules to maintain the calculated surface instantaneous strain at a preset 'Control Strain' below the ultimate surface instantaneous strain. Together, SMARTKILN and acoustic emission measurement form the basis of Clever Kiln Controller®, a kiln control system to dry Tasmanian eucalypt timber in the minimum time with minimum degrade. In Clever Kiln Controller, SMARTKILN uses datalogged real time drying conditions to simulate the drying behaviour of a sample board in the kiln. Calculated drying behaviour is continuously compared with measured drying behaviour (measured AE rate and moisture profiles measured by regularly slicing sample boards). Provided the calculated and measured drying behaviour are satisfactorily matched, the optimum drying schedule developed by SMARTKILN is applied to the kiln. When the AE rate approaches the AE checking threshold, the drying conditions are automatically ameliorated to prevent surface checking. Subsequently, SMARTKILN develops a refined optimum schedule to incorporate the new datalogged drying conditions. This study has developed the understanding of acoustic emission from the existing (often misleading) information recorded in the literature to a level that could be incorporated with current knowledge of the behaviour of drying timber. The thesis describes how this was achieved. Various aspects of the understanding have been reported in papers published, in press or under review. The final result is the development of a commercial kiln controller which is described and already implemented in some selected experimental kilns at present restricted to eucalypt materials...|$|E

40|$|International audienceArgillaceous {{formations}} {{are thought}} to be suitable natural barriers to the release <b>of</b> radionuclides from <b>a</b> radioactive waste repository. However, the safety assessment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> waste repository hosted by an argillaceous rock requires knowledge of several properties of the host rock such as the hydraulic conductivity, diffusion properties and the pore water composition. This paper presents an experimental design that allows the determination of these three types of parameters on the same cylindrical rock sample. The reliability of this method was evaluated using <b>a</b> core <b>sample</b> from <b>a</b> well-investigated indurated argillaceous formation, the Opalinus Clay from the Mont Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL) (Switzerland).

40|$|Petrology is {{the science}} of rocks. Geologists map rocks in the field, and bring selected. samples back to the {{laboratory}} for detailed petrographic analysis, mineralogical study and chemical analysis. On {{the basis of these}} studies, existing hypotheses for the origin of the rocks are tested, or new hypotheses are erected. From examination of the rocks in field and laboratory, geologists then attempt to deduce their histories. Experimental petrology involves further laboratory experiments which reproduce the conditions within the Earth during the generation and evolution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rock or rock suite. This involves subjecting minerals and rocks, or their synthetic equivalents, to high pressures and temperatures under varied but precisely controlled conditions. Determination of the reactions which occur under the known conditions in the laboratory provides calibrations for the processes involved in formation of the rocks in nature, defining the actual conditions, and facilitating selection among competing hypotheses of origin. Furthermore, exploration of reactions under various conditions within the laboratory may reveal processes operating within the Earth which were previously unsuspected Experimental petrology had its beginnings in adventurous experiments on minerals and rocks using furnaces or cannon barrels. It became a force in Earth sciences starting in the early 1900 s with the systematic determination of high-temperature phase equilibria involving the crystallisation of synthetic silicate liquids, which included representatives of the common rock-forming minerals. These investigations brought the rigour of thermodynamics to the processes of partial melting of rocks and the crystallisation of magmas, and elucidated many problems in igneous petrology. Only in the 1950 s did phase equilibrium experiments with simultaneously maintained high temperatures and pressures become routine. At first the experiments reproduced conditions only within the continental crust, then during the 1960 s the experimental range was extended to high-pressure conditions within the mantle, equivalent to about 100 km depth. During the 1980 s one type of large-volume apparatus reproduced conditions down to 650 km in the Earth, and a miniature device has reproduced conditions corresponding to 2000 km depth, not far short of the mantle-core boundary of the Earth.
