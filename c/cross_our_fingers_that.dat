Both drivers added that their focus {{would be on the}} championship. Lapierre accepted that his early race crash affected his team's ambitions of winning the race, stating he was unable to see anything because of low visibility, and did not expect to get the car back to the pit lane with the heavy damage it sustained: [...] "We <b>crossed</b> <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>that</b> the car would hold together to the end, and after this we can be pleased with what we accomplished." [...] Wolfgang Ullrich, the head of Audi Motorsport, expressed his respect for Porsche, saying the German company and Toyota were strong competitors and Ullrich held a belief that Audi would succeed despite of strenuous prerequisites for the season. He stated the event was [...] "of the kind you can only experience at Le Mans" [...] with the deciding factors being that the Audi R18 e-tron quattro drove consistently fast for the entire duration of the race and said the victory was placed among one of the German company's greatest wins because of the constant changing factors for all the competing teams.|$|R

40|$|Welcome to {{our special}} edition {{focusing}} on assessment. We have the pleas-ure of presenting eight articles that address assessment {{in social work}} edu-cation {{from a variety of}} perspectives. These contributions were chosen in keeping with the philosophy of this journal: The examination of issues and ideas that will influence how our profession will address the countless assessment ques-tions we continually discover. Assessment is interwoven throughout the fabric of social work education. We con-tinually take stock of what we are doing and how well we are accomplishing our intended goals. It permeates our academic lives whether we notice it or not. Assessment presents itself when we emerge from class. Are we smiling or frowning because of what occurred? Assessment happens when we select textbooks. Are we happy with our choices or do we have the urge to write our own? Assessment is salient againwhenwe craft syllabi. We can only cram somuch into 15 weeks—some-thing has to go—yet, we know from professional wisdom that we easily could use more time. It comes into play when the faculty meets to take stock of what the cur-riculum is accomplishing. Is graduation joyful because we are confident in what we have created?

60|$|This, however, {{though it}} looks so plausible, will not bear examination. The {{expression}} “two pebbles and one pebble,” and the expression “three pebbles,” stand indeed for the same aggregation of objects, but they by no means stand for the same physical fact. They are names of the same objects, but of those objects in two different states: though they denote the same things, their connotation is different. Three pebbles in two separate parcels, and three pebbles in one parcel, do not make the same impression on our senses; and the assertion that the very same pebbles may by an alteration of place and arrangement be made to produce either the one set of sensations or the other, though a very familiar proposition, is not an identical one. It is a truth known to us by early and constant experience: an inductive truth; and such truths are {{the foundation of the}} science of Number. The fundamental truths of that science all rest on the evidence of sense; they are proved by showing to our eyes and <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>that</b> any given number of objects—ten balls, for example—may by separation and re-arrangement exhibit to our senses all the different sets of numbers the sums of which is equal to ten. All the improved methods of teaching arithmetic to children proceed on a knowledge of this fact. All who wish to carry the child’s mind along with them in learning arithmetic; all who wish to teach numbers, and not mere ciphers—now teach it through the evidence of the senses, in the manner we have described.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a strong}} link between {{acalculia}} and finger agnosia. Early in development, calculation begins with <b>our</b> <b>fingers.</b> The order <b>that</b> we use when we count with <b>our</b> <b>finger</b> is very specific and it is found {{in a variety of}} different cultures. The use of a base ten number system is also found in many cultures. Gerstmann believed that it was no coincidence the word digit means both a finger and any numeral.Rusconi et al. suggested that these two conditions co-occur because they are close in cortical territory. In their 2005 study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), they noted both finger agnosia and acalculia in the test subjects when areas of the intraparietal sulcus were stimulated. They concluded that the areas underlying finger agnosia and acalculia are extremely close to one another, but distinct. These areas receive blood from the same branch of the middle cerebral artery. Any damage to that blood supply would cause symptoms of both acalculia and finger agnosia.|$|R
40|$|ZAPATA ENGINEERING {{challenged}} our {{engineers and}} scientists, which included robotics expertise from Carnegie Mellon University, {{to design a}} solution to meet our client's requirements for rapid digital geophysical and radiological data collection of a munitions test range with no down-range personnel. A prime concern {{of the project was}} to minimize exposure of personnel to unexploded ordnance and radiation. The field season was limited by extreme heat, cold and snow. Geographical Information System (GIS) tools were used throughout this project to accurately define the limits of mapped areas, build a common mapping platform from various client products, track production progress, allocate resources and relate subsurface geophysical information to geographical features for use in rapidly reacquiring targets for investigation. We were hopeful that our platform could meet the proposed 35 acres per day, towing both a geophysical package and a radiological monitoring trailer. We held <b>our</b> breath and <b>crossed</b> <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> as the autonomous Speedrower began to crawl across the playa lakebed. We met our proposed production rate, and we averaged just less than 50 acres per 12 -hour day using the autonomous platform with a path tracking error of less than +/- 4 inches. Our project team mapped over 1, 800 acres in an 8 -week (4 days per week) timeframe. The expertise of our partner, Carnegie Mellon University, was recently demonstrated when their two autonomous vehicle entries finished second and third at the 2005 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge. 'The Grand Challenge program was established to help foster the development of autonomous vehicle technology that will some day help save the lives of Americans who are protecting our country on the battlefield', said DARPA Grand Challenge Program Manager, Ron Kurjanowicz. Our autonomous remote-controlled vehicle (ARCV) was a modified New Holland 2550 Speedrower retrofitted to allow the machine-actuated functions to be controlled by an onboard computer. The computer-controlled Speedrower was developed at Carnegie Mellon University to automate agricultural harvesting. Harvesting tasks require the vehicle to cover a field using minimally overlapping rows at slow speeds in a similar manner to geophysical data acquisition. The Speedrower had demonstrated its ability to perform as it had already logged hundreds of acres of autonomous harvesting. This project is the first use of autonomous robotic technology on a large-scale for geophysical surveying...|$|R

After tracking Deep Sensation for most of the way, Dunwoody sent Remittance Man into the lead on the run-in and the gelding won his thirteenth steeplechase from fourteen attempts, beating Deep Sensation by three and a half lengths. His victory was warmly received by the crowd and an emotional Henderson commented [...] "I honestly expected him to get beaten today, but he has class, and there was no rustiness at all about his jumping... we now must keep <b>our</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>that</b> he stays sound."

Despite returning lame after his fall at Cheltenham, Remittance Man started 9/4 joint favourite for the Melling Chase at Aintree three weeks later, but after several jumping errors he was virtually pulled up in the closing stages and came home last of the four finishers behind Katabatic.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the {{morphological}} optimization of the phalanges lengths of a robotic <b>finger,</b> <b>that</b> improves position and torque requirements of grasping tasks. We apply a black box optimizer {{that uses the}} kinematic and the dynamic of the fingers as a fitness function, to evaluate the best morphological configuration. The kinematic of the finger is modeled using a hybrid model based on the Denhavit-Hartenberg parameterization modified by Khalil and Kleinfinger and unified with quaternions formulation (DHKK-SQR) [1]. The dynamic model {{is based on the}} postulate of virtual displacements and virtual works [2]. Usage of DHKK-SQR model allows us to introduce soft joints and flexible phalanges in <b>our</b> robotic <b>finger.</b> Theoretical and experimental results show that soft links combined with morphological optimization, lead in more precise grasping.
