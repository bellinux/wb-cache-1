The particles have been dispersed {{in a variety of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>liquids</b> employing a wide range of surfactant materials. In non-aqueous <b>carrier</b> <b>liquids,</b> a single layer of surfactant is chemically adsorbed at the particle surface to effect steric stabilization. In aqueous media, a primary layer of chemisorbed surfactant interpenetrates a secondary layer which is physically adsorbed. This arrangement places hydrophilic charged groups at the surfactant/water interface, thereby maintaining a favourable interaction between the two phases. A wide variety of surfactants, including a range of straight-chain fatty acids, have been evaluated for use in aqueous magnetic fluids. Fluids incorporating up to 32 wt. % magnetite {{have been prepared}}. Stability towards dilution, changes in pH and quantity of dispersing agent have all been studied. Charge-stabilized magnetic fluids, in both acidic and alkaline aqueous media, have been investigated. Control of Fe(_ 3) O(_ 4) particle size, between 60 Ǻ and 80 Ǻ diameter, has-been achieved by altering the conditions under which precipitation occurs, namely temperature, reagent concentrations, viscosity and solvent composition. In addition, water was found to be capable of dispersing larger particles than organic <b>carrier</b> <b>liquids.</b> Particles as small as 30 Ǻ diameter have been prepared by in situ magnetite precipitation with naturally occurring polymeric surfactants, such as proteins and polysaccharides.

METHODS Primary human osteoblasts and periodontal ligament (PDL) cells were exposed to EMDs in both gel and <b>liquid</b> <b>carriers</b> and compared for their ability to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Alizarin red staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of genes encoding collagen 1, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2, as well as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2), transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, and interleukin (IL) - 1 β, were assessed. RESULTS EMDs in both carriers significantly increased cell proliferation of both osteoblasts and PDL cells in a similar manner. Both formulations also significantly upregulated the expression of genes encoding BMP 2 and TGF-β 1 as well as decreased the expression of IL- 1 β.

40|$|PURPOSE: Collagen barrier {{membranes}} {{were first}} introduced to regenerative periodontal and oral surgery to prevent fast ingrowing soft tissues (ie, epithelium and connective tissue) into the defect space. More recent attempts have aimed at combining collagen membranes with various biologics/growth factors {{to speed up}} the healing process and improve the quality of regenerated tissues. Recently, a new formulation of enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system (Osteogain) has demonstrated improved physico-chemical properties for the adsorption of enamel matrix derivative to facilitate protein adsorption to biomaterials. The aim of this pioneering study was to investigate the use of enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system in combination with collagen barrier membranes for its ability to promote osteoblast cell behavior in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Undifferentiated mouse ST 2 stromal bone marrow cells were seeded onto porcine-derived collagen membranes alone (control) or porcine membranes + enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system. Control and enamel matrix derivative-coated membranes were compared for cell recruitment and cell adhesion at 8 hours; cell proliferation at 1, 3, and 5 days; and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 3 and 14 days for genes encoding Runx 2, collagen 1 alpha 2, alkaline phosphatase, and bone sialoprotein. Furthermore, alizarin red staining was used to investigate mineralization. RESULTS: A significant increase in cell adhesion was observed at 8 hours for barrier membranes coated with enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system, whereas no significant difference could be observed for cell proliferation or cell recruitment. Enamel matrix derivative in a <b>liquid</b> <b>carrier</b> system significantly increased alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels 2. 5 -fold and collagen 1 alpha 2 levels 1. 7 -fold at 3 days, as well as bone sialoprotein levels twofold at 14 days postseeding.
