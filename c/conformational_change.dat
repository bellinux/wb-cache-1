5|$|Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit {{their target}} proteases by the typical {{competitive}} (lock-and-key) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual <b>conformational</b> <b>change,</b> which disrupts {{the structure of}} the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> involves the RCL moving to {{the opposite end of the}} protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule causes a <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
40|$|Protein {{interactions}} play {{important roles}} in {{various aspects of the}} molecular mech-anisms of biological processes. Protein docking techniques are used in pharmaceutical applications such as drug design to predict protein interactions especially for flexible proteins. <b>Conformational</b> shape <b>changes</b> occur in flexible proteins during interactions. Studies of protein flexibility show that <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> have a crucial influ-ence on protein docking. Most existing algorithms handle only side-chain flexibility, which accounts for a small amount of <b>conformational</b> <b>changes.</b> Treatment of backbone flexibility, which accounts for major <b>conformational</b> <b>changes,</b> remains a challenge. In this proposal, we propose to model the <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> in protein interactions. Proper modeling of <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> will allow flexible docking algorithm to produce more accurate predictions of protein interactions...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the best}} ways to detect <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> in {{proteins}} is to sandwich said protein between two fluorophores. FRET will respond to internal <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> result from reorientation of the fluorophore with respect to the other. Dumbrepatil sandwiched an estrogen receptor between a CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and a YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to study <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> of the receptor upon binding of a ligand.|$|R
40|$|SummaryProtein {{interactions}} are {{often accompanied by}} significant changes in conformation. We have analyzed the relationships between protein structures and the <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> they undergo upon binding. Based upon this, we introduce a simple measure, the relative solvent accessible surface area, {{which can be used}} to predict the magnitude of binding-induced <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> from the structures of either monomeric proteins or bound subunits. Applying this to a large set of protein complexes suggests that large <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> upon binding are common. In addition, we observe considerable enrichment of intrinsically disordered sequences in proteins predicted to undergo large <b>conformational</b> <b>changes.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that the relative solvent accessible surface area of monomeric proteins {{can be used as a}} simple proxy for protein flexibility. This reveals a powerful connection between the flexibility of unbound proteins and their binding-induced <b>conformational</b> <b>changes,</b> consistent with the conformational selection model of molecular recognition...|$|R
5|$|Protease-inhibition {{is thought}} to be the ancestral function, with non-inhibitory members the results of {{evolutionary}} neofunctionalisation of the structure. The S to R <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> has also been adapted by some binding serpins to regulate affinity for their targets.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins {{also use}} the serpin <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> {{as part of their}} function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding {{globulin}} has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
50|$|Protein {{adsorption}} {{often results}} in significant <b>conformational</b> <b>changes,</b> which refers {{to changes in the}} secondary, tertiary, and quartary structures of proteins. In addition to adsorption rates and amounts, orientation and conformation are of critical importance. These <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> can affect protein interaction with ligands, substrates, and antigens which are dependent on the orientation of the binding site of interest. These <b>conformational</b> <b>changes,</b> as a result of protein adsorption, can also denature the protein and change its native properties.|$|R

5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of biological processes, including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E

Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

40|$|Most ligand-gated {{channels}} exhibit desensitization, {{which is}} the progressive fading of ionic current in the prolonged presence of agonist. This process involves <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> that close the channel despite continued agonist binding. Despite the physiological and pathological importance of desensitization, {{little is known about}} the <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> that underlie this process in any Cys-loop ion channel receptor. Here we employed voltage clamp fluorometry to identify <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> that occur with a similar time course as the current desensitization rate in both slow-and fast-desensitizing alpha 1 glycine receptor chloride channels. Voltage clamp fluorometry provides a direct indication of <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> that occur in the immediate vicinity of residues labeled with environmentally sensitive fluorophores. We compared the rates of current desensitization and fluorescence changes at nine labeled extracellular sites in both wild type slow-desensitizing and mutated (A 248 L) fast-desensitizing glycine receptors. As labels attached to three sites at the interface between the ligand binding domain and transmembrane domain reported fluorescence responses that changed in parallel with the current desensitization rate, we concluded that they experienced local <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> associated with desensitization. These labeled sites included A 52 C in loop 2, Q 219 C in the pre-M 1 domain, and M 227 C in the M 1 domain. Activation and desensitization were accompanied by physically distinct <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> at each labeled site. Because activation is mediated by a specific reorganization of molecular interactions at the extracellular-transmembrane domain interface, we propose that desensitization is mediated by a distinct set of <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> that prevents this reorganization from occurring, thereby favoring channel closure...|$|R
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the <b>conformational</b> <b>change</b> is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a <b>conformational</b> <b>change.</b> Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a <b>conformational</b> <b>change,</b> RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

40|$|Glycine {{receptor}} chloride {{channels are}} Cys-loop receptor proteins that isomerize between a low affinity closed {{state and a}} high affinity ion-conducting state. There is currently much interest in understanding the mechanisms that link affinity changes with conductance changes.

However, it has proved difficult to convincingly distinguish those agonist-induced domain movements that are critical for triggering activation from those that are simply local deformations to accommodate ligands in the site. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> in the ligand-binding site in response to activation by glycine, which binds locally, and ivermectin, which binds in the transmembrane domain. We reasoned that ivermectin-mediated activation should initiate a conformational wave that propagates from the pore-lining domain towards the ligand-binding domain, eliciting <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> in those extracellular domains that are allosterically linked to the gate. We found that ivermectin indeed elicited <b>conformational</b> <b>changes</b> in ligand-binding domain loops C, D and F.
