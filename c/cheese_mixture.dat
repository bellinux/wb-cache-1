Disaronno is also often used to enhance the taste of tiramisu.|$|E
50|$|Sodium {{alginate}} {{is the one}} of {{the main}} ingredients that is responsible for Easy Cheese's pseudoplastic characteristics. More specifically, it contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the casein and salts. The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic calcium alginate. Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains. Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure. About 0.05-0.5% weight by volume of sodium alginate at a 5.4-5.7 range must be added to the <b>cheese</b> <b>mixture</b> to exhibit these properties during extrusion.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, {{this dish}} {{breaches}} the kosher laws (כַּשְׁרוּת; kashrut) observed by Judaism as it combines ground beef and <b>cheese.</b> <b>Mixtures</b> {{of milk and}} meat (בשר בחלב, basar bechalav, literally [...] "meat in milk") are prohibited according to Jewish religious law (הלכה; halakha), following a verse in the Book of Exodus in which Jews are forbidden from [...] "boiling a (kid) goat in its mother's milk". This prohibition appears again in Deuteronomy. [...] This dietary law sparked controversy in Jerusalem when McDonald's began opening franchises there that sold cheeseburgers. Since that time, McDonald's has opened both kosher and non-kosher restaurants in Israel.|$|R
50|$|Queso de mano is {{prepared}} {{using a combination}} of cow's milk and ewe's milk curd. The resulting product is called cuajada.

50|$|Easy Cheese is an oil-in-water emulsion. Oil {{droplets}} {{typically have}} {{a diameter of}} no more than one micrometer. Emulsions with large droplets like this tend to have a low-medium viscosity in comparison to smaller droplets whose emulsions have a higher viscosity. Heating the <b>cheese</b> <b>mixture</b> causes separation of the fats and protein of the cheese emulsion from destabilization. Emulsifying agents are made up of amphiphilic molecules that act as an interface to reduce the surface tension between hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules of the product to result in a uniform cheese spread that does not separate during storage. Cheese proteins that have denatured during processing are reestablished using melting salts. Sodium citrate and sodium phosphate are the main emulsifiers used in Easy Cheese to sequester calcium in cheddar cheese. This occurrence hydrates and solubilizes the casein, causing it to swell with water. The addition of these salts contributes to the uniformly creamy consistency of Easy Cheese.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} a reference method for the detection of cow milk in ewe and goat cheeses (EC 273 / 08) in order to protect manufacturers and consumers from adulterations and imitations, and to ensure alignment with the demands of domestic and EU markets. The method includes isolation of casein from cheese, isoelectric focusing of γ 2 - and γ 3 -casein originating from the hydrolysis of β-casein by plasmin, the detection and quantitative determination of γ-casein in cow, ewe and goat cheese by densitometry. Ewe or goat cheese products with a minimum of 1 % of cow milk are considered to be adulterated. For the quantitative determination of cow, ewe and goat milk in <b>cheeses,</b> standard <b>mixtures</b> of cow-ewe and cow-goat milk were made by adding 0; 0. 5; 1; 2; 5; 10; 25; 50; 75 and 100 % (v/v) of cow milk. The quantification was performed by determining the peak area ratio of cow γ-casein in comparison to ewe/goat casein in prepared standard cheeses. The calibration curves were calculated based on the relation of the peak area ratio of cow γ-caseins (calculated as the percentage of total γ-caseins) in contrast to the relative content (%) of cow milk in the mixture. The method proved to be adequate for the detection of raw and heat-treated cow milk in fresh and ripened cheeses made from ewe or goat milk, or a mixture of ewe and goat milk...|$|R

This paper comprehensively reviews and updates fundamental and applied aspects encompassing tech nological and organoleptic characteristics of AOP traditional cheeses manufactured in the Iberian Peninsula, from ovine and/or caprine milks. Those cheeses from Portugal and Spain can be divided into four distinctive groups, based on milk source and rennet type: (i) Azeitão, Castelo Branco, Évora, Nisa, Serpa, Serra da Estrela and La Serena cheeses, manufactured with raw ovine milk and coagulated via plant rennet; (ii) Terrincho, Idiazábal, Manchego, Roncal and Zamorano cheeses, elaborated with raw ovine milk and coagulated via animal rennet; (iii) Cabra Transmontano and Majorero cheeses, manufac tured with raw caprine milk and coagulated via animal rennet; and (iv) Amarelo da Beira Baixa, Picante da Beira Baixa and Rabaçal <b>cheeses,</b> manufactured with <b>mixtures</b> of raw ovine and caprine milks and coagulated via animal rennet. Considerable differences between Portuguese and Spanish AOP cheeses exist; the former are, in general, characterized by softer consistencies and similarities to one another in terms of manufacturing protocols (usually encompassing coagulation of plain raw milk followed by slow draining of the curd), whereas the latter are, in general, larger and firmer...|$|R

All lysozyme containing films prevented {{the increase of}} L. monocytogenes counts in Kashar cheese for 8 weeks at 4 °C, {{but it was only}} the zein-wax composite films with sustained lysozyme-release rates which caused a significant reduction (- 0. 4 decimals) in initial microbial load of inoculated <b>cheese</b> samples. The <b>mixture</b> of catechin and gallic acid improved the in vitro antimicrobial effect of films against L. monocytogenes, but showed no considerable antimicrobial effect in cheese. However, the films containing catechin and gallic acid were effective in preventing oxidative changes in cheese. This study showed the possibility of increasing safety and quality of fresh cheeses by use of active packaging employing natural antimicrobial compounds and controlled release technology. Industrial relevance There has been a growing interest to develop the functional properties of packaging materials and to obtain packed foods with better shelf-life and quality. Active packaging incorporating antimicrobials {{is one of the most}} promising areas since application of this method can improve safety of foods by inhibiting pathogenic bacteria or controlling spoilage flora by using minimum amounts of active compounds. Recently, health concerns of consumers and environmental problems related to plastics increased the popularity of using natural antimicrobial substances in edible films and coatings.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 1 st International Conference on Food Digestion celebrado en Cesena (Italia) del 19 al 21 {{de marzo de}} 2012. During cheese ripening, casein is hydrolyzed into a large {{variety of}} {{peptides}} by proteases and peptidases from milk, rennet, starter culture and secondary microbial flora. These peptides are characteristic of each cheese type and ripening time and are in part responsible of the typical and differentiating organoleptic characteristics of cheese. Some of these peptides {{are known to be}} partially resistant to digestion or they can act as precursors of the peptides that finally are absorbed. Different studies performed at our laboratory aimed the identification of the major peptides generated after two-step hydrolysis process that simulates gastrointestinal digestion of different Spanish cheeses. These include: Manchego cheese which is a hard or semi-hard variety made from ewe's milk; Serena cheese which is elaborated with ewe's milk and vegetal rennet; Tetilla cheese is made from bovine milk and animal rennet and a <b>cheeses</b> made from <b>mixtures</b> of caprine, ovine and bovine milk (Iberian and Valdeon cheeses). Therefore, the degree of proteolysis and the peptidic profile before simulated digestion was different and distinctive for each cheese type and ripening time. After digestion, the water soluble extracts were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3000 Da membrane and the permeates were analyzed by HPLC coupled to tandem spectrometry. Many homologous sequences were found in the ultrafiltrates of the water soluble extracts although they were obtained from different cheese types. There are casein regions specially resistant to hydrolysis that were found in many of these studies such as, k¿-casein f(134 - 139) HLPLPL; k-casein f(47 - 52) DKIHPF; k-casein f(114 - 119) YPVEPF. Interestingly, some of the most often peptides found had been previously been reported with a given bioactivity as antihypertensive, opioid or with antiallergenic properties. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
