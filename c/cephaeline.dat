50|$|<b>Cephaeline</b> is a desmethyl analog of emetine {{also found}} in ipecac root.|$|E
50|$|Ipecacuanha {{contains}} the alkaloids emetine (methylcephaeline) and <b>cephaeline.</b> It also contains {{contains the}} pseudo-tannin ipecacuanhic acid or cephaëlic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cephaeline</b> in {{the form}} of syrup of ipecac was once {{commonly}} recommended as an emergency treatment for accidental poisoning, but its use has been phased out due to its ineffectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>cephaeline</b> and emetine {{come from}} two main biosynthesis pathways: the biosynthesis of Dopamine from L-tyrosine and the biosynthesis of secologanin from geranyl diphosphate. Biosynthesis begins from the reaction between dopamine and secologanin forming N-deacetylisoipecoside (S-form) and N-deacetylipecoside (R-form). The S-form then {{goes through a}} Pictet-Spengler type reaction followed {{by a series of}} O-methylations and the removal of glucose, with O-methyltransferases and a glycosidase, to form proemetine. Proemetine then reacts with another dopamine molecule to form 7'-O-demethylcephaeline. The final products are then produced with a 7'-O-methylation to make <b>cephaeline</b> and a 6'-O-methylation successively to make emetine.|$|E
50|$|The {{actions of}} ipecac are mainly those of major alkaloids, emetine (methylcephaeline) and <b>cephaeline.</b> They both act locally by irritating the gastric mucosa and {{centrally}} by stimulating the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone to induce vomiting.|$|E
50|$|Early use of emetine was in {{the form}} of oral {{administration}} of the extract of ipecac root, or ipecacuanha. This extract was originally thought to contain only one alkaloid, emetine, but was found to contain several, including <b>cephaeline,</b> psychotrine and others. Although this therapy was reportedly successful, the extract caused vomiting in many patients which reduced its utility. In some cases, it was given with opioids to reduce nausea. Other suggestions to reduce nausea involved coating the drug to allow it to be released after digestion in the stomach.|$|E
50|$|Emetine dihydrochloro hydrate {{is used in}} the {{laboratory}} to block protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It does this by binding to the 40S subunit of the ribosome. This can thus be used in the study of protein degradation in cells. Mutants resistant to emetine are altered in the 40S ribosomal subunit (S14 protein), and they exhibit cross-resistance to cryptopleurine, tylocrebrine, <b>cephaeline</b> and tubulosine, but not other inhibitors of protein synthesis. The compounds to which these mutants exhibit cross-resistance have been shown to share common structural determinants with emetine that are responsible for their biological activities.|$|E
40|$|Ipecac {{alkaloids}} {{produced in}} the medicinal plant Psychotria ipecacuanha, such as emetine and <b>cephaeline,</b> possess a monoterpenoid-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton, which is formed by condensation of dopamine and secologanin. The condensation products are deglucosylated, and the resulting aglycon is further processed to protoemetine, which is condensed with the second molecule of dopamine, followed by conversion into <b>cephaeline</b> and emetine. Although four hydroxy groups derived from two molecules of dopamine need to be methylated to form emetine, the order of O-methylation reactions had been veiled. We recently identified three Ipecac alkaloid O-methyltransferases (IpeOMT 1 -IpeOMT 3) that are sufficient for catalyzing O-methylations of all four hydroxy groups. Detailed characterization of their catalytic properties with integration of that of the previously identified Ipecac alkaloid β-glucosidase (IpeGlu 1) revealed {{a large portion of}} the biosynthetic pathway of Ipecac alkaloids. The results provide proof-of-concept to the significance and the usefulness of the biosynthetic pathway strategy by EST analysis coupled with recombinant enzyme characterization. At the same time, however, the results raised an intriguing question about the subcellular network between the biosynthetic enzymes and intermediates. Here, we provide additional discussion about this point and indicate what remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|The {{medicinal}} plant Psychotria ipecacuanha produces ipecac alkaloids, {{a series of}} monoterpenoid-isoquinoline alkaloids such as emetine and <b>cephaeline,</b> whose biosynthesis derives from condensation of dopamine and secologanin. Here, we identified three cDNAs, IpeOMT 1 –IpeOMT 3, encoding ipecac alkaloid O-methyltransferases (OMTs) from P. ipecacuanha. They were coordinately transcribed with the recently identified ipecac alkaloid β-glucosidase Ipeglu 1. Their amino acid sequences were closely {{related to each other}} and rather to the flavonoid OMTs than to the OMTs involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Characterization of the recombinant IpeOMT enzymes with integration of the enzymatic properties of the IpeGlu 1 revealed that emetine biosynthesis branches off from N-deacetylisoipecoside through its 6 -O-methylation by IpeOMT 1, with a minor contribution by IpeOMT 2, followed by deglucosylation by IpeGlu 1. The 7 -hydroxy group of the isoquinoline skeleton of the aglycon is methylated by IpeOMT 3 prior to the formation of protoemetine that is condensed with a second dopamine molecule, followed by sequential O-methylations by IpeOMT 2 and IpeOMT 1 to form <b>cephaeline</b> and emetine, respectively. In addition to this central pathway of ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis, formation of all methyl derivatives of ipecac alkaloids in P. ipecacuanha could be explained by the enzymatic activities of IpeOMT 1 –IpeOMT 3, indicating that they are sufficient for all O-methylation reactions of ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Carapichea {{ipecacuanha}} produces various emetine-type alkaloids, {{known as}} ipecac alkaloids, which {{have long been}} used as expectorants, emetics, and amebicides. In this study, we isolated an O-methyltransferase cDNA from this medicinal plant. The encoded protein (CiOMT 1) showed 98 % sequence identity to IpeOMT 2, which catalyzes the 7 ′-O-methylation of 7 ′-O-demethylcephaeline to form <b>cephaeline</b> at the penultimate step of emetine biosynthesis (Nomura and Kutchan, J. Biol. Chem., 285, 7722 – 7738 (2010)). Recombinant CiOMT 1 showed both 7 ′-O-methylation and 6 ′-O-methylation activities at the last two steps of emetine biosynthesis. This indicates that small differences in amino acid residues are responsible for distinct regional methylation specificities between IpeOMT 2 and CiOMT 1, and that CiOMT 1 might contribute to two sequential O-methylation steps from 7 ′-O-demethylcephaeline to emetine...|$|E
40|$|A {{versatile}} {{method for}} the quantitation of emetine and <b>cephaeline</b> in biological samples is described. Two milliliters of samples containing N-propylprocainamide as the internal standard are buffered to pH 9 and extracted with n-butyl chloride. After subsequent back extraction into 0. 01 M hydrochloric acid, {{a portion of}} the acid layer is analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Routinely, the minimum level of detection for both drugs is 5 ng/mL and linearity is demonstrated from 5 to 2500 ng/mL. Apparatus A Varian 5000 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Rheodyne model 7125 injector was used. The compounds were separated on a 15 -cm x 4. 6 -mm 5 # Uhrasphere ODS column from Rainin Instruments. The detector was a Perkin Elmer 650 - 10 S spectrofluorometer equipped with an 18 -#L flow cell...|$|E
40|$|Emetine is the {{principal}} alkaloid of ipecacuanha root which is obtained from the plant known botanically as Psychotria Ipecacuanha, also called Cephaelis Ipecacuanha, indigenous to Brazil, and from Psychotria Acuminata found in Colombia, both members of the Rubiaceous Order. In this root emetine is accompanied by <b>cephaeline</b> and, in much smaller amount, by psychotrine, 0 =methylpsychotrine and emetamine, the five alkaloids being closely {{related to each other}} chemically. The two chief medicinal properties of ipecacuanha root, namely its emetic effect and its ability to alleviate dysentery, have long been known, the name “ipecacuanha” itself being derived through Portugese from a native word meaning “road-side sick-making plant”. It is with the investigations into the constitution of the ipecacuanha alkaloids, and particularly with the modern work in this field, that we are concerned in the present dissertation. From considerations of space, in the historical survey much must necessarily be disregarded which to the present author seems irrelevant to the main issue, and in particular on account of the work of many early investigators will be omitted because in no way do their results appear to have disclosed anything of fundamental importance. A chapter is to be included recording the development, scope and modern position of the technique of dehydrogenation, a technique which forms the basis of a large section of the present investigation of which this thesis is a record...|$|E
40|$|Ipecac {{alkaloids}} {{produced in}} the medicinal plant Psychotria ipecacuanha such as emetine and <b>cephaeline</b> possess a monoterpenoid-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton, which is formed by condensation of dopamine and secologanin. Deglucosylation {{of one of the}} condensed products N-deacetylisoipecoside (1 α(S) -epimer) {{is considered to be a}} part of the reactions for emetine biosynthesis, whereas its 1 β(R) -epimer N-deacetylipecoside is converted to ipecoside in P. ipecacuanha. Here, we isolated a cDNA clone Ipeglu 1 encoding Ipecac alkaloid β-d-glucosidase from P. ipecacuanha. The deduced protein showed 54 and 48 % identities to raucaffricine β-glucosidase and strictosidine β-glucosidase, respectively. Recombinant IpeGlu 1 enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed glucosidic Ipecac alkaloids except for their lactams, but showed poor or no activity toward other substrates, including terpenoid-indole alkaloid glucosides. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of deglucosylated products of N-deacetylisoipecoside revealed spontaneous transitions of the highly reactive aglycons, one of which was supposed to be the intermediate for emetine biosynthesis. IpeGlu 1 activity was extremely poor toward 7 -O-methyl and 6, 7 -O,O-dimethyl derivatives. However, 6 -O-methyl derivatives were hydrolyzed as efficiently as non-methylated substrates, suggesting the possibility of 6 -O-methylation prior to deglucosylation by IpeGlu 1. In contrast to the strictosidine β-glucosidase that stereospecifically hydrolyzes 3 α(S) -epimer in terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis, IpeGlu 1 lacked stereospecificity for its substrates where 1 β(R) -epimers were preferred to 1 α(S) -epimers, although ipecoside (1 β(R)) is a major alkaloidal glucoside in P. ipecacuanha, suggesting the compartmentalization of IpeGlu 1 from ipecoside. These facts have significant implications for distinct physiological roles of 1 α(S) - and 1 β(R) -epimers and for the involvement of IpeGlu 1 in the metabolic fate of both of them...|$|E
