40|$|Contractors {{occasionally}} substitute {{reinforcement bars}} during construction works, {{perhaps as a}} result of unavailability of the design-specified bars. As a result, this study have explored the basis, extent and the conditions for the mutual substitution of reinforcing bar groups of equivalent area but different bar diameters in reinforced concrete beams. A total of (20) concrete beams including the control beams were cast. These comprise (2) each of 100 mm× 100 mm× 500 mm and 150 mm× 150 mm× 750 mm beams as plain concrete (control beams) and (2) each of 100 mm× 100 mm× 500 mm and 150 mm× 150 mm× 750 mm beams were reinforced in turn with 20 mm, 16 mm, 12 mm and 10 mm bar diameters. The beams were subjected to <b>centre-point</b> <b>loading</b> using bending testing machine, in accordance with BS 1881 - 118 and with the load and compressive strain recorded to the point of failure. The results of the test beams showed that the greatest difference in the area of reinforcement between beams reinforced with 9 Y 12 bars (bar area = 1020 mm 2) and 3 Y 20 bars (bar area = 943 mm 2) is 7. 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Experimental {{study on}} the {{influence}} of fibre content on crack behaviour and propagation in synthetic-fibre reinforced beams has been reported in this paper. The tensile behaviour of metallic fibre concrete is evaluated in terms of residual flexural tensile strength values determined from the load-crack mouth opening displacement curve or load-deflection curve obtained by applying a <b>centre-point</b> <b>load</b> on a simply supported notched prism. The results achieved demonstrate that an increase in fibre content has an almost negligible effect on compressive and tensile splitting properties, causes a marginal increment in flexural tensile strength and increasesthe Re 3 value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Structure {{strength}} and deformation of the preliminary hydraulic press design have been calculated by the finite element method, {{in which two}} working conditions have been considered, i. e. the <b>centre-point</b> <b>load</b> condition and the eccentric load condition. To solve the surplus structure strength globally and the localized stress concentration, the combined methodology of mathematical programming algorithm and the FEM has been utilized to redesign the hydraulic press. The optimization result shows that {{the mass of the}} press has been reduced greatly and the localized stress concentration has been eliminated. Besides that, the {{strength and}} stiffness in the optimized structure still meet the performance requirements...|$|R
