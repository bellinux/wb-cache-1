5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

5|$|Rome's revenue equaled {{the amount}} of the {{successful}} bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E
5|$|Tirano Banderas is a 1926 {{novel by}} Spanish writer Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan (aka Valle-Inclan or Valle). Although was {{published}} in Madrid (Spain), this novel is influenced by Facundo by Ramon Sarmiento {{and it is the}} first of dictator novels. It recounts the fall of the South American dictator Santos Banderas, which directs the fictitious region of Santa Fe de Tierra Firme of despotic mode and <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> staying in power through terror and oppression. The work describes the behavior of the tyrant and the beginning of a revolutionary movement that will eventually overthrow him before his clumsiness.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} of Henry's focus on his planned campaign against Nicaea to attack Thessalonica. At the head of Latin mercenaries, he captured the constable of the Kingdom of Thessalonica and baron of Domokos, the Lombard Amé Buffa, and a hundred of his companions. He {{is alleged to have}} been excessively <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> his prisoners, killing or whipping many of them, while Buffa, his confessor, and three other nobles were crucified. Michael's army proceeded to capture several fortresses and kill the Latin garrisons, including priests. Enraged, Henry sped to Thessalonica's aid, covering the distance from Constantinople in only twelve days. Michael in the meantime had allied himself with the Bulgarian ruler Strez, but they were defeated by Henry. It is possible that during this campaign, Henry was assisted by his vassals from Achaea, thereby explaining the reference in the Pope's correspondence of Achaean barons fighting against Michael, rather than assuming an Epirote expedition to the Peloponnese. The Latin Emperor wrested lands from both allies, but was forced to cut short his campaign and return to Constantinople, which was being threatened by the Bulgarian emperor Boril. Henry left Thessalonica in the charge of his brother Eustace and of Berthold of Katzenelnbogen, who then defeated another invasion by Strez, supported with troops from his brother Boril. Disquieted by the Bulgarian attacks on Thessalonica, Michael switched sides and joined the Latins in defeating the Bulgarians at Pelagonia. It is commonly assumed that during these conflicts, Michael terminated his vassalage to the Latin Empire; historian Philip Van Tricht however points out that there are no sources for this, and that this vassalage may have survived until 1217, when Michael's brother Theodore captured Latin Emperor Peter II of Courtenay near Dyrrhachium.|$|E

25|$|Throughout history {{individuals}} have condemned various practices that they {{considered to be}} <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> animals.

25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> animals.

Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, {{on the grounds that}} animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).|$|E
25|$|Some {{techniques}} of intensive agriculture may be <b>cruel</b> <b>to</b> animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
