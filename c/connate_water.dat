Mature and immature subgroups were formed {{on the basis of}} dissolved (semi) volatile organic compounds. The oldest (<b>connate)</b> <b>waters</b> form one group with a small number of samples. The subgroups containing different small molecular-sized soluble aromatics differ sharply in their chemical features (sodium, hydrogen carbonate, iodine, ammonium etc. content). The origin of the organic matter may differ in the subgroups as inferred by their different δ 18 O values and ten times greater halogen contents. Our results show that the decomposition of organic matter produces small molecular-sized aromatic compounds and also influences the amounts of inorganic components in thermal waters, through the increase of feldspar hydrolysis and carbonate dissolution. ...|$|R

In general, total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations increase with depth. Most deep groundwaters classified as brines (having total dissolved solids {{equal to or greater}} than that of seawater) are predominantly sodium chloride type. However, the predominance of chloride usually increases with increasing TDS, at the expense of sulfate. The ratio of calcium to sodium usually increases with depth.|$|E
5000|$|Most mineral vein {{systems are}} a result of {{repeated}} natural fracturing during periods of relatively high pore fluid pressure. The impact of high pore fluid pressure on the formation process of mineral vein systems is particularly evident in [...] "crack-seal" [...] veins, where the vein material is part of a series of discrete fracturing events, and extra vein material is deposited on each occasion. One example of long-term repeated natural fracturing is in the effects of seismic activity. Stress levels rise and fall episodically, and earthquakes can cause large volumes of <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> to be expelled from fluid-filled fractures. This process is referred to as [...] "seismic pumping".|$|E
50|$|The {{change in}} voltage through the well bore {{is caused by}} a buildup of charge on the well bore walls. Clays and shales (which are {{composed}} predominantly of clays) will generate one charge and permeable formations such as sandstone will generate an opposite one. Spontaneous potentials occur when two aqueous solutions with different ionic concentrations are placed in contact through a porous, semi-permeable membrane. In nature, ions tend to migrate from high to low ionic concentrations. In the case of SP logging, the two aqueous solutions are the well bore fluid (drilling mud) and the formation water (<b>connate</b> <b>water).</b> The potential opposite shales is called the baseline, and typically shifts only slowly over the depth of the borehole.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examined}} physical, geochemical and geological features, {{and fluid}} expulsion processes of fossil seep carbonates and recent mud volcanoes {{in the northern}} Apennines. Chaotic brecciated deposits associated with short “eruptive” periods of the Modena-Reggio mud volcanoes (Regnano) are debris flows made of polygenic breccias floating in a viscous mud. These deposits show a number of analogies with monogenic and polygenic brecciated lithofacies of the Miocene methane derived authigenic carbonates of the northern Apennines. Similarities between the examined fossil seep carbonates and mud volcanoes include also the type of fluids which consist mainly of methane mixed with <b>connate</b> <b>waters</b> and clay mud, and their isotopic signatures strongly depleted in δ 13 C values. The comparison between recent and fossil diapiric-related structures has been useful for constraining {{the nature of the}} fossil seepage pathway, understanding fluid expulsion processes and reconstructing models of chemoherm evolution. In particular, this investigation suggests that brecciated structures and exotic clasts in ancient chemoherms are due to the offscraping and chaotic mixing of sediments during the rapid rise of methanogenic fluids along diapiric conduits or fractures, following similar processes and mechanisms as in chaotic deposits associated with mud volcanoes...|$|R
40|$|Water {{level and}} water {{salinity}} (expressed as electrical conductivity, EC) {{of the two}} Adra lagoons -"Honda" and "Nueva"- have been periodically recorded during the years 7999 and 2000. EC was also measured {{in a number of}} open wells and shallow piezometers around the lagoons. Data obtained have been compared with previous EC measures, dating back to 1 984. Salinity evolution in the lagoons is mainly conditioned by evaporation and rain-induced dillution effects. Evaporative concentration is comparatively less intense in the Nueva lagoon, due to its higher water storage. Dillution is more effective in the Honda lagoon because of the Incidence of esporadic runoff which doesn't affect to the Nueva. Then, the range in EC variations is higher in the Honda than in the Nueva, and the seasonal evolution can show different trends during the normal hydroperiod. As an average, the salinity in both lagoons is fairly {{similar to that of the}} shallow groundwater in the sector of the aquifer where the lakes are located (mean values of 3 - 7 mS/cm of EC).

50|$|In any matrix {{which has}} some porosity, the pore spaces {{will be filled}} with a fluid of oil, gas (either {{hydrocarbon}} or otherwise) or formation water (sometimes referred to as <b>connate</b> <b>water).</b> This fluid will saturate the rock and change its electrical properties. A wireline resistivity tool direct injects current(lateralog-type tools for conductive water based muds) or induces (induction-type tools for resistive or oil based muds) an electric current into the surrounding rock and determines the resistivity via ohm's law. The resistivity of the formation is used primarily to identify pay zones containing highly resistive hydrocarbons {{as opposed to those}} containing water, which is generally more conductive. It is also useful for determining the location of the oil-water contact in a reservoir. Most wireline tools are able to measure the resistivity at several depths of investigation into the bore hole wall, allowing log analysts to accurately predict the level of fluid invasion from the drilling mud, and thus determine a qualitative measurement of permeability.|$|E

Weathering of silicate minerals such as anorthite, Na+ and K+ feldspar additionally increases {{the concentration of}} HCO 3 − in groundwater samples from the upstream of the Amaravathi River basin, and in the downstream (Fig.  4 c), the relatively high concentration of HCO 3 − {{is due to the}} direct mixing of municipal sewages and industrial drainage from Karur region. The Cl− concentration of groundwater samples in both the seasons is found above the acceptable limit. About 87 % samples are not suitable for drinking purposes. Elevated amounts of Cl− in water are usually taken as an indicator of pollution and considered as the foundation of groundwater contamination. Geologically significant sources of chloride are appetite, sodalite, <b>connate</b> <b>waters,</b> and hot springs. Higher concentration was observed in the downstream of the Amaravathi River Basin (Fig.  4 d), mainly due to the surface overspill from farming land, sewage and municipal wastes, and effluents from dyeing and bleaching industries.

The results indicate {{that most of the}} chlorine is not derived from the dominant granitoid that host the geothermal system.

40|$|The {{immiscible}} {{displacement of}} oil by {{water in a}} petroleum reservoir has been simulated in the laboratory using a consolidated porous medium constructed out of silica sand particles. Four distinct displacement flow modes were employed, namely horizontal, vertical upward, vertical downward, and transverse. Experiments were carried out by displacing the oil phase (heavy paraffin oil) by the aqueous phase (dyed glycerol solution) at different oil/water viscosity ratios, at different flow rates, and in the presence and absence of <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> (<b>connate</b> <b>water</b> is the name given to the very small amount of water that occurs naturally in petroleum reservoirs). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of viscosity ratio, flow rate, and flow mode on the oil recovery efficiency. In the absence of <b>connate</b> <b>water,</b> a decrease in the oil recovery is observed when the oil/water viscosity ratio increases for all four flow modes but the displacement patterns are different for each flow mode. In the presence of <b>connate</b> <b>water,</b> the dependence of oil recovery on viscosity ratio is similar although in this case the displacement patterns are almost indistinguishable for the four different flow modes on account of coalescence of the <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> phase with the displacing aqueous phase. Without <b>connate</b> <b>water,</b> the highest recovery is obtained in the vertical upward mode where the buoyancy forces stabilize the displacement process. Conversely, in the vertical downward flow mode, the instability promoted by gravity leads to a low recovery. Comparison of the results obtained with and without <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> shows that <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> has a negative effect on the recovery and, moreover, that the synergistic effect between the viscosity ratio and the <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> reduces the oil recovery efficiency significantly...|$|E

Fluorine only shows relatively high concentrations atelevated chlorine and bromine concentrations showing that fluorine, chlorine and bromine are possibly controlled by the same processes. Iodine does not correlate with any of the other halogens indicating that unique processes control iodine. Key geological parameters that influence chlorine and bromine (and possibly fluorine) concentrations are the presence of salt in a basin, the age of the reservoir unit and the kerogen-type within the main hydrocarbon source rock in a basin. The presence of salt in a basin shows that sea water was evaporated to halite saturation producing <b>connate</b> <b>waters</b> with high concentrations of chlorine and bromine. The presence of salt also leads to high salinity waters through water-salt interaction during burial and diagenesis. Tertiary reservoirs typically have much lower chlorine and bromine concentrations than Mesozoic or Palaeozoic reservoirs. The age of the reservoir unit may simply reflect he different amounts of time available for formation water to interact with salt. The dominance of type II marine kerogen in a basin leads to higher bromine concentrations. This ma...|$|R

The composition of all water samples collected from the sea bottom is close to that of sea water. Nevertheless, it was possible to estimate the thermal endmember composition by extrapolating the sulfate concentration to zero. This endmember is similar in chemical composition both to waters of the Rio Purificacion and La Tuna thermal springs, located to the South along the Pacific coast of the Jalisco Block, and to pore waters from the deep-sea drilling cores from some accretionary complexes. Gas composition as well as isotopic composition of He and carbon from CO 2, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 suggests an essentially thermo-biogenic origin for the gas and the presence of a high proportion of radiogenic, crustal helium. Isotopic composition of He in the Punta de Mita gas (0. 4 Ra) is the lowest ever measured in Mexican hydrothermal gases. These findings do not support the idea that there exists a direct connection between the Punta de Mita springs and the last volcanic events which occurred in this area at V 3 Ma.

The {{results show that the}} ultimate oil recovery in test # 4 (Swi[*]=[*] 0.33) is higher than that in test # 1 (Swi[*]=[*] 0). These results indicated the positive effect of <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> in the RF of oil in the imbibition test using low-salinity water as imbibing fluid; However, there is no monotonic relationship between ultimate oil recovery and initial water saturation (as presented in Fig.  3). The presence of <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> in the core acts as a conductive layer that provides more efficient interaction between rock surface and imbibition fluid. In the other words, the <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> in the pores bridges between the oil-wet pores and injected brine, such that the ion interaction between brine and oil-wet pore, and thus, the wettability alteration process occurs more efficiently. However, it seems that if the amount of initial water in the porous media is higher than a certain value, then the injected brine more likely flows through the pores occupied by <b>connate</b> <b>water</b> (already water-wet pores). In this case, the oil-wet pores {{are less likely to be}} influenced by injected brine and so the wettability alteration of these pores remains unchanged. This difference in the water saturation is shown in Fig.  4, schematically.

Pore waters in the Fraser River delta sediments appear to be <b>connate</b> <b>waters,</b> and the concentration of major ions (Cl-, Mg 2 +, Na ÷) reflects the degree of mixing of meteoric water and marine water that occurred at the sediment-water interface as the sediments were deposited. De-viations from simple mixing of meteoric and marine water are ob-served for Ca 2 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, SOl, and HCOj, suggesting diagenetic modification of the pore water since sediment deposition. Although Na + concentrations appear {{to be controlled by}} simple mixing rather than by diagenetic reactions, examination of reactions between clay minerals and water suggests that pore waters are in cation exchange quilibrium with smectite. Some chemical modification of the pore waters has oc-curred subsequent o sediment deposition, but there is no chemical evidence ither for extensive meteoric-water flushing of the sediments or for tidal influxes of marine water into the sediments. Framboidal pyrite and calcite are the only diagenetic minerals ob-served in the sediments. Calcite concretions formed at, or near, the sediment-water interface in distributary channels. Calcite in carbonate concretions is depleted in 13 C, relative to PDB, because of oxidation near the surface of 13 C-depleted methane formed at greater depths by methanogenesis.

40|$|Presently {{non-commercial}} {{occurrences of}} Mississippi Valley-type ore assemblages in the Middle Silurian strata of the Niagara Peninsula have been studied. Based on this detailed study, a new poly-stage genetic model is proposed which relates ore mineralization in carbonate environments {{to the evolution}} of the sedimentary basin. Sulphide ore mineralization occurred during two episodes: 1. During the late diagenesis stage, which is characterized by compaction-maturation of the sediments, the initial mineralization took place by upward and outward movement of <b>connate</b> <b>waters.</b> Metals were probably supplied from all the sediments regardless of their specific lithologies. However, clay minerals were possibly the main contributors. The possible source of sulphur was from petroleum-type hydrocarbons presently mixed with the sediments at the site of ore deposition. Evidence for this {{is the fact that the}} greatest abundance of ore minerals is in petroliferous carbonates. The hydrocarbons probably represent liquids remaining after upward migration to the overlying Guelph-Salina reservoirs. The majority of sphalerite and galena formed during this period, as well as accessory pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, arsenopyrite, and pyrrhotite; and secondary dolomite, calcite, celestite, and gypsum. 2. During the presently ongoing surface erosion and weathering phase, which is marked by the downward movement of groundwater, preexisting sulphides were probably remobilized, and trace amounts of lead and zinc were leached from the host material, by groundwaters. Metal sulphides precipitated at, or below, the water table, or where atmospheric oxygen could raise the Eh of groundwaters to the point where soluble metal complexes are unstable and native sulphur co-precipitates with sphalerite and galena. This process, which can be observed today, also results in the transport and deposition of the host rock material. Breakdown of pre-existing sulphide and sulphate, as well as hydrocarbon present in the host rock, provided sulphur necessary for sulphide precipitation.

40|$|The shallow-marine {{carbonate}} {{rocks of}} the Jandaíra Formation {{have been subject}} to significant permeability variations through time due to various events of fracturing and calcite cementation. As a consequence, the Jandaíra Formation accommodated fluid flow only during specific moments in time. We reconstructed these episodes of fluid flow based on isotope characterizations and microscope characteristics of calcite veins and host rock cements. The Jandaíra Formation, which belongs to the post-rift sequence of the Potiguar Basin in northeast Brazil, was deposited from the Turonian onward until a marine regression exposed it in the Campanian. Due to the subaerial exposure, meteoric waters flushed out marine <b>connate</b> <b>waters,</b> leading to an event of early diagenesis and full cementation of the Jandaíra Formation. Fluid flow through the resulting impermeable carbonate formation appears to be closely related to fracturing. Fracturing in the Late Cretaceous induced a drastic increase in permeability, giving rise to extensive fluid circulation. Host rock dissolution associated to the circulating fluids led to calcite vein cementation within the fracture network, causing it to regain an impermeable and sealing character. In the research area, fluid flow occurred during early burial of the Jandaíra Formation at estimated depths of 400 – 900 m. This study documents the first application of fluid inclusion isotope analysis on vein precipitates, which allowed full isotopic characterization of the paleo-fluids responsible for calcite vein cementation. The fluid inclusion isotope data indicate that upwelling of groundwater from the underlying Açu sandstones provided the fluids to the fracture network. In Miocene times, renewed tectonic compression of a lower intensity created a secondary fracture network in the Jandaíra Formation. The density of this fracture network, however, was too low to induce a new episode of fluid circulation. As a result, this tectonic event is associated with the development of barren extensional fractures...|$|R
