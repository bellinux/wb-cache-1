40|$|Introduction Patient safety {{efforts are}} often {{recommended}} solely on {{judgments about the}} relative importance of particular adverse events in hospital care, without considering the frequency and costs of all hospital-acquired illness and injury. The objective {{of the study was to}} use patient-level cost data to estimate relative economic priorities for hospital inpatient safety efforts. Methods Patient level costs are estimated using computerized patient costing systems that initially log individual utilization of inpatient services, and then apply sophisticated cost estimates from the hospital's general ledger. The occurrence of a hospital-acquired diagnosis is identified using a new Australian 'condition-onset' flag for all diagnoses not present on admission. These diagnoses are grouped to yield a comprehensive set of 144 categories of hospital-acquired conditions, using a recently-developed algorithm to summarize data coded with ICD- 10 -AM. Standard linear regression techniques are used to identify the independent contribution to inpatient costs of hospital- acquired conditions, taking into account the case mix of a sample of acute inpatients (n = 1, 699, 997) treated in Australian public hospitals in Victoria (2005 / 06) and Queensland (2006 / 07). Results The most costly types of adverse events were post-procedure endocrine and metabolic disorders, adding $A 21, 869 to the cost of an episode, followed by (methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus) MRSA (+$A 19, 892) and enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (+$A 19, 745). Aggregate additional costs to the system were highest for septicaemia (+$A 41. 5 mil), complications of <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>implants</b> other than septicaemia (+$A 28. 7 mil), acute lower respiratory infections [...] including influenza and pneumonia ($A 28. 0 mil) [...] and UTI (+$A 24. 7 mil). Hospital acquired complications are estimated to add 17. 1 % to the costs of treatment in this sample. Conclusion Patient safety efforts frequently focus on dramatic but rare complications with very serious patient harms. Adding an economic dimension to priority-setting could result in changes to the priorities of patient safety programs. It could also provide guidance as to other areas where research into causes and prevention strategies may prove a productive investment. Financial information should be combined with information on patient harms to allow for cost-utility evaluation of future programs. Full Tex...|$|R

Cell viability achieved for all the studied synthetic polymers allowed their frame in biocompatible material category. Cell morphology did not significantly change, thus accomplishing a new biocompatibility criterion. The degree of biocompatibility of the studied polymers varied. Polyvinyl alcohol presented the highest grade of biocompatibility and polyvinyl chloride placed itself at the lowest limit of biocompatibility. The results achieved allowed the selection of those polymers that (by enhancing their degrees of biocompatibility due to the association with various biopolymers) will be used in the development of new biocompatible materials, useful in nervous conduits manufacture...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} to microgravity eliminates the hydrostatic gradients in the vascular system.

This experiment examined the responses to modified Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers measured by <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> ultrasound (ECHO) in a baseline steady state and during preload reduction introduced with thigh occlusion cuffs used as a counter-measure device (Braslet cuffs) measured by <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> ultrasound examinations. Methods: Nine International Space Station crewmember subjects (Expeditions 16 - 20) were examined in 15 experiment sessions 101 +/- 46. days after launch (mean +/- SD; 33 - 185). Twenty Seven <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> parameters were obtained with/without respiratory maneuvers before and after tightening of the Braslet cuffs. Results: Non-physicians performed diagnostic-quality <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> ultrasound examinations using remote guidance. Three of 27 combinations of maneuvers and Braslet or Braslet alone were identified as being significant changed when compared to baseline. Eleven of 81 differences between combinations of Mueller, Valsalva or baseline were significant <b>and</b> related to <b>cardiac</b> preload reduction or increase in lower extremity venous volume. Conclusions: Acute application of Braslet occlusion cuffs causes lower extremity fluid sequestration and exerts commensurate measurable effects on cardiac performance in microgravity. Ultrasound techniques to measure the hemodynamic effects of thigh cuffs in combination with respiratory maneuvers may serve as an invaluable tool in determining the volume status of the cardiac patient at the 'microgravity bedside'...|$|R
40|$|In {{hypertension}} baroreceptor-mediated modulation {{of heart}} rate is impaired, {{resulting in a}} decreased vagal control. Reactive oxygen species produced locally in the vasculature decrease baroreceptor sensitivity. Folic acid has antioxidant properties. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to test whether folic acid improves baroreceptor function in hypertension. Twenty-one male patients with hypertension not taking any drugs for 2 weeks participated in the study and were randomized to folic acid 5 mg or matching placebo. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> sympathetic baroreceptor functions were tested before and after a single dose of folic acid or placebo with two different methods: the alpha-coefficient method and the phenylephrine (PE) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) bolus method. In the folic acid group both methods showed significantly improved <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> sympathetic baroreceptor sensitivity compared with placebo. This study provides evidence that folic acid improves <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> sympathetic baroreceptor sensitivity in hypertensive patients, which suggests an improved vagal control and an enhanced baroreceptor modulation of sympathetic vasomotor tone. Thus, folic acid may represent a novel treatment for prevention of orthostatic dysregulation and/or arrhythmic complications resulting from baroreceptor dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, many {{clinical}} studies {{have revealed that}} some cisplatin-treated cancer survivors have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events, being cisplatin-induced cardiovascular toxicity an increasing concern. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the cardiovascular alterations induced by different chronic cisplatin treatments, and to identify some of the mechanisms involved. Direct blood pressure, basal <b>cardiac</b> (left ventricle <b>and</b> coronary arteries) <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> (aortic <b>and</b> mesenteric) functions were evaluated in chronic (5 weeks) saline- or cisplatin-treated male Wistar rats. Three different doses of cisplatin were tested (1, 2, and 3 mg/kg/week). Alterations in <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> tissues were also investigated by immunohistochemistry, Western Blot, and or quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Cisplatin treatment provoked a significant modification of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, <b>and</b> basal <b>cardiac</b> function at the maximum dose tested. However, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurred at lower doses. The expression of collagen fibers and conexin- 43 were increased in cardiac tissue in cisplatin-treated rats with doses of 2 and 3 mg/kg/week. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was also modified in <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> tissues after cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, chronic cisplatin treatment provokes <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs at lower doses than <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> systemic cardiovascular toxicity. Moreover, some structural changes in <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> tissues are also patent even before any systemic cardiovascular alterations.

40|$|In {{the heart}} and in the blood vessel walls, complex adrenergic-cholinergic {{interactions}} occur both prejunctionally, {{at the level of}} the autonomic nerve terminals, and postjunctionally, {{at the level of the}} responding cells themselves. The principal prejunctional interaction appears to be an inhibition of the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve terminals by the acetylcholine liberated from nearby cholinergic nerve endings. This inhibitory effect is mediated by muscarinic receptors located in the postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. The inhibitory effect of acetylcholine on <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> tissues is therefore achieved in part by a direct influence of the cholinergic neurotransmitter on the <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> muscle cells, <b>and</b> in part by an indirect influence on sympathetic neurotransmission. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Spondyloarthritides are {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular risks, which can only partly be explained by traditional risk factors. It {{is likely that the}} chronic inflammatory state is involved. In this review, novel findings regarding <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> pathologies <b>and</b> potential overlapping mechanisms will be discussed. Cardiac pathologies in spondyloarthritides are conduction disturbances and valvular heart diseases. Recent studies have also focused on <b>vascular</b> pathologies <b>and</b> showed impaired endothelial function, suggesting that atherosclerotic alterations could also be involved in increased cardiovascular mortality. Novel findings suggest that chronic systemic inflammation is involved in these <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> pathologies. Thus, spondyloarthritides and ankylosing spondylitis {{are associated}} with increased levels of circulating inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein. Interestingly, ankylosing spondylitis patients may also have an atherogenic lipid profile and disturbances in their T-helper lymphocyte subsets, which may be involved in cardiovascular disease development. The beneficial effects of statin treatment on circulating inflammatory mediators and atherogenic lipid profiles may reveal new therapeutic options for patients with spondyloarthritides. Recent studies have highlighted that the chronic, systemic inflammatory condition of patients with spondyloarthritides may be involved in the development of <b>cardiac</b> <b>and</b> <b>vascular</b> pathologie...|$|R
