X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry <b>confirmed</b> <b>removal</b> of the covalently-bound fatty acid layer (F-layer) {{from the surface of the}} wool fibers, resulting in exposure of the underlying, hydrophilic protein material. Dye uptake experiments were carried out at 50 ºC to evaluate the effects of plasma on the rate of dye uptake by the fiber surface, as well as give an indication of the adsorption characteristics in the early stages of a typical dyeing cycle. The dyes used were typical, sulfonated wool dyes with a range of hydrophobic characteristics, as determined by their partitioning behavior between water and n-butanol. No significant effects of plasma on the rate of dye adsorption were observed with relatively hydrophobic dyes. In contrast, the relatively hydrophilic dyes were adsorbed more rapidly (and uniformly) by the plasma-treated fabric. It was concluded that adsorption of hydrophobic dyes on plasma-treated wool was influenced by hydrophobic interactions, whereas electrostatic effects predominated for dyes of more hydrophilic character. On heating the dyebath to 90 ºC in order to achieve fiber penetration, no significant effect of the plasma treatment on the extent of uptake or levelness of a relatively hydrophilic dye was observed as equilibrium conditions were approached. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra DN 34) tissue {{cultures}} removed 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) from an {{aqueous solution}} in five days, reducing the toxicity {{of the solution}} from highly toxic Microtox® EC value {{to that of the}} control. 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane (RDX) was taken up by the plant tissue cultures more slowly, but toxicity reduction of the solution was evident. The measurement of toxicity reduction of aqueous solutions containing TNT and RDX was performed using a novel methodology developed for use with the Microtox® testing system. Radiolabeled TNT and RDX were used to confirm removal of explosives from hydroponic solutions containing plant tissue cultures and to verify that toxicity did not change in solutions where no plant cultures were present (positive controls). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) measurements <b>confirmed</b> <b>removal</b> of TNT and RDX from solutions containing poplar plant tissue cultures and constancy of the plant-free controls. In addition, metabolites were identified in remediated solutions by HPLC, confirming the mechanism by which plants can remediate groundwater, surface water, and soil solutions. Using an Affymetrix® microarray, poplar trees were exposed to TNT over 48 hours. General patterns, as well as significant downregulated and upregulated genes were studied. We identified several new genes that were implicated in the detoxification and metabolism of TNT by Populus. In particular, our results support the 2 ̆ 2 green liver 2 ̆ 2 model of different gene families being expressed during the time course experiments. This suggests an alignment with Phase I transformation, Phase II conjugation, and Phase III compartmentation processes. Many of the genes identified in this study were related to those significantly expressed in previous Arabidopsis studies, supporting the comparison between these two plants. Gene families represented as significant in this study were glucosyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, cytochromes, and phosphofructokinases.

40|$|AbstractA ponded {{infiltration}} {{experiment was}} conducted under simultaneous imaging to investigate variations in quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity a process frequently observed in infiltration experiments in soils with wide grain -size distribution. An artificially prepared heterogeneous sample composed of coarse quartz sand (representing pathways of preferential flow) and fine porous ceramic (representing soil matrix) was investigated. The sample was 34. 5 mm high and 29. 0 mm in diameter. Sequences of neutron radiography images (RI) of pixel size 0. 045 × 0. 045 mm were taken at one angle during particular transient {{phases of the}} flow process. During quasi-steady state flow stages of the experiment radiography images were acquired in range of angles 0 - 180 ° in 0. 9 ° step and. 3 D neutron tomograms (TI) were then developed. Using the data a quantitative evaluation of the spatial and temporal distribution of water content within the sample was conducted. For every RI and TI {{the amount of water}} in particular pixels and voxels, respectively, was calculated by subtracting the image of dry sample. The accuracy of the water content estimates derived from the images was checked by comparing them to the corresponding gravimetrically determined water content data. Heavy water with equilibrium air saturation was introduced into the sample during two recurrent infiltrations. Thirty five hours later, during second infiltration, the inflow was switched to degassed heavy water in order to remove residual air present in the sample. During the first twelve hours of first infiltration run flow rate through the sample decreased from 3. 7 cm/hour to 1. 0 cm/hour {{at the end of the}} “steady state flow” stage. The flow rate in second run decreased from 3. 6 cm/hour to 1. 6 cm/hour. Comparison of the tomogram of the sample at the beginning and one taken at the end of the steady state flow stage in each run shows an increase of water content in the porous ceramic, while the water content in the coarse sand decreased. On the contrary, during the subsequent infiltration with degassed water the flow rate increased to its maximum value of 10. 5 cm/hour. The tomograms <b>confirmed</b> <b>removal</b> of the residual air during this stage. Increased water content in the coarse quartz sand was evident on a tomogram made at the end of the degassed water infiltration. The results show that the residual air saturation and its spatial distribution strongly affected the water flow in the quasi-saturated heterogeneous media representing natural soil...|$|E

30|$|This clarifies {{a slight}} {{decrease}} in size for PEG-SH-coated BPs and also supports the UV-vis data above. As {{a result of}} the functionalization, the surface charges of the NSs decrease massively as displayed in Fig.  4 b. The cationic surfactant gets readily displaced with PEG-SH, which is further replaced by MUA owing to higher affinity towards Au surface. Owing to the small size of MUA, it has higher flexibility to displace CTAB that remains on the NSs, even after PEGylation. Final zeta potential values of MUA-coated NSs reflect negatively charged surfaces for all NSs except for NRs. This discrepancy can be linked to the uneven coating of the small NRs or their polydispersity, and the measurement principle applied. For the spherical NSs, the initial negative surface charge is due to citrate coating. However, high magnitudes of the zeta potentials for all the NSs ensure the stability of the NSs in aqueous solutions. XPS measurements carried out on the Au NSs after each stage of functionalization, i.e., with PEG-SH followed by MUA shows a very low content of bromine on the surface, <b>confirming</b> <b>removal</b> of bound CTAB in large amounts from the surfaces of the NSs.

40|$|Abstract The {{negative}} effects of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water are well known and, where necessary, its removal is crucial. This is enforced by the increasingly stringent water regulations around the world. In South Africa, this regulation targets NOM {{in the form of}} total organic carbon (TOC), at a maximum of 10 mg/L. Enhanced coagulation (EC), a multiple objective chemical dosing strategy, offers a viable method of NOM removal, and this study explored its use for typical South African raw waters. A consistent and reproducible jar test procedure was developed and applied to 19 widely different raw water samples collected from different locations and at different times of a year long period. These samples consisted {{of a wide range of}} alkalinity, UV 254 and turbidity values. Three criteria were developed and applied to determine the best EC dosage for the optimal removal of UV 254 without compromising residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and turbidity. DOC was measured, prior to and after batch tests, to <b>confirm</b> <b>removal</b> similarities with UV 254 and compliance with national standards. The resultant percentage removals of UV 254 and DOC ranged between 56 to 96 % and 45 to 94 % respectively, irrespective of water source, period and coagulation dosage.

40|$|The {{development}} of reliable tissue engineering methods using decellularized cadaveric or donor lungs could potentially provide {{a new source}} of lung tissue. The vast majority of current lung decellularization protocols are detergent based and incompletely removed residual detergents may have a deleterious impact on subsequent scaffold recellularization. Detergent removal and quality control measures that rigorously and reliably <b>confirm</b> <b>removal,</b> ideally utilizing nondestructive methods, are thus critical for generating optimal acellular scaffolds suitable for potential clinical translation. Using a modified and optimized version of a methylene blue-based detergent assay, we developed a straightforward, noninvasive method for easily and reliably detecting two of the most commonly utilized anionic detergents, sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), in lung decellularization effluents. In parallel studies, we sought to determine the threshold of detergent concentration that was cytotoxic using four different representative human cell types utilized in the study of lung recellularization: human bronchial epithelial cells, human pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (CBF 12), human lung fibroblasts, and human mesenchymal stem cells. Notably, different cells have varying thresholds for either SDC or SDS-based detergent-induced cytotoxicity. These studies demonstrate the importance of reliably removing residual detergents and argue that multiple cell lines should be tested in cytocompatibility-based assessments of acellular scaffolds. The detergent detection assay presented here is a useful nondestructive tool for assessing detergent removal in potential decellularization schemes or for use as a potential endpoint in future clinical schemes, generating acellular lungs using anionic detergent-based decellularization protocols...|$|R

40|$|Background Context: Disc {{degeneration}} is {{the leading}} cause of low back pain and is often characterized by a loss of disc height, resulting from cleavage of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) present in the nucleus pulposus. Intact CSPGs are critical to water retention and maintenance of the nucleus osmotic pressure. Decellularization of healthy nucleus pulposus tissue has the potential to serve as an ideal matrix for tissue engineering of the disc because of the presence of native disc proteins and CSPGs. Injectable in situ gelling matrices are the most viable therapeutic option to prevent damage to the anulus fibrosus and future disc degeneration. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to create a gentle decellularization method for use on healthy nucleus pulposus tissue explants and to develop an injectable formulation of this matrix to enable therapeutic use without substantial tissue disruption. Study Design: Porcine nuclei pulposi were isolated, decellularized, and solubilized. Samples were assessed to determine the degree of cell removal, matrix maintenance, gelation ability, cytotoxic residuals, and native cell viability. Methods: Nuclei pulposi were decellularized using serial detergent, buffer, and enzyme treatments. Decellularized nuclei pulposi were solubilized, neutralized, and buffered.
