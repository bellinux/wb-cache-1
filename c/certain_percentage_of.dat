Lower-grade applications, including sub-base and roadwork, have been practicing in many countries; however, higher-grade activities are rarely discussed. This paper develops two mixing approaches by adding silica fume into <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> Recycled Aggregate (RA) in the pre-mix procedure, named as Two-Stage Mixing Approach(silica fume) (TSMAs) and adding silica fume and proportional amounts <b>of</b> cement into <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> RA in the first mix, named as Two-Stage Mixing Approach(silica fume and cement) (TSMAsc). Experimentation highlights that improvements have been recorded resulted from the use <b>of</b> various RA <b>percentages</b> from both TSMAs and TSMAsc. The additions of silica fume and proportional cement content in the pre-mix on TSMAs and TSMAsc can fill up the weak areas in the RA and thus develop a stronger interfacial layer around aggregate, and hence a higher strength of the concrete. It, thus, concludes that TSMAs and TSMAsc can provide alternative methodologies for further improvement in quality of this recyclable material...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, a <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E
