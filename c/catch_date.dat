40|$|Anguillid eels {{are declining}} worldwide, so {{monitoring}} of their annual recruitment is important, but labor-intensive. Efficient ways {{to assess the}} abundance of their new recruits (0 -age) each year would therefore be useful. Three discriminant analysis methods were evaluated {{for their ability to}} identify 0 -age eels based on the total length (TL) of eels that included various age classes from 0 -age to ≥ 2 -age. Japanese eels were sampled every month from 2007 to 2009 in the Imagawa River, an inlet river of Hamana Lake in Japan, and the ages of 223 eels (50 to 250 mm TL) were determined using otolith annuli analyses. All three discriminant analyses could predict 0 -age eels more accurately than 1 -age and ≥ 2 -age eels based on TL and <b>catch</b> <b>date</b> data. Canonical discriminant analysis appeared to be best for predicting 0 -age eels, with all eels determined by otolith analysis as 0 -age being correctly predicted (100 %) in the leave-one-out cross validation method, although 2. 4 % of 1 -age eels were wrongly predicted as 0 -age. Studies of the recruitment patterns, habitat use, or ecology of 0 -age recruits in a river system would be possible without additional aging efforts after a discriminant analysis function was created for a river system...|$|E

Mean (+/- SD) growth rates ranged from 0. 04 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 56 +/- 0. 1 mm d(- 1) at 5 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Unexpectedly, the <b>catch</b> <b>date</b> also influenced growth rates, indicating that recently recruited animals grew faster than overwintering shrimps of the same size. Female shrimps of the recent recruitment wave showed significantly higher growth rates than male shrimps. Individual moult intervals were determined using a marking method.

Temperature and length affected the moult interval but not the moult increment. Variability in the observed growth rates at a given length and temperature was mainly an effect of variable moult increments. Results from 2 pre-experiments also indicate an effect of food quality on growth, with shrimps growing faster when feeding on live copepods in comparison to several other food sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has declined since the 1970 s. The {{major reason for}} the recent decline appears to be increased marine mortality. Before 1970 s, the native populations of Atlantic salmon were exterminated in several rivers in Southern Norway due to acidification, {{but in the last}} two decades many of these have been re- established, due to liming of the rivers. The aim of this study was to analyse marine growth of Atlantic salmon caught with bag net near the River Mandalselva on the Skagerrak coast in the years 2004 - 2010. The sampled fish were maturing adults, most of which were probably returning to the River Mandalselva or other rivers in the same area. I determined age and growth of the fish from the scales. The rate of measurement error from the scale reading was low so one reading of each scale was conducted. The sampling error declined when more scales per fish were measured. In this study I measured four scales per fish, a number that both took into account requirements for precision and the amount of work. The number of circuli deposited in the scales and the inter- circuli distances were measured. The growth rate of Atlantic salmon during the first year at sea was positively correlated with the number of circuli present at the end of the same period. The number of circuli deposited after the winter-band was positively related to the <b>catch</b> <b>date.</b> The inter-circuli distances increased rapidly after the smolt had entered the sea, reaching a point of inflection at circuli number six. There was a significant year-to-year variation in the total number of circuli deposited during both first and second growth year at sea. There was a reduction in the peaks of maximum inter-circuli distances for the multi-sea-winter (MSW) Atlantic salmon first growth year at sea over the entire study period, 2001 - 2008. The total number of circuli deposited during the first growth year at sea differed significantly between the one-sea-winter (1 SW) and MSW Atlantic salmon. 1 SW fish deposited a higher number of circuli than the MSW fishes. The observed variations in growth while at sea were probably related to variation in temperature that acted directly on fish growth by affecting physical processes or indirectly by affecting changes in the ecosystem. Findings in this study highlight the importance of considering both circuli number and inter-circuli distances when studying Atlantic salmon growth rather than to solely rely on inter-circuli distances...|$|E

40|$|Mnesampela privata is an Australian {{geometrid}} moth that {{is considered}} to have resource-driven outbreaks. An autumnal oviposition/larval development cycle is considered the "norm" in this species, but spring/summer activity has also been observed. This apparent plasticity of phenology and probable concomitant changes in voltinism have not been considered as possible causes of moth outbreaks. We developed GumMoth, a retrospective phenological model for M. privata that uses temperature to predict development times of immatures. Photoperiod determines whether individuals undergo direct development or pupal diapause. We used known <b>catch</b> <b>dates</b> of moths (in the same moth-active season or 365 -day period) to simulate population phenologies on the Australian mainland (27 ° 28 ’S to 38 ° 14 ’S) and in Tasmania (40 ° 54 ’S to 42 ° 57 S). GumMoth successfully simulated phenological patterns that accorded with published records and demonstrated {{for the first time}} that multivoltinism is possible in M. privata. In seven paired simulations using dates for first and last moth catches, the earliest moth activity resulted in the pupae of four out of 11 generations undergoing diapause, whereas the latest moth activity resulted in pupae of five out of eight generations undergoing diapause (diapause individuals emerged the following moth-active season). Almost two-thirds of offspring of spring/summer active moths reached adulthood within that same moth-active season (i. e. no delay in development), whereas those of autumn active moths always reached adulthood the following moth-active season (i. e. development was delayed). Records from foresters and in the scientific literature confirmed that the more common autumn phenology is supplemented by spring/summer activity in many localities. At half of these localities, populations that required insecticide control or caused substantial defoliation also developed. Because plantation eucalypts are suitable M. privata hosts for only four to five tree-growth seasons after planting, local moth populations must increase quickly if an outbreak is to occur. We suggest that large populations are more likely when plantations are colonised in the first moth-active season after planting and population growth commences in the spring/summer of each year. Foresters can use <b>catch</b> <b>dates</b> and regional weather data in GumMoth to estimate the numbers and phenology of generations of M. privata.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{virtue of}} social media {{is to build}} virtual communi-ties between users. As such, {{it is no surprise}} that almost all social media sites provide web interfaces for the search and/or recommen-dation of other users who share similar attributes, interests, etc. -with results being the top-k users selected according to a ranking function. Our studies of real-world websites unveil a novel yet se-rious privacy leakage caused by the design of such interfaces and ranking functions. Specifically, we find that many such websites feature private attributes only visible to a user him/herself, but not to other users (and therefore will not be visible in the query an-swer). Nonetheless, some websites also take into account such pri-vate attributes in the design of the ranking function, understand-ably for improving the effectiveness of search/recommendation. While the conventional belief might be that tuple ranks alone are not enough to reveal the private attribute values, our investigation shows that this is not the case in reality. Specifically, we define a novel problem of rank based inference, and introduce a taxonomy of the problem space according to two dimensions, (1) the type of query interfaces widely used in practice and (2) the capability of adversaries. For each subspace of the prob-lem, we develop a novel technique which either guarantees the suc-cessful inference of private attributes, or (when such an inference is provably infeasible in the worst-case scenario) accomplishes such an inference attack for a significant portion of real-world tuples. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over real-world datasets, including successful online attacks over popular so-cial media such as Amazon Goodreads and <b>Catch</b> 22 <b>dating...</b>|$|R

The behaviour of the noise on 2 h time scales is described well by a power-law with index 0. 25 in R-magnitude, ranging from 0. 1 mmag at R= 11. 5 to 1 mmag at R= 16, which is close to the pre-launch specification, though still a factor 2 - 3 above the photon noise due to residual jitter noise and hot pixel events.

The accurate detection of deception in human interactions has long been of interest across {{a broad array of}} contexts and has been studied in a number of fields, including psychology, communication, and law enforcement. The detection of deception is well-known to be a challenging problem: people are notoriously bad lie detectors, and no verified approach yet exists that can reliably and consistently <b>catch</b> liars. To <b>date,</b> the speech signal itself has been largely neglected by researchers as a source of cues to deception. Prior to the work presented here, no comprehensive attempt has been made by speech scientists to apply state-of-the-art speech processing techniques to the study of deception. This work uses a set of features new to the deception domain in classification experiments, statistical analyses, and speaker- and group-dependent modeling approaches, all designed to identify and employ potential cues to deception in speech.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The GRASS (V. 4. 0) {{geographical}} {{information system}} (GIS) {{was used to test}} the hypothesis that pheromone trap based predictions of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) damage in processed sweet corn could be improved by considering spatial patterns of corn plantings and wind blocking features around the trap. Wind blocking features include: tree rows, wooded areas, large buildings close to the trap, and abrupt hillsides. Pheromone traps were monitored at 29 and 30 sites in 1990 and 1991. Corn development through the year and damage levels at harvest (percent infestation) were also recorded for these locations. Maps of all corn plantings and wind blocking features within 2. 5 kilometers of the trap were created, digitized, and entered into the GIS for each site. A stepwise regression analysis considering 18 spatial and two non-spatial variables resulted in a highly significant (P< 0. 001) four variable regression model with an R² of 0. 82. Spatial input variables used in this model included the total number of hectares of corn within 2. 0 kilometers of the trap as well as the average distance to wind blocking features {{on the north side of}} the trap. The non-spatial variables used were cumulative trap <b>catch</b> and <b>date</b> of first silk. A dynamic simulation model was also created. This was designed to filter from the trap catch those moths coming from plantings outside of the trapped planting. This model functioned by creating map surfaces in the GIS showing for each day the relative contribution to catch for each location around the trap. This map surface was the product for each location of relative moth population levels and the likeliness that a moth positioned there would be captured by the trap. The modified cumulative trap catch was expected to correlate more strongly to damage levels than the unmodified trap catch, but no run of the model produced a significant improvement in the correlation. In the process of collecting data for this project, circumstantial evidence was obtained which indicated that high synchrony between valley-wide moth catch levels and valley-wide timings of silking in corn could be used as an indicator of high damage years...|$|R

In the thesis are discussed the economic costs associated with the cultivation of catch crops and the possibility of the use of subsidies for its cultivation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{the second part of}} a project to assess the {{applicability}} of the male-produced, aggregation pheromone of the strawberry blossom weevil, Anthonomus rubi, for commercial monitoring and control. Following optimisation of pheromone lure and trap in previous work, the potential of the pheromone traps for monitoring and control of the pest was investigated. There was no obvious relationship between total pheromone trap catches and numbers of weevils on the crop determined by beating. However, good correlations were obtained at five sites during two seasons between the cumulative numbers of weevils and the amount of severing damage on the crop. Early catches of weevils preceded the first occurrence of damage by at least 1 week in several instances, providing useful information for timing the application of insecticide sprays against the adults to prevent occurrence of damage. The number of flowers severed was usually in the range of 0. 5 – 2. 0 times the cumulative number of weevils captured per trap. Adult weevil catches started at a low level in April or early May with similar numbers of males and females. The catches showed a marked increase in mid June coinciding with the emergence of new adults from the damaged flower buds, even though these are in reproductive diapause. Male weevils predominated in <b>catches</b> beyond this <b>date</b> by a factor of approximately 2 : 1. Two field experiments investigated the interference between traps and the effects of the traps on populations and crop damage by this pest. There was no evidence for interference between traps at spacings as close as 1. 7 m, and no effect on weevil damage or distribution was observed. Replicated trials were carried out of three approaches to exploit the pheromone for control of strawberry blossom weevil damage in 0. 5 ha plots in commercial strawberry crops. These involved surrounding the crop with a perimeter of lures, the same method but with a boarder spray of the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin or by mass trapping with sticky stake pheromone traps at a density of 1000 per ha. None of these showed any reduction in crop damage compared to untreated plots. Possible reasons for this lack of success are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{fisheries}} management {{is key to}} restoring and maintaining ecological function and benefits to people, but it requires accurate information about patterns of resource use, particularly fishing pressure. In most coral reef fisheries and other data-poor contexts, obtaining such information is challenging and remains an impediment to effective management. We developed the most comprehensive regional view of shore-based fishing effort and <b>catch</b> published to <b>date,</b> to show detailed fishing patterns from across the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). We reveal these regional patterns through fisher “creel” surveys conducted by local communities, state agencies, academics, and/or environmental organizations, at 18 sites, comprising > 10, 000 h of monitoring {{across a range of}} habitats and human influences throughout the MHI. All creel surveys included in this study except for one were previously published in some form (peer-reviewed articles or gray literature reports). Here, we synthesize these studies to document spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries catch, effort, catch rates (i. e., catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)), and catch disposition (i. e., use of fish after catch is landed). This effort provides for a description of general regional patterns based on these location-specific studies. Line fishing was by far the dominant gear type employed. The most efficient gear (i. e., highest CPUE) was spear (0. 64 kg h− 1), followed closely by net (0. 61 kg h− 1), with CPUE for line (0. 16 kg h− 1) substantially lower than the other two methods. Creel surveys also documented illegal fishing activity across the studied locations, although these activities were not consistent across sites. Overall, most of the catch was not sold, but rather retained for home consumption or given away to extended family, which suggests that cultural practices and food security may be stronger drivers of fishing effort than commercial exploitation for coral reef fisheries in Hawai‘i. Increased monitoring of spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries can inform targeted management, and can help communities develop a more informed understanding of the drivers of marine resource harvest and the state of the resources, in order to maintain these fisheries for food security, cultural practices, and ecological value...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) were {{exploited}} extensively {{around the}} world and remain endangered. In the North Pacific their population structure is unclear and current status unknown, {{with the exception of a}} well-studied eastern North Pacific (ENP) population. Despite decades without whaling, recent abundance estimates for ENP blue whales indicate a slowed recovery, leading to speculation that their recovery may be hindered by fatal collisions with large vessels. I test this hypothesis by first estimating historical catches and then assessing the population trends with Bayesian population dynamics models under basic assumptions about historical and future ship strikes. I collated previously unreported Soviet catches and combined these with known catches to form the most current estimates of North Pacific blue whale catches. I used the knowledge that ENP whales produce a different song call than blue whales in the western North Pacific to split the conflated catches. The catches were split by estimating spatiotemporal occurrence of blue whales with generalized additive models fitted to acoustic call patterns, which predict the probability a catch belonged to the ENP population based on the proportion of calls of each population recorded by latitude, longitude, and month. When applied to the conflated historical catches, I estimate that ENP blue whale catches totaled 2, 969 (95 % credible interval 2, 301 to 3, 516) from 1905 - 1971, and amounted to 35 % (95 % credible interval 27 % to 41 %) of all catches in the North Pacific. The uncertainty in the acoustic data influence the results substantially more than uncertainty in <b>catch</b> locations and <b>dates.</b> These estimated <b>catch</b> series were then combined with abundance estimates and used to assess the recovery of ENP blue whales. I found the population has recovered to a median of 97 % of pre-exploitation levels (credible interval 62 % to 99 %) and thus density dependence is primarily responsible for their slowed recovery. Further, current levels of ship strikes are not an immediate risk and thus ship strike mitigation would impact the population minimally. Indeed, vessel traffic would need to increase 3 - 5 times the current levels before the population is at risk. The recovery of ENP blue whale is a conservation success story and demonstrates that endangered cetacean populations can recover under careful management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBoth {{scientists}} and farmers are {{confronted by a}} similar question: which current and past cropping system components will influence the present weed flora, and how? This information is necessary to optimize both cropping systems for weed control, and quality and cost in surveys and monitoring schemes. The present study addressed these questions with a sensitivity analysis to input variables of a cropping system model, ALOMYSYS, that predicts weed dynamics in interaction with pedo-climatic conditions. The study ranked cropping system components according to their impact on weed infestation in winter wheat, showing for instance that though crop succession was crucial, current and past tillage strategies influenced grass weed densities even more. Crops were not only ranked {{as a function of}} the resulting weed risk but the latter was also linked to crop species traits, i. e. crop type, usual sowing period and emergence speed. A previous winter v. spring crop thus increased weed density by 72 % in the following winter wheat; a late-sown v. early sown winter crop by 26 %, a slow v. fast-emerging winter crop by 17 %, and a lower competitive ability by 9 %. Similarly, the characteristics of each crop management technique (tillage, catch crop, secondary crop, mowing, mechanical weeding, herbicides, nitrogen fertilizer, manure and harvest) were quantified. For instance, the timing of the first tillage operation was crucial prior to the analysed winter wheat crop while the choice of the tool used even 5 years previously still influenced weed infestation in the current year; a catch crop prior to previous spring sown crops reduced the current infestation regardless of <b>catch</b> crop sowing <b>dates</b> and densities, but the reductive effect could be lost if the field was tilled several times to destroy the catch crop. The advice synthesized here and in a companion paper (Colbach & Meziere 2012). will be valuable to design innovative, integrated cropping systems, indicating (1) which cropping system components to modify to produce the largest effect, (2) for how long past practices must be considered when choosing current options and (3) the optimal options for the different management techniques. Points (1) and (2) are also valuable to identify data to record in surveys, though still resulting in a total of 232 variables. In a second step, these detailed variables were therefore simplified and aggregated to determine a smaller set of 22 synthetic variables easily recorded in surveys, such as the proportion of winter and spring crops during the last 10 years (instead of the actual crop sequence), the proportion of crops sown in summer, early autumn, late autumn, early spring and late spring during the last 5 years (instead of exact sowing dates), the ploughing frequency (instead of ploughing dates and characteristics), the mean number of herbicide sprayings per year (instead of dates), etc. This reduced survey list will reduce the cost of surveys as well as increase the number and quality of surveys as more farmers will be ready to participate and there will be fewer uncertainties in the answers...|$|R
40|$|The Northeast Arctic (NA) cod {{is known}} to {{undertake}} long southbound spawning migrations from their feeding grounds in the Barents Sea, to various spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast. Hence it’s native Norwegian name “skrei”, meaning to move or to travel. The spawned eggs and larvae subsequently drift northwards along with the prevailing currents, eventually reaching the Barents Sea as juveniles. From commercial fisheries statistics we see that these spawning grounds once spanned across nearly 2000 km of {{the west coast of}} Norway, from Finnmark in the north to Vest-Agder at the very south. Today the latitudinal range of the spawning grounds is significantly reduced, with only a marginal part of the stock spawning as far south as Møre, some 1500 km from the Barents Sea. Coarse estimates from the Institute of Marine Research suggest that around 90 - 95 % of the spawning stock spawn from Lofoten and northwards, utilizing only a third of their original expanse. Also, recent scientific surveys have found that during the last decade, the NA cod have to a great extent stopped spawning at their major traditional grounds in Vestfjorden, Lofoten, and have relocated to more northbound areas. Historically, scientists have shown little interest in the changes in spawning grounds, but due to the major impact this recent shift has had on local fishermen and landing ports, the topic currently attracts noticeable interest from fisheries scientists as well as climate scientists. The NA cod’s previous widespread spawning distribution, together with its historical and contemporary northbound shifts has spurred two major research questions addressed in this thesis. First, why does spawning take place over such a vast geographical area, implying that certain parts of the population undergo spawning migrations several thousands of kilometres further than their conspecifics? Secondly, what has caused the northbound shift in spawning grounds? From general evolutionary theory, we would expect that individuals undertaking longer spawning migrations, thus leaving less time to forage in the Barents Sea, as well as increasing their energetic cost of migration, would achieve a comparable return benefit. If not, such a life history strategy could simply not hold through the course of natural selection. The benefit need not target the spawning individual directly, but can also be mediated through increased fitness to their progeny, essentially through increased survival probability. Using a simplistic assumption that fitness benefit increases linearly with migration distance, we developed a model simulating a population of individuals which finds optimal solutions to the trade-off between growth and reproduction, depending on physiological condition and ecological constraints. Overall, the model predict that larger individuals and individuals in better condition gain higher fitness benefit from longer spawning migrations compared to smaller and less fit individuals. These findings are partly due to a nonlinear relationship between hydrodynamic friction and individual size, meaning that relatively, larger fish spend less energy on swimming compared to smaller individuals. More interestingly, when simulating historical fishing pressure at the spawning grounds, there is selection for large late-maturing fish and longer migrations, whilst a contemporary trawl fishery, typically located at the feeding areas in the Barents Sea, select for small and early-maturing fish with shorter optimal migration distances. The latter case is consistent with observational studies, and indicates that fisheries’ induced evolution have not only lowered the maturation age of NA cod, but may also be causing the northbound shift in spawning ground distribution. To test the validity of our initial assumption that southerly spawning grounds are in fact associated with higher fitness benefits, we employed different general circulation models to track virtual fish eggs and larvae released at various spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast. From their drift trajectories towards the Barents Sea, we found that eggs and larvae released from more southerly spawning grounds experienced higher average temperature exposures, generally thought to promote faster growth and consequently reduce mortality in early life stages. However, the southernmost spawning grounds generally also experienced more retention in local fjord systems. In addition, seasonal and inter-annual variation in drift trajectories, as well as overall temperature exposure, growth and survival was evident, indicating that climatic conditions may also play a role for offspring success. Overall, the latitudinal effect on larval temperature exposure was significantly stronger than the climatic variability. Finally, by utilizing empirical data from commercial <b>catch</b> statistics <b>dating</b> back to 1866, our initial theory, that shifts in spawning grounds are caused by a size-selective industrial trawl fishery in the Barents Sea, was tested against alternative explanatory factors such as density dependence and climate change. In total, 104 years of landing data were compiled for the entire Norwegian coast, revealing large fluctuations in spawning ground distributions, but also showing trends towards more northbound spawning after the 1920 s. Climatic variation was found only partially to explain the variation, whilst rapidly increasing landings from the trawl fishery in the Barents Sea starting around 1923, clearly coincided with the northbound shifts in spawning grounds...|$|R
