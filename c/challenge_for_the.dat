5|$|Ape Escape {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{use a variety}} of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, {{traversing}} across several environments.

5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact}} that Dyer had been a {{resident}} in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained his belt.|$|E

5|$|This {{agreement}} was amended on November 22, 1961, substituting the Governors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario with the Committee of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario {{as the group}} that would name the two Canadian trustees, if need be. In the 1970s, the World Hockey Association sought to <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cup. By this time, all Cup Trustees were longtime NHL loyalists, and {{under the direction of}} NHL President Clarence Campbell the WHA's <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cup was blocked. However, notwithstanding the aforementioned legal obligation, the NHL (considering not only the WHA's presence but also the rising caliber of European ice hockey leagues) quietly discontinued calling its champions the world champions.|$|E

5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's {{conservative}} wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
