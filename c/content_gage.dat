40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 nuclear 2 ̆ 2 asphalt <b>content</b> <b>gage</b> {{was used}} with {{bituminous}} mixes containing slag aggregates to assess its applicability as a rapid analysis tool for {{these types of}} mixes. It was found to work as well, or better, than the standard extraction technique. It was also found to have additional advantages over the extraction technique since it is about an order to magnitude faster, requires no solvent and involves no decisions {{on the part of}} the user...|$|E
40|$|The GAGE {{protein is}} {{detected}} only in cancer and in testis and is expressed from {{a cluster of}} nearly identical gene copies on the X-chromosome. We determined the lengths of these GAGE gene clusters from human families, identical twins, and in clinical samples from cancer patients. The GAGE cluster lengths proved to be highly heterogeneous, ranging from 13 to 39 gene copies, with an average <b>content</b> of 20 <b>GAGE</b> genes per cluster. Low levels of mei-otic rearrangement in families and mitotic rearrangement in adult solid tumors are detectable. Analysis of Rothmund -Thomson syndrome (RTS) kindreds and probands showed GAGE cluster inheritance and stability indistinguishable from that found in non-RTS individuals. These observations support the concept of evolutionarily rapid rearrangement of clustered repetitive sequences in the human genome...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur was {{analyzed}} {{in more than}} 200 lava samples from five drill holes located on the east rift zone of Kilauea volcano {{on the island of}} Hawaii. The sulfur <b>content</b> is a <b>gage</b> of whether lava was erupted subaerially (low sulfur) or erupted subaqueously (high sulfur). Despite considerable variation, sulfur is generally low (less than 0. 025 %) in {{the upper part of the}} holes, begins to increase at a depth of 250 - 320 m below sea level, and generally reaches a high level (greater than 0. 1 %) indicative of steady submarine eruption at 330 - 450 m below sea level. Assuming that the island is subsiding at 2. 4 mm/yr, an analysis of these data indicates that part of the variation in sulfur concentration results from past eustatic oscillation of sea level, and that the volcano (at the drill hole site) finally emerged for the last time about 98 ka. The long- term average rate of lava accumulation is roughly 4. 4 mm/yr, and upward growth of the volcano at the drill hole area is about 2 mm/yr in excess of subsidence...|$|R
