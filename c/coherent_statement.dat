2500|$|Formally, the Restoration period had a {{preferred}} rhyme scheme. [...] Rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter {{was by far}} the most popular structure for poetry of all types. Neo-Classicism meant that poets attempted adaptations of Classical meters, but the rhyming couplet in iambic pentameter held a near monopoly. According to Dryden ("Preface to The Conquest of Grenada"), the rhyming couplet in iambic pentameter has the right restraint and dignity for a lofty subject, and its rhyme allowed for a complete, <b>coherent</b> <b>statement</b> to be made. Dryden was struggling with the issue of what later critics in the Augustan period would call [...] "decorum": the fitness of form to subject (q.v. Dryden Epic). It is the same struggle that Davenant faced in his Gondibert. Dryden's solution was a closed couplet in iambic pentameter that would have a minimum of enjambment. This form was called the [...] "heroic couplet," [...] because it was suitable for heroic subjects. Additionally, the age also developed the mock-heroic couplet. After 1672 and Samuel Butler's Hudibras, iambic tetrameter couplets with unusual or unexpected rhymes became known as Hudibrastic verse. It was a formal parody of heroic verse, and it was primarily used for satire. Jonathan Swift would use the Hudibrastic form almost exclusively for his poetry.|$|E

40|$|Computational {{aeroacoustics}} {{often use}} finite difference schemes optimized to require relatively few points per wavelength; such optimized schemes are often called Dispersion Relation Preserving (DRP). Similar techniques {{are also used}} outside aeroacoustics. Here the question is posed: what {{is the equivalent of}} points per wavelength for growing or decaying waves, and how well are such waves resolved numerically? Such non-constant-amplitude waves are common in aeroacoustics, such as the exponential decay caused by acoustic linings, the O(1 /r) decay of an expanding spherical wave, and the decay of high-azimuthal-order modes in the radial direction towards the centre of a cylindrical duct. It is shown that optimized spatial derivatives perform poorly for waves that are not of constant amplitude, under performing maximal-order schemes. An equivalent criterion to points per wavelength is proposed for non-constant-amplitude oscillations, reducing to the standard definition for constant-amplitude oscillations and valid even for pure growth or decay with no oscillation. Using this definition, <b>coherent</b> <b>statements</b> about points per wavelength necessary for a given accuracy can be made for maximal-order schemes applied to non-constant-amplitude oscillations. These features are illustrated through a numerical example of a one-dimensional wave propagating through a damping region...|$|R

40|$|Employer {{criticism}} of British school-leavers is long-standing. <b>Coherent</b> <b>statements</b> by employers regarding their educational 'needs' have not materialised; employers' accounts concerning such needs are typically confused or contradictory. This paper formulates a 'filter' enabling {{better understanding of}} industry's educational needs. The starting point is that these needs are essentially labour-power needs. The 'needs filter' rests on this and another concept drawn from Marxism: capital. Furthermore, its development is grounded {{on a series of}} assumptions (that employers 'needs' can in principle be stated, that there are no contradictions within labour-power, and that employers' labour-power needs are realisable through education and training). After discussing conventional views on the 'needs of industry', the filter is presented as a series of labour-power needs for categories and functions of capital. Its utility for curriculum design, employers and researchers is explored. However, if the guiding assumptions underpinning the filter cannot be justified then the whole edifice collapses. It is argued that as labour-power is inherently contradiction-ridden then the filter implodes - along with it any notion that employers can straightforwardly state their labour power needs as a foundation for education and training planning and curriculum development...|$|R

40|$|This new {{introduction}} by Shaun Gallagher gives students and philosophers {{not only an}} excellent concise overview {{of the state of}} the field and contemporary debates, but a novel way of addressing the subject by looking at the ways in which phenomenology is useful to the disciplines it applies to. Gallagher retrieves the central insights made by the classic phenomenological philosophers (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and others), updates some of these insights in innovative ways, and shows how they directly relate to ongoing debates in philosophy and psychology. Accounts of phenomenological methods, and the concepts of intentionality, temporality, embodiment, action, self, and our ability to understand other people are integrated into a <b>coherent</b> contemporary <b>statement</b> that shows why phenomenology is still an active and vital philosophical approach. Each chapter begins with a discussion of the classic analyses and then goes on to show their relevance to contemporary debates in philosophy about embodied, enactive and extended approaches to our understanding of human experience. Along the way Gallagher introduces some novel interpretations that suggest how phenomenology can both inform and be informed by the terms of these debates...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} suggestibility studies in recent years which have demonstrated that reports of children and adults about a real event can be suggestivly influenced {{to such an extent}} that the statements are no longer reliable. It also has been shown that it is possible to evoke false memories about entire events that never occurred. Other relevant forensic issues - especially when judging statements of child witnesses about sexual abuse - are how statements develop over a course of various interviews, if there are quality differences between true and suggested accounts und to what extent experts of statement psychology are able to distinguish reliably between true and suggested statements. To answer these issues a study was designed taking into account relevant forensic factors. Sixty-seven children (aged between six and eight years) were interviewed individually six times about one real and one fictitious event. The events, individually selected for each child, were negative participant activities, wich involved the own body of the children and contained a loss of control (such as being bitten by an animal, falling off of a bicycle, cutting oneself etc.). The first four interviews served to evoke <b>coherent</b> <b>statements</b> about the fictitious event, applying various suggestive techniques. The fifth interview was conducted by different interviewers who did not know which of the events were true and which were fictitious. They questioned the children about both events in a non-suggestive manner. The sixth interview, conducted by a new informed interviewer, served to partially debrief the children, and to find out to what extent false memories had been created. Five blind experts were asked to jugde the quality and the credibility of the reports on the basis of different amounts of information (personal impression by interviewing the child, videotape of the interview, transcripts of the interview). Results show that over the course of the interviews there was a considerable increase of assents to the fictitious events. Moreover, the quality of suggested reports had increased substantially, so hardly any quality differences between true and suggested statements could be demonstrated in the fifth interview. Accordingly, experts had difficulties in discriminating between true and suggested reports, especially in identifying suggested statements. This was especially the case when they only used transcripts of the interviews. Furthermore, several children apparently were convinced of the truth of their reports and had developed false memories of the fictitious event. Results are discussed with regard to relevance to the practice of statement psychology and credibility assessment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Health policymakers require timely {{evidence}} to inform decision-making, however, rapid social change often outpaces {{the capacity of}} traditional approaches to research to produce meaningful insights. The pervasion of mobile technologies and internet access offers opportunities for capturing context specific and near real-time data on people’s perceptions, behaviours and everyday experiences that could usefully inform decision-making. The Right Here Right Now pilot study was established to provide insights into public responses to, and lived experiences of, contemporary social and health issues. From May to October 2015, a cohort of 180 adults living in Glasgow were asked weekly questions. These questions were developed with decision-makers working in health and social policy or in response to topical newsworthy public health issues that arose. The questions were delivered through an online system and allowed participants to answer directly by website, SMS or post. Aim: An issue that was of high public health policy interest and debate during this period was {{the need for further}} tobacco and nicotine control. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the potential of using an online data collection system with a cohort of Glasgow residents to provide rapid insights into public opinion on such policy developments. Method: Three smoking/vaping related questions were sent out to Right Here Right Now participants over the course of the study. The questions were in four parts, first a multiple choice question and then three qualitative follow-up questions based on participants’ responses to part one. The questions were developed with stakeholders working in health advocacy and policy development. They focused on: perceptions of the pervasion of e-cigarettes; legislation on smoking in cars carrying children; and reflections on ten years of the ‘smoking ban’ in enclosed public places. Results: The response rate ranged from 45 % to 55 % (65 – 78 participants). In relation to e-cigarettes most participants described seeing e-cigarettes as a matter of course, a mundane and quickly adopted feature of social life, particularly outdoors and especially in the street. The responses offered a range of drivers for e-cigarette use, and the varied references to health reflect the complex and often competing public narratives of health risk and benefit surrounding e-cigarettes. By contrast responses to legislation prohibiting smoking in cars carrying children and the legacy of the ‘smoking ban’ in enclosed public spaces showed almost universal support. Almost all participants responded by reproducing well-rehearsed and <b>coherent</b> <b>statements</b> around the harms of second-hand smoke. Conclusions: The Right Here Right Now system was able to provide rapid insights into people’s perceptions of ongoing debates around tobacco and nicotine use, and associated policy developments/legislative proposals. The system can provide a barometer for public support for proposed legislation, and its acceptability as a means of changing health behaviours. It can also offer insights for policy development which require further nuanced understanding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of a large scale empirical study of coherent dependence clusters. All <b>statements</b> in a <b>coherent</b> dependence cluster depend upon the same set of statements and affect the same set of statements; a <b>coherent</b> cluster's <b>statements</b> have ‘coherent’ shared backward and forward dependence. We introduce an approximation to efficiently locate coherent clusters and show that it has a minimum precision of 97. 76 %. Our empirical study also finds that, despite their tight coherence constraints, coherent dependence clusters are in abundance: 23 of the 30 programs studied have coherent clusters that contain at least 10 % of the whole program. Studying patterns of clustering in these programs reveals that most programs contain multiple substantial coherent clusters. A series of subsequent case studies uncover that all clusters of significant size map to a logical functionality and correspond to a program structure. For example, we show that for the program acct, the top five coherent clusters all map to specific, yet otherwise non-obvious, functionality. Cluster visualization also brings out subtle deficiencies in program structure and identifies potential refactoring candidates. A study of inter-cluster dependence is used to highlight how coherent clusters are connected to each other, revealing higher-level structures, which can be used in reverse engineering. Finally, studies are presented to illustrate how clusters are not correlated with program faults as they remain stable during most system evolution...|$|R
