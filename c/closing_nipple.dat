50|$|A nipple {{is a short}} stub of pipe, usually male-threaded steel, brass, {{chlorinated}} {{polyvinyl chloride}} (CPVC), or copper (occasionally unthreaded copper), which connects two other fittings. A nipple with continuous uninterrupted threading {{is known as a}} <b>close</b> <b>nipple.</b> Nipples are commonly used with plumbing and hoses.|$|R
50|$|A double-tapped bushing is {{a fitting}} {{which serves as}} a reducer. It is a sleeve similar to a <b>close</b> <b>nipple,</b> but is {{threaded}} on both its inner and outer circumferences. Like a reducer, a double-tapped bushing has two threads of different sizes.|$|R
50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{toothed gear}} {{is mounted on}} a hexagonal shaft. The wrench is introduced inside the pipe (especially a <b>close</b> <b>nipple,</b> which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench). As the wrench is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip {{the inside of the}} pipe. As with a regular pipe wrench, the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} the nipple is usually {{specified}} by the overall length with threads. It may have a hexagonal section in the center for wrench to grasp (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "hex nipple"), or it may simply be made from a short piece of pipe (sometimes referred to as a [...] "barrel nipple" [...] or [...] "pipe nipple"). A [...] "close nipple" [...] has no unthreaded area; when screwed tightly between two female fittings, very little of the nipple remains exposed. A <b>close</b> <b>nipple</b> can only be unscrewed by gripping one threaded end with a pipe wrench which will damage the threads and necessitate replacing the nipple, or by using a specialty tool known as a nipple wrench (or known as an internal pipe wrench) which grips the inside of the pipe, leaving the threads undamaged. When the ends are of two different sizes it is called a reducer or unequal nipple.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{high-resolution}} 3 D finite difference {{model of}} the electrical conductivity distribution in a human thorax based on a 43 -slice MRI data set along with lead field theory {{was used to examine}} the effect of thoracic conductivity inhomo-geneities on sensitivity distributions. The electrode configu-rations {{used in the present study}} were based on an eight-electrode array positioned evenly around the thoracic model at a level <b>close</b> the <b>nipple</b> line. Sensitivity distributions of each possible adjacent pair current excitation pattern for both the homogeneous thoracic model and the heterogeneous thoracic model were evaluated. The results show that thoracic inhomogeneities significantly perturb sensitivity distribution patterns. Although for a given thoracic geometry the electrode configuration gives the overall sensitivity distribution features, sharp large local changes occur near the boundaries between different tissues in the heterogeneous model. The results of sensitivity distributions of the hetero-geneous thoracic model demonstrate the feasibility of imped-ance source localization. Selectivity can be used to as a guide to finding favorable electrode configuration for regional impedance monitoring.

30|$|The {{option of}} WLE was offered to all {{eligible}} women, {{such as those}} with small tumours {{in relation to the}} breast volume, without contraindications or objections to post-operative radiation therapy; those with multicentric or multifocal tumours, or tumours <b>close</b> to the <b>nipple</b> areolar complex were considered on a case-by-case basis. Some surgeons recommend mastectomy for invasive lobular carcinoma because of the more frequent association with multifocal disease, while others include breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pre-operative work-up before proceeding with WLE. Other tumour factors do not affect decision-making. Several other factors, such as advanced age, pre-existing co-morbidities, poor family and social support, however, influence the choice of surgery. Immediate breast reconstruction with an autologous flap was often offered as an option to women below 60  years of age without significant co-morbidities, and was only performed together with a mastectomy. The more complex oncoplastic techniques now practiced in many centres and reconstruction using breast implants were not performed during this period.|$|R
40|$|The primary aim in the {{treatment}} of inverted nipple is to achieve a satisfactory and permanent projection of the nipple. The drawbacks of reported techniques include sensory disturbance of the nipple, marked scarring of the nipple and areola, destruction of breast function and incomplete correction. In the present study, the authors introduced a new modification of using two opposite nipple-based areolar dermal flap in {{the treatment}} of grades 2 and 3 inverted nipple cases. Nipple-based areolar flaps designed at 3 o′clock and 9 o′clock were raised by two linear incisions and the tip of each flap was sutured on the base of the <b>nipple</b> <b>close</b> to the base itself in a reverse S shape at 6 and 12 o′clock. Successful outcome was obtained due to a strongly suspending effect of the design of the flaps. The mean follow-up period was 6 months. The patients were satisfied with the result and the scars were minimal. The authors recommend the use of the technique that is a simple, reliable and with minimal scars for correcting grades 2 and 3 inverted nipples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a simple, fast, {{and accurate}} method for automatically locating the nipple on digitized mammograms {{that have been}} segmented to reveal the skin-air interface. If the average gradient of the intensity is computed in the direction normal to the interface and directed inside the breast, {{it is found that}} there is a sudden and distinct change in this parameter <b>close</b> to the <b>nipple.</b> A nipple in profile is located between two successive maxima of this parameter; otherwise, it is near the global maximum. Specifically, the nipple is located midway between a successive maximum and minimum of the derivative of the average intensity gradient; these being local turning points for a nipple in profile and global otherwise. The method has been tested on 24 images, including both oblique and cranio-caudal views, from two digital mammogram databases. For 23 of the images (96 %), the rms error was less than 1 mm at image resolutions of 400 μm and 420 μm per pixel. Because of its simplicity, and because it is based both on the observed behavior of mammographic tissue intensities and on geometry, this method has the potential to become a generic method for locating the nipple on mammograms...|$|R
40|$|Background: The inverted-T {{technique}} {{is the most}} popular skin pattern used for mastopexy, but short scar variations have increased in popularity over recent years. With respect to nipple elevation, superior, superomedial, medial, inferior, lateral, and central pedicle designs have been described. Objectives: We introduce a novel concept for mastopexy, the glandular Z-mammaplasty, and assess its anatomic and technical feasibility. Methods: Glandular Z-plasty was performed on 15 human female cadavers. Various parameters were measured pre- and postoperatively to assess degree of ptosis and subsequently compared by student t test. Results: Average pre and postoperative breast width (28. 5 ± 4. 7 cm, 26. 7 ± 3. 2 cm, P =. 009), breast length (25 ± 6. 6 cm and 21. 8 ± 4. 3 cm P =. 005), breast height (10. 7 ± 3. 7 cm and 9. 5 ± 2. 9 cm, P =. 02), and ptosis degree (1. 9 ± 0. 9 cm and 0. 3 ± 0. 5 cm, P <. 0001) were determined. Inferior limb transposition moved the <b>nipple</b> <b>closer</b> to the sternal notch and sternum midline an average of 5. 3 ± 2. 2 cm and 2. 4 ± 1. 7 cm, respectively. The average Z-plasty degree was 34. 5 ± 8. 2 °. The average central limb length was 8. 7 ± 2. 1, and the average pedicle width was 5. 4 ± 0. 8 cm. Buttress support of the nipple was accomplished by caudal transposition of the superior Z-plasty flap and its inset below the nipple. Conclusion: We demonstrate that glandular Z-mammaplasty is indeed feasible. The grade of ptosis was statistically significantly improved, with the nipple moving superiorly an average of 5. 3 cm in our study group...|$|R
30|$|In our study, we {{observed}} that older women tended to undergo mastectomy; 19  % {{of those who}} had a mastectomy were older than 70  years of age as compared to 8  % {{of those who had}} a WLE. We were unable to conclude whether this was a preference {{on the part of the}} patient or the surgeon but from our experience, older women often prioritise a shorter treatment course over post-operative cosmesis and would rather avoid a repeat operation and daily post-operative radiation sessions. Financial costs may also be a contributing factor. Surgeons may also be more inclined towards mastectomy in older women, particularly those with significant co-morbidities who could have a higher risk of potential morbidity from additional surgery and radiation treatments. Even so, as many as 40  % of our women younger than 70  years of age with tumours smaller than 2  cm underwent mastectomy, instead of WLE. This may seem a relatively high proportion, but Asian women generally have smaller breast volumes and a 2  cm tumour may be too large or too <b>close</b> to the <b>nipple</b> areolar complex for WLE. Median tumour size in our study was 2.1  cm, and was larger than most tumours in the studies where WLE was found superior to mastectomy (Agarwal et al. 2014; Hwang et al. 2013). Furthermore, many women opt for mastectomy rather than take up neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downsize a tumour deemed too large for breast conservation. The tendency for women with symptoms to undergo mastectomy may reflect differences in the attitudes and psyche of women presenting to the clinics. Women with symptoms often seek medical attention because they suspect a cancer and often seem to assume that mastectomy would be offered once the diagnosis is confirmed. On the other hand, women attending breast screening are often unprepared for a cancer diagnosis and tend to opt for less extensive surgery. Regardless, our study suggests that many women eligible for WLE undergo a mastectomy instead.|$|R
40|$|Male {{breast cancer}} (MBC) is rare, with an {{estimated}} 145 men diagnosed in Australia this year and up to 12 % of these having a BRCA 2 mutation. The median age at diagnosis for men is 71 years versus 60 years for women. Most men with enlarged breasts have lipomastia or pseudogynaecomastia. Gynaecomastia refers to unilateral or bilateral breast tenderness due to hormonal changes. Conversely, MBC tends to present as unilateral, often nodular tumours located <b>close</b> to the <b>nipple</b> and bloody nipple discharge can occur. Initial investigation includes ultrasound and mammography followed by core-biopsy of the primary lesion and often fine-needle biopsy of abnormal axillary nodes. Breast MRI may be helpful. Common histologies include infiltrating ductal (90 %) followed by papillary carcinomas (3 %) and DCIS in 2 % of patients. ER-positive disease accounts for 80 % of patients and HER 2 -positive disease is uncommon (< 5 %). Treatment is total mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. If a patient presents with a larger mass, a PET-CT or CT and bone scan is necessary to assess loco-regional and distant disease and this often helps determine whether axillary dissection, sentinel node biopsy or IMC irradiation is required. Most patients require post-mastectomy radiotherapy, as the disease is often advanced at presentation and obtaining clear margins can be difficult. Limited studies {{support the use of}} adjuvant tamoxifen and/or chemotherapy, but not aromatase inhibitors alone. Herceptin is advisable if patient is HER 2 positive, but studies are limited. Follow-up and review in a family history clinic is important, as 12. 5 % of patients will develop a second cancer. BRCA 2 mutation may account for increased risk of pancreatic, prostate and gastric cancer. There is significant psychological impact from MBC with issues including "contested masculinity", "concealment" and "interacting with health services" for patients facing a disease dominated by pink and the female sex. Increasing awareness is essential. 2 page(s...|$|R
