In this way, we have found that aluminum comes only from the use of uncoated graphite susceptors.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system was}} developed for evaluation {{of the effects of}} aerodynamic heating and cooling, vacuum, and pressure loading on candidate insulation packages proposed for use on the space shuttle. The system includes a number of design features which facilitate rapid recycle times. This is necessary to efficiently conduct extensive thermal cycling tests on these insulation packages to determine their reuse capabilities. The heart of the system is a 26 -inch graphite element radiant heater. A susceptor plate functions as a uniform-temperature intermediate radiating surface. The susceptor also forms the lid of an inert atmosphere enclosure which separates the heater from the oxidizing test atmosphere. In some tests the plate properly simulates the heating from an actual flight heat-shield panel. Although other materials were used at lower required test temperatures, 2500 F was routinely achieved using a <b>coated</b> columbium <b>susceptor</b> plate...|$|R
40|$|A novel coating {{method for}} the GaN-MOCVD {{graphite}} susceptor is {{proposed in the}} paper, {{which means that the}} upper surface and sides of the graphite susceptor are covered with a low emissivity material coating, and the surface under the susceptor is covered with a high emissivity SiC coating. By using finite element analysis software COMSOL Multiphysics, the temperature field of the <b>susceptors</b> without <b>coating,</b> with common SiC coating, and with improved coating is obtained and compared, which shows that the susceptor with the improved coating not only increases the heating efficiency of the heater, but also improves the temperature uniformity of the substrate, which can be of great benefit to the film growth. In addition, this improved <b>coating</b> for the <b>susceptor</b> has the same heating sensitivity as the common SiC coating...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to present the design and {{development}} of a chemical vapor deposition reactor {{for the growth of}} high quality homoepitaxy silicon carbide films for electronic device applications. The work was performed in the Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center at the University of South Florida from 8 / 2001 - 5 / 2003. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the technique of choice for SiC epitaxial growth. Epitaxial layers are the building blocks for use in various semiconductor device applications. This thesis reports on a SiC epitaxy process where a carrier gas (hydrogen) is saturated with reactive precursors (silane and propane) which are then delivered to a semiconductor substrate resting on a RF induction heated SiC <b>coated</b> graphite <b>susceptor.</b> Growth proceeds via a series of heterogeneous chemical reactions with several steps, including precursor adsorption, surface diffusion and desorbtion of volatile by-products. The design and development of a reactor to make this process controlled and repeatable can be accomplished using theoretical and empirical tools. Fluid flow modeling, reactor sizing, low-pressure pumping and control are engineering concepts that were explored. Work on the design and development of an atmospheric pressure cold-wall CVD (APCVD) reactor will be presented. A detailed discussion of modifications to this reactor to permit hot-wall, low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) operation will then be presented. The consequences of this process variable change will be discussed as well as the necessary design parameters. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations, which predict the flow patterns of gases in the reaction tube, will be presented. Feasible CVD reactor design that results in laminar fluid flow control {{is a function of the}} prior mentioned techniques and will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{molybdenum}} oxides were produced on silicon substrates from Mo(CO) [subscript] 6 and O[subscript] 2 using both a low pressure and plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (LPCVD and PECVD). The substrates were heated using a SiC <b>coated</b> graphite <b>susceptor</b> which was inductively coupled to a 200 - 450 kHz radio-frequency (RF) generator and using a Macor resistive heater. The process variables investigated were temperature, 250 - 530 °C; pressure, 100 - 1014 mtorr; Mo(CO) [subscript] 6 flow rate, 0. 56 - 6. 7 mg/min; O[subscript] 2 flow rate, 5 - 15 sccm; H[subscript] 2 O flow rate of 0. 0 - 0. 53 sccm; and RF current, 22 - 34 amps;Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were conducted on the system using a computer program, Solgasmix-PV. The calculations indicated that [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3 was the most stable phase for all deposition conditions. [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3 films formed under LPCVD conditions at temperatures greater than 350 °C and pressures of 300 mtorr or more depending upon the reactor geometry and the heater used during deposition. The [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3 films were oriented and had a columnar or platelet structure. At lower temperatures under LPCVD conditions reduced molybdenum oxides, MoO[subscript] 2 and Mo[subscript] 4 O[subscript] 11, were produced. A quadratic model was developed {{of the formation of}} LPCVD [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3 as a function of temperature and pressure. The film uniformity and composition were strongly influenced by transport processes;At high RF currents, the RF generator created an inductively coupled Ar-O[subscript] 2 plasma in the system when using the Macor heater. Films deposited under PECVD conditions were oriented [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3; the PECVD films had lower deposition rates and were produced at lower temperatures than LPCVD [alpha]-MoO[subscript] 3 films.

40|$|Graphene {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{material}} due to its promising properties, for instance electronics applications. Graphene films were grown on silicon carbide (SiC) substrate using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Influence of the deposition temperature on the morphology of the films was investigated. Characterizations were done by reflectance mapping, atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Two samples were done by sublimation process, to compare the number of layers and the morphology of the graphene films with the one grown by chemical vapor deposition. The reflectance mapping showed that the number of layers on the samples made by CVD was notinfluenced by the deposition temperature. But also, demonstrated that sublimation growth is present in allthe samples due to the presence of silicon <b>coating</b> in the <b>susceptor.</b> The growth probably started by sublimation and then CVD deposition. The step morphology characteristic of the silicon carbide substrate surface was conserved during the deposition of graphene. But due to surface step bunching, a decrease inthe step height occurred and the width of the terraces increased. The decreasing in deposition temperature leads to a smoother surface with the CVD method. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence ofgraphene and of the buffer layer characteristic of the sublimation growth. Moreover, it demonstrated the presence of compressive strain in the graphene layers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) process for the new directions in both silicon carbon (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) epitaxial growth. The properties of the grown epitaxial layers are investigated in detail {{in order to have}} a deep understanding. SiC is a promising wide band gap semiconductor material which could be utilized for fabricating high-power and high-frequency devices. 3 C-SiC is the only polytype with a cubic structure and has superior physical properties over other common SiC polytypes, such as high hole/electron mobility and low interface trap density with oxide. Due to lack of commercial native substrates, 3 C-SiC is mainly grown on the cheap silicon (Si) substrates. However, there’s a large mismatch in both lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients leading to a high density of defects in the epitaxial layers. In paper 1, the new CVD solution for growing high quality double-position-boundaries free 3 C-SiC using on-axis 4 H-SiC substrates is presented. Reproducible growth parameters, including temperature, C/Si ratio, ramp-up condition, Si/H 2 ratio, N 2 addition and pressure, are covered in this study. GaN is another attractive wide band gap semiconductor for power devices and optoelectronic applications. In the GaN-based transistors, carbon is often exploited to dope the buffer layer to be semi-insulating in order to isolate the device active region from the substrate. The conventional way is to use the carbon atoms on the gallium precursor and control the incorporation by tuning the process parameters, e. g. temperature, pressure. However, there’s a risk of obtaining bad morphology and thickness uniformity if the CVD process is not operated in an optimal condition. In addition, carbon source from the graphite insulation and improper <b>coated</b> graphite <b>susceptor</b> may also contribute to the doping in a CVD reactor, which is very difficult to be controlled in a reproducible way. Therefore, in paper 2, intentional carbon doping of (0001) GaN using six hydrocarbon precursors, i. e. methane (CH 4), ethylene (C 2 H 4), acetylene (C 2 H 2), propane (C 3 H 8), iso-butane (i-C 4 H 10) and trimethylamine (N(CH 3) 3), have been explored. In paper 3, propane is chosen for carbon doping when growing the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure on a quarter of 3 -inch 4 H-SiC wafer. The quality of epitaxial layer and fabricated devices is evaluated. In paper 4, the behaviour of carbon doping using carbon atoms from the gallium precursor, trimethylgallium (Ga(CH 3) 3), is explained by thermochemical and quantum chemical modelling and compared with the experimental results. GaN is commonly grown on foreign substrates, such as sapphire (Al 2 O 3), Si and SiC, resulting in high stress and high threading dislocation densities. Hence, bulk GaN substrates are preferred for epitaxy. In paper 5, the morphological, structural and luminescence properties of GaN epitaxial layers grown on N-face free-standing GaN substrates are studied since the N-face GaN has advantageous characteristics compared to the Ga-face GaN. In paper 6, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) technique is used to study the properties of AlGaN/GaN epitaxial layers grown on both Ga-face and N-face free-standing GaN substrates. A PL line located at ~ 3. 41 eV is only emerged on the sample grown on the Ga-face substrate, which is suggested to associate with two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) emission...|$|R
