The warm-up area has seating for 86 VIP ticket holders, and is separated by soundproof glass. All the public areas have air conditioning and are finished in marble, granite or top tier ceramic tile.|$|E
5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in <b>cryotherapy</b> to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
25|$|Treatments for {{significant}} lesions include <b>cryotherapy,</b> loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), and laser ablation.|$|E
25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} can {{be treated}} with local <b>cryotherapy</b> when the hookworm {{is still in the}} skin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryotherapy</b> (freezing) or laser {{photocoagulation}} are occasionally used {{alone to}} wall off {{a small area}} of retinal detachment so that the detachment does not spread.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{treatments}} {{have been found}} to be effective. A 2012 review of different treatments for skin warts in otherwise healthy people concluded modest benefit from salicylic acid and <b>cryotherapy</b> appears similar to salicylic acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryotherapy,</b> {{cold water}} {{immersion}} or ice bath {{is a new}} form of hydrotherapy used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics. Proponents claim improved return of blood flow and byproducts of cellular breakdown to the lymphatic system and more efficient recycling.|$|E
25|$|If it {{has spread}} {{outside of the}} kidneys, often into the lymph nodes, the lungs or the main vein of the kidney, then {{multiple}} therapies are used including surgery and medications. RCC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in most cases, but does respond well to immunotherapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha, biologic, or targeted therapy. In early stage cases, <b>cryotherapy</b> and surgery are the preferred options.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physicians}} and patients may consider having lower limbs venous ultrasonography {{to screen for}} deep vein thrombosis after knee replacement. However, this kind of screening should be done only when indicated because to perform it routinely would be unnecessary health care. If a medical condition exists that could cause deep vein thrombosis, a physician can choose to treat patients with <b>cryotherapy</b> and intermittent pneumatic compression as a preventive measure.|$|E
25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and <b>cryotherapy</b> (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} a retinal tear, efforts to prevent it {{becoming}} a detachment include <b>cryotherapy</b> using a cold probe or photocoagulation using a laser. Treatment of retinal detachment should be carried out in a timely manner. This may include scleral buckling where silicone is sutured {{to the outside of}} the eye, pneumatic retinopexy where gas is injected into the eye, or vitrectomy where the vitreous is partly removed and replaced with either gas or oil.|$|E
25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can be mitigated in {{some cases}} when the warning signs are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of retinal tears {{which can be treated}} with laser or <b>cryotherapy.</b> This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination.|$|E
25|$|A probe {{is placed}} {{through the skin}} and into the tumor using {{real-time}} imaging of both the probe tip and the tumor by computed tomography, ultrasound, or even magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat (radiofrequency ablation) or cold (<b>cryotherapy).</b> These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation. Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5nbsp&cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation {{can be used on}} tumors that are larger.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. <b>Cryotherapy</b> (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the <b>cryotherapy</b> had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E
500|$|The {{medical staff}} were also worried, because a {{systemic}} illness with intestinal inflammation, such as colitis, {{is a common}} precursor to laminitis, a painful inflammation of the internal structures of the hoof. [...] The staff had been using <b>cryotherapy</b> on his lower legs as a precaution. Although his blood test results and protein levels began to stabilize, he nevertheless developed laminitis in three of his feet on September 4, ten days after {{he arrived at the}} center. The veterinarians treating Paynter put casts on his lower legs to support his feet. [...] Most experts believed that even if he survived his racing days were over, and the Zayat family feared that euthanasia would be necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Laparoscopic <b>cryotherapy</b> {{can also}} be done on smaller lesions. [...] Typically a biopsy is taken {{at the time of}} treatment. [...] Intraoperative {{ultrasound}} may be used to help guide placement of the freezing probes. Two freeze/thaw cycles are then performed to kill the tumor cells. [...] As the tumor is not removed followup is more complicated (see below) and overall disease free rates are not as good as those obtained with surgical removal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{training}} complex used by AEK {{is located}} in Spata. Owned by Nicholas X. Notias, {{it is the most}} expensive (with a total cost around 25 million euros) and one of the three biggest training centers in Greece. There are three regular pitches and one synthetic grass. The main building of the center hosts offices of the club, a press room, and the players' rooms. The training ground is used by the first team and youth teams. The Sports Center includes state-of-the-art facilities, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a <b>cryotherapy</b> center and more. There are also plans for an AEK Museum, hotel, aquatic center and two more soccer fields. AEK moved to the complex in November 2010. Since 2014, the official name of the ground is [...] "OPAP Sports Center".|$|E
2500|$|Scleral buckle {{surgery is}} an {{established}} treatment {{in which the}} eye surgeon sews one or more silicone bands (or tyres) to the sclera (the white outer coat of the eyeball). The bands push {{the wall of the}} eye inward against the retinal hole, closing the break or reducing fluid flow through it and reducing the effect of vitreous traction thereby allowing the retina to re-attach. <b>Cryotherapy</b> (freezing) is applied around retinal breaks prior to placing the buckle. [...] Often subretinal fluid is drained as part of the buckling procedure. The buckle remains in situ. The most common side effect of a scleral operation is myopic shift. That is, the operated eye will be more short sighted after the operation. Radial scleral buckle is indicated for U-shaped tears or Fishmouth tears, and posterior breaks. Circumferential scleral buckle is indicated for multiple breaks, anterior breaks and wide breaks. Encircling buckles are indicated for breaks covering more than 2 quadrants of retinal area, lattice degeneration located on more than 2 quadrant of retinal area, undetectable breaks, and proliferative vitreous retinopathy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cryotherapy</b> - <b>Cryotherapy</b> induces {{damage to}} the {{vascular}} endothelium with secondary thrombosis and infarction of the tumor tissue by rapidly freezing it. <b>Cryotherapy</b> {{may be used as}} primary therapy for small peripheral tumors or for small recurrent tumors previously treated with other methods.|$|E
50|$|RBDV can be {{eradicated}} from infected {{plants by}} {{a procedure that}} first applies thermotherapy then <b>cryotherapy</b> to infected shoots. Applying heat to infected plants causes vacuoles in infected cells to enlarge, with these cells later being killed during <b>cryotherapy.</b> Adding either Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or Fe-ethylenediaminedi(o)hydroxyphenylacetic acid after <b>cryotherapy</b> stimulates regrowth and prevents chlorosis from developing in plant shoots. Using this method, about 80% of shoots survive the initial heat therapy, with 33% surviving the <b>cryotherapy</b> and successfully regrowing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cryotherapy</b> is {{the local}} or general use of low {{temperatures}} in medical therapy. <b>Cryotherapy</b> is used to treat a variety of benign and malignant tissue damage, medically called lesions. The term [...] "cryotherapy" [...] comes from the Greek cryo (κρύο) meaning cold, and therapy (θεραπεία) meaning cure. <b>Cryotherapy</b> {{has been used as}} early as the seventeenth century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryotherapy,</b> {{the use of}} ice or cold in a {{therapeutic}} setting, {{has become one of}} the most common treatments in orthopedic medicine. The primary reason for using <b>cryotherapy</b> in acute injury management is to lower the temperature of the injured tissue, which reduces the tissue's metabolic rate and helps the tissue to survive the period following the injury. It is well documented that metabolic rate decreases by application of <b>cryotherapy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While <b>cryotherapy</b> {{is widely}} used, {{there appears to}} be little {{evidence}} as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies.
