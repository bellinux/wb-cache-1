5|$|D. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2010 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for the prohibited substance <b>Clenbuterol</b> on a rest day. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using <b>clenbuterol</b> during the race and stripped him of his title on 6 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2012, MLB {{announced}} that they were suspending Mota for 100 games due to his testing positive for <b>Clenbuterol,</b> a performance-enhancing substance. This was his second suspension as he had previously been suspended for 50 games in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport {{decided that}} Contador, {{following}} his positive test for <b>clenbuterol</b> at the 2010 Tour de France, lost his results since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, {{and the winner}} of the points classification.|$|E
5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using <b>clenbuterol</b> during the race; thus his results since the 2010 Tour de France were taken away from him and he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for <b>clenbuterol</b> at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Contador {{announced}} that he had tested positive for the banned <b>clenbuterol</b> from a sample taken during his now-disqualified 2010 Tour victory. He was suspended from racing during an investigation until February 2011. When cleared to race he competed in and won the general classifications of the Vuelta a Murcia, Volta a Catalunya and Giro d'Italia before the Tour. With overall victory in the Tour he was aiming to complete the Giro-Tour double, last achieved by Marco Pantani in the 1998 Tour. Schleck had placed second to Contador in the previous two Tours and won the young rider classification in the previous three. In the lead up to the Tour his best results were third in the one-day race Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the mountains classification of the Tour de Suisse. Evans, podium finisher in the 2007 and 2008 Tours, had a successful season before the Tour, winning the general classifications of both the Tour de Romandie and Tirreno–Adriatico, as well as second place in the Critérium du Dauphiné.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of <b>clenbuterol</b> found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.|$|E
5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for <b>clenbuterol</b> at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
5|$|Before Mota {{ever played}} for the Red Sox, however, he was traded again to the Cleveland Indians. He {{struggled}} in his time with the Indians in 2006 and was designated for assignment by them in August. The New York Mets acquired him, and Mota improved mightily upon joining them. Following the season, he became a free agent, but he again signed with the Mets. After struggling in 2007, he {{was traded to the}} Milwaukee Brewers. He got off to a poor start with Milwaukee in 2008 but improved in the second half. Following the season, Mota became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers again. He had his best year since 2004 and became a free agent again after the season. For {{the first time in his}} career, in 2010 he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. After making the team out of spring training, Mota won his first career World Series despite struggling at times during the season. Following the season, he signed another minor league contract with the Giants and made the team out of spring training again. During the 2012 season, Mota became one of three players in league history to fail a drug test twice when it was shown he tested positive for <b>Clenbuterol,</b> a performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, aerosolised drugs, such as {{salbutamol}} or <b>clenbuterol,</b> may be used. <b>Clenbuterol</b> {{also has}} anti-inflammatory actions, {{and is therefore}} often preferred.|$|E
25|$|Contador tested {{positive}} for <b>clenbuterol</b> in the 2010 Tour de France and was subsequently suspended from cycling for two years.|$|E
25|$|Bronchodilatation {{is already}} maximized in the exercising horse, {{therefore}} bronchodilatory agents such as ipratropium, albuterol, or <b>clenbuterol</b> are not {{effective in reducing}} EIPH.|$|E
25|$|In an emergency, {{intravenous}} <b>clenbuterol</b> or atropine may be used, but {{care must}} be exercised with atropine, as it may predispose to adverse systemic side effects such as mydriasis, excitement, GI stasis and colic.|$|E
25|$|The German National Anti-Doping Agency warned athletes {{that some}} meat in Mexico had tested {{positive}} for the stimulant <b>clenbuterol.</b> However, Games officials said that food served at the athletes' village would be tested to ensure it contained no drugs or contaminants.|$|E
25|$|On 13th April 2017, Shahzad {{has been}} charged by the ICC for violating the {{anti-doping}} code. After testing his sample on 17 January 2017 at ICCA Academy in Dubai, it was found to contain a prohibited substance, <b>Clenbuterol.</b> Therefore, he was provisionally suspended 12 days after issuing the notice of charges being laid on April 26 2017.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, Contador {{revealed}} that a urine sample he had given on 21 July, a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France, had contained traces of <b>clenbuterol.</b> He has stated, due {{to the number of}} other tests he passed and that only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one he failed, that food contamination was to blame.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} 2010 Tour de France, it was {{announced}} that Alberto Contador had tested positive for low levels of <b>clenbuterol</b> on 21 July rest day. On 26 January 2011, the Spanish Cycling Federation proposed a 1-year ban but reversed its ruling on 15 February and cleared Contador to race. Despite a pending appeal by the UCI, Contador finished 5th overall in the 2011 Tour de France, but in February 2012, Contador was suspended and stripped of his 2010 victory.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Morales-Garcia rematch on October 20, 2012, United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) {{conducted}} two random {{drug tests}} (Oct 3 and 10, 2012). Morales was {{tested positive for}} use of the banned substance <b>Clenbuterol,</b> a weight-loss drug, it reduces fat deposits and is believed to increase muscle mass. Although the New York State Athletic Commission was notified 24 hours in advance of the Garcia-Morales bout regarding Morales’ positive drug test results, the legal process was still ongoing. The NYSAC allowed the fight to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Salbutamol {{has been}} shown to improve muscle weight in rats and anecdotal reports hypothesise that it might be an {{alternative}} to <b>clenbuterol</b> for purposes of fat burning and muscle gain, with multiple studies supporting this claim. Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1000µg/L. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4mg.|$|E
25|$|Contador {{assumed the}} race lead {{after winning the}} ninth stage to Mount Etna. Contador {{continued}} to increase his advantage by riding well in the remaining stages and winning the stage 16 individual time trial, which allowed him to win his second Giro d'Italia championship. Contador raced the 2011 Giro despite having an ongoing trial about his possible use of <b>clenbuterol,</b> a banned substance. On 6 February 2012 the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided that Contador should lose his 2010 Tour de France title and his results since that race, which included his Giro victory in May 2011, and receive a two-year ban. After Contador's conviction, runner up Michele Scarponi was then delegated the overall victory.|$|E
25|$|Vandenbroucke made {{headlines}} in 1999 {{for the first}} of many drug problems, arrested by Paris police but then released. In 2001 he was stopped on the E17 motorway in Belgium in a speeding car shared with Bernard Sainz, the so-called Dr Mabuse of cycling. Sainz was jailed in 2008 for falsely practising medicine. Sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as <b>clenbuterol,</b> morphine and EPO, which is used in sport as a blood-booster. Sainz insisted they were homeopathic products. After Sainz said he had spent the night at Vandenbroucke's house, police acquired a search warrant from a court in Termonde and searched Vandenbroucke's house with drugs specialists. There they found small quantities of more drugs which Vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog. Vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station. Two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment. Among them was his rival, Peter van Petegem. Vandenbroucke was banned by the Flemish cycling federation from riding in Belgium for six months.|$|E
500|$|At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Hardy {{qualified}} for the USA Olympic Team. [...] A few weeks later, on July 23, 2008, Hardy was notified that the second of her three tests from the Trials came back as positive for low levels of clenbuterol; this notification subsequently leaked to the media. [...] Her attorney confirmed on July 24, 2008, that Hardy's [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] samples from a test administered on July 4 were positive for <b>clenbuterol.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hardy claimed {{innocence and}} said she had {{never even heard of}} <b>clenbuterol.</b> [...] Media {{coverage}} of the issue noted that tainted supplements have played a part in some previous instances of bans, and in this case. [...] An example offered has been that of American swimmer Kicker Vencill, who won a lawsuit against a company that provided him with tainted supplements that resulted in a positive dope test and two-year ban from the sport. Under both American and international regulations, a lack of knowledge of the source of the substance ingested is not considered to be a defense against a positive result.|$|E
500|$|On 6 February 2012, CAS removed Alberto Contador's results {{due to his}} {{positive}} {{test for}} <b>clenbuterol</b> at the 2010 Tour. The UCI subsequently revised the final general classification, with riders ranked between 6 and 21 upgraded, and the 21st position left unattributed. On 18 October 2012, the UCI announced that a disciplinary procedure against Carlos Barredo (...) was taken following anomalies in his biological passport. He retired from cycling in December 2012. In July 2014, his results were disqualified from races in which he participated between 26 October 2007 and 24 September 2011, with his 35th position on the 2011 Tour's general classification left vacant.|$|E
500|$|On August 1, 2008, {{following}} Hardy's {{hearing before}} the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), USADA released a statement stating, [...] "The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) announced today that U.S. swimmer, Jessica Hardy, of Long Beach, CA, {{tested positive for the}} prohibited substance <b>clenbuterol</b> at the U.S. Olympic Trials on July 4, 2008, and has agreed to withdraw from the 2008 United States Olympic Team {{in the best interests of}} the team." [...] On August 1, 2008, Hardy officially, and voluntarily, left the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team. [...] In May 2009, it was announced that Hardy would be banned from the sport for one year for the positive test.|$|E

2500|$|Often, {{bronchodilators}} are {{the mainstay}} of therapy. One {{of the most common}} is <b>clenbuterol,</b> either as an oral medication administered twice daily in feed, or via the intravenous route.|$|E
2500|$|Scarponi also contested the Vuelta a España {{later in}} the season, again leading the [...] team. He {{finished}} second to Joaquim Rodríguez on the eighth stage, but was not {{a major factor in}} the general classification; he abandoned on stage 14, trailing the overall leader Bradley Wiggins by over 24 minutes. In February 2012, Contador was stripped of his victories in the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro d'Italia, after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) following his positive test for <b>clenbuterol</b> at the 2010 Tour de France. With Scarponi finishing second in both 2011 races, he was retrospectively promoted to first position.|$|E
2500|$|EE {{is ideal}} for {{pharmaceuticals}} with low concentrations of active ingredient, such as those containing proteins and peptides, because {{of its ability to}} lower limits of detection for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. [...] In addition, sample enrichment by EE helps overcome the low injection volumes and short optical path length of UV-Vis detectors that accompany CE. [...] EE coupled to CE has been used to separate and analyze antisense oligonucleotides. [...] Antisense oligonucleotides inhibit protein expression from their complimentary base pair sequence and can treat certain diseases and genetic disorders. [...] EE coupled to liquid chromatography also successfully detects low concentration metabolites in urine for the purpose of studying metabolic processes. [...] In addition, EE-ITP-CE has been used in the determination of the drugs <b>clenbuterol,</b> salbutamol, terbutaline, and fenoterol.|$|E
2500|$|Voigt {{began his}} {{last season with}} team manager Bjarne Riis (2010) by {{participating}} in the Tour Down Under and the Vuelta a Mallorca. He got his first top ten result {{of the year in}} the , just short of the podium in fourth position. In March, Voigt participated in Paris-Nice, where he finished second of the prologue and grabbed the yellow jersey after the third stage, which was shortened [...] due to snowfall. He lost the jersey the very next day to eventual winner Alberto Contador, but managed to finish fifth overall after Alejandro Valverde's second place was annulled for his implication in the Operación Puerto doping case. Voigt then headed to the Volta a Catalunya, where he won stage 4 after escaping from the peloton to join a group of four riders on the last ascent of the day. He eventually was left with only Rein Taaramae to worry about, and won the sprint against the [...] rider. In May, he scored a sixth place overall in the Tour of California thanks to consistent placings in the hilly stages and finishing fifth in the individual time trial held in Los Angeles. He participated to the Tour de France as a domestique to his leaders, the Schleck brothers. Voigt survived a scare on the mountainous stage 16, where he crashed heavily on the descent of the Col de Peyresourde, destroying his bike. After getting back up, he realized that all the team cars had passed and that he would not be handed a new bike. Desperate, he borrowed a child's bike much too small for him, from a children group's car which was following the race. He rode on it for about [...] before reaching a policeman who had another bicycle which had been left for him by his team. His teammate Andy Schleck finished the Tour in second place, but was later given the title since the original winner Alberto Contador tested positive to <b>clenbuterol.</b>|$|E
