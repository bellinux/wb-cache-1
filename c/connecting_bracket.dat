Brackets and attachment are modeled in detail and the brackets are integrated with global wing model. FE stress analysis is carried out for all three design ultimate load conditions. Failure-index of composite part is extracted on the basis of Yamada-Sun failure criteria.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{mechanically}} evaluate {{different systems}} used for canine retraction. METHODS: Three different methods for partial canine retraction were evaluated: retraction with elastic chain directly attached to bracket; elastic chain <b>connected</b> to <b>bracket</b> hook and with sliding jig activated {{with the aid}} of an elastic chain attached to a mini-implant. For this evaluation, a Typodont was adapted to simulate the desired movements when exposed to a heat source. After obtaining the measurements of the movements, statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: The mini-implant/sliding jig system (Groups M 0. 018 -in and M 0. 019 x 0. 026 -in) favored less extrusion and distal inclination of the canines in the retraction stage (p < 0. 005). Meanwhile, the retraction system with elastic chain directly attached to the orthodontic brackets (Groups C 0. 018 -in and 0. 019 x 0. 026 -in) favored greater inclination and extrusion than the others, followed by the system of elastic chain attached to the hook (Groups G 0. 018 -in and 0. 019 x 0. 026 -in). CONCLUSIONS: Canine retraction with the mini-implant/sliding jig system showed the best mechanical control.

40|$|Developing {{ideas of}} the formal {{geometry}} [G 1], [GKF], and ideas based on combinatorial formulas for characteristic classes we introduce the algebraic structure modeling N connections on the vector bundle over an oriented manifold. First we construct a graded free associative algebra A with a differential d. Then {{we go to the}} space V of cyclic words of A. Certain elements of V correspond to the secondary characteristic classes associated to k connections. That construction allows us to give easily the explicit formulas for some known secondary classes and to construct the new ones. Space V has new operations: it is a graded Lie algebra with respect to the Poisson bracket. We write how i-th differential and i-th homotopy operator in the algebra are <b>connected</b> with this <b>bracket.</b> There is an analogy between our algebra and the Kontsevich version of the noncommutative symplectic geometry.

40|$|The {{development}} of non-load bearing curtain walling technology {{around the turn}} of the 20 th centre along with an effort to reduce the energy consumption of the building and dependence on artificial lightening, the {{development of}} high performance glass and efficient building system has seen architectural trends move toward maximising glass surface areas in order to optimise natural light. This presents an opportunity to also investigate the façade system potential to become a filter for wind-induced vibration. The façade has been rarely considered or designed as a potential windinduced vibration absorber for tall buildings. In this paper the potential of utilizing a moveable exterior façade in a double-skin façade system is investigated and shown that with optimal choices of materials for stiffness and damping of <b>brackets</b> <b>connecting</b> the two skins, a substantial portion of wind-induced vibration energy can be dissipated which leads to avoiding expensive lateral stiffening systems and/or space consuming large damper systems such as tuned mass or liquid dampers. The works have demonstrated that up to 50 % of response caused by winds can be absorbed by a smart and efficient façade design, including purely passive systems with constant stiffness and damping or better, by a smart system possessing variable stiffness for different phases of façade movement...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the force delivered by different superlastic nickel-titanium wires during vertical displacement, in order to determine whether their stress release meets the criteria for constant and light forces that are usually accredited to these archwires. METHOD: Ten samples of 6 brands of 0. 016 -in archwires (Ormco, GAC, Morelli, TP, American Orthodontics e Rocky Mountain) were tested in a complete metal model using Dynalock brackets (3 M Unitek&# 8482;). In the canine position, there was a sliding <b>bracket</b> <b>connected</b> to a pole. This set was related to a load cell of 0. 5 kg attached to a universal testing machine (Autograph AG- 199 kNG, Shimadzu). The crosshead speed was 0. 5 mm/min and the maximum displacement was 1. 0 mm. The model was submerged in temperature-controlled water. The results were analyzed by ANOVA (p < 0. 05), using the software SAS System 8. 02, Cry, NC, USA. RESULTS: The TP archwire had the lowest force throughout the test, although the final force was high (277. 91 g). The Rocky Mountain archwire had the highest force release (455. 41 g).

40|$|Most of the {{research}} on high strain rate effects on wood since the 1950 s has been on impact loading. Very limited work has been conducted on full-scale wood specimens under blast loading. In North America, the prevalence of these structures makes them susceptible to unintended blast effects. The question on how to retrofit and protect these structures against blast loads has still not been addressed adequately, and design provisions for new wood structures against blast are not comprehensive. Far-field explosion effects were simulated using the University of Ottawa shock tube. Twenty-five light-frame wood stud walls were tested dynamically. The research program aimed to determine the response of light-frame wood stud walls to blast loads that correspond to the heavy to blow-out damage levels. The results showed that, under idealized simply supported end conditions, the stud walls failed in flexure. Under heavier loads, ripping of sheathing commonly used in light-frame wood structures was observed, which caused premature failure of the assembly because the load was not fully distributed to the studs. The use of stiffer sheathing or reinforcing the sheathing provided a better load path and the wall was capable of reaching its full capacity. The effect of using realistic boundary connection details was investigated, and the results showed that typical connection detailing performed poorly under blast loads. Designed steel <b>brackets</b> <b>connecting</b> the studs to the rim-joist allowed for the studs to reach their full capacity. An analytical single degree-of-freedom model was generated using material properties obtained from static testing. The model was validated using the experimental results from the shock tube testing.

40|$|AbstractVibro-acoustic source {{characterization}} is {{an essential}} task in vehicle development to enable prediction of receiver response. For structure-borne noise, the interface forces in multiple degrees of freedom due to internal loads are often quantified for root cause analyses in a single system assembly, as in transfer path analysis (TPA). However, for a reliable prognosis of the acoustic performance of a known component such as a motor or pump, a receiver-independent source characterization is required, and the method of acquiring blocked forces from in-situ measurements {{has been shown to}} be a preferred technique for such purposes. The benefits of the method are the characterization of the intrinsic properties of the source and the possibilities of measuring the component attached to receivers with varying dynamic properties. There is to date a limited number of validation cases where blocked forces from in-situ measurements are acquired for automotive source–receiver assemblies. In this study the blocked forces of a vacuum pump in nine degrees of freedom were determined when <b>connected</b> to a <b>bracket</b> whose boundary conditions were modified in order to achieve four assemblies with different source/receiver dynamic properties. The results show that the blocked forces are transferable, i. e. the receiver response in one assembly was predicted in a wide frequency range by combining source–receiver transfer functions of that assembly with blocked forces estimated in another assembly. Furthermore, an in-situ blocked force TPA was applied to a double-isolated complete vehicle source–receiver case of an electric rear axle drive with interior compartment sound pressure as target. The reconstructed magnetic tonal harmonics agreed with the measured target response in the frequency range 50 – 500 Hz, which further motivates the use of the blocked force principles for TPA and source requirements specifications...|$|R
