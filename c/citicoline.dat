25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> is water-soluble, {{with more}} than 90% oral bioavailability.

25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> is {{approved}} for treatment {{in cases of}} head trauma, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease in Japan and Europe. <b>Citicoline</b> improves the clinical outcome following an ischemic stroke, {{as evidenced by the}} reduction in size of lesions caused by ischemic strokes after supplementation. It has been claimed that <b>citicoline</b> reduces rates of death and disability following an ischemic stroke.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> lowers {{increased}} glutamate concentrations {{and raises}} decreased ATP concentrations induced by ischemia. <b>Citicoline</b> also increases glutamate uptake by increasing expression of EAAT2, a glutamate transporter, in vitro in rat astrocytes. It {{is suggested that}} the neuroprotective effects of <b>citicoline</b> after a stroke are {{due in part to}} citicoline’s ability to decrease levels of glutamate in the brain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> is {{available}} as a supplement online and in stores.

Once these cross the blood–brain barrier it is reformed into <b>citicoline</b> by the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> (INN), {{also known}} as {{cytidine}} diphosphate-choline (CDP-Choline) or cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine is an intermediate in the generation of phosphatidylcholine from choline, a common biochemical process in cell membranes. <b>Citicoline</b> is naturally occurring in the cells of human and animal tissue, in particular the organs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> {{has also}} been shown to elevate ACTH {{independently}} from CRH levels and to amplify the release of other HPA axis hormones such as LH, FSH, GH and TSH in response to hypothalamic releasing factors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> {{decreases}} phospholipase stimulation. This {{can lower}} levels of hydroxyl radicals produced after an ischemia and prevent cardiolipin from being catabolized by phospholipase A2. It can also work to restore cardiolipin levels in the inner mitochondrial membrane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Citicoline</b> has a {{very low}} {{toxicity}} profile in animals and humans. Clinically, doses of 2000nbsp&mg per day have been observed and approved. Minor transient adverse effects are rare and most commonly include stomach pain and diarrhea.|$|E

2500|$|The neuroprotective effects {{exhibited}} by <b>citicoline</b> {{may be due}} to its preservation of cardiolipin and sphingomyelin, preservation of arachidonic acid content of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, partial restoration of phosphatidylcholine levels, and stimulation of glutathione synthesis and glutathione reductase activity.
