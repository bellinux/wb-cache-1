40|$|Film historians situate {{the birth}} of le cinéma québécois in the late 1950 s with the {{emergence}} – within the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) – of an Équipe française whose Direct Cinema revolutionized documentary filmmaking. The grand narrative of Quebec national cinema emphasises the emancipating qualities of this cinematographic language and insists that it contributed to a collective prise de parole and Quebec’s ascension to modernity. Film historians mythologize the cinema of the Quiet Revolution (1958 - 1967) by inscribing the fiction films of the 1960 s within the trajectory of Direct Cinema. Borrowing from Jocelyn Létourneau, the present thesis uses the concept <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> to investigate the documentary-to-fiction transition that accompanied {{the creation of the}} NFB’s Production française in the mid- 1960 s. The argument advanced here is that Quebec’s francophone filmmakers, between 1963 and 1967, distanced themselves from documentary filmmaking – including Direct Cinema – to explore the dramatic form and feature length format. They formed a tightly-knit <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> whose actions, written works and films explained, legitimized and promoted the notion that Quebecers needed a commercial feature film industry of their own. The most prominent members of the Production française – Gilles Carle, Gilles Groulx and Arthur Lamothe to name but a few – played a preponderant role in this process. They articulated and disseminated an elaborate narrative which allowed them to consolidate their status as auteurs within a post-Duplessis Quebec. The present thesis reconstructs and analyzes the above filmmakers’ narrative to demythologize – and develop an alternative reading of – the cinema of the Quiet Revolution. ...|$|R

40|$|A European {{public sphere}} emerges out of Europeanized {{national}} public spheres if {{the following two}} phenomena are verified. First, {{if and when the}} same (European) themes are discussed at the same time with similar frames of reference, meaning structures, and patterns of interpretation across the various media sources. Second, if and when a transnational <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> emerges in which speakers and listeners recognize each other as legitimate participants in a discourse that frames the issues at stake as common European problems. We present empirical evidence from other scholars and two case studies of our own, namely Eastern enlargement and the sanctions against the Austrian ÖVP/FPÖ-government. The main finding is that at least when European issues are discussed, that a European public sphere is constituted and re-constituted through the discursive connections and debates across borders.

40|$|The {{academic}} {{discourse on}} the need for a shared political public sphere {{at the level of the}} European Union has in recent years produced the conventional wisdom that an emerging transnational <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> is already observable in the mass media. However, the empirical indicators on which this notion rests tend to accommodate parallel national public spheres rather than a genuine transnational communicative space. Arguing that the mutual permeability of national public spheres is a key precondition for the emergence of spaces for transnational opinion formation, this article analyzes to which extent the debate on the Constitutional Treaty in two Swedish quality newspapers has been characterized by transnational communication. While showing certain embryonic elements, the debate analyzed still falls short of fulfilling the normative requirements for a European public sphere understood as a genuine communicative community...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{the theory}} of Risse and Van de Steeg (2003) and Koopmans (2004), this thesis finds some few {{indications}} of Europeanisation occurring in the welfare debates in Sweden from 1995 to 2005 and in France from 2000 to 2005. The most contentious issues within the welfare debates {{proved to be more}} Europeanised than the general debate. Signs that a Western European <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> emerged were found in the discussion on the EU Constitutional Treaty and the French referendum that took place within the welfare debate. Moreover, based on Bartolini (2005) and on the assumption that European integration changes the welfare debates, this thesis also provides data confirming the hypothesis that a new cleavage line emerged in the welfare debates in the period of study. The cleavage is based on a European dimension that became politicised into the three groups of Welfare-Europeans, Welfare-Nationalists and Neoliberal Europeans...|$|R

40|$|By {{comparing}} European and US newspaper {{debates on}} the 2003 Iraq War, this working paper empirically tests whether a European public sphere exists regarding the contested issue {{of war and}} peace. This component of foreign and security policy represents a hard case for the evolution <b>of</b> European <b>communication</b> and looking for it empirically leads into nearly uncharted territory, as most studies have not yet addressed this particular policy field. The data set includes more than 400 articles from six respected newspapers in Germany, Great Britain, and the US, which serve in this case as a non-European control group. One interesting finding of the frame analysis {{is the fact that}} one can identify a European <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> that relates to the legal dimension of the Iraq-debate and to discourses in two European countries.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Kenya's media {{landscape}} has witnessed {{a wave of}} transformative and disruptive technologies {{in the form of}} Web 2. 0 applications, accessible through computers and now increasingly through mobile phones. These developments have since incubated two new critical media regimes. First, the country has seen the emergence <b>of</b> a new <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> practitioners. Second, a new web-enabled communication infrastructure has made possible the broadening of the public sphere, encouraging public participation in news, with non-traditional journalistic platforms becoming important sites for ‘alternative’ journalism. This article critically reflects on how social media platforms such as Twitter (read here as a heteroglossic text and space) enable and encourage public participation in wider national conversations. The article explores this through the work of key bloggers/activists and citizen journalists, reflecting on how they construct as well as enable new participatory forms of civic/political engagement through Twitter. While the platform seems to have created its own hierarchies, horizontal participation is still much greater than with mainstream media formats. The discussion demonstrates the growing institutionalisation of the online space as an important platform for popular expression in Kenya, if at the same time offering an indictment of mainstream media's regime of ‘closure’ to outsider voices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} make sense of the {{empirical}} and theoretical literature by asking two questions: What do we know empirically about a Europe public sphere? How can we make sense of the empirical findings in light of the theoretical debate on a European public sphere? I concentrate on media reporting on European issues as an-albeit problematic-proxy for the (non-) existence of a European public sphere. The short answer to the first question is somewhat paradoxical: the available evidence suggests that the overall salience of European themes is still low, but that similar meaning structures and frames of reference prevail in media reporting about Europe. The short answer to the second question is that a European public sphere emerges out of the interconnectedness of and mutual exchanges between various national public spheres. An ideal typically European sphere would then emerge if and when the same (European) themes are discussed at the same time at similar levels of attention across national public spheres, and media; if and when similar frames of reference, meaning structures, and patterns of interpretation are used across national public spheres and media; if and when a transnational <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> emerges in which speakers and listeners recognize each other as legitimate participants in a common discourse...|$|R

40|$|As the <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> {{educators}} {{struggles to}} resolve many issues within its ranks, {{the question of}} gender bias {{in the world of}} debate, and beyond, continues to be raised. Stereotypical socialization, with women as nurturing/submissive and men as dominant/aggressive, begins early and continues throughout life, and the educator is part of this process. When gender differences are examined in a competitive event such as a debate, the line is quickly crossed between gender stereotype and sexual harassment. A study by Bruschke and Johnson (1994), which included female students and judges, showed that this stereotyping is firmly set in the minds of males and females alike. A specific course of action for educators is suggested: (1) student and coach must become aware of and discuss the different ways in which men and women communicate [...] videos are excellent for this; (2) the class should review the legal definitions of sexual harassment; and (3) the instructor should make it clear that harassment claims will be given immediate and serious attention and a clearly stated policy of behavior should be in place, with a specific course of redress.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the antecedents <b>of</b> <b>community</b> satisfaction towards an Australian drug clinic, with the aim of developing a general model <b>of</b> <b>community</b> stakeholder satisfaction that may apply to other clinics. A structured survey was administered via the telephone and face to face with 490 community stakeholders including residents, businesses and other health and community service providers. Multilingual interviewers were used because a large percentage of participants were from a non-English-speaking background. Community stakeholder satisfaction was found to correlate positively with variables such as stakeholder's perception of the importance of services, understanding <b>of</b> <b>community</b> needs, contribution to <b>community,</b> usefulness <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> and staff skill. The antecedents related to quality of service, rather than to knowledge of the clinic, showed consistently stronger correlations with overall satisfaction. Stakeholders were least aware of the clinic's services that were rated the most important and given the highest satisfaction scores. It is concluded that regular surveying <b>of</b> <b>community</b> attitudes helps a clinic to modify its services to meet the needs <b>of</b> its <b>community</b> more accurately. Surveying can also provide early warning of growing problems that may, if left unresolved, impede future survival or growth of the clinic. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Communities {{in which}} {{professionals}} share and create knowledge potentially support their continued learning. To realise this potential more fully, members {{are required to}} reflect critically. For learning at work such behaviour {{has been described as}} critically reflective work behaviour, consisting of six aspects: challenging groupthink, critical opinion sharing, an openness about mistakes, asking for and giving feedback, experimentation and research utilisation. We studied whether and how these aspects can be distinguished in dialogues <b>of</b> seven different <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> veterinary professionals (critically reflective dialogues). Our exploration of the nature of critically reflective dialogues resulted in an analytical framework. Within each aspect four different modes <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> were identified: interactive, on an individual basis, non-reflective and restricted. We assume that professionals use learning opportunities most in the interactive mode <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> The framework was employed to study the extent to which dialogues showed these modes of critically reflective dialogues. The results demonstrate that in these <b>communities</b> the modes <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> within aspects were largely non-interactive (i. e., individual, non-reflective).
