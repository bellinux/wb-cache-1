50|$|The {{theory of}} {{conspicuous}} consumption {{was introduced by}} Thorstein Veblen in his book The Theory of the Leisure Class. The oldest theory of distribution, it poses that people spend money on obtaining luxury goods and services to give an indication of their wealth to other members of society. He highlights society's endless <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> maintaining that 'elegance' or elaborateness of dress, and new styles,which are both indicative of expense, are the main drivers of fashion change. Each social class imitates the consumption behaviour of the class above {{it in order to}} enhance their social status.|$|R

Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire was {{always on the lookout for}} new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> and perfection. The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with Over the Top, a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well.|$|R
40|$|Pressure on {{academics}} {{to publish}} articles in ‘top’ journals continues to grow. In tandem, {{we have seen}} a proliferation of journal rankings, claiming to provide a guide to the quality of journals. As editors become more preoccupied by the ranking of ‘their’ journal, they exercise performative power over authors, by setting standards for publication that exclude many while compelling those that are published to adapt to the styles, priorities and imperatives of editors. One result has been a ceaseless <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>novelty,</b> manifest in an insistence that each paper must make a ‘distinctive’ theoretical contribution. I argue that this is producing an environment in which scholarship is increasingly mechanized and industrialized, while rendering its outputs more arcane and inaccessible to non-specialists. It also means that the academy is becoming ever more complicit in its own subordination to performative processes that it frequently criticizes when observing them in the outside, ‘real’ world of management practice. We are therefore seeing more barriers to entry for both authors and new journals – unless both conform to norms that bear an orthodox but often sterile imprint. I consider the implications of these issues for emergent journals such as Leadership, and for academic freedom, and suggest how those interested in scholarly inquiry in general and the fate of this journal in particular should respond...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature review}} {{led to the}} conclusion that there has been minimal research into key psychological parameters associated with tourist crime victimization. Three series of four studies were completed that defined "tourists"; developed an inventory that assessed tourist personality; evaluated the psychometrics of this inventory; and, then determined the role of key psychological parameters in tourist crime victimization. The first series of studies (Chapter 2) focused on defining a "tourist". The series began with an archival study that found that tourists had (historically) been described along three dimensions: <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> (versus familiarity); reliance on (or independent from) the tourist industry; and, a motivation to seek and interact with hosts (versus vacations for rest and relaxation). The second (qualitative) study determined that tourist academics described the "tourist" using four themes: who (psychographics and demographics); does what (travel behaviours); with and to whom (cotravellers and hosts); and, where (destination factors). This qualitative study was successfully triangulated with a third (quantitative) lexical study. The final study in this first series utilized the extremes of the historical dimensions and described them in terms of the four themes. The extremes of the personality dimension were labelled "Allocentricism" and "Psychocentricism". The second series of studies (Chapter 3) described the development and evaluation of a tourist personality inventory that empirically measured "Allocentricism-Psychocentricism". The first in this series of studies utilized empirical assessment guidelines to develop a reliable and (face, content) valid inventory. The second study determined criterion validity and found Allocentricism was not related to Extraversion, but was substantially measuring Openness (to new experiences). The third study found that while the Tourist Personality Inventory could predict tourist destination preferences, it failed to predict actual tourist destination choice. It was found that social environmental factors (money, opportunity, time) also influenced tourist decision-making. The final study in Chapter 3 confirmed that travel behaviours {{under the control of the}} tourist were predicted by the tourist personality inventory. The final series of four studies (Chapter 4) described four tourist personality types, determined that these tourist types were not culturally universal but had good predictive validity when evaluating Australian inbound and domestic tourists. The final study in this series found that the Allocentric Tourist Personality Inventory predicted tourist crime victimization, but failed to predict post crime reporting behaviour of tourist victims. It was concluded that a reliable and valid measure of tourist personality had been developed and that further research can now occur in the area of tourist crime victimization. The limitations of these studies and future directions...|$|R

40|$|Green {{building}} is redefining building practice and Malaysia is poised for early adoption {{in recognition of}} the potential economic and environmental benefits that accrue to it. Available reports tend towards the fact that there will be increase in demand for green buildings with the growth in environmental awareness and increase in corporate social responsibility among the companies as well as growing body of evidence demonstrating that green buildings make financial sense. Despite the growing interest, risks of uncertainties still cloud investment in green building. This paper examines Malaysia efforts to spure green building investment and demand with particlualr focus on Green Building Index (GBI) and the enabling green tax incentives. Subsequently the paper reviews potential factors that enhance green building in Malaysia as well as the underlying challenges and barriers. Based on the review, we can infer that the Malaysia green tax incentives for obtaining GBI certification are significant but not outstanding. They are inherent with notable criticisms and may not be sufficiently attractive to potential real estate investors. The review also empower us to hypothesize that the model of green building demand for Malaysia will comprise seven interrelated factors vis-a-avis:- <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> environmental sustainability, <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> increased productivity, <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> improved internal building conditions, <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> higher building value, <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> cost savings, <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> lower risks, and <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> branding and prestige.
