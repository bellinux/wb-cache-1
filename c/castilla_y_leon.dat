5|$|Del Potro {{qualified}} for the main draw of his first Grand Slam in the 2006 French Open {{at the age of}} 17. He lost in the opening round to former French Open champion and 24th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero. Having received a wild card, he reached the quarterfinals of the ATP event in Umag, Croatia, where he lost in three sets to the eventual champion, Stanislas Wawrinka. In Spain, he participated in the Open <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> Challenger tournament held in Segovia, defeating top seed Fernando Verdasco in the quarterfinals and Benjamin Becker in the final.|$|E
5|$|The team's biggest {{success in}} 2009 was Contador's overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France. Elsewhere, their main successes in 2009 were in small stage races, with Contador winning the Volta ao Algarve and the Vuelta al País Vasco {{as well as two}} stages in Paris–Nice, and Leipheimer winning the Tour of California and the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León.</b> The team also won the team {{classification}} at numerous events. The team {{failed to live up to}} lofty expectations in the Giro d'Italia; Leipheimer was widely considered a favorite for victory, as was Armstrong before a collarbone injury sustained weeks before, but Leipheimer finished sixth overall and the team did not win any stage.|$|E

5|$|With {{the team}} disinvited from Paris–Nice and Tirreno–Adriatico, their next stage race was the Volta ao Distrito de Santarém, a race which neither Astana nor Discovery Channel {{had participated in}} the year before. The team did not win any stage, though Andreas Klöden {{finished}} on the event's final podium, in third. Astana next entered the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> with a squad that was thought to greatly outclass the squads entered by other teams. Contador won the opening time trial and the mountainous fourth stage en route to winning the race overall. Leipheimer also showed well, finishing 4 seconds off Contador's winning time in the time trial, and falling only on Stage 4, where he rode in support of Contador, to finish in fourth overall.|$|E
25|$|The early {{highlights}} of Froome's 2011 season were top fifteen finishes in the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> and the Tour de Romandie. Froome had a mixed Tour de Suisse, riding with the lead group on some mountain stages yet losing time on others, and finishing ninth {{in the final}} time trial.|$|E
25|$|Australian ABC radio {{reported}} on September 24, 2008, that Armstrong would {{compete in the}} UCI Tour Down Under through Adelaide and surrounding areas in January 2009. UCI rules say a cyclist {{has to be in}} an anti-doping program for six months before an event, but UCI allowed Armstrong to compete. He had to retire from the 2009 Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> during the first stage after crashing in a rider pileup in Baltanás, Spain, and breaking his collarbone. Armstrong flew back to Austin, Texas, for corrective surgery, which was successful, and was back training on a bicycle within four days of his operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{team also}} won lesser {{classification}}s at the Tour of Oman, the Tour de Romandie, the Circuit de Lorraine, and the Tour of Hainan.

25|$|Valverde started 2009 in {{good form}} {{by taking the}} points and {{mountains}} classifications in the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> while finishing 9th overall with two stage victories. He could not repeat his successes {{of the last few}} years in the spring classics with his best result being a 7th at La Flèche Wallonne. He won the Klasika Primavera and the Volta a Catalunya to put those disappointments behind him. With the threat of not racing the Tour de France hanging over his head he entered the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré hoping to prove his worth. He performed consistently throughout the two early time-trials {{to stay in touch with}} the leaders before finishing second on Mont Ventoux to take the lead in the overall classification. Though Cadel Evans repeatedly attacked him in the final days he stayed on his wheel, with the help of compatriot Alberto Contador, to take the yellow jersey. On the back of these successes he appealed his ban by the Italian authorities with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the hope of racing the tour.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his work}} in {{dialectology}} {{has been the most}} influential, Alvar's work broached other topics such as the linguistics of Romance languages in general, historical linguistics, toponymy, medieval literature (serving as principal investigator along with the University of Wisconsin in developing the Spanish Medieval Dictionary in 1978), translation, history of the Americas, among others. In terms of dialectology, Alvar wrote, directed, or coordinated the development of many linguistic atlases and Spanish-language research published in Spain and Latin America {{during the second half of}} the 20th century, including the Atlas Lingüístico y Etnográfico de Andalucía (ALEA), the Atlas Lingüístico de España y Portugal (ALEP), the Atlas Lingüístico de <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> (ALCyL), and the Linguistic and Ethnographical Atlas of Argentina (AleCuyo). Alvar served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Atlas Linguarum Europae (ALE) in Holland in 1971, a linguistic atlas supported by UNESCO which includes Altaic languages, Basque, Indo-European languages, Ibero-Caucasian languages, Semitic languages and Uralic languages. Forty-seven national committees and four minority language committees worked on this atlas. Other important atlases Alvar has worked on include an Atlas Lingüístico de Andalucía (1957-1959).|$|E

500|$|The {{defending}} champion and favourite {{for the race}} was Alejandro Valverde (...) [...] Valverde had won the race in 2006, 2014 and 2015. No rider had ever won more than three editions of La Flèche Wallonne. Valverde was in strong form following his victory at the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> on the previous weekend, although he was preparing particularly for the 2016 Giro d'Italia rather than for the Ardennes classics. His team included Daniel Moreno, who had won the 2013 La Flèche Wallonne.|$|E
500|$|Dutch {{design studio}} Buro Vormkrijgers created a Pong-themed clock as a fun project within their offices. After the studio decided to {{manufacture}} it for retail, Atari took legal action in February 2006. The two companies eventually {{reached an agreement}} in which Buro Vormkrijgers could produce a limited number under license. In 1999, French artist Pierre Huyghe created an installation entitled [...] "Atari Light", in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play Pong on an illuminated ceiling. The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> in 2007.

60|$|We {{are told}} that Ferdinand, {{after the death of}} Columbus, showed a sense of his merits by {{ordering}} a monument to be erected to his memory, on which was inscribed the motto already cited, which had formerly been granted to him by the sovereigns: A <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> a <b>Leon</b> nuevo mundo dio Colon (To Castile and Leon Columbus gave a new world). However great an honor a monument may be for a subject to receive, it is certainly but a cheap reward for a sovereign to bestow. As to the motto inscribed upon it, it remains engraved in the memory of mankind, more indelibly than in brass or marble; a record of the great debt of gratitude due to the discoverer, which the monarch had so faithlessly neglected to discharge.|$|R

500|$|The Astana {{team did}} not include 2008 race {{champion}} Alberto Contador, who chose not to defend his championship, but did include Lance Armstrong, who had recently returned from retirement. Though his appearance was put in doubt after he crashed out of stage 1 of the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> and broke his collarbone, Armstrong announced on 16 April that he would start the Giro despite undergoing surgery for his injury. [...] star Cadel Evans was originally announced to be {{taking part in the}} Giro, but he publicly announced shortly afterward that he would not ride it, and accused RCS Sport (the organizers of the race) of using his name to promote the event. Contador and Evans both chose to focus on the Tour de France later in the season.|$|E
500|$|At Paris–Nice in March, Contador {{appeared}} well in line {{to repeat}} his victory there from two years prior, winning the opening individual time trial [...] and the mountainous sixth stage. He dramatically faltered in Stage 7, however, losing the yellow jersey and three minutes to Luis León Sánchez, and ultimately finishing fourth. He was unable to chase down Sánchez because of what was later blamed on dietary problems. The team experienced both success and hardship in the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León</b> later in the month. Leipheimer won the event overall, with Contador having ridden the event in support for him. The first day, however, Armstrong {{was involved in a}} crash and taken to the hospital with was later revealed as a fractured clavicle. The injury was thought to take away from Armstrong's previously high odds to win the Giro d'Italia, and there was briefly speculation that he would even pull out of the Giro because of the injury.|$|E
500|$|The late {{invitation}} of [...] {{to the race}} provided three potential contenders: 2007 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador, third-place finisher from that race Levi Leipheimer, and Andreas Klöden. One analysis of pre-race favorites considered Klöden to be the strongest of them, while another considered Contador to be the race's biggest favorite after his wins at the recently run Vuelta al País Vasco and Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León.</b> Both Di Luca and Contador had strong domestiques (support riders) by their sides, with Di Luca joined by two-time Giro d'Italia champion Paolo Savoldelli, Gabriele Bosisio, and Alessandro Spezialetti, and Contador by Leipheimer and Klöden. Other riders named as overall contenders included Denis Menchov, Gilberto Simoni, Vincenzo Nibali, Riccardo Riccò, Mauricio Soler, Marzio Bruseghin, Emanuele Sella, Evgeni Petrov, Franco Pellizotti, and Juan Manuel Gárate. Unibet.com's odds-on favorite was Klöden. 2004 Giro d'Italia winner Damiano Cunego chose to skip the race to better prepare for the Tour de France, adding to speculation {{that this would be}} the first Giro since 1996 to feature a non-Italian winner.|$|E

500|$|Sánchez won stage 4 at the Tour of the Basque Country in April, the team's {{first win}} in a stage race on the season. He made the day's {{selections}} and stayed with an elite group which formed {{at the top of}} the Arrate climb. Sánchez attacked on the descent and won the stage that way, though he did not have a time gap at the finish. Sánchez had also won the stage run on this same course in 2010. Antón finished on the poidum, in third, at the Vuelta a <b>Castilla</b> <b>y</b> <b>León,</b> thanks to a fourth place on the race's one summit finish and a solid individual time trial the next day. At the Tour de Romandie, Castroviejo took a relatively rare time trial win for the team, coming home mere tenths of a second better than Taylor Phinney and Leigh Howard in the [...] prologue. He turned in another strong time trial later in the Tour de Romandie, finishing ninth in the stage 4 race against the clock, which was [...] long, as well as eighth earlier in the season in the [...] time trial which closed out the Tirreno–Adriatico. Castroviejo further confirmed his prowess in the short time trial by winning stage 1 of the Vuelta a la Comunidad de Madrid, a [...] timed race.
