50|$|Crown rot or {{root rot}} of {{strawberries}} {{is a common}} example of diseases of fruit crops caused by P. cactorum.

Similarly to apple trees, crown rots of strawberries caused by P. cactorum can be partially diagnosed by cutting the crown of the plant and observing brown vascular tissues, and root rots by brown or black stunted roots.|$|E

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{culture and}} regeneration protocol {{has been established}} for asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) protoplasts isolated from shoots of in vitro plants. Studies focused on factors to maximize plating efficiency, colony formation, and plant regeneration. The optimized protocol involved the culture of asparagus protoplasts embedded in agarose beads {{through a series of}} defined media. Etiolated shoot cultures were a superior source for protoplasts than green shoot cultures, and growing feeder cells were critical for high plating efficiency and colony formation. In the presence of growing asparagus feeder cells, asparagus protoplasts initiated cell divisions within 2 d of plating in agarose with plating efficiencies up to 20 %. About 80 % of the protoplasts initiating cell divisions developed into colonies of at least 25 - 30 cells, of which 25 % initiated somatic embryos. <b>Complete</b> <b>plants</b> were regenerated from the embryos at a frequency over 20 %. Overall, ca. 0. 8 % of the initially isolated protoplasts regenerated into <b>complete</b> <b>plants</b> with this protocol. Plants regenerated from protoplasts have been transferred to soil and maintained phenotypically normal morphology for over 2 yr. Chromosome counts confirmed the diploid status (2 n= 20) of plants regenerated by somatic embryogenesis...|$|R

The 2005 (publicly revealed in 2007) discovery in Schoharie County, New York, of fossils from the Middle Devonian (about 385 million years ago) united the crown of Wattieza to a root and trunk known since 1870, the fossilized grove of [...] "Gilboa stumps" [...] discovered at Gilboa, New York, which had been previously described as Eospermatopteris, though the <b>complete</b> <b>plant</b> remained unknown.

50|$|Before construction, {{the site}} was {{surveyed}} to make sure endangered and rare species would not be affected. The top soil and leaf litter were collected and reintroduced when construction was <b>complete.</b> <b>Plant</b> seedlings removed during construction were re-planted in their original locations. Construction began in June 1994 despite protests from conservationists. The 32 towers at Skyrail were built in 10x10 metre clearings and workers had to sterilise equipment and footwear before entering sites. Russian Kamov helicopters were used extensively to carry equipment, materials and cement to tower sites and rainforest stations. Helicopters carried 900 tonnes of steel, cement and building materials into the Barron Falls Station alone. Because no roads were built during construction, workers walked to the tower sites each day with their equipment.|$|E
