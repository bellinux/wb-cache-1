40|$|Results from {{exposure}} of {{several types of}} Solarex silicon cells to a space environment {{for nearly two years}} on the LIPS 3 satellite are presented. Experiments include standard thickness (10 <b>mil)</b> <b>cells</b> with and without back surface fields, and ultrathin (2 <b>mil)</b> <b>cells</b> also with and without back surface fields. A comparison between a widely used coverslide adhesive, DC 93 - 500 and a potential alternate is also presented. The major findings from the data are that the 2 <b>mil</b> <b>cells</b> without a back surface field show the smallest normalized short circuit current degradation and that the 10 mil back surface field cells show the greatest absolute power output for the radiation exposures and temperatures encountered. The new encapsulant (McGhan Nusil CV- 2500) exhibits a degradation comparable to DC 93 - 500. A comparison is made with each of the cell types in this experiment with expectations based on JPL Radiation Handbook data...|$|R
40|$|Work was {{performed}} to define and apply processes {{which could lead to}} high output from thin (2 - 8 <b>mils)</b> silicon solar <b>cells.</b> The overall problems are outlined, and two satisfactory process sequences were developed. These sequences led to good output cells in the thickness range to just below 4 mils; although the initial contract scope was reduced, one of these sequences proved capable of operating beyond a pilot line level, to yield good quality 4 - 6 <b>mil</b> <b>cells</b> of high output...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that bufalin {{is a new}} potent inducer of the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. The present work was carried out to examine further the effect of bufalin on the growth and characteristics of human leukemia-derived cell lines U 937, Mil. and HL 60. At concentrations of 5 - 10 IIM,bufalin decreased the growth of <b>Mil</b> <b>cells</b> preferentially at the G 2 phase and U 937 cells at the S and (. _. phases of the cell cycle. Bufalin, under these conditions, induced the differentiation of U 937, ML 1, and HL 60 cells to monocyte/ macrophage-like cells by measuring the expression of various differen tiation markers, as assessed by morphology and histochemistry, and ability to phagocytose latex particles, to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, and to develop Fc receptors. U 937 and <b>Mil</b> <b>cells</b> started to differentiat...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{comparisons between}} recently proposed Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for the flow around the Ahmed bluff body. PANS model changes seamlessly from Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to the direct numerical {{solution of the}} Navier-Stokes equations (DNS) as the unresolved-to-total ratios of kinetic energy and dissipation are varied. The parameter which determines the unresolved-to-total kinetic energy ratio is defined based on the grid spacing and it is dynamically adjusted at each point {{at the end of}} every time step. The main target of this paper is to show if PANS obtains comparable results with LES calculations on finer meshes and improves results on coarser meshes. In other words, the question to be answered is whether PANS can provide the optimum solution for every computational mesh. This will be achieved by comparing PANS calculations on two different computational meshes: 3. 4 mil. (grid A), and 8. 0 mil. (grid B), with LES calculations on grid A and additional two grids consisting of 9. 5 <b>mil.</b> <b>cells</b> (grid C) and 16. 5 <b>mil.</b> <b>cells</b> (grid D) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} {{the widespread use}} of GaAs solar cells in space is the cost and weight of the GaAs substrate. In order to overcome these problems, Spectrolab is pursuing thin cell technologies encompassing both liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) GaAs on GaAs and MOCVD GaAs on Ge cells. Spectrolab's experience in the manufacture of 4 to 6 mil 2 cm x 4 cm GaAs cells on a LPE production line is discussed. By thinning the cells at a late state of processing, production yields comparable to 12 <b>mil</b> <b>cells</b> have been achieved. Data are presented showing that GaAs cells can be welded without degradation and have achieved minimum average efficiencies of 18 percent AM 0, 28 C with efficiencies up to 20 percent. Spectrolab, in conjunction with Spire Corporation has also been pursuing GaAs on Ge cell technology in support of larger area lighter weight power systems. Data are presented showing that individual 2 cm x 2 cm, 8 <b>mil</b> <b>cell</b> efficiencies up to 21. 7 percent have been achieved. Efficiencies up to 24 percent AM 0 will be possible by optimizing the GaAs/Ge interface. Cells have been welded without degradation using silver interconnects and have been laid down on an aluminum honeycomb/graphite facesheet substrate to produce a small coupon. The efficiency was 18. 1 percent at AM 0, 28 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{intermediate}} lobe (IL) of the pituitary {{produces a}} PRL-regulating factor (PRF). Targeted tumorigenesis, using the POMC promoter ligated to SV 40 large T antigen (Tag), generated transgenic mice that develop IL tumors with PRF activity. Our {{goal was to}} establish and characterize a PRF-producing cell line. Two cell lines, which differ markedly in size and morphology, were independently developed from IL tumors and designated mIL 5 and <b>mIL</b> 39. These <b>cells</b> are transformed, as judged by rapid proliferation, low serum requirements, and generation of secondary tumors in nude mice. RT-PCR revealed that mIL 39, but not <b>mIL</b> 5 <b>cells,</b> express POMC and dopamine D 2 receptors, typical of a melanotroph phenotype. Although <b>mIL</b> 5 <b>cells</b> originated from an IL tumor, they do not express messenger RNA for SV 40 Tag. The bioassay for PRF used GH 3 cells stably transfected with th...|$|R

Sixteen cells {{of each type}} were subjected to 11 temperatures and 9 intensities. The textured P(+) 8 to 10 <b>mil</b> <b>cells</b> provided the best performance both at 1 astronomical unit and at LTLI conditions. The average efficiencies of this cell were 14. 5 percent at 1 solar constant/+ 25 C and 18. 7 percent at 0. 086 solar constant/- 100 C...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept is}} {{presented}} for encapsulating solar cells between {{two layers of}} glass either individually, in panels, or in a continuous process. The concept yields an integral unit that is hermetically sealed and that is tolerant to high temperature thermal cycling and to particulate radiation. Data are presented on both high temperature solar cells and special glasses that soften at low temperatures for use with the concept. The results of encapsulating experiments are presented which show the successful application of the concept to the special high temperature cells. The mechanical feasibility of encapsulating 2 <b>mil</b> <b>cells</b> between two layers of 2 mil glass is also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{experiments}} using wire-saw {{techniques to}} slice thin silicon wafers are described. Substrates were sliced directly to 17 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil thicknesses. Some of the 8 mil substrates {{and all of}} the 5 mil substrates were chemically etched to 7 and 4 mils, respectively, to guarantee removal of any saw damage. The wafers wire sawed to 17 mil thicknesses were processed as reference cells. A baseline process which results in an n(+) -p cell structure, and two advanced processes which provide n(+) -p-p(+) structures were utilized. By using a p(+) enhancement layer on the solar cell back surface, the performance of the 7 mil wafers was increased to exceed that of the 17 <b>mil</b> solar <b>cells</b> with simple n(+) -p structures. Cells fabricated by an ion implantation sequence utilizing elemental boron and phosphorus implants were shown to be capable of equalling or exceeding the performance of cells fabricated by an equivalent all-diffusion process...|$|R
40|$|Antimony (SbIII) and {{miltefosine}} (MIL) {{are important}} drugs {{for the treatment}} of Leishmania parasite infections. The mitochondrion is likely to {{play a central role in}} SbIII and <b>MIL</b> induced <b>cell</b> death in this parasite. Enriched mitochondrial samples from Leishmania promastigotes selected step by step for in vitro resistance to SbIII and MIL were subjected to differential proteomic analysis. A shared decrease in both mutants in the levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase was observed, as well as a differential abundance in two calcium-binding proteins and the unique dynamin- 1 -like protein of the parasite. Both mutants presented a shared increase in the succinyl-CoA: 3 -ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase and the abundance of numerous hypothetical proteins was also altered in both mutants. In general, the proteomic changes observed in the MIL mutant were less pronounced than in the SbIII mutant, probably due to the early appearance of a mutation in the miltefosine transporter abrogating the need for a strong mitochondrial adaptation. This study is the first analysis of the Leishmania mitochondrial proteome and offers powerful insights into the adaptations to this organelle during SbIII and MIL drug resistance...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} {{fabricating}} 2 to 3 <b>mil</b> wraparound solar <b>cells</b> was formulated. Sample thin wraparound cells were fabricated using this process. The process used a reinforced perimeter construction {{to reduce the}} breakage that occurs during handling of the wafers. A retracting piston post was designed and fabricated to help minimize the breakage that occurs during the screen printing process. Two alternative methods of applying the aluminum back surface field were investigated. In addition to the standard screen printed back surface field, both spin-on and evaporated aluminum techniques were researched. Neither spin-on nor evaporated aluminum made any noticeable improvement over the screen printing technique. A fine screen mesh was chosen {{for the application of}} the aluminum paste back surface field. The optimum time and temperature for firing the aluminum turned out to be thirty seconds at 850 C. The development work on the dielectric included looking at three dielectrics for the wraparound application. Transene 1000, Thick Film Systems 1126 RCB and an in house formulation 61 - 2 - 2 A were all tested. Cells with pre-dielectric thickness of 3. 0 - 0 - 3. 5 mils using Transene 1000 as the wraparound dielectric and the procedure outlined above showed an average efficiency of 10. 7 percent. Thinner cells were fabricated, but had an unacceptable yield and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Tethered IL- 15 {{to augment}} the {{therapeutic}} potential of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptor: Maintaining memory potential, persistence, and antitumor activity Adoptive immunotherapy can retarget T cells to CD 19, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on B-cell malignancies, by {{the expression of a}} chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Infusion of CAR-modified T cells for the treatment B-cell malignancies has demonstrated promise in preclinical and clinical trials. These data highlight the ability of infused CD 19 -specific T cells to be synchronously activated by large burdens of CD 19 + leukemia and lymphoma. This can lead to dramatic antitumor effects, but also exposes the recipient to toxicity associated with tumor-cell lysis and cytokine storm. Clinical trials will now be addressing the targeting of minimal burdens of CD 19 + malignancy as patients are enrolled earlier in their disease course and receive concomitant chemotherapy. It is likely that the existing populations of CAR T cells generated ex vivo to address relapsed disease {{may not be able to}} address minimal residual disease (MRD). Therefore, we have developed a clinically appealing approach to sustaining the persistence of CAR T cells independent of TAA by providing signaling through the common gamma chain receptor (gc). Administration of exogenous soluble recombinant cytokines that signal through the gc, such as interleukin (IL) - 2, have been used clinically to sustain the persistence of adoptively transferred T cells. However, systemic high-dose administration has resulted in dose-limiting toxicities. Unlike IL- 2, IL- 15 possesses numerous attributes desirable for adoptive therapy and has been ranked among the most valuable immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment. It is a pro-survival cytokine that promotes the survival of long-lived T-cell memory subsets and in vivo antitumor activity. Unlike other gc family cytokines, IL- 15 is transpresented to responding T cells in the context of IL- 15 receptor alpha (IL- 15 Ra). Therefore, we hypothesized that a membrane-bound IL- 15 fusion protein (mIL 15) tethered to the cell surface would enhance T-cell costimulation to support persistence independent of CAR activation by preserving T-cell memory potential and maintain antitumor activity in the presence of low TAA. Using clinically compliant methods, the generated mIL 15 -CAR T cells mimicked the physiologic mechanism of transpresentation to sustain costimulation via phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT 5). In contrast to conventional CD 19 -specific CAR T <b>cells,</b> <b>mIL</b> 15 -CAR T cells persisted in mice independent of the presence of TAA and mediated potent rejection of a systemically distributed CD 19 + leukemia. The potential for sustained immunity against B-cell malignancies was shown as, in the absence of antigen, mIL 15 -CAR T cells were long-lived and adopted a desirable CD 45 ROnegCCR 7 + “low-differentiation” state with a memory-like molecular profile and phenotype. These results have direct implications for the design of an adoptive immunotherapy clinical trial evaluating mIL 15 -CAR T cells in the setting of MRD and warrants further investigation of mIL 15 to engineer T cells targeting other tumor cells that have sequestered or low levels of TAA...|$|R
