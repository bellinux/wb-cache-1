5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E

He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided {{that in order to}} be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E

5|$|Mary Ann Davis, who {{had bought}} the Fornells grant on Key Biscayne in 1821, died in Galveston, Texas in 1885. Her son Waters Smith Davis began taking steps to assert the family title to the island. In 1887 he {{purchased}} {{the rights of the}} other Davis heirs and received a new deed in his name. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clear title, however. Venancio Sanchez still claimed a half share of the Fornells Grant, two of the town lots had been sold to William Harney around 1840, and Osborne and Field had their deed from the Florida Internal Improvement Fund. Davis received quitclaims from Osborn and Field, and on the Harney lots, but was unable to settle with Sanchez. He finally received a patent from the United States government for his land in 1898. In 1903 Davis bought the abandoned Cape Florida lighthouse from the United States Treasury for US$400.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

25|$|With {{the group}} stage drawing {{to an end}} and {{injuries}} piling up, Lyon traveled to Florence to again face Fiorentina. Despite having injury troubles {{at the back of the}} defense, Lyon performed well and only conceded one goal, again from Alberto Gilardino, though at the time of the goal, Lyon were up 2–0 after goals from Jean Makoun and Karim Benzema. Despite chances from Juninho and Ederson, in which both players hit the post in amazing fashion, the scoreline remained as Lyon booked their place in the knockout stage. In the final group stage match, which decided what team would finish first place in the group, Bayern Munich defeated Lyon 2–3, scoring all three of their goals in the first half. Lyon controlled the second half with two goals from Sidney Govou and Benzema, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> third to draw the match or a fourth to win the group.

Cincinnati then forced San Francisco to punt, but on the first play of their next drive, 49ers rookie linebacker Bill Romanowski intercepted a pass from Esiason at the Bengals 23-yard line. However, after a dropped pass by Rice, the 49ers' offense <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> first down, and they had to settle for Cofer's 32-yard field goal to tie the game, 6-6.|$|E

During the battle, the Soviet air force flew 2,459 attack missions and 1,683 bombing sorties. The German forces found {{that they could not}} use their armour as well as they had hoped, because it was vulnerable to destruction on the roads and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good grip on the sandy soil of the pine forests in the region.

But McNabb made up for his mistake with a 39-yard run on third down and 5 on Philadelphia's ensuing possession, setting up a field goal for David Akers that tied the game, 3–3. In the second quarter, McNabb completed all four of his passes for 70 yards on a 73-yard drive, including a 41-yard completion to Todd Pinkston, that ended with a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chad Lewis. Tampa responded with a 10-play, 65-yard drive, but once again could not dent the end zone and {{had to settle for}} another Gramatica field goal, cutting their deficit to 10–6. Later in the quarter, Eagles punter Sean Landeta pinned the Buccaneers back at their own 5-yard line and Tampa Bay <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> first down with their next drive. After receiving Mark Royals' short 28-yard punt at the Buccaneers 31-yard line, McNabb threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Duce Staley with 35 seconds left in the half.

25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a short delay in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view.
