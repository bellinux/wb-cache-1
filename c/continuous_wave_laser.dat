50|$|The {{coherent}} {{generation of}} an optical frequency comb from a continuous wave pump laser {{is not a}} unique property of Kerr frequency combs. Optical frequency combs generated with cascaded optical modulators also possess this property. For certain application this property can be advantageous. For example, to stabilize the offset frequency of the Kerr frequency comb one can directly apply feedback to the pump laser frequency. In principle {{it is also possible}} to generate a Kerr frequency comb around a particular <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> in order to use the bandwidth of the frequency comb to determine the exact frequency of the <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
50|$|A similar problem {{exists in}} holography. The total energy {{required}} when exposing holographic film using a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> (i.e. for several seconds) is {{significantly less than}} the total energy required when exposing holographic film using a pulsed laser (i.e. around 20 - 40 nanoseconds) due to a reciprocity failure. It can also be caused by very long or very short exposures with a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser.</b> To try to offset the reduced brightness of the film due to reciprocity failure, a method called latensification can be used. This is usually done directly after the holographic exposure and using an incoherent light source (such as a 25-40 W light bulb). Exposing the holographic film to the light {{for a few seconds}} can increase the brightness of the hologram by an order of magnitude.|$|E

50|$|Titanium-sapphire is {{especially}} suitable for pulsed lasers since an ultrashort pulse inherently contains {{a wide spectrum}} of frequency components. This is due to the inverse relationship between the frequency bandwidth of a pulse and its time duration, due to their being conjugate variables. However, with an appropriate design, titanium-sapphire can also be used in <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lasers</b> with extremely narrow linewidths tunable over a wide range.|$|R

50|$|Russell Targ was {{involved}} in early laser research at Technical Research Group where he co-authored, with Gordon Gould among others, a 1962 paper describing the use of homodyne detection with laser light.

50|$|Laser {{ablation}} is {{the process}} of removing material from a solid (or occasionally liquid) surface by irradiating it with a laser beam. At low laser flux, the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy and evaporates or sublimates. At high laser flux, the material is typically converted to a plasma. Usually, laser ablation refers to removing material with a pulsed laser, but it is possible to ablate material with a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> beam if the laser intensity is high enough.|$|E
50|$|A {{limitation}} of photothermal chemotherapy using gold nanoparticles involves {{the choice of}} laser when conducting treatment. Pulsed lasers offer very selective treatment of cancer cells within a small, localized area, but can lead to potential destruction of particles and have a low heating efficiency due to heat lost during the single pulse excitation. <b>Continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lasers</b> have a higher heating efficiency and work better in heating larger areas with lower risk of destroying the nanoparticles being heated. However, treatment with <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>lasers</b> are much longer compared to treatment with a pulsed laser. A {{limitation of}} photothermal therapy {{with respect to the}} laser used is the depth of the tumor being treated. Most lasers used to induce tumor ablation using gold nanoparticles can only reach several centimeters into soft tissue, making it impossible to reach tumors farther in the body. Finding a way to carry out therapy in cells farther into the body without damaging surrounding cells is essential to making this technique viable as a cancer treatment in the future.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{differences between}} the behavior of glass and crystalline ceramic laser host materials {{are associated with the}} greater variation in the local environment of lasing ions in amorphous solids. This leads to a broadening of the fluorescent levels in glasses. For example, the width of the Nd3+ emission in YAG is ~ 10 angstroms as compared to ~ 300 angstroms in typical oxide glasses. The broadened fluorescent lines in glasses {{make it more difficult to}} obtain <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> operation (CW), relative to the same lasing ions in crystalline solid laser hosts.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb is a laser source whose spectrum {{consists of a}} series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser,</b> four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode locked laser. Much work has been devoted to the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} twenty-first century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch in 2005.|$|E
50|$|EN 207 is the European {{norm for}} laser safety eyewear. Any laser eye {{protection}} sold within the European Community must be certified and labeled with the CE mark. According to this standard, laser safety glasses {{should not only}} absorb laser light of a given wavelength, but they should {{also be able to}} withstand a direct hit from the laser without breaking or melting. In this respect, the European norm is more strict than the American norm (ANSI Z 136) that only regulates the required optical density. More precisely, the safety glasses should be able to withstand a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> for 10 seconds, or 100 pulses for a pulsed laser.|$|E

50|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the creation of}} infrared lasers based on the vibrationally excited products of a chemical reaction was first proposed by John Polanyi in 1961. A pulsed (although not chemical) laser was demonstrated by Jerome V. V. Kasper and George C. Pimentel in 1965. First, hydrogen chloride (HCl) was pumped optically so vigorously that the molecule disassociated and then re-combined, leaving it in an excited state suitable for a laser. Then hydrogen fluoride (HF) and deuterium fluoride (DF) were demonstrated. Pimentel went on to explore a DF-CO2 transfer laser. Although this work did not produce a purely chemical <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser,</b> it paved the way by showing the viability of the chemical reaction as a pumping mechanism for a chemical laser.|$|E
5000|$|A laser can be {{classified}} as operating in either continuous or pulsed mode, {{depending on whether the}} power output is essentially continuous over time or whether its output takes the form of pulses of light on one or another time scale. Of course even a laser whose output is normally continuous can be intentionally turned on and off at some rate in order to create pulses of light. When the modulation rate is on time scales much slower than the cavity lifetime and the time period over which energy can be stored in the lasing medium or pumping mechanism, then it is still classified as a [...] "modulated" [...] or [...] "pulsed" [...] <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser.</b> Most laser diodes used in communication systems fall in that category.|$|E

50|$|Kerr {{frequency}} combs (also known as microresonator {{frequency combs}}) are optical frequency combs which are generated from a continuous wave pump laser by the Kerr nonlinearity. This coherent {{conversion of the}} pump laser to a frequency comb takes place inside an optical resonator which is typically of micrometer to millimeter in size and is therefore termed a microresonator. The coherent generation of the frequency comb from a <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> <b>laser</b> with the optical nonlinearity as a gain sets Kerr frequency combs apart from today’s most common optical frequency combs. These frequency combs are generated by mode-locked lasers where the dominating gain stems from a conventional laser gain medium, which is pumped incoherently. Because Kerr frequency combs only rely on the nonlinear properties of the medium inside the microresonator and do not require a broadband laser gain medium, broad Kerr frequency combs can in principle be generated around any pump frequency.|$|E
