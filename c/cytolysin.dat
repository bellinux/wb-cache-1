50|$|A {{more complex}} pore {{formation}} process involves a oligomerization process of several PFC monomers. The pore forming process comprise 3 basic steps. The <b>cytolysins</b> {{are produced by}} certain microorganisms at first. Sometimes the producer organism needs to create a pore at its own membrane to release such <b>cytolysins,</b> like the case colicins produced by Escherichia coli. <b>Cytolysins</b> are released as protein monomers in a water-soluble state in this step. Note that <b>cytolysins</b> are often toxic to its producing hosts as well. For example, colicins consume nucleic acids of cells by using several enzymes. To prevent such toxicity, host cells produce immunity proteins for binding <b>cytolysins</b> before they do any damage inward.|$|R

5000|$|A diverse {{range of}} studies {{has been done on}} Cytolysins. Since the 1970s, more than 40 new cytolysins have been {{discovered}} and grouped into different families. At genetic level, the genetic structures of about 70 <b>Cytolysin</b> proteins has been studied and published. The detailed process of membrane damage has also been surveyed. Rossjohn et al. presents the crystal structure of perfringolysin O, a thiol-activated <b>cytolysin,</b> which creates membrane holes on eukaryotic cells. A detailed model of membrane [...] formation that reveals membrane insertion mechanism is constructed. Shatursky et al. studied the membrane insertion mechanism of Perfringolysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-dependent pore-forming <b>cytolysin</b> produced by pathogenic Clostridium perfringens. Instead of using a single amphipathic β hairpin per plypeptide, PFO monomer contains two amphipathic β hairpins, each spans the whole membrane. Larry et al. focused on the membrane penetrating models of RTX toxins, a family of MDT secreted by many gram-negative bacteria. The insertion and transport process of the protein from RTX to target lipid membrane was revealed.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the formed <b>cytolysin</b> {{clusters}} penetrate target cells membranes {{and form}} membrane pores. The size of these pores varies from 1-2 nm ( [...] S. aureus &alpha;-toxin, E. coli &alpha;-hemolysin, Aeromonas aerolysin) to 25-30 nm (streplysin O, pneumolysin).|$|E

50|$|The lethal {{effects of}} pore-forming <b>cytolysins</b> are {{performed}} by causing influx and outflux disorder {{in a single}} cell. Pores that allow ions like Na+ to pass through created imbalance in the target cell which exceeds its ion-balancing capacity. Attacked cells therefore expand to lysis. When target cell membranes are destructed, bacteria which produce the <b>cytolysins</b> can consume the intracellular elements of the cell, such as iron and cytokines. Some enzymes that decompose target-cells' critical structures can enter the cells without obstructions.|$|R
5000|$|Cytolysins which {{attack the}} {{hydrophobic}} regions of membranes {{and act like}} [...] "detergents". Examples of this type include the 26-amino-acid δ-toxins from Straphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus and S. lugdunensis, Bacillus subtilis toxin and the <b>cytolysin</b> from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|E
5000|$|One {{specific}} type of <b>cytolysin</b> is the Cholesterol-dependent <b>cytolysin</b> (CDC). CDCs exist in many Gram-positive bacteria. The pore forming process of CDCs require the presence of cholesterols on target-cell membranes. The pore size created by CDC is large (25-30 nm) due to the oligomeric process of cytolysins. Note that cholesterol are not always necessary at during the adhering phase. For example, Intermedilysin requires only the presence of protein receptors when attaching to target cells and cholesterols are required at pore forming. The formation of pores through CDCs involve an additional step than the steps analyzed above. The water-soluble monomers oligomerize to form an intermediate product named [...] "pre-pore" [...] complex and then a &beta;-barrel is penetrated into the membrane.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of several hemolysins has been solved by X-ray crystallography in the soluble and pore-forming conformations. For example, α-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus forms a homo-heptameric β-barrel in biological membranes.

These findings imply that data on membrane effects caused by streptolysin O cannot be related indiscriminately to other SH-activated <b>cytolysins.</b> With regard to the mode of membrane interaction, two apparently different groups of SH-activated <b>cytolysins</b> exist...|$|R

Rabbits were actively vaccinated (wild-type toxins or toxoids) or passively immunized (hyperimmune serum) against combinations of superantigens (toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, enterotoxins B and C, and enterotox-in-like X) and <b>cytolysins</b> (α-, β-, and γ-toxins) and challenged intrapulmonarily with multiple strains of S. aureus, both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant. Results. Active vaccination against a cocktail containing bacterial cell-surface antigens enhanced disease se-verity as tested by infective endocarditis.
