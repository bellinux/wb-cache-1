5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|Operation Torch, the Allied {{invasion}} of French North Africa, precipitated {{a crisis in}} Kesselring's command. He ordered Walther Nehring, the former commander of the Afrika Korps who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to Tunisia to take command of a new corps (XC Corps). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in Tunisia and then to press west {{as far as possible}} so as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was forced to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> Kesselring had won the race; the final phase of Torch had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from Tunisia after a prolonged struggle.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{decades after}} his 1839 paper and {{shortly before his}} death, Darwin <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> he was incorrect.

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. George did <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> major work is needed on Banksia marginata, which shows such a high degree of variability over its range.|$|E
5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> the IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order a batch of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E
5|$|Dick Clark, a Democratic Senator from Iowa, {{discovered}} the operation during a fact-finding mission in Africa, but Seymour Hersh, {{a reporter for}} The New York Times, revealed IA Feature to the public on 13 December 1975. Clark proposed {{an amendment to the}} Arms Export Control Act, barring aid to private groups engaged in military or paramilitary operations in Angola. The Senate passed the bill, voting 54–22 on 19 December 1975, and the House of Representatives passed the bill, voting 323–99 on 27 January 1976. Ford signed the bill into law on 9 February 1976. Even after the Clark Amendment became law, then-Director of Central Intelligence, George H. W. Bush, refused to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> all U.S. aid to Angola had ceased. According to foreign affairs analyst Jane Hunter, Israel stepped in as a proxy arms supplier for South Africa after the Clark Amendment took effect. Israel and South Africa established a longstanding military alliance, in which Israel provided weapons and training, as well as conducting joint military exercises.|$|E

5|$|In 1022 Æthelnoth went to Rome {{to obtain}} the pallium, and was {{received}} by Pope Benedict VIII. On his return trip, he bought a relic of St Augustine of Hippo for 100 silver talents and one gold talent. He gave the relic to Coventry Abbey. He also presided over the translation of the relics of Ælfheah, his predecessor at Canterbury who {{was regarded as a}} martyr and saint. In 1022 Æthelnoth consecrated Gerbrand as bishop for the Diocese of Roskilde, which was in Scandinavia. The archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen was the metropolitan of Roskilde, and the fact that Gerbrand was consecrated by an English archbishop later caused friction between the bishop and his metropolitan. Cnut was forced to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> in the future he would not appoint bishops in Bremen's archdiocese without the metropolitan's advice. A later tradition held that Æthelnoth consecrated two Welsh bishops, one at Llandaff and one at St. David's.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance {{that there would be no}} more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{was also}} unpopular within the Navy itself for the {{replacement}} of Sir George Callaghan by Sir John Jellicoe as commander of the Grand Fleet and for bowing to public pressure and dismissing Prince Louis of Battenberg as First Sea Lord, although {{he was one of}} the last members of the government to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> Battenberg had to be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Wemyss {{returned}} from South Africa in July 1901 and proposed an arrangement {{to carry the}} Wellsgreen traffic on the new line. Until that time it had been routed to Wemyss Castle and carried by the NBR. A new eastward spur from the Wellsgreen branch was provided, shortening the transit to Methil considerably. However the NBR reminded Wemyss of the earlier agreement that Wellsgreen traffic would travel via Wemyss Castle, and after some prevarication Wemyss was obliged to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> obligation in August 1903.|$|E
25|$|Most biographers <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> those accusations {{concerning}} Marlowe {{contained in}} various documents {{sent to the}} Privy Council {{at the time were}} very serious. It is therefore surprising that, despite the initial summons for his arrest being on 18 May, he was apparently still at liberty on 30 May to attend the Deptford meeting. Whatever the reason for this, it would have certainly given the opportunity for a faked death to be organized and carried out, if the Marlovians are right in claiming that this is what happened.|$|E

25|$|Schlesinger raised {{awareness}} of the peak oil issue and supports facing it.

In his 2010 ASPO-USA keynote speech, Schlesinger observed that the Peak Oil debate was over.

25|$|Romney's budget {{proposals}} included savings he anticipated achieving by {{restructuring the}} state government. On announcing his 2004 budget proposal, {{he said that}} through improving efficiency by reorganizing the state bureaucracy, along with reducing waste and fraud, he would save $2 billion. Democratic legislators and independent analysts called that estimate vastly overdrawn. The Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation, a nonpartisan, business-funded organization that monitors state finances, suggested the figure might have been closer to $100 million, and Romney himself was eventually forced to <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> the $2 billion figure {{could not be reached}} without new revenue.|$|E

However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to <b>concede</b> <b>that,</b> with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date. However, this was later to be changed to February.|$|E
