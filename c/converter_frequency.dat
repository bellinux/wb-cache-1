40|$|Abstract:- Voltage to {{frequency}} converter (VFC) is an oscillator whose frequency is linearly proportional to control voltage. In this paper, the New Synchronous Voltage to Frequency Converter (NSVFC) or "sigma delta " (Σ-Δ) voltage to {{frequency converter}} is described. This NSVFC works similarly as conventional SVFC {{but it has}} a better frequency spectral property then other SVFC and therefore it is possible to used in fractional phase locked loop (PLL).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{concept of}} a multiple converter. It works in three modes- AC-AC converter voltage regulator, AC-AC <b>converter</b> <b>frequency</b> changer and AC-DC converter. All three modes work simultaneously. AC-AC converter mode of operation alters low input frequency to high output frequency across the load. AC-DC converter mode of operates with variable amplitude across load. This concept is implemented for a single phase supply using MATRIX topology. The control signals for the power switches are generated in a very clear form. The Simulation of the Converter is carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK and results are presented for both modes of operation with low frequency and high frequency operation for AC-AC Mode and Variable voltage for AC-DC conversion mode. This paper discusses the proposed new multiple converter for single phase input using matrix topology for AC-AC conversion and AC-DC conversion using just a single control logic. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A highly {{integrated}} 1. 75 -GHz 0. 35 - m CMOS transmitter is described. The modulator-based transmitter facilitates integration {{through the}} use of a unique mixer, termed a harmonic-rejection mixer, and a wide loop bandwidth phase-locked loop (PLL) for the RF synthesizer. The harmonic-rejection mixers are used to eliminate the need for a discrete IF filter and the use of a wide loop bandwidth PLL allowed for the complete integration of the synthesizers using low- components while achieving low phase noise. The entire transmit signal path from the digital-toanalog converters to the power amplifier, including two fully integrated frequency synthesizers, is integrated into a single-chip solution. The transmitter was tested with a testing buffer before the power amplifier (PA) and achieved less than 1. 3 rms phase error when modulating a DCS- 1800 GMSK signal. The prototype consumed 151 mA from a 3 -V supply. A class-C PA, capable of driving 25 dBm off-chip, was included and the output was compared to the testing buffer with little change in the transmitter performance.

40|$|A {{high gain}} {{operating}} regime for a frequency to voltage converter is analyzed. Such kind of regime {{is useful to}} detect very low variations of a signal frequency. Another possible application is as a marker generator for the sweep low frequency oscillators. The converter gain is theoretically calculated and compared with experimental results. Key words: frequency to voltage <b>converter,</b> <b>frequency</b> comparator, frequency demodulation. In order to observe certain physical effects {{it is necessary to}} demodulate a frequency-modulated signal (e. g. NQR effect [1], RFSE effect [2], various biophysical applications [3], etc). In this purpose, there are many possible methods. Due to its simplicity, the frequency to voltage converter {{is one of the most}} widespread. Frequency to voltage converter provides to its output a voltage U 0 proportional to the input signal frequency ν. Although frequency to voltage converters are not as accurate as the frequency counter circuits, they remain useful in many applications. This is the case where it is required to record only the variations of a signal frequency but it is not necessary to know very precisely the signal frequency. In this paper, we propose a new operating regime for frequency to voltage converter used as a frequency comparator. Such a regime can be useful in order to detect very low variations of a signal frequency. Generally, a frequency to voltage converter must accomplish two main requirements: – Output voltage versus input signal frequency to be linear – Converter gain K=∆U 0 /∆ν to be as high as possible...|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuous}} scaling of CMOS technology, two opposite trends can be observed. First trend is exponential {{improvement of the}} digital logic and second trend is linear degradation of the analog and RF components. Traditional methodology for designing analog and RF focuses on optimizing the performance of individual blocks such as analog-to-digital converters, frequency synthesizers, etc. Unfortunately, such traditional approach {{is limited by the}} unforgiving power-consumption-performance tradeoffs encountered in the design of each circuit block. As a result, high power consumption of RF and analog has become a major bottleneck for implementation of new communication algorithms. Alternatively, one can "assist" the underperforming RF and analog blocks using cross-domain (RF-analog-digital) techniques. Such cross-domain approach leads to a significant saving in the power consumption while achieving the desired system performance (e. g. bit-error rate). This dissertation explores cross-domain techniques to assist the analog-to digital <b>converter,</b> <b>frequency</b> synthesizer and antenna arrays. Novel cross-domain techniques are proposed to optimize the usage of dynamic range of analog-to-digital converter, to track and correct phase noise of the frequency synthesizer and to increase the processing bandwidth of phased array antennas. The proposed techniques have either been directly verified in experiment or as a minimum their implementation aspects have been fully considered in order to close the bridge between theoretical studies and practice. By applying the proposed techniques to the system design of a 60 GHz radio link, we could improve the bit error rate of the link by several orders of magnitude while consuming an order of magnitude less power than the power that would otherwise have been consumed using traditional approach...|$|E
40|$|AUTHORS ' SYNOPSIS The {{accuracy}} {{of the use of}} spectral analysis as a method of quantitative interpretation of Doppler-shift flow signals from chronically implanted probes was investigated in sheep and ponies. Doppler-shift flow probes, chronically implanted around the pulmonary artery, were used to obtain a continuous beat-by-beat measurement of cardiac output. The average velocity blood flow in the vessel was found by spectral analysis, and output calculated using the internal diameter of the vessel. The results were compared with those obtained simultaneously by the dye dilution method. In these circumstances the Doppler-shift flow probes gave results which accurately reflected changes in cardiac output, and which were quantitatively at least as accurate as those measured by dye-dilution methods. Doppler-shift methods of measurement of flow velocity have been used extensively to measure blood flow velocity in vessels, using both super-ficial probes in order to obtain qualitative changes in flow rate and more accurately, probes in cuff form placed around a surgically exposed vessel. To date, most of the work done using constant wave Doppler-shift flowmeters has been of a qualitative nature rather than an accurate quantitative measurement (Gosling et al, 1969; Baker, 1970). This is mainly because of the problems in analysing the returning signal in order to obtain the average Doppler-shift frequency. Most commercially available appara-tus attempts to do this by means of a zero-crossing DC <b>converter</b> <b>frequency</b> meter, but whilst in uitro this converter may give accurate quantitative results, in viuo- and particularly where pulsatile flow is being measured- the results are less trustworthy. The errors which occur are due partly to limitations inherent in the zero-crossing frequency meter (Gosling et al, This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust and th...|$|E

40|$|At Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV) the {{frequency}} of the Doppler shifted light scattered from the fluid has to be determined to obtain the velocity field. Standard DGV is based on the principle of transforming the Doppler shifted frequency into variations of grey levels by means of an Iodine cell, the transmittance of which is frequency dependent. Standard DGV configurations require a second reference camera to monitor the flow field. The major problems of the Standard DGV technique at present are limitations of the velocity resolution at low flow velocities and the influence of multi–particle scattering on the results of the velocity measurements. This paper will discuss different solutions to overcome these problems. First, a method of optical discrimination of the Doppler frequency shift has been realized in an optical Doppler processor (ODP) with coherent feedback. This processor is used as a <b>converter</b> <b>frequency</b> ==> intensity. One implementation of the Optical Doppler Processor consists of a semi–confocal interferometer as wide–band spatial frequency filter with resonant transfer function. The slope of its resonance transfer function is used as frequency discrimination curve. The ODP is included in a feed back loop with the laser. In the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Göttingen joint experiments on visualization and measurement of velocity fields in gas jets from a test nozzle in the regime of low velocities of a few meters/second have been made utilizing the ODP. A method to eliminate the influence of multi–particle scattering on the result of the measurement of velocity fields based on linear operations with frequency–demodulated images of the flow, formed in various areas of the angular spectrum of the scattered light, is proposed. The registration of the image can be made by only one CCD camera without the need of a second camera for a reference image. Eliminating the influence of multi–particle scattering is subject of an application for an European patent. ...|$|E

40|$|Transient {{stability}} {{concerns the}} ability of a power system to maintain synchronism after a large disturbance. Transient stability {{plays an important role in}} guaranteeing operational security and reliability and has been extensively studies for large 50 Hz and 60 Hz transmission systems. However, transient stability of low frequency railway grids has not been properly investigated. As low frequency railway grids operate at another frequency than the public grid, conversion of frequency is needed. This conversion is performed by Rotary <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converters</b> or by Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converters.</b> These two types of converters have a different impact on stability. In this thesis, the overall aim is to obtain knowledge on transient stability in low frequency railway grids, with focus on the Swedish synchronous-synchronous railway grid with a mix of Rotary and Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converters.</b> The transient stability problem is approached by developing a simplified model of a Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> that can be used for the stability studies in low frequency railways. The Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> is modelled as single phase generator with an equivalent inertia and damping. However as Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>converters</b> cannot handle currents much above their ratings, current limitation is implemented. The current limitation is needed to avoid unnecessary tripping of the converter during fault or other high current situations. With the model developed for a Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> and with a simplified model of a Rotary <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter,</b> transient stability studies have been performed for several test systems representing the Swedish railway grid. The simulations performed shows the appearance of power oscillations after a large disturbance, between a Static <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> and a Rotary <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> when these are operating in parallel. The simulations also showed that the systems studied were stable for realistic values of the fault-clearing time.
