This research was aimed {{to evaluate the}} impact of time zone transitions on self-perception of mood, concentration, and time reactions, {{in a sample of}} 21 fencers, participating in the 2011 World Fencing Championships. Two self-report instruments were administered: the Profile of Mood States and a questionnaire assessing travel, sleep habits, and sleep-wake cycle in the first week after the arrival. Results of the mixed- method analysis and possible educational intervention on athletesâ€™ psychophysical recovery were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{deployment}} of combat units to overseas locations {{is a primary}} concern of today's strategic planners. Such movements require the airlifting of units across multiple time zones. Numerous studies have documented the adverse physiological and behavioral consequences accompanying the rapid crossing of three or more time zones (1). These effects result from the requirement that the body must adjust its circadian rhythms to the new local time. Under normal conditions, these daily cycles are synchronized by the external Zeitgebers (i. e., time-givers) of the local environ-ment. The sudden shifting of these Zeitgebers causes the shifting at different rates of the body's physiological, biochemical, and behavioral rhythms. While some circadian rhythms adjust quite rapidly, others adjust very slowly. Consequently, the passenger's circadian system is not only out of synchrony with the environ-ment but is also internally desynchronized. It is the latter condition, <b>circadian</b> <b>dyschronism,</b> which is particularly respon-sible for the fatigue and malaise typically reported as "Jet lag" during the first several days following rapid transmeridian flight. While the physiological and behavioral consequences of uch P> 1 flights are a common experience for airline travellers, their impact C 3. poses a potentially serious problem for troops required to display maximal combat effectiveness upon arrival at a hostile destination. The high-level cognitive performance required by the modern sophis-ticated battlefield may only serve to exacerbate the problem. Any DT c his 0 o-. [...] c ' [...] cI distribution if utw;:ed.

40|$|As a group phenomenon, human {{variables}} {{exhibit a}} rhythm with a period (tau) equal to 24 h. However, healthy human adults {{may differ from}} one another {{with regard to the}} persistence of the 24 -h periods of a set of variables' rhythms within a given individual. Such an internal desynchronization (or individual <b>circadian</b> <b>dyschronism)</b> was documented during isolation experiments without time cues, both in the present study involving 78 male shift workers and in 20 males and 19 females living in a natural setting. Circadian rhythms of sleep-wake cycles, oral temperature, grip strength of both hands, and heart rate were recorded, and power-spectra analyses of individual time series of about 15 days were used to quantify the rhythm period of each variable. The period of the sleep-wake cycle seldom differed from 24 h, while rhythm periods of the other variables exhibited a trimodal distribution (tau = 24 h, tau > 24 h, tau 24 h, none was detected between 23. 2 and 24 h or between 24 and 24. 8 h. Furthermore, the deviations from the 24 -h period were predominantly grouped in multiples of +/- 0. 8 h. Similar results were obtained when the rhythm periods of hand grip strength were analyzed (for each hand separately). In addition, the distribution of grip strength rhythm periods of the left hand exhibited a gender-related difference. These results suggested the presence of genetically controlled variability. Consequently, the distribution pattern of the periods was analyzed to elucidate its compatibility with a genetic control consisting of either a two-allele system, a multiple-allele system, or a polygenic system. The analysis resulted in structuring a model which integrates the function of a constitutive (essential) gene which produces the exact 24 -h period (the Dian domain) with a set of (inducible) polygenes, the alleles of which, contribute identical time entities to the period. The time entities which affected the rhythm periods of the variables examined were in the magnitude of +/- 0. 8 h. Such an assembly of genes may create periods ranging from 20 to 28 h (the Circadian domain). The model was termed by us "The Dian-Circadian Model. " This model {{can also be used to}} explain the beat phenomena in biological rhythms, the presence of 7 -d and 30 -d periods, and interindividual differences in sensitivity of rhythm characteristics (phase shifts, synchronization, etc.) to external (and environmental) factors...|$|E
