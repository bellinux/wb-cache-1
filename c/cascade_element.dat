40|$|The {{operation}} of the recently introduced photon assisted cascaded electron multiplier (PACEM) in CF 4 is investigated. The PACEM uses the VUV scintillation produced in the electron avalanches of the first multiplier of the cascade to transfer the signal to the subsequent ones. The VUV scintillation induces the emission {{of a large number}} of photoelectrons from a Csl photocathode placed on the top-surface of the second multiplier. The photoelectrons are further multiplied in the subsequent stages of the cascade, resulting in efficient signal amplification. A mesh, set at a fixed voltage, is placed between the first and the second multipliers to block the charge transfer between them, thus suppressing all the ion backflow (IBF) heading to the first <b>cascade</b> <b>element.</b> The PACEM electrically isolates the first multiplier of the cascade and only the ions produced in the electron avalanches of the first element may flow back into the drift region. Operating in CF 4, absolute IBFs as low as ~ 1 ion per primary electron are achieved for drift fields of 0. 1 kV/cm, while for fields of 0. 5 kV/cm the absolute IBF is ~ 10 ions/primary electron. This corresponds to an IBF of 10 - 4 at gains of 104, for time projection chambers (TPC) operating conditions, and IBFs of ~ 10 - 5 at gains of 106 for gaseous photomultipliers (GPM) operating condition...|$|E

Exposure of developing cells of a C-factor-less mutant (csgA) to purified C factor increases the ratio of methylated to nonmethylated FrzCD protein, the Frz homolog of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Methylation depends on the cognate methyltransferase FrzF, and its extent increases with the concentration of C factor. C-factor-induced methylation also depends on the product of a gene, called class II, which is necessary in vivo for all known responses to C factor.

40|$|The {{application}} of artificial neural networks to complex real world problems usually requires a modularization {{of the network}} architecture. The single modules deal with subtasks that are defined by a decomposition of the problem. Up to now, the modularization of the network is usually done heuristically.

This paper discusses the properties of the recently proposed direct cascade architecture DCA (Littmann and Ritter, 1992).

40|$|Introduction: The {{cascade of}} HIV diagnosis, care and {{treatment}} (HIV care cascade) is increasingly used to direct and evaluate interventions to increase population antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, {{a key component}} of treatment as prevention. The ability to compare cascades over time, sub-population, jurisdiction or country is important. However, differences in data sources and methodology used to construct the HIV care cascade might limit its comparability and ultimately its utility. Our aim was to review systematically the different methods used to estimate and report the HIV care cascade and their comparability. Methods: A search of published and unpublished literature through March 2015 was conducted. Cascades that reported the continuum of care from diagnosis to virological suppression in a demographically definable population were included. Data sources and methods of measurement or estimation were extracted. We defined the most comparable <b>cascade</b> <b>elements</b> as those that directly measured diagnosis or care from a population-based data set. Results and discussions: Thirteen reports were included after screening 1631 records. The undiagnosed HIV-infected population was reported in seven cascades, each of which used different data sets and methods and could not be considered to be comparable. All 13 used mandatory HIV diagnosis notification systems to measure the diagnosed population. Population-based data sets, derived from clinical data or mandatory reporting of CD 4 cell counts and viral load tests from all individuals, were used in 6 of 12 cascades reporting linkage, 6 of 13 reporting retention, 3 of 11 reporting ART and 6 of 13 cascades reporting virological suppression. Cascades with access to population-based data sets were able to directly measure <b>cascade</b> <b>elements</b> and are therefore comparable over time, place and sub-population. Other data sources and methods are less comparable. Conclusions: To ensure comparability, countries wishing to accurately measure the cascade should utilize complete population-based data sets from clinical data from elements of a centralized healthcare setting, where available, or mandatory CD 4 cell count and viral load test result reporting. Additionally, virological suppression should be presented both as percentage of diagnosed and percentage of estimated total HIV-infected population, until methods to calculate the latter have been standardized...|$|R

Details of this model have varied over time partly reflecting different experimental conditions and diverse datasets from distinct task strategies, contributing uncertainty to the bandwidth measurements and leaving important issues unresolved.

This work addresses the problem of propagation in borehole conditions where the temperature varies by approximately 3 ยฐC/ 100 m. In addition to the temperature variation along the coax we have considered the high frequency domain where the skin effect is severe and leading to very high losses. Unlike the uniform temperature distribution study this case is very complex and that is the reason why we have provided a model for PSPICE simulator to represent the cascaded cells because the analytic solution is extremely tedious to solve.

Because the number of cells is huge we have written a C language program to generate automatically the PSPICE. CIR file. Each cell has its own resistance and inductance according to its temperature.

Res u l t s: In the liver, DZN elicited global sensitization, characterized by parallel up-regulation of AC activity itself and of the responses to stimulants acting at ฮฒ-adrenergic receptors, glucagon receptors, or G-proteins. The effects intensified over the course from adolescence to adulthood. In contrast, PRT elicited up-regulation in adolescence that waned by adulthood. Superimposed on these general patterns were effects on glucagon receptor coupling to AC and on responses mediated through the G i inhibitory protein. The effects on the liver were more substantial {{than those in the}} heart, which displayed only transient effects of DZN on AC function in adolescence and no significant effects of PRT.

Analysis of intrinsic arm of apoptotic signaling <b>cascade</b> <b>elements</b> revealed that PGF 2 a injection triggered increased ratio of Bax to Bcl- 2 in the luteal tissue as early as 4 h post treatment that remained elevated till 18 h.

40|$|ABSTRACT Scaffold {{proteins}} play central {{roles in}} the function of many signaling pathways. Among the best-studied examples are the Ste 5 and Far 1 proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins contain three conserved modules, the RING and PH domains, characteristic of some ubiquitin-ligating enzymes, and a vWA domain implicated in protein-protein interactions. In yeast, Ste 5 p regulates the mating pathway kinases while Far 1 p coordinates the cellular polarity machinery. Within the fungal lineage, the Basidiomycetes and the Pezizomycetes contain a single Far 1 -like protein, while several Saccharomycotina species, belonging to the CTG (Candida) clade, contain both a classic Far 1 -like protein and a Ste 5 -like protein that lacks the vWA domain. We analyzed the function of C. albicans Ste 5 p (Cst 5 p), {{a member of this}} class of structurally distinct Ste 5 proteins. CST 5 is essential for mating and still coordinates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) <b>cascade</b> <b>elements</b> {{in the absence of the}} vWA domain; Cst 5 p interacts with the MEK kinase (MEKK) C. albicans Ste 11 p (CaSte 11 p) and the MAPK Cek 1 as well as with the MEK Hst 7 in a vWA domain-independent manner. Cst 5 p can homodimerize, similar to Ste 5 p, but can also heterodimerize with Far 1 p, potentially forming heteromeric signaling scaffolds. We found direct binding between the MEKK CaSte 11 p and the MEK Hst 7 p that depends on a mobile acidic loop absent from S. cerevisiae Ste 11 p but related to the Ste 7 binding region within the vWA domain of Ste 5 p. Thus, the fungal lineage has restructured specific scaffolding modules to coordinate the proteins required to direct the gene expression, polarity, and cell cycle regulation essential for mating.
