40|$|Future manned {{missions}} to Mars {{are expected to}} greatly increase the space vehicle's size, weight, and heat dissipation requirements. An effective means to reducing both size and weight is to replace single-phase thermal management systems with two-phase counterparts that capitalize upon both latent and sensible heat of the coolant rather than sensible heat alone. This shift is expected to yield orders of magnitude enhancements in flow boiling and condensation heat transfer coefficients. A major challenge to this shift {{is a lack of}} reliable tools for accurate prediction of two-phase pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient in reduced gravity. Developing such tools will require a sophisticated experimental facility to enable investigators to perform both flow boiling and condensation experiments in microgravity in pursuit of reliable databases. This study will discuss the development of the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE) for the International Space Station (ISS), which was initiated in 2012 in collaboration between Purdue University and NASA Glenn Research Center. This facility was recently tested in parabolic flight to acquire condensation data for FC- 72 in microgravity, aided by high-speed video analysis of interfacial structure of the condensation film. The condensation is achieved by rejecting heat to a counter flow of water, and experiments were performed at different mass velocities of FC- 72 and water and different FC- 72 inlet qualities. It is shown that the film flow varies from smooth-laminar to wavy-laminar and ultimately turbulent with increasing FC- 72 mass velocity. The heat transfer coefficient is highest near the inlet of the <b>condensation</b> <b>tube,</b> where the film is thinnest, and decreases monotonically along the tube, except for high FC- 72 mass velocities, where the heat transfer coefficient is enhanced downstream. This enhancement is attributed to both turbulence and increased interfacial waviness. One-ge correlations are shown to predict the average condensation heat transfer coefficient with varying degrees of success, and a recent correlation is identified for its superior predictive capability, evidenced by a mean absolute error of 21. 7 %...|$|E

Controlling parameters of the investigation were fin spacing of <b>condensation</b> <b>tubes,</b> flow rate of condensate and surface tension to density ratio of the condensate. The results indicate that the retention angle (measured from the top of the tube to the position where the inter-fin space is completely filled with liquid) increases with the increase in fin spacing. Also, retention angle increases as the density of the condensate increases but retention angle decreases with increase in surface tension. Interesting finding is seen as retention angle remains constant with increase in condensate flow rate, starting from very low (nearly zero) flow rate to the flow rate at which the tube gets fully flooded. The critical flow rate for eight tubes of defined fin density against three working fluids is measured.

The refrigerant used was R 134 a, and the void fractions were measured using two capacitive void fraction sensors. Mass fluxes ranging from 100 – 400 kg/m 2. s and vapour qualities ranging from 10 – 90 % were considered. Heat transfer coefficients were also compared with void fractions. It was found that at combinations of low mass fluxes and vapour qualities, void fraction and heat transfer were significantly affected by changes in inclination angle. Generally, void fractions and heat transfer coefficients increased with downward inclination angles with an optimum angle between - 10 ᵒ and - 30 ᵒ (downward flow). At some intermediate mass flux and vapour quality conditions, the void fraction and heat transfer coefficients were observed to be independent of the inclination angle despite changes in the prevailing flow patterns.

40|$|Enhanced tubes {{have already}} been widely used for {{air-conditioning}} and refrigeration applications as they ensure a large heat transfer enhancement with a relatively low pressure drop increase. During <b>condensation</b> enhanced <b>tubes</b> show a heat transfer enhancement, compared to equivalent smooth tubes under the same operating conditions, that {{is partly due to}} the mere increase in the effective exchange area, and additionally to the turbulence induced in the liquid film by the enhanced surface (fins) and to the surface tension effect on the liquid drainage. There is agreement in the literature that the mechanisms of heat transfer and pressure drop are intimately linked with the prevailing two-phase flow regime. During <b>condensation</b> inside horizontal <b>tubes,</b> the two-phase flow may be dominated by vapour shear or gravity forces. While annular flow pattern is associated with high vapour shear, stratified, wavy and slug flows appear when gravity is the controlling force. In a fully developed annular flow pattern, there is a thin condensate film on the entire tube wall, while the gas phase flows in the central core, and heat transfer is governed by vapour shear and turbulence. Very poor evidence about the effect of microfins both in helical and “herringbone” shapes on flow patterns during condensation is given in the open literature. Thus, to investigate the two phase flow pattern during condensation, a special test section was built.
