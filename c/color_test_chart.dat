40|$|In this article, we are {{combining}} minimization {{criteria in}} the colorant separation process for spectral color reproduction. The colorant separation is performed by inverting a spectral printer model: the spectral Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer model. The inversion of the spectral printer model is an optimization operation {{in which a}} criterion is minimized an each iteration. The approach we proposed minimizes a criterion defined by the weighted sum of a spectral difference and a perceptual color difference. The weights can be tuned with a parameter alpha epsilon [0, 1]. Our goal is to decrease the spectral difference between the original data and its reproduction and also to consider perceptual color difference under different illuminant conditions. In order {{to find the best}} alpha value, we initially compare a pure colorimetric criterion and a pure spectral criterion for the reproduction, then we combine them. We perform four colorant separations: the first separation will minimize the 1976 CIELAB color difference where four illuminants are tested, the second separation will minimize an equally weighted summation of 1976 CIELAB color difference with the four illuminants tested independently, the third colorant separation will minimize a spectral difference, and the fourth colorant separation will combine a weighted sum of a spectral difference and one of the two first colorimetric differences previously introduced. This last colorant separation can be tuned with a parameter in order to emphasize on spectral or colorimetric difference. We use a six colorants printer with artificial inks for our experiments. The prints are simulated by the spectral Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer model. Two groups of data are used for our experiments. The first group describes the data printed by our printing system, which is represented by a regular grid in colorant space of the printer and the second group describes the data which is not originally produced by our printing system but mapped to the spectral printer gamut. The Esser <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> and Macbeth <b>Color</b> Checker <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> have been selected for the second group. Spectral gamut mapping of this data is carried out before performing colorant separation. Our results show improvement for the colorant separations combining a sum of 1976 CIELAB color difference for a set of illuminants and for the colorant separation combining a sum of 1976 CIELAB color difference and spectral difference, {{especially in the case of}} spectral data originally produced by the printer...|$|R

40|$|As printers, it is {{important}} to be able to produce accurate proofs before going to press. It is not a rare occurrence that a file looks different, depending on the output device used. This poses a problem for all parties involved with maintaining the accuracy of the print. The DocuColor 12 is a digital proofing device that has been SWOP (Specifications for Web Offset Publication) certified. SWOP certified machines should be able to print <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> that will have very similar, if not identical color measurements. This paper looks to verify this certification by printing a <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> and measuring the color patches. The DocuColor 12 was used to create a new profile, which was applied to the IT 8. 7 / 3 chart and these patches measured. The charts were measured with a GretagMacbeth SpectroScan spectrophotometer. The DocuColor 12 was profiled by printing an ECI 2002 <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> and calculating the profile with GretagMacbeth ProfileMaker 5. 01.

The degradation of dye caused by ozone was observed also in a long-term period, after the contact of sample with ozone was terminated. Results of printed samples accelerated ageing by UV radiation and those that were influenced by the ozone effect were evaluated in the same way. It was found out that UV radiation and ozone treatment have a different effect on {{the degradation of}} dyes.

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the acute effects of physical exercise on specific cognitive functions immediately following an increase in cardiovascular activity. Stair-climbing exercise is used to increase the cardiovascular output of human subjects. The color-naming Stroop Test was used {{to identify}} the cognitive improvements in executive function with respect to processing speed and error rate. The study compared the Stroop results before and immediately after exercise and before and after nonexercise, as a control. The results {{show that there is}} a significant increase in processing speed and a reduction in errors immediately after less than 30 [*]min of aerobic exercise. The improvements are greater for the incongruent than for the congruent <b>color</b> <b>tests.</b> This suggests that physical exercise induces a better performance in a task that requires resolving conflict (or interference) than a task that does not. There is no significant improvement for the nonexercise control trials. This demonstrates that an increase in cardiovascular activity has significant acute effects on improving the executive function that requires conflict resolution (for the incongruent <b>color</b> <b>tests)</b> immediately following aerobic exercise more than similar executive functions that do not require conflict resolution or involve the attention-inhibition process (for the congruent <b>color</b> <b>tests)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} on color {{reproduction}} processes in the graphics field {{and is based on}} theoretical research and practical studies. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate how new tools and tools adapted to a specific production set-up can be used to raise awareness regarding the quality and workflow of images and image processing for sheet-fed offset within the graphic industry. The work is divided in to the following three study areas with several sub-studies: 1) The first research goal of the thesis is to identify knowledge levels regarding color separation of images and demand specifications within printing houses. 2) The second research goal is to investigate whether novel tools and new terminology can help to increase the knowledge level regarding color management 3) The third goal is to investigate whether process specific adaptation of key color control tools can improve quality levels Three surveys about color reproduction (focusing on level of knowledge concerning color separation, the use of ICC-profiles and demand specifications for controlled color reproduction) at printing companies in Sweden were made between 2000 and 2004. The surveys indicated a serious problem in the graphic arts industry, involving both an insufficient understanding of color management and a lack of communication. An important part of the work was to assist in make color management understandable for users and thereby optimize printing. For this purpose, digital test forms have been developed. The developed tools, together with descriptive material, will facilitate the understanding of color management issues. Definitions within the field of color separations have been examined, and changes have been suggested. A new term for separation “Compensation by Black”, CB, has been suggested, instead of e. g. GCR and UCR. Is it possible to adapt the different parts of the process chain in order to achieve an improved production? Yes! This work has developed the method for adaptation of the scanne rtest <b>chart,</b> the printing <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for image categorization and the control strip forsheet-fed offset using gray balance. This thesis suggests {{that it is possible to}} produce a custom-made IT 8 target <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for scanners and achieve a result at least similar to or even better than the standard <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> on the market. This work has also shown that itis possible to adapt the <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for printing to image category. The result showed that low-key image separated by the image-adapted <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> showed more detail in the dark areas than a low-key image separated by the standard <b>test</b> <b>chart,</b> in the prints on a coated paper. The result from the adaptation of a control strip for sheet-fed offset showed that gray balance can be used as a control parameter for quality control in sheet-fed offset. QC 2010061...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a computerized <b>color</b> vision <b>testing</b> (Arden <b>color</b> contrast <b>test)</b> as a screening test for detection of diabetic macular edema (DME). Materials and Methods: A consecutive, prospective case series of 83 eyes of 42 diabetic patients with and without macular edema was enrolled. Macular edema was assessed clinically by stereoscopic grading and by central retinal thickness measurement with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, a computerized chromatest for the protan- and tritan-axis was performed. Analysis of test characteristics included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated sensitivity and specificity. Results: Sixty-one eyes had clinically significant macular edema (CSME). OCT yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0. 92. <b>Color</b> vision <b>testing</b> yielded an AUC of 0. 82 for the tritan- and 0. 80 for the protan-axis. Using a cut off of 199 microns OCT resulted in a 100 % sensitivity at 39 % specificity. With a cut-off of 4. 85, <b>color</b> <b>testing</b> yielded a sensitivity of 100 % at a specificity of 8 % on the tritan-axis, respectively. Considering OCT instead of clinical examination as a reference standard resulted in a comparable high sensitivity, but low specificity for <b>color</b> vision <b>testing.</b> Disturbance of the tritan axis was more pronounced than for the protan axis in present macular edema and also better correlated (r = 0. 46) with retinal thickness measured with OCT. Conclusions: Computerized, quantitative <b>color</b> <b>testing</b> using the chromatest allows detection of diabetic maculopathy with high sensitivity. However, only a low specificity exists for retinal macular edema, as in diabetic retinopathy (DR) frequently abnormalities of the tritan axis exist before any retinal thickening occurs...|$|R
