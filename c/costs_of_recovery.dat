50|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} realities facing many of the former Soviet republics was the loss of Soviet-subsidized fuel and utility transfers. Prior to 2004, Georgia's transmission network was in critical condition, with electricity blackouts being common throughout the country. In response to mounting pressures, the Georgian government initiated a series of legislative reforms in 1998 and 1999 to begin to develop the power sector and electricity markets. While measures were taken to unbundle and liberalize the energy sector, a new law was drafted and Georgia’s independent regulatory authority, the Georgian National Energy Regulatory Commission (GNERC), was formed. In addition to providing government subsidies, the GNERC was able to increase the prices of electricity and natural gas in Georgia to buffer the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> from the state’s reform process. Following these reforms, distribution has been increasingly more reliable, approaching consistent 24-hour-a-day services. Investments in infrastructure have been made as well.Currently, a privately owned Energo-Pro Georgia controls 62.5% of the electricity distribution market.|$|E

Although {{little is known about}} the historic distribution of aspen in Oregon, it is believed that stands were once larger and more widely distributed. Decline of the species is attributed to fire suppression and browsing pressure from large ungulates. A landscape approach to restoring aspen is taken using a variety of techniques. Among these are construction of large herbivore exclosures, prescribed fire, establishment of new aspen stands using containerized planting stock, simulation of natural refugia, and use of genetic variation data to guide management decisions.

40|$|In this study, {{we develop}} a bi-level {{optimization}} model for <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> a disrupted water distribution system. The model minimizes the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the system. The cost includes the repair <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{the system and}} systemic impact of disruption on the system during the repair process. The systemic cost is calculated {{in terms of the}} unmet demand while the system is still damaged. The upper level problem is to schedule the repair tasks, and the lower level problem is to optimize the supply of water (optimal mitigation) given the schedule from upper level problem. The upper level problem is solved using Simulated Annealing, and the lower level problem uses a Generalized Reduced Gradient algorithm. We first apply and validate the model on a small water distribution system with only three elements damaged due to disruption. In this case, the recovery process requires tasks that can be performed in only one mode. We later apply the model to a larger and more complex water distribution system with eight elements damaged due to disruption. We perform three different experiments on this system. In the first experiment, limited resources are available at each time period. In the second experiment, the resources are increased by 50 %, and in third experiment, some tasks are provided with an additional mode.

Resilience explains the resistance of a system to shocks and disasters, recovery ability, recovery times, and <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> [75]. In a Futures Clinique, covering {{the broad range of}} discontinuities in detail is an ambitious task; but provides useful grounds for analysing their implications for energy security beyond conventional risk assessment. While feedback was not collected from the participants to evaluate the quality or impact of this process, the workshop participants are key stakeholders for this research question, expected to be able to carry the findings in their own future work. In the post-black swans session, the use of four transformative scenarios for each black swan allowed a differentiation to be made across a range of possible black swans and their contexts, to open up another level of different possible futures. Exploring discontinuities allowed for a depiction of a fairly rich ‘futures map’ [76]. Resilience could be understood a countering dimension for discontinuities and black swans, and rich futures maps may be important for resilience. It may help understanding how energy services can be provided in a future society even in the case of disruptions [77].|$|E
40|$|An Operational Information System (OIS) {{supports}} a real-time {{view of an}} organization's information critical to its logistical business operations. A central component of an OIS is an engine that integrates data events captured from distributed, remote sources in order to derive meaningful real-time views of current operations. This Event Derivation Engine (EDE) continuously updates these views and also publishes them to a potentially large number of remote subscribers. The paper first describes a sample OIS and EDE {{in the context of}} an airline's operations. It then defines the performance and availability requirements to be met by this system, specifically focusing on the EDE component. One particular requirement for the EDE is that subscribers to its output events should not experience downtime due to EDE failures, crashes or increased processing loads. Toward this end, we develop and evaluate a practical technique for masking failures and for hiding the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> from EDE subscribers. This technique utilizes redundant EDEs that coordinate view replicas with a relaxed synchronous fault tolerance protocol. A combination of preand post-buffering of replicas is used to attain a solution that offers low response times (i. e., `zero' downtime) while also preventing system failures in the presence of deterministic faults like `ill-formed' messages. Parallelism realized via a cluster machine and application-specific techniques for reducing synchronization across replicas are used to scale a `zero' downtime EDE to support the large number of subscribers it must service...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary The {{need for}} {{building}} resilience Natural hazards {{have the potential}} to devastate communities and economies around the world. Natural hazards are inevitable, but not natural disasters. When a natural hazard occurs, it is the collective societal resilience that will determine whether that event results in a natural disaster. This century, more than one million people have lost their lives to natural disasters. Last year alone around 20, 000 people were killed or went missing in natural disasters, the majority in storms, floods and other severe weather events. The impact of natural disasters can reverberate long after the event itself—global economic losses due to natural disasters in 2013 amounted to USD 131 billion, which represents almost 2 % of GDP. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> from these natural disasters—borne by governments, NGOs, business and communities—consume scarce public and private resources which could otherwise be used to develop social, economic and natural capital. Much of this can be prevented by building disaster-resilient communities and economies. Reducing disaster risk before an event can have a direct impact on how well, and how quickly, communities recover. Across many nations, there is a funding imbalance between investing in pre-disaster resilience and paying the costs of post-disaster relief and recovery. Investment in building up- front resilience and hazard preparedness provides a positive return and reduces the need for recovery. It is estimated that every dollar spent in disaster risk reduction returns between two and ten dollars in recovery savings. Building resilience to natural hazards requires an awareness of risk, a commitment by all stakeholders to make change happen, and a structured approach to funding and implementing effective measures for disaster risk reduction.   NOTE: This report is Phase 1 of the The Global Resilience Project.

40|$|The {{number of}} people {{affected}} by natural disasters and the financial <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> are increasing. To improve the survival rate, reduce the financial costs and reduce the risks posed to rescue workers, several authors have proposed using robotic modules {{to aid in the}} search and rescue and cleanup operations that follow natural disasters. Due to the potentially high-levels of adaptivity that they may provide, there is one class of system in particular which is often highlighted: self-reconfigurable modular robots. Self-reconfigurable modular robots are robotic modules which can physically connect with one another and dynamically alter their structural configuration through a process known as morphogenesis. For self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems to be effective in tasks like search and rescue they will need to be capable of surviving autonomously for long periods of time, whilst demonstrating high levels of reliability and fault tolerance. In this thesis, a novel approach is used to study the reliability of an existing morphogenesis algorithm, using techniques from the field of reliability engineering. The techniques are found to be effective in identifying problems with the algorithm and the findings are used to help develop new strategies for detecting faults and recovering from failures. Results from simulated and real robot experiments show that systems employing these strategies are able to recover significantly quicker and survive longer than systems which do not. The design of a new platform extension and algorithms for controlling the collective locomotion of robots equipped with the extension are also presented. Through the novel use of `virtual sensors', the same locomotion strategy is used to demonstrate implicit forms of self-assembly and self-reconfiguration. It is concluded that the long-term autonomy of self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems can be improved through the study and development of new and existing approaches to fault tolerant morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|A major {{economic}} hurdle for {{the viability of}} second generation biofuel production is the highly dispersed nature of biomass feedstocks and the associated <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> and transport to a biofuel production facility. The sugar industry is unique in that the processing of cane into sugar results in a highly localised and relatively abundant source of biomass fibre for bioelectricity and biofuel production. Despite this localised abundance few Australian mills produce bagasse in quantities sufficient to achieve the economies of scale required for commercially viable biofuel production. In addition most mills are situated in regions which are relatively remote from major fuel distribution and population centres. This paper explores the potential for significant cost reductions through industry-wide factory-based energy densification and transport of bagasse and trash for large scale centralised biofuel production. Energy densification by pelletisation of raw and of torrefied bagasse is compared with unprocessed bagasse {{in terms of the}} associated impacts on transport and centralised biofuel production costs. Enzymatic hydrolysis with dilute acid pre-treatment and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technologies are assumed for the production of ethanol and hydrocarbons respectively. Costs associated with centralised biofuel production based at processing plants in Brisbane and Townsville are considered. The overall lowest costs (on an energy basis) in this study are reached for a sub-scenario in which FT fuel is produced from torrefied and pelletised bagasse and trash located at Townsville at final fuel costs of 48 A$/GJLHV (1. 6 A$/L of hydrocarbon fuel). The lowest cost ethanol production scenario is observed for a centralised plant using unprocessed bagasse and trash at Townsville with final costs of 49 A$/GJLHV (1. 0 A$/L of ethanol). A Monte Carlo analysis was undertaken to quantify the impact of uncertainties associated with inputs used in calculating unit biofuel production costs. It was found that a deviation from the base case costs is more likely to occur for FT fuel production, which is especially sensitive to export power price and capital investment parameters.

40|$|We study {{strategic}} and operational measures of improving airline system performance and reducing delays for aircraft, crew and passengers. As a strategic approach, we study robust optimization models, which capture possible future operational uncertainties at the planning stage, {{in order to}} generate solutions that when implemented, {{are less likely to}} be disrupted, or incur lower <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> when disrupted. We complement strategic measures with operational measures of managing delays and disruptions by integrating two areas of airline operations thus far separate - disruption management and flight planning. We study different classes of models to generate robust airline scheduling solutions. In particular, we study, two general classes of robust models: (i) extreme-value robust-optimization based and (ii) chance-constrained probability-based; and one tailored model, which uses domain knowledge to guide the solution process. We focus on the aircraft routing problem, a step of the airline scheduling process. We first show how the general models can be applied to the aircraft routing problem by incorporating domain knowledge. To overcome limitations of solution tractability and solution performance, we present budget-based extensions to the general model classes, called the Delta model and the Extended Chance-Constrained programming model. Our models enhance tractability by reducing the need to iterate and re-solve the models, and generate solutions that are consistently robust (compared to the basic models) according to our performance metrics. In addition, tailored approaches to robustness can be expressed as special cases of these generalizable models. The extended models, and insights gleaned, apply not only to the aircraft routing model but also to the broad class of large-scale, network-based, resource allocation. We show how our results generalize to resource allocation problems in other domains, by applying these models to pharmaceutical supply chain and corporate portfolio applications in collaboration with IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory. Through empirical studies, we show that the effectiveness of a robust approach for an application is dependent on the interaction between (i) the robust approach, (ii) the data instance and (iii) the decision-maker's and stakeholders' metrics. We characterize the effectiveness of the extreme-value models and probabilistic models based on the underlying data distributions and performance metrics. We also show how knowledge of the underlying data distributions can indicate ways of tailoring model parameters to generate more robust solutions according to the specified performance metrics. As an operational approach towards managing airline delays, we integrate flight planning with disruption management. We focus on two aspects of flight planning: (i) flight speed changes; and (ii) intentional flight departure holds, or delays, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between fuel costs and passenger delay costs. We provide an overview of the state of the practice via dialogue with multiple airlines and show how greater flexibility in disruption management is possible through integration. We present models for aircraft and passenger recovery combined with flight planning, and models for approximate aircraft and passenger recovery combined with flight planning. Our computational experiments on data provided by a European airline show that decrease in passenger disruptions on the order of 47. 2 %- 53. 3 % can be obtained using our approaches. We also discuss the relative benefits of the two mechanisms studied - that of flight speed changes, and that of intentionally holding flight departures, and show significant synergies in applying these mechanisms. We also show that as more information about delays and disruptions in the system is captured in our models, further cost savings and reductions in passenger delays are obtained. by Lavanya Marla.
