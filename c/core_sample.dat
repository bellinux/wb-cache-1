5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm {{from the back of}} his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
25|$|The depositional {{setting of}} the field is also varied. On the basis of <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> {{analysis}} and seismic studies the following depositional settings have been identified: limestone, talus, normal marine, shallow marine, inner reef lagoon, reef core, relatively deep water, slope, and anhydrite.|$|E
25|$|An ice core is a <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> {{from the}} {{accumulation}} of snow and ice that has re-crystallized and trapped air bubbles over many years. The composition of these ice cores, especially the presence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, provides {{a picture of the}} climate at the time. Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information.|$|E
30|$|Standard Core Lab {{procedures}} were implemented in cutting, trimming and cleaning the <b>core</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>Core</b> <b>samples</b> {{are provided by}} ADCO and are cylindrical in shape, 4 ″ in length and 1.5 ″ in diameter. The <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> were cut into three horizontal pieces using the core trimming machine. For cleaning, Soxhlet extraction apparatus was used. The <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> were placed in medium of toluene {{and then in the}} medium of methanol. Toluene was used to extract hydrocarbon and methanol to remove salts. Then, all cleaned <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> were placed in oven for drying.|$|R
30|$|Since <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are {{not readily}} available, we compare the outcrop with <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> for Eagle Ford Lower Shale, and observe a quite {{different}} behavior. The outcrop sample has a unimodal pore-throat size (at 95  %) located at 10 – 50  nm, compared to 30  %– 44  % for three <b>core</b> <b>samples.</b> Pore-throats for the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are widely distributed from 3  nm to 36  μm, though most of them (70  %– 80  %) are smaller than 100  nm. The disparity between outcrop and <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> is also reflected in median pore-throat sizes, as well as permeability with a difference of a factor of 100. However, caution needs to be extended when using data from outcrop samples to infer underground conditions.|$|R
30|$|A {{total length}} of 205.9  m of <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> was {{collected}} from five wells, and the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> were {{all from the}} first member of the Lower Cretaceous Yingcheng Formation.|$|R
25|$|In September 2013 NASA {{launched}} an Announcement of Opportunity for researchers to propose {{and develop the}} instruments needed, including a <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> cache. The science conducted by the rover's instruments would provide the context needed {{to make informed decisions}} about whether to return the samples to Earth. The chairman of the Science Definition Team stated that NASA does not presume that life ever existed on Mars, but given the recent Curiosity rover findings, past Martian life seems possible.|$|E
25|$|When {{the team}} {{conducted}} carbon dating {{studies on the}} charcoal pieces, two yielded a date of ca. 1070 AD, with the third piece dating to the Late Archaic period some two thousand years earlier, specifically 2920+/-65 years BP (before the present). The third date, ca. 2900 BP, was recovered from a <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> below cultural modification level. The first two dates place the Serpent Mound {{within the realm of}} the Fort Ancient culture. The third dates the mound back to very early Adena culture or before.|$|E

It is responsible for administering the Indian Antarctic Program and maintains the Indian government's Antarctic research station, Maitri. In addition to laboratories for marine sample processing/analyses, it hosts a special low-temperature ice <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> storage facility. It is also the nodal agency for Indian scientific participation in the deep sea drilling research {{under the aegis of}} International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).|$|E
30|$|Although the {{description}} of <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> is always the most reliable data in sedimentary facies, due to {{the limited number of}} <b>core</b> <b>samples,</b> information on sedimentary facies based on <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are localized and fragmented. For this reason, well-log data are used to provide more information of sedimentary facies along the well. This will generate more reliable values along the well to control the model results.|$|R
30|$|The {{permeability}} estimated here is {{orders of}} magnitude greater than permeabilities estimated in <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> (Mizoguchi et al. 2008; Lockner et al. 2009). It is difficult to obtain <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> for laboratory experiments that include the fracture or fractures primarily controlling the permeability; therefore, {{it is not surprising}} that permeabilities estimated for <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are considerably smaller than permeabilities estimated by in situ testing for a granitic rock (Brace 1980).|$|R

25|$|In April 1947, new {{producing}} {{oil wells}} were drilled near Iago {{on the southwest}} edge of the Boling salt dome. Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field's production leaped {{to an average of}} 1 million barrels per year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> was retrieved from the caprock and the production of sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling salt dome.|$|E

500|$|An ice core is a <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> that is {{typically}} removed from an ice sheet or a high mountain glacier. [...] Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers {{are older than}} upper, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years. [...] Cores are drilled with hand augers (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2 km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} formed <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> {{was designed}} and functionally tested {{for use in the}} Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF). Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was requested to compare properties of the formed <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> and <b>core</b> drilled <b>samples</b> taken from adjacent areas in the full-scale sampler. While several physical properties were evaluated, the primary property of interest was hydraulic conductivity. Differences in hydraulic conductivity between the samples from the formed <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> and those representing the bulk material were noted with respect to the initial handling and storage of the samples. Due to testing conditions, the site port samples were exposed to uncontrolled temperature and humidity conditions prior to testing whereas the formed <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> were kept in sealed containers with minimal exposure to an uncontrolled environment prior to testing. Based on the results of the testing, no significant differences in porosity or density were found between the formed <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> and those representing the bulk material in the test stand...|$|R
30|$|After saturating <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> number 1 – 15 with preflush fluid of 5 % HCl: 10 % CH 3 COOH for a {{duration}} of 3  days, the colour of the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> changed from grey to yellowish brown {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 a, b. This could indicate that not only the minerals were dissolved due to the reaction between the acid and the <b>core</b> <b>samples,</b> but also some reaction products could have been formed. These products could potentially be iron(III) (Fe 3 +) or iron(III) tetrachloro complex (FeCl 4 −), which were formed due to the reaction between iron ions and chloride ions which then resulted in the change in colour of the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> into a yellowish brown colour. These colour changes were also observed by Shafiq and Shuker (2013), whereby the colour of the <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> changed to yellowish after saturating with acid.|$|R

2500|$|Ice core {{samples were}} taken from Upper Fremont Glacier in 1990-1991. These ice cores were {{analyzed}} for climatic changes as well as alterations of atmospheric chemicals. In 1998 an unbroken ice <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> of [...] {{was taken from the}} glacier and subsequent analysis of the ice showed an abrupt change in the oxygen isotope ratio oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in conjunction with what is widely regarded {{as the end of the}} Little Ice Age, a period of cooler global temperatures between the years 1550 and 1850. A linkage was established with a similar ice core study which had been undertaken on the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru, which also demonstrated the same changes in the oxygen isotope ratio during the same period. The climatic implications from the ice cores taken from both sites support evidence of a sudden global climate change during the mid 19th century.|$|E

A hanging <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> is positioned with the bottom part of the sample barely touching the imbibing fluid in the beaker. Relative saturation as well as mass of core samples starts to change during imbibition. A computer connected to a balance continuously monitors the <b>core</b> <b>sample</b> mass change over time. Plots of squared mass change versus time are generated.|$|E

In this study, QGF experiment was conducted for another seven wells distributed on the Mosuowan-Mobei area to determine the scale and distribution of the paleo reservoirs. There are a total of 29 samples and sampling locations are shown in Fig.  3. Five <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are from Well M 3, with depth ranging from 4354.21  m to 4379.3  m; five <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are from Well M 5, depth ranging from 4287  m to 4311.8  m; 4 cutting samples are from Well M 7, 4236  m to 4250  m; five <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> are from Well M 15, 4293.35  m to 4309.7  m; five <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> from Well M 21, 4358  m to 4396  m; two <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> from Well MB 3, 3803.95  m and 3808.1  m; and three <b>core</b> <b>samples</b> from Well MB 5, 3727.6  m to 3731  m.
