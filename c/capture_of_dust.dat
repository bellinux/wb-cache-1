Aerogel, a highly porous material with a density of a few tens of kg m(- 3), allows <b>capturing</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles present during the discharge without destroying them. The first exposures in the TEXTOR scrape-off layer plasma showed that such targets are able to capture both slow and fast particles with sizes {{in the range from}} submicrometre to similar to 100 mu m.

Values of filtration efficiency calculated at the three-dimensional modelling of the filtration process are compared with experimental measurements for sets of filtered particles 100 nm in diameter or bigger. The most important characteristics affecting quality of nanofibre materials are nanofibre diameter, porosity and homogeneity of nanofibre layers. The method making possible to achieve the required diameter of the nanofibres is demonstrated on the influence of relative humidity and solvent type on the fibre-forming process taking place in an electrostatic field. The effect of homogeneity of the nanofibre deposition on the collecting substrate is assessed employing images from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tests of filtering abilities of the nanofibre layers. Also, some measurements obtained when nanofibres were used in filtration of air, liquids and dispersions of carbon nanotubes in a liquid are presented...|$|E

Using a full-scale mock-up of a continuous mining machine, preliminary work showed that these side sprays improved suppression of the dust cloud and redistributed this cloud under the cutting head. This led to reductions in dust levels around the machine and in down-wind airways for some positions of theminingmachine. This testing also showed that side spray effectiveness was in u-enced by the distance from the fresh air ventilation device to the cutting surface, termed the ventilation setback distance. These sprays produced larger reductions inmachine and re-turn dust levels at smaller setback distances than at larger setback distances. These side sprays then were installed in similar locations on a mining machine at an underground coal mine operation to evaluate their effectiveness for im-proving suppression and <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> by the ooded-bed dust scrubber.

30|$|The {{biology and}} ecology of {{biological}} soil crusts, a soil surface community of mosses, lichens, cyanobacteria, green algae, fungi, and bacteria, {{have only recently}} been a topic of research. Most efforts began in the western U.S. (Cameron, Harper, Rushforth, and St. Clair), Australia (Rogers), and Israel (Friedmann, Evenari, and Lange) in the late 1960 s and 1970 s (e.g., Friedmann et al. 1967; Evenari 1985 reviewed in Harper and Marble 1988). However, these groups worked independently of each other and, in fact, were often not aware of each other’s work. In addition, biological soil crust communities were seen as more a novelty than {{a critical component of}} dryland ecosystems. Since then, researchers have investigated many different aspects of these communities and have shown that although small to microscopic, biological soil crusts are critical in many ecological processes of deserts. They often cover most of desert soil surfaces and substantially mediate inputs and outputs from desert soils (Belnap et al. 2003). They can be a large source of biodiversity for deserts, as they can contain more species than the surrounding vascular plant community (Rosentreter 1986). These communities are important in reducing soil erosion and increasing soil fertility through the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> and the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and carbon into forms available to other life forms (Elbert et al. 2012). Because of their many effects on soil characteristics, such as external and internal morphological characteristics, aggregate stability, soil moisture, and permeability, they also affect seed germination and establishment and local hydrological cycles. Covering up to 70 % of the surface area in many arid and semi-arid regions around the world (Belnap and Lange 2003), biological soil crusts are a key component within desert environments.|$|E
40|$|Cabin {{environmental}} control {{is an important}} issue for a successful Moon mission. Due to the unique environment of the Moon, lunar dust control {{is one of the main}} problems that significantly diminishes the air quality inside spacecraft cabins. Therefore, this innovation was motivated by NASA s need to minimize the negative health impact that air-suspended lunar dust particles have on astronauts in spacecraft cabins. It is based on fabrication of a hybrid filter comprising nanofiber nonwoven layers coated on porous polymer membranes with uniform cylindrical pores. This design results in a high-efficiency gas particulate filter with low pressure drop and the ability to be easily regenerated to restore filtration performance. A hybrid filter was developed consisting of a porous membrane with uniform, micron-sized, cylindrical pore channels coated with a thin nanofiber layer. Compared to conventional filter media such as a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, this filter is designed to provide high particle efficiency, low pressure drop, and the ability to be regenerated. These membranes have well-defined micron-sized pores and can be used independently as air filters with discreet particle size cut-off, or coated with nanofiber layers for filtration of ultrafine nanoscale particles. The filter consists of a thin design intended to facilitate filter regeneration by localized air pulsing. The two main features of this invention are the concept of combining a micro-engineered straight-pore membrane with nanofibers. The micro-engineered straight pore membrane can be prepared with extremely high precision. Because the resulting membrane pores are straight and not tortuous like those found in conventional filters, the pressure drop across the filter is significantly reduced. The nanofiber layer is applied as a very thin coating to enhance filtration efficiency for fine nanoscale particles. Additionally, the thin nanofiber coating is designed to promote <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles on the filter surface and to facilitate dust removal with pulse or back airflow...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of research undertaken to study various problems associated with hypervelocity <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> particles in aerogel. The primary topics investigated were the properties of shocked aerogel and the requirements for reliable capture of particles on the STARDUST mission. In particular, the viscosity of shocked aerogel has been an open question. The results presented here suggest that the viscosity of aerogel at high impact velocities is negligible, although there remains some uncertainty about lower velocities. The model adopted for viscosity treats the mixture of polymeric silica and decomposition products and finds that, for particle velocities of 6 - 7 km/s, the viscosity is similar to that typical of light gasses at STP. Expressions for the Hugoniot of aerogel as a function of density were also obtained from the available data. All aerogels of interest for cosmic dust collectors have very similar shock velocity-particle velocity Hugoniot curves. The strength behavior of aerogel for low-speed penetration was measured, but further work is needed to study the proper way to apply this to the issue of terminal deceleration of a dust particle. Preliminary calculations designed to maximize the penetration depths were performed to determine the required density of aerogel to reliably stop a particle in a 3 cm thickness of aerogel (the path length expected for a normal impact into the STARDUST collector). In order to stop a particle of density rho(sub p) and diameter d(sub p), the mean density of the aerogel collector should be no less than that given by the expression bar rho(sub 0) = 1. 085 X 10 (exp - 4) rho(sub p) d(sub p), for densities measured in g/ cu cm and the particle diameter measured in micrometers...|$|E

Unfortunately it has been downhill since its selection, culminating in CDCF being dropped as attached payload in the SSF redesign process this year. This action was without any input from the science or cosmic dust communities. The Exobiology Intact Capture Experiment (Exo-ICE) as an experiment on CDCF was also lost. Without CDCF, no facility-class instrument for cosmic dust studies is available or planned. When CDCF (and Exo-ICE) was selected as a SSF attached payload, an exercise called the small particle intact capture experiment (SPICE) was started for Exo-ICE to develop an understanding and early testing of the necessary expertise and technology for intact <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> cosmic <b>dust</b> and IDP's. This SPICE activity looks to fly small, meter square or less, collection area experiments on early orbital platforms of opportunity such as EURECA, MIR, WESTAR, and others, including the shuttle. The SPICE activity has focused on developing techniques and instrument concepts to capture particles intact and without inadvertent contamination. It began with a survey and screening <b>of</b> available <b>capture</b> media concepts and then focused on the development <b>of</b> a <b>capture</b> medium that can meet these requirements. Evaluation and development <b>of</b> the chosen <b>capture</b> medium, aerogel (a silicon oxide gel), has so far lived up to the expectations of meeting the requirements and is highlighted in a companion paper at this workshop.

The SPICE instrument's experiment design builds on the knowledge gained from these efforts to meet the intact capture, noncontamination requirements.

Glycine itself has been claimed, but a recent analysis indicates that few, if any, of the astronomical radio lines attributed to glycine are actually from that molecule. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have long been proposed as the source of the unidentified infrared bands between 3 and 16  μm, but no single PAH has been identified in space, partly because PAHs generally have weak or non-existent radio spectra.

We have performed a series of hypervelocity impact experiments using carbon-bearing impactors (diamond, graphite, kerogens, PAH crystals, and Murchison and Nogoya meteorites) into Al plate targets at velocities - 6 km/s. Estimated peak shock pressures probably did not exceed 120 GPa and peak shock temperatures were probably less than 4000 K for times of nano- to microsecs. Nominal crater dia. are less than one mm. The most significant results of these experiments are the preservation of the higher mass PAHs (e. g., pyrene relative to napthalene) and the formation of additional alkylated PAHs.

This has been done with N-body methods, but such methods are computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness when considering large, slowly evolving grains, and for extrasolar systems with unknown planets and parent bodies, where the possible parameter space for investigation is large. In this work, we present a semi-analytic method for calculating the <b>capture</b> and evolution <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> grains in resonance, which can be orders of magnitude faster than N-body methods.

Since many coals are hydrophobic and not easily wetted by water, wetting agents can be added to the spray water in an effort to improve coal wetting and assist with dust capture. In order to study wetting agent effects on coal dust capture, laboratory experiments were conducted with three wetting agents used by the coal industry on - 325 mesh sized Pocahontas No. 3 coal dust. Significant differences in coal dust sink times were observed among the three wetting agents at water mixture concentrations of 0. 05 %, 0. 1 % and 0. 2 %. The best wetting agent as identified by the coal dust sink test was only tested at the lowest 0. 05 % water mixture concentration and was found to have a negligible effect on spray airborne dust capture. Water spray airborne dust capture results for all three wetting agents tested at a 0. 2 % water mixture concentration showed that all three wetting agents exhibit similar but small improvements in dust capture efficiency as compared with water. These results indicate that the coal dust sink test may not be a good predictor for the <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> airborne <b>dust.</b> Additional research is needed to examine if the coal dust sink test is a better predictor <b>of</b> wetting agent <b>dust</b> suppression effects during cutting, loading, conveying and dumping of coal products by comparison to airborne dust capture from sprays.

40|$|Hydrophobic silica aerogels with {{ultra-low}} densities {{have been}} designed and developed as cosmic dust capture media for the Tanpopo mission which is proposed {{to be carried out}} on the International Space Station. Glass particles as a simulated cosmic dust with 30 μ m in diameter and 2. 4 g/cm^ 3 in density were successfully captured by the novel aerogel at a velocity of 6 km/s. Background levels of contaminated DNA in the ultra-low density aerogel were lower than the detection limit of a polymerase chain reaction assay. These results show that the manufactured aerogel has good performance as a cosmic dust collector and sufficient quality in respect of DNA contamination. The aerogel is feasible for the biological analyses <b>of</b> <b>captured</b> cosmic <b>dust</b> particles in the astrobiological studies. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
2500|$|The Natural Stone Council (NSC) has {{commissioned}} some life-cycle inventory {{data for}} use in life cycle assessments. [...] Almost 90% of the effort in doing a life cycle assessment involves getting reliable data. [...] For example, the NSC has data that the Global Warming Potential for granite quarrying is 100kg of carbon dioxide equivalents and for granite processing is 500 (same units); and the Global Warming Potential for limestone quarrying is 20kg carbon dioxide equivalents while for limestone processing it is 80 (same units). [...] The data on energy and water use include everything back to removal of overburden in the dimension stone quarry and upstream production of energy and fuels, and forward to packaging of finished dimension stone product or slabs for shipment and transport, or to moving scrap stone to storage or reclamation and to <b>capturing</b> and treatment <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> and waste water. [...] The data is then placed in an impact category (i.e. changes to air, changes to water), characterized as to {{the contribution of the}} item to the impact compared to other items, and then the impact categories are assigned weights among themselves to show their relative importance.|$|R
40|$|In a {{companion}} paper {{we have shown}} how the equations describing gas and dust as two fluids coupled by a drag term can be reformulated to describe {{the system as a}} single fluid mixture. Here we present a numerical implementation of the one-fluid dusty gas algorithm using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The algorithm preserves the conservation properties of the SPH formalism. In particular, the total gas and dust mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy are all exactly conserved. Shock viscosity and conductivity terms are generalised to handle the two-phase mixture accordingly. The algorithm is benchmarked against a comprehensive suit of problems: dustybox, dustywave, dustyshock and dustyoscill, each of them addressing different properties of the method. We compare the performance of the one-fluid algorithm to the standard two-fluid approach. The one-fluid algorithm is found to solve both of the fundamental limitations of the two- fluid algorithm: it is no longer possible to concentrate dust below the resolution of the gas (they have the same resolution by definition), and the spatial resolution criterion h < csts, required in two-fluid codes to avoid over-damping of kinetic energy, is unnecessary. Implicit time stepping is straightforward. As a result, the algorithm is up to ten billion times more efficient for 3 D simulations of small grains. Additional benefits include the use of half as many particles, a single kernel and fewer SPH interpolations. The only limitation {{is that it does not}} <b>capture</b> multi-streaming <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> in the limit of zero coupling, suggesting that in this case a hybrid approach may be required.

40|$|Variations of the East Asian {{winter monsoon}} (EAWM) induced by dust aerosol are studied {{by using a}} {{regional}} climate model (RegCM 4 /Dust). Dust coupled and uncoupled experiments are carried out {{for the past decade}} (2000 – 2009). The coupled RegCM 4 <b>captures</b> three centers <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> mixing ratio (DMR) located in the Taklamakan Desert, western Inner Mongolia, and northern Xinjiang, respectively, with maximum values greater than 500 [*]µg[*]kg− 1 in winter. The surface total radiation change induced by dust is negative, and its central value of − 8 [*]W[*]m− 2 results in surface temperature cooling by 1. 5 °C in winter. Dust induced radiation change {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA) is also negative in Northern China, except over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and up to − 5 [*]W[*]m− 2 in Central China. Dust cooling effects increase the sea level pressure (SLP) gradient between land and ocean, the cold surge frequency, and the East Asian jet stream (EAJ) intensity and then enhance the EAWM. The dry and cold wind pervade most areas of East Asia, suppressing large-scale precipitation and eventually leading to a rainfall decrease of about 10 – 30 % in Northern China and the middle Yangtze River Valley...|$|R
