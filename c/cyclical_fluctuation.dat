40|$|AbstractThere is {{a strong}} {{consistency}} between fluctuations in electricity demand and business cycle in macro-economy in China, and the former is stronger than the latter since 1991. The empirical study shows that {{the main reason for}} the cyclical fluctuations in electricity demand is the <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in high energy consumption industries (HECI). Its transmission mechanism in terms of electricity demand is “Investment in the four HECI - HECI forming production capacities - Electricity consumption growths - Investment in electricity growth”. Therefore, in order to smooth <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> it is necessary to strengthen the plan of investments in HECI and the investment in electricity industry itself...|$|E
40|$|We {{decompose}} underlying {{disturbances in}} total hours into three kinds: disturbances that shift the steady-state level of hours, those {{that change the}} sectoral composition of employment in the long-run, and those that cause temporary movement of hours around the steady-state. Our identifying restriction exploits the distinctive nature of the two margins of labor: employment and hours per worker. According to the variance decompostion from a VAR based on Post-War U. S. monthly data, we find that disturbances which eventually shift the steady-state level of hours account for three-quarters of <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in aggregate hours. This challenges the commonly used restriction of constant hours along the balanced growth path in the business cycle literature. Further, we do not find a significant role for sectoral reallocation shocks in the <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of hours. ...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{explanations}} {{appear in}} sharp contrast concerning the determinants of demand-driven industrial business cycles. Aggregate factors are likely to differentiate <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> for a given industry across countries. Industry-specific factors are likely to differentiate <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> across industries of a given economy. The differences are evaluated using data for industries producing private domestic output across a group of major industrial countries. Aggregate factors dominate industryspecific factors in explaining industrial <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in response to aggregate demand shifts. Consistent with the various explanations, higher variability of aggregate demand moderates the response of industrial output to aggregate demand shifts across countries. Contrary to {{the implications of the}} new classical imperfect information model, <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in industrial output appear also smaller in response to higher trend price inflation across countries.

In 1992 Livera et al have shown in one patient, that <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of cerebral blood volume could be measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The aim {{of the present study}} was a quantification of the amplitude of <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of cerebral blood volume (represented by total haemoglobin [Hbtot]) in a large number of healthy infants. Furthermore changes of oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (Hb) were investigated. Measurements were done during two hours of undisturbed daytime sleep. Fifty-eight infants (30 male, 28 female) were included in the study. All but one infant showed <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> For quantification of <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> only periods during quiet sleep with excellent tracing quality were used. A number of 7894 cycles was analyzed for each of the three NIRS parameters. The median amplitude of the cycling fluctuations was: Delta Hbtot 1. 1 mu mol/l, Delta HbO(2) 1. 1 mu mol/l, and Delta Hb 0. 2 mu mol/l. The frequency was changing within a range of 3 to 6 cycles/minute. Polynominal regression analysis showed that the relationship of Delta HbO(2) and Delta Hbtot was distinctively stronger compared to the relationship of Delta Hb and Delta Hbtot. In conclusion we think that these data represent "normal ranges" for parameter fluctuations in long-time NIRS tracings...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe gut {{microbiome}} {{and daily}} feeding/fasting cycle influence host metabolism {{and contribute to}} obesity and metabolic diseases. However, fundamental characteristics of this relationship between the feeding/fasting cycle and the gut microbiome are unknown. Our {{studies show that the}} gut microbiome is highly dynamic, exhibiting daily <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in composition. Diet-induced obesity dampens the daily feeding/fasting rhythm and diminishes many of these <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which feeding is consolidated to the nocturnal phase, partially restores these <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Furthermore, TRF, which protects against obesity and metabolic diseases, affects bacteria shown to influence host metabolism. Cyclical changes in the gut microbiome from feeding/fasting rhythms contribute to the diversity of gut microflora and likely represent a mechanism by which the gut microbiome affects host metabolism. Thus, feeding pattern and time of harvest, in addition to diet, are important parameters when assessing the microbiome’s contribution to host metabolism...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the rol of job tenure as a {{protective}} element of wages against the business cycle. According to the economic theory, job tenure implies the accumulation, through learning, of a specific human capital. Thus, to the extent that the worker receives a fraction of the returns to this human capital, we can expect that the degree of <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation</b> of wages is lower for more tenured workers. In the framework of the Argentinian economy, the empirical analysis confirms this hypothesis, showing that the elasticity of wages to the unemployment rate decreases with tenure. When job heterogeneity is taken into account, the progressive isolation of wages as tenure increases turns out to be more pronounced for more educated workers and for those employed in the higher paying sectors...|$|E
40|$|Views {{expressed}} do {{not necessarily}} reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System. Observers of financial markets have long notedthat broad stock market price indices tend to fallsteeply immediately before and during recessions. In theory, a stock’s price is equal to the sum of its dis-counted expected future dividends, and the discount rate is the expected gross stock return. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that, when the economy becomes weaker, the sharp decrease in stock prices reflects the reduction in expected future dividends. However, many studies have found that the magnitude of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in dividends is too small to account for such large stock market price movements. One possible explanation is that large changes in stock prices might be accompanied by swings in investors ’ atti-tude toward risk.
