500|$|In 2005, Kentucky Speedway filed {{a similar}} lawsuit against ISC and NASCAR, {{claiming}} that NASCAR violated antitrust laws by not awarding them a Sprint Cup Series race, noting the {{close relationship between}} NASCAR, ISC, and the France Family. NASCAR sought to have the case thrown out by arguing that the speedway wasn't trying to end the alleged anticompetitive practices, they were merely trying to benefit from them as well. This motion was denied, however. A motion to move the case from Kentucky to Florida [...] home of NASCAR and ISC [...] was also rejected. ISC, for its part, said it shouldn't {{be involved in the}} <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> as it conducts no business in the state. Lawyers for Kentucky Speedway contended that the company does business online and is just as responsible for the lack of competition in granting the races as NASCAR is.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh {{was brought}} to trial on 17 November 1603, on charges of [...] "conspiring to deprive the King of his Government; to alter religion; {{to bring in the}} Roman superstition; and to procure foreign enemies to invade the kingdom". The {{government}} alleged that on 11 June 1603, Raleigh had met with Lord Cobham, and they had agreed to bring Lady Arbella Stuart (a great great granddaughter of Henry VII) to the English throne, and to accept 600,000marks from the Spanish government. As such, Raleigh was charged with supporting Stuart's claim to the throne and claiming Spanish money. He pleaded not guilty, with Coke's only evidence being a confession from Cobham, who was described as [...] "a weak and unprincipled creature... who said one thing at one time, and another thing in another, and could be relied upon in nothing". This case was [...] "no <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all...</b> It supports the general charges in the indictment only by the vaguest possible reference to 'these practices,' and 'plots and invasions' of which no more is said".|$|E

2500|$|But the Arizona {{system was}} {{different}} in both these areas. First, a jury {{was not involved}} in the sentencing phase of a capital <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> — a judge sitting alone presided over the sentencing hearing and made both the preliminary findings of fact and the ultimate decision. [...] Because judges were presumed to follow the law, they needed no guidance in finding a killing to be [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] in the correct circumstances. Second, the Arizona Supreme Court had developed a body of law that defined the words [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved." [...] Thus, there were legal standards available for trial judges to follow in imposing the death sentence. [...] For the Walton Court, these key differences meant that Arizona's [...] "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] aggravating factor satisfied the dictates of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

2500|$|Figure #13 is {{probably}} Diana, {{identified with the}} moon, although some commentators believe {{her to be a}} mere auxiliary troop with #14. [...] Diana holds spears in her left hand and her right hand seems to rest on the head of the man in figure #12, but not gripping his hair as supposed by many. [...] Another identifying feature of Diana is her bountiful hair, bound up for the hunt, and her hunting clothes. [...] Figure #14 might be an auxiliary, but more likely he personifies Mercurius (Mercury/Hermes), identified by his rimmed hat. [...] Mercurius seems to be dragging the female in figure #12 by her hair towards the tropaion. [...] The scene is clearly complex. [...] Many interpretations insist that the ‘auxiliaries’ are dragging the barbarian prisoners to join their kindred in being bound to the trophy. [...] However, there are indications that this might not be the <b>case</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> [...] First, the man on his knees is begging for mercy from Diana, who does look down on him. [...] That same man wears around his neck a torque, suggesting him to be a Celt or German. [...] It may be significant that Diana has her back turned to the observer and possibly the scene itself. [...] She is the only one as such, and perhaps to contrast the celebration of victory in battle, she shows instead mercy to one pleading for his life. [...] In addition, since the man is a leader, it makes for better propaganda that he should beg for mercy before a Roman goddess. [...] Mercurius might not be dragging the woman to be bound to the trophy, but might be bringing her to kneel before Diana to beg for mercy as well. [...] She shows the sign of a truce by placing her hand upon her chest. [...] Perhaps Diana and Mercurius are sheltering them, perhaps offering them salvation in the final moments of victory. [...] Whatever the case, the couple in #12 are not comparable to the despairing couple in #11, with whom they appear both to balance and contrast; [...] balance by having barbarians on the right and left, literally balancing the composition, and contrast as one couple being doomed to be bound at the trophy, and the other begging for what looks like a chance of mercy.|$|E
