40|$|Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008] {{study the}} {{spreading}} {{of a message}} in an Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, p) starting from a set of vertices that are <b>convinced</b> of the message initially. In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v are <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes <b>convinced.</b> The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can be <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to be <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will be <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will be <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{opposite}} predictions of reactance and dissonance theory, two popular psychological theories, {{with regard to}} the responses of car drivers to the introduction of the road pricing. Reactance theory predicts that persons who are <b>convinced</b> that a toll will come are more opposed than less <b>convinced</b> persons. In contrast, dissonance theory expects that <b>convinced</b> persons are more in favour of road pricing than less <b>convinced</b> persons. Aim {{of the study was to}} test which theory is more appropriate to explain user reactions towards the toll introduction. We experimentally manipulated the perceived likelihood (low, middle, high and a control condition) of a toll introduction for private cars on German motorways (NÂ =Â  140 car drivers). In accordance with the predictions of dissonance theory, results revealed clearly that <b>convinced</b> persons about a definite introduction of road pricing developed more positive attitudes towards road pricing than less <b>convinced</b> persons, i. e., the strength of conviction about the introduction of road pricing has a strong effect on the attitudinal evaluation of road pricing. The implications are discussed. ...|$|R
