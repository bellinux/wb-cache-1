5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration and settlement of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to a demographic change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E
5|$|GDRT {{was most}} likely the first Aksumite king to be {{involved}} in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning of centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> of South Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The {{most important of}} these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor, a man who would remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E

5|$|The Bodleian Libraries {{group was}} formed in 2000, {{bringing}} the Bodleian Library {{and some of the}} subject libraries together. It now comprises 28 libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library. Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF planned four area {{commands}} initially: Southern Area, <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> {{units in}} Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia {{and the southern}} Riverina district of New South Wales; Central Area, covering units in New South Wales except southern Riverina and {{the north of the}} state; Western Area, covering units in Western Australia; and Northern Area, covering units in northern New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua. The first two commands established, in March 1940, were Southern Area, which essentially took over the role and headquarters of No.1 Group in Melbourne, and Central Area, which evolved from No.2 Group in Sydney. Western and Northern Areas eventually followed in January and May 1941, respectively; pending their formation, units in Queensland were temporarily controlled by Central Area Command, and those in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Papua came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The schoolboys {{sections}} of Shamrock Rovers and Tallaght Town merged in 1997 {{to form a}} new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin. Tallaght Town initially remained in operation with three intermediate teams participating in the Leinster Senior League. Two of these teams continue to compete, but under the name of Shamrock Rovers. Tallaght Town exists as a limited company and as trustee of a training facility used by the youth teams at Shamrock Rovers. There are sixteen of these teams, composed of over 200 players and 35 managers and coaches. They cater for players in the six to nineteen years of age group. The club's youth teams have participated in the Milk Cup and Dallas Cup. The club operates scholarships <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> levels of education.

5|$|The {{series of}} events that caused Kean to change the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion had the advantage of calling for protective artillery fire <b>covering</b> <b>all</b> approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also had the advantage of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
