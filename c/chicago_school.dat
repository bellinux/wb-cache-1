5|$|University of Chicago {{scholars}} {{have played a}} major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including: the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics; the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of literary criticism; the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.|$|E

During his six-year tenure, foreign {{investment}} increased, restrictions {{were placed on}} striking and labor unions, and GDP rose yearly. A foreign exchange program was created between the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chicago. Many other <b>Chicago</b> <b>School</b> alumni were appointed government posts {{during and after the}} Pinochet years; others taught its economic doctrine at Chilean universities. They became known as the Chicago Boys.|$|E

5|$|The University of Chicago {{has been}} the site of some {{important}} experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has {{played an important role}} in shaping ideas about the free market and is the namesake of the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of sociology. In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled, self-sustaining man-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron, and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM sleep was discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.|$|E
5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career.

5|$|In 1946, Friedman {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} teach economic theory at the University of Chicago (a position opened by departure of his former professor Jacob Viner to Princeton University).

5|$|In 1995, the Illinois state {{legislature}} passed the <b>Chicago</b> <b>School</b> Reform Act, {{which gave the}} Mayor of Chicago unprecedented new control over Chicago Public Schools.

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E

5|$|The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{established}} {{the first major}} American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders {{in the development of}} pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> economists like Milton Friedman, James M.

5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} runs {{a number}} of academic institutions and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools. It operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and day care), the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems), and a public charter school with four campuses on the South Side of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute. In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school {{for students with learning}} disabilities, maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University of <b>Chicago</b> <b>School</b> Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools.
