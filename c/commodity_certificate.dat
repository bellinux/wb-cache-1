40|$|This report {{discusses}} U. S. policy regard farm commodities. Greater {{public awareness}} of the size of commodity program payments reaching a comparatively small number of very large farms has focused the attention of Congress on payment limits. Limits on commodity program payments have been imposed since 1970. As part of the emergency economic assistance packages enacted each of the past three years, the payment limits have been doubled. In addition, a mechanism has been developed that allows farms to circumvent the limit on loan deficiency payments, namely <b>commodity</b> <b>certificate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The long-running {{controversy}} over whether <b>commodity</b> <b>certificate</b> gains {{should be the}} subject of information reporting 1 was resolved on July 24, 2007, with issuance of Notice 2007 - 63. 2 That move by the Internal Revenue Service placed all four methods of paying marketing loan benefits (loan deficiency payments, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans repaid with cash, CCC loans repaid with generic commodity certificates and forfeiture of commodities to CCC under non-recourse loans) under the federal commodity subsidy program 3 on the same footing insofar as information reporting is concerned. ...|$|E

25|$|Partially {{with the}} help of the China Aid Act of 1948 and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, the Republic of China {{government}} implemented a far-reaching and highly successful land reform program on Taiwan during the 1950s. They redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with <b>commodities</b> <b>certificates</b> and stock in state-owned industries. These rural reforms, such as the 375 rent reduction program, were never implemented with much force in mainland China but were very successful in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The CCC, {{which has}} no staff, is {{essentially}} a financing institution for USDA’s farm price and income support commodity programs, commodity export credit guarantees, and agricultural export subsidies. The programs funded through CCC are administered by employees of the Farm Service Agency and the Foreign Agricultural Service. The CCC {{has the authority to}} borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to carry out its obligations. Net losses from its operations subsequently are restored through the congressional appropriations process. It issues payments in the form of <b>Commodity</b> <b>Certificates.</b>|$|R

40|$|The 2002 {{farm bill}} {{has been criticized}} from day one. Freetrade advocates criticized the {{significant}} increase in domestic subsidies for U. S. farmers {{at a time when}} the rest of the world was seemingly moving toward more liberalized production and trade. Small-farm advocates criticized the ability of large farms to bypass payment limitations through the use of <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates.</b> Conservation advocates thought they had accomplished a major feat with the Conservation Security Program, but implementation rules and subsequent funding cuts have shown that the program will have little short-term impact. And rural development advocates criticized the bill for its continued focus on supporting commodities rather than rural income enhancement...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Marketing Assistance Loan Program, the federal government accepts harvested crops as collateral for interest-bearing loans (marketing assistance loans) that are typically due in nine months. When market prices drop below the loan rate (the loan price per pound or bushel), the government allows farmers to repay the loan at a lower rate and retain ownership of their commodity for eventual sale. The difference between the loan rate and the lower repayment rate is called the "marketing loan gain. " Conversely, farmers {{who do not have}} marketing assistance loans can also receive a benefit when prices are low called a "loan deficiency payment. " The loan deficiency payment is equal to the marketing loan gain that the farmer would have received if he or she had a loan. Farmers may choose to obtain either a marketing loan gain or a loan deficiency payment [...] both of which are known as the marketing loan benefit. The increase in the payment limit and the availability of <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates</b> had only modest effects on the $ 15 billion in marketing assistance loan payments provided for crop year 1999 and for crop year 2000 through May 2001. Because of the increase in the payment limit, total payments over the two-year period were 1. 9 percent more than they would have been under the previous limit, or an additional $ 261. 1 million. Most farmers did not use <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates</b> to receive gains more than the payment limit, but a small number of farmers did benefit from the program. According to the best available data from USDA's county offices, 47 farmers used certificates to receive more than $ 150, 000 in 1999, and 100 farmers did so in 2000. ...|$|R

S. cotton subsidies such as marketing loans, export credits, <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates,</b> direct payments and counter cyclical payments are depressing world prices and are injurious to Brazilian farmers. In addition, the West and Central African Countries (WCA) countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad have filed a petition with the WTO claiming that they are losing export earnings of 1 billion dollar {{a year as a}} result of subsidies by the United States and the European Union (BBMC, 2003). For WCA countries, both production and export of cotton have increased in the last decade but export revenues have declined during the same period due to lower prices.

50|$|The {{limit on}} {{marketing}} assistance loan gains and loan deficiency payments for loan commodities is $75,000 {{per person per}} year (this limit applies separately to wool, mohair, honey and peanuts). Farmers {{are not subject to}} any limits on the use of <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates</b> to repay marketing assistance loans. The Conservation Reserve Program has a limit of $50,000 per person per year, the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) limits total payments to $450,000 to any participating producer, and the Conservation Security Program has annual payment limits {{for each of the three}} alternative levels of participation. Section 1604 of the Act imposes a prohibition on making commodity payments or conservation payments to individuals or entities that have 3-year average adjusted gross incomes exceeding $2.5 million (unless 75% or more of the income is from farming, ranching, or forestry).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study has}} {{critically}} examined {{the issue of}} Cotton subsidies in USA as well made a comparative analysis of cotton sector between USA and India {{in the background of}} USA claim that African cotton producers’ plight was not due to the trade-distorting subsidies of USA but was on account of upward trend in cotton production in India and China in defiance of market signals. This study also estimated the comparative advantage in cotton production and cotton export diversification by calculation various indicators. Result shows that India has comparative advantage in production and export of cotton in recent years. This study highlights that USA has 14 percent share in world production, however, its share in world export is 38 percent. USA exports 86 percent of cotton production to other countries. The cost of producing cotton is highest in USA, which is 4. 5 to 6 times higher than India. During 1995 - 2010, USA has given about $ 37 billion to cotton producers though various programmes like counter-cyclical payments, decoupled income, <b>commodity</b> <b>certificates</b> etc. Despite high cost of cotton production, USA is enjoying artificial comparative advantage in cotton market due to high level of domestic support given to farmers and big corporation in USA...|$|R
40|$|This work envisages {{minimizing}} many shortcomings including associated {{delays in}} the cargo clearance process when the import and export certificate which is legally known as license/permit become applicable. Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a sample of 100 importers and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain <b>commodities</b> require <b>certificates</b> from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system. Proposed e-Certificate system will not only expedite the clearance process but also will prevent the certificates being misused. Much superior controls could be implemented as online information will be available for all regulatory agencies. Main goal of the proposal is to eliminate paper requirement and pave the way for paperless trade in Sri Lanka...|$|R
