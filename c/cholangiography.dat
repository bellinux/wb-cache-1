5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic <b>cholangiography</b> (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

50|$|Percutaneous transhepatic <b>cholangiography</b> (PTHC or PTC) or {{percutaneous}} hepatic cholangiogram is a radiologic {{technique used}} {{to visualize the}} anatomy of the biliary tract. A contrast medium is injected into a bile duct in the liver, after which X-rays are taken. It allows access to the biliary tree in cases where endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been unsuccessful. Initially reported in 1937, the procedure became popular in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, a cholangiogram {{would be}} {{obtained}} via {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP), which typically reveals [...] "beading" [...] (alternating strictures and dilation) of the bile ducts inside and/or outside the liver. Currently, the preferred option for diagnostic <b>cholangiography,</b> given its non-invasive yet highly accurate nature, is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), a magnetic resonance imaging technique. MRCP has unique strengths, including high spatial resolution, and can even be used to visualize the biliary tract of small animal models of PSC.|$|E
50|$|The IVC is {{not used}} as much today as it was.

50|$|It may be {{difficult}} to obtain endoscopic access to the obstruction located higher (proximal) up in the biliary system, or when it is due to a stricture in the priorly performed anastomosis between the bile duct (surgically joining) with the duodenum or jejunum. When this happens, percutaneous transhepatic <b>cholangiography</b> (PTC) may be needed to relieve pressure. This involves identifying the bile duct by ultrasound and then passing a tube through the skin (percutaneous). PTC is generally performed by radiologists. PTC has potential complications, so occasionally further attempts at ERCP by more experienced doctors are preferred.|$|E

The drain can be placed percutaneously through the liver, with the procedure then being called percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). This can additionally be performed as part of a percutaneous transhepatic <b>cholangiography,</b> then a form of interventional radiology. A biliary drain {{can also be used to}} take bile samples for diagnostic workup or disease monitoring, as well as providing a route of administration for medical substances.|$|E

5000|$|Modern imaging {{techniques}} allow the diagnosis {{to be made}} more easily and without invasive imaging of the biliary tree. [...] Commonly, the disease {{is limited to the}} left lobe of the liver. Images taken by CT scan, X-ray, or MRI show enlarged intrahepatic (in the liver) bile ducts due to ectasia. Using an ultrasound, tubular dilation of the bile ducts can be seen. On a CT scan, Caroli disease can be observed by noting the many fluid-filled, tubular structures extending to the liver. A high-contrast CT must be used to distinguish the difference between stones and widened ducts. Bowel gas and digestive habits make it difficult to obtain a clear sonogram, so a CT scan is a good substitution. When the intrahepatic bile duct wall has protrusions, it is clearly seen as central dots or a linear streak. Caroli disease is commonly diagnosed after this “central dot sign” is detected on a CT scan or ultrasound. However, <b>cholangiography</b> is the best, and final, approach to show the enlarged bile ducts as a result of Caroli disease.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic {{resonance}} <b>cholangiography</b> is a {{new technique}} which has already gained a role in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> is another non-invasive technique which {{has been used in}} assessing abnormal biliary tree, but has never been applied to evaluating primary sclerosing cholangitis. AIMS: To evaluate the ability of both magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography</b> and computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> to detect bile duct changes in primary sclerosing cholangitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography</b> and computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> were performed in 16 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. The computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> data set was transferred to a processing workstation to obtain tridimensional reconstructions. Magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography</b> and computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> images were analysed blind by two radiologists to assess: primary sclerosing cholangitis involvement, quality of imaging and the radiologist's certainty in determining the presence and location of the disease. RESULTS: Mean imaging quality was significantly better with computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> compared with magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography.</b> Primary sclerosing cholangitis was identified in 15 cases with computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> and 10 with magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography</b> (P < 0. 05). Sensitivity in diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis was 94 % with computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> versus 63 % with magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography.</b> Intrahepatic location was found in 14 cases, definitely present in 10 cases with computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> and five with magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography.</b> Extrahepatic location was found in 13 cases, definitely present in 11 cases with computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> and four with magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography</b> (P < 0. 05). Computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> also offered dynamic information about biliary excretion. CONCLUSIONS: Computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> enables more accurate detection and location of primary sclerosing cholangitis than magnetic resonance <b>cholangiography.</b> Since computerised tomographic <b>cholangiography</b> offers additional information about biliary excretion, it may be proposed as an integrative technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonography, {{although}} an accurate method of detecting stones within the gall bladder, is unreliable {{for the detection}} of bile duct stones for which per-operative <b>cholangiography</b> remains the standard investigation. Fifty seven patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy had both a pre-operative intravenous cholangiogram and per-operative <b>cholangiography.</b> The pre-operative investigation is shown to be at least as effective in the detection of common bile duct stones and only missed a duct stone in one patient. The substitution of pre-operative intravenous <b>cholangiography</b> for routine per-operative <b>cholangiography</b> would result in a significant reduction in operating time, may provide advance knowledge on the biliary anatomy and would allow advance planning of the likely procedure.

40|$|Background and Objective: Despite the {{numerous}} and often cited benefits of routine <b>cholangiography</b> during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, universal {{application of this}} technique has not been realized. Surgeons who advocate selective <b>cholangiography</b> cite the extra cost, the low yield of unanticipated findings, and the marked increase in {{the duration of the}} operation when <b>cholangiography</b> is added to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We present our experience with preview <b>cholangiography</b> and compare it with the transcystic-duct approach. Methods: We attempted preview cholangiograms on 11 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Successful <b>cholangiography</b> was determined by using established radiologic criteria. Results: Preview cholangiogram was successful in all 11 patients. No complications occurred. The average time required was 110 seconds. The mean operating time was 52 minutes. These times are far better than our best accomplishments using the cystic duct cannulation method for <b>cholangiography</b> (mean cholangiogram time, 22 minutes, and mean operative time, 75 minutes) following the first 100 cases. Conclusions: Preview <b>cholangiography</b> is a safe, relatively easy, quick method for outlining the anatomy of the extrahepatic biliary tree prior to dissection necessary to remove the gallbladder with laparoscopic techniques. The ease of this approach should result in more widespread use of <b>cholangiography</b> during laparoscopic cholecystectomy...|$|E

40|$|Background Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dreaded {{complication}} of cholecystectomy, often caused by misinterpretation of biliary anatomy. To prevent BDI, techniques {{have been developed}} for intraoperative assessment of bile duct anatomy. This article reviews the evidence for the different techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in terms of efficacy, ease, and cost-effectiveness. Method PubMed was searched from January 1980 through December 2009 for articles concerning bile duct visualization techniques for prevention of BDI during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Results Nine techniques were identified. The critical-view-of-safety approach, indirectly establishing biliary anatomy, is accepted by most guidelines and commentaries as the surgical technique of choice to minimize BDI risk. Intraoperative <b>cholangiography</b> is associated with lower BDI risk (OR 0. 67, CI 0. 61 - 0. 75). However, it incurs extra costs, prolongs the operative procedure, and may be experienced as cumbersome. An established reliable alternative is laparoscopic ultrasound, but its longer learning curve limits widespread implementation. Easier to perform are cholecystocholangiography and dye <b>cholangiography,</b> but these yield poor-quality images. Light <b>cholangiography,</b> requiring retrograde insertion of an optical fiber into the common bile duct, is too unwieldy for routine use. Experimental techniques are passive infrared <b>cholangiography,</b> hyperspectral <b>cholangiography,</b> and near-infrared fluorescence <b>cholangiography.</b> The latter two are performed noninvasively and provide real-time images. Quantitative data in patients are necessary to further evaluate these techniques. Conclusions The critical-view-of-safety approach should be used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperative <b>cholangiography</b> or laparoscopic ultrasound is recommended to be performed routinely. Hyperspectral <b>cholangiography</b> and near-infrared fluorescence <b>cholangiography</b> are promising novel techniques to prevent BDI and thus increase patient safety...|$|E

False-positive studies occurred in 3 of 150 (2 %) total cholangiograms and 3 of 12 (25 %) abnormal cholangiograms consistent with choledocholithiasis. A total of 16 of 364 patients had proven common bile duct stones (4. 4 %). Eight of the sixteen stones were removed by preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/sphincterotomy.

Grey-scale ultrasonography distinguished between obstructive and hepatocellular jaundice in 35 out of 46 patients (76 %) and indicated {{the site of the}} obstruction in 27 (58 %) and the cause of the obstruction in 13 (28 %). Percutaneous transhepatic <b>cholangiography</b> distinguished between obstructive and hepatocellular jaundice in 42 of the patients (91 %) and indicated the site of the obstruction in 42 (91 %) and the cause in 29 (63 %).
