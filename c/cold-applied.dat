50|$|Modified Bitumen - This type of roofing is an {{evolution}} of asphalt roofing. It {{is made from}} asphalt {{and a variety of}} rubber modifiers and solvents. There are several ways of connecting pieces of this material. In a heat application process the seams are heated to melt the asphalt together and create a seal. There is also hot-mopped application, similar to how conventional built-up roofs are installed. <b>Cold-applied</b> adhesives and self-adhesive membranes are two of the more recent options. This material is also referred to as APP, SBS, and SEBS.|$|E
40|$|Concern about {{premature}} {{joint sealant}} failures occurring in portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements gave impetus to initiating this research project. Eight sealants, including three silicone sealants, were evaluated and {{tested in the}} lab as well as incorporated in approximately 700 joints {{in the field and}} evaluated over a six-year period. The preliminary data show that among the silicone sealants, Dow Corning 888 rated the highest. However, this was rated third overall behind the W. R. Meadows <b>cold-applied</b> Sof Seal and Crafco # 231 hot pour sealants. The W. R. Meadows and Crafco sealants cost approximately 30 percent and 50 percent less to furnish and place than the Dow Corning product. All joint sealants will continue to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In the roofing industry, {{modified}} bitumen membranes {{are generally}} applied by torching {{with an open}} flame or mopping with hot bitumen or asphalt and cold adhesive. These methods can ensure a strong and watertight seam of overlapping membranes. However, mopping creates health and odor concerns while torching carries the risk of fire. Use of <b>cold-applied,</b> solvent-based adhesives is growing rapidly {{but there are still}} limitations associated with volatile organic compound (VOC) issues and longer curing times than torched or mopped systems. A growing demand for self-adhesive roof membranes, driven in part by insurance companies and legislation to increase the safety of the installation workers, stimulates the development of suitable formulations to improve the quality and expand the scope of these products. Although there are regional differences, premium self-adhesive roofing compounds are generally composed of multiple ingredients: bitumen/asphalt, a mixture of SBS and SIS block copolymers, SB di-block polymer, tackifying resin, naphthenic oil, oxidise...|$|E
30|$|Current {{observations}} also {{inform the}} discussion regarding the lamp’s production date, {{as well as}} the relationship of the foot {{to the rest of the}} vessel. The double pontil mark visible on the base of this lamp is characteristic of vessels reintroduced into the furnace on a pontil rod to fuse gilding and enamels, a technology consistent with Mamluk production, as opposed to kiln-firing of enamels, a technique not practiced until the 19 th century [19]. Although both edges have been partially ground down, the broken edges of the body do not meet or match those of the foot; the diameter of the body’s broken edge fits entirely within that of the foot. As compared to other Mamluk era lamps, the foot seems disproportionate to the body. Additionally as opposed to the enamels decorating the lamp’s body, red and gold-colored paints, <b>cold-applied</b> and unfired, decorate the top edge of the foot, perhaps an attempt to visually integrate these two sections of the object and to cover an adhesive repair. The date of the paint application is, however, unknown.|$|E
40|$|It is {{critical}} to identify the low temperature properties of different asphalt crack sealants to achieve long lasting performance. The current test methods, as outlined in ASTM International D 5329, do not provide {{an effective way to}} correlate field performance to test results. The Direct Tension Tester (DTT) is a Superpave instrument designed to study the low temperature properties of asphalt binders. The DTT consists of elongating asphalt binders and studying its failure mechanisms. In this study, the DTT is used to study the thermally induced stress for different asphalt crack sealants when the temperature decreases from 5 °C to- 30 °C. Both hot and <b>cold-applied</b> asphalt crack sealants are included in this study. Similar to the Thermal Stress Retained Specimen Test (TSRST), with the ends of specimen restrained, the tensile stress due to thermal contraction of different asphalt sealants is plotted versus temperature. Results indicate that the thermal stress can be used to differentiate the bonding capability for different asphalt crack sealants. The tensile stress and strain at- 29 °C for different asphalt crack sealants are also measured. The comparison shows that the DTT can be used to classify asphalt crack sealant based on their low temperature property. RÉSUM...|$|E
