40|$|<b>Cash</b> flow <b>management</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} determinants of the success of construction project management. Overdraft, retainage, financing, payment and billing policies constitute the most significant financial issues that contractors must plan, control and manage for the successful completion of construction jobs. Particularly, in an attempt to reduce project costs, contractors must balance cost savings of material discounts due to early payments and extra interest expenses because of additional overdraft. Through identifying feedback loops in project cash flows, a system dynamics model is developed for project <b>cash</b> flow <b>management.</b> The model is flexible to incorporate typical front-end and back-end loading <b>cash</b> flow <b>management</b> strategies and provides an interactive predication of project cash flows. A warehouse project is discussed to demonstrate how various cash flow strategies improve overdraft financing requirements and profitability.

Different changes to the basic structure of the model allow and establish the consistency of the results. Alternative formulations are suggested to deal with uncertainties, longer planning horizons, and multiple subcontractors and suppliers. In addition to the tangible financial earnings derived from the optimization process, the simple structure of the model, as a network flow and corresponding equations, provides much visual insight concerning the relationships between the external inputs and the variables of the problem.
