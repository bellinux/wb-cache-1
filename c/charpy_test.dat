40|$|Abstract. Instrumented <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> {{method is}} {{possible}} to obtain various dynamic fracture characteristics from the load-deflection or load-time curve. Recently, instrumented <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method is widely used {{for the evaluation of}} toughness of various specimens of different materials with different sizes. It is important to record an accurate impact load in order to improve the reliability of this test method. In some standards of instrumented <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method such as ISO and ASTM, they havent clearly standardized striker geometry which seem to directly influence the obtained impact load. There are some differences between standards, although standard procedures are well defined. Therefore, instrumented <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method has a problem that measurement value is different depending on each standard. In the present study, the effect of striking edge geometries, which are difference between ISO and ASTM, on load-deflection curve and absorbed energy were investigated. According to ISO and ASTM, two types of striker having different radius were machined. There was no difference between the two different striking edge geometries for values of absorbed energy per unit ligament area less than 0. 75 J/mm 2. However, striking edge geometry according to ASTM is not propriety for <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method because of four, instead of three, point bending on process of fracture at high level of absorbed energy. The effect of brinelling deformation, which was considered as an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM, is very small on instrumented <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test.</b> Consequently, there seem to be not an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM. Therefore, standards should be unified in the striking edge geometry according to ISO...|$|R

Further, differences of the impact response curves obtained by an instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>test</b> and the one-point bend test are compared and discussed. The results of this study are summarized as follows. (1) The vibrational wave can be prevented by using a small specimen which shortens the period of the vibrational wave.

The <b>Charpy</b> <b>test</b> is simulated using a full 3 D mesh and accounting for adiabatic heating and contact between the specimen, the striker and the anvil. The developed model is well suited to represent ductile tearing. Using brittle failure parameters identified below − 150 °C, it is possible to represent the transition curve up to − 80 °C assuming that the Beremin stress parameter σu is independent of temperature. Above this temperature, a temperature dependent Beremin stress parameter, σu, must be used to correctly simulate the transition curve.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of bulk Sn, Sn-Cu, Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu lead-free solders was measured as {{function of the}} temperature {{by means of a}} pendulum impact test (<b>Charpy</b> <b>test).</b> A ductile to brittle fracture transition was found for them, i. e. a sharp change in their {{fracture toughness}}, compared to no transition for the eutectic Sn-Pb. The transition temperature of high purity Sn, Sn- 0. 5 %Cu and Sn- 0. 5 %Cu(Ni) alloys is around- 125 °C. The Ag-containing solders show a transition at higher temperatures: in the range of – 78 ° to– 45 °C. The highest transition temperature of – 45 °C was measured for Sn- 5 %Ag, which is ductile only above – 30 °C. The increase of the Ag content shifts the transformation temperature towards higher values, which can probably be related to the higher volume fraction of SnAg 3 particles in the solder volume. These result are believed to be very important for the selection of the best lead-free solder composition.

40|$|Control of ductile {{fracture}} propagation {{is one of}} the major concerns for pipeline industry, particularly with the increasing demand of new control rolled steel grades required to maintain integrity at high operational pressures. The objective of this research is to understand which microstructural features govern crack propagation, and to analyse the effect of two of them (average grain size, and volume fraction of pearlite). The main disadvantage during classical <b>Charpy</b> <b>test</b> was to discriminate the crack initiation and propagation energy during fracture of a notched sample. The initiation appears to be caused by the stress state in the neighbouring of Ti-containing precipitates or pearlite particles (no presence of M/A constituents or MnS inclusions was detected in the evaluated grades), propagation-arrest of the crack is assumed to play the main role concerning the control of fracture. Our approach to characterize the fracture resistance is to measure the energy absorbed during the crack propagation stage by means of load-displacement curves obtained via instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>test.</b> It was observed that the energy absorbed during crack propagation is not influenced by the average grain size but by the fraction and the morphological (banded-not banded) distribution of second pearlitic phase. This suggests that a different approach to characterize the heterogeneities in grain size clustering might be followed to correlate the energy measured during crack propagation and the morphological features of the steel...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of natural fibres such as bamboo, jute, banana, coir, linen {{and the like}} in Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites have become so vital due to their high effective stiffness and strength, availability, low cost, specific strength, better dimensional stability and mechanical properties, eco-friendly and biodegradable as compared with synthetic fibres. The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such composites are a proof to this claim.
