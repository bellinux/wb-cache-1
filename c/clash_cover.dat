Erickson did not question Soviet claims regarding German casualties, and Glantz questioned the veracity of German claims regarding the total of escapees from the pocket. Glantz has also translated the Soviet General Staff Study on the Korsun Operation into English as The Battle for the Ukraine: The Red Army's Korsun'-Shevchenkovkii Operation, 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Toots and the Maytals' {{compositions}} {{experienced a}} resurgence of popularity in 1978-80 during the reggae punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials covered [...] "Monkey Man" [...] on their 1979 debut album and the <b>Clash</b> <b>covered</b> the group's hit [...] "Pressure Drop". During this period Toots and the Maytals were {{also included in the}} lyrics to Bob Marley & the Wailers song, [...] "Punky Reggae Party": [...] "The Wailers will be there, the Damned, the Jam, the Clash, the Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too".|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Clash's</b> <b>cover</b> of Sonny Curtis' [...] "I Fought the Law" [...] {{became one}} of the {{definitive}} recordings of the song, and remained in the band's live set list for {{much of the rest of}} their career. Joe Strummer also performed it with his later bands, including during his stint with The Pogues. The early single [...] "Capital Radio" [...] was re-recorded because the band learned that copies of the original Capital Radio EP were selling for high prices. [...] "Capital Radio", later listed as [...] "Capital Radio Two", is much longer, mainly because of a protracted outro.|$|R
50|$|Although The Clash: Westway to the World ostensibly {{provides}} an overview of the band's history, the film implies that The Clash broke up in 1983 when Mick Jones left the band, making no mention of the post-Jones version of the band that existed between 1983 and 1986, nor the album that iteration produced (Cut the Crap). Danny Garcia's 2012 documentary film The Rise and Fall of The <b>Clash</b> <b>covers</b> this period in some depth, placing an emphasis on the band's declining years and the repercussions of Mick Jones' ouster. Garcia's film also features interviews with latter-day Clash members Pete Howard, Nick Sheppard, and Vince White.|$|R

[...] Contrary to the lyrics biographer Brian Hinton argues that Taylor was, in fact, widely known. He comments that [...] "David Bowies Ziggy Stardust was based on him, The <b>Clash</b> <b>covered</b> his near-hit Brand New Cadillac, and he recently appeared (2000) as one of Mojos 100 essential cult heroes." [...] Morrisons concert performances {{of the song}} usually include a section of Taylors [...] "Brand New Cadillac", starting off as a slow twelve-bar blues for the [...] "Goin Down Geneva" [...] section and the pace immediately quickens for [...] "Brand New Cadillac". In late 1999 and 2000 the medley also included Bob Dylans [...] "Rainy Day Women#12 & 35".|$|R

The song was fused with The <b>Clash's</b> <b>cover</b> of [...] "Brand New Cadillac". American musician Shawn Lee covered the song in the album Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra (2007). French-Israeli singer-songwriter Yael Naïm released a piano-driven version of the song in her eponymous debut album (2007). British electronic music group Metronomy's cover was described as [...] "something out of a [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic polka medley, only not kidding".

5000|$|The {{national}} student sit-in movement {{began with}} the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina several months later. Although initiated as a nonviolent campaign which would not respond to white violence, in some locations, including Portsmouth Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee, blacks forcefully defended themselves against assaults. Robert F. Williams led a successful sit-in campaign in Monroe where, he reported, no racists dared to attack his group because it was well-known his use of nonviolence was strictly conditional. In Jacksonville, Florida, the local NAACP made preparations to defend nonviolent activists by enlisting a local street gang to respond to any attacks. This led to a city-wide <b>clash</b> <b>covered</b> nationally as [...] "Axe-handle Saturday" [...] where dozens of blacks and whites were injured in August 1960. Lunch counters were desegregated in Jacksonville and many other sites of protest in the following months. Doug McAdam cited [...] "Axe-handle Saturday" [...] {{as an example of}} the specter of violent crisis that loomed over lunch counter sit-ins generally, finding that the threat of escalating chaos pressured authorities to make concessions.|$|R
5000|$|... "Train in Vain" [...] {{has become}} an {{influential}} and well-known <b>Clash</b> song, <b>covered</b> by artists {{as diverse as the}} British indie dance band EMF, the Brazilian rock band Ira! on their acoustic special for MTV Brasil in 2004, where the song was titled [...] "Pra ficar comigo", the blues-oriented hard rock jam band The Black Crowes, the Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, or the Swedish indie rock band Shout Out Louds.|$|R

5000|$|According to the book, I & I: The Natural Mystics: Marley, Tosh and Wailer by Colin Grant, {{the band}} was {{not happy with the}} [...] "soft porn" [...] look of the album <b>cover,</b> <b>clashing</b> as it did with their sensibilities, and were upset that they weren't {{consulted}} on its look.|$|R
5000|$|In a very {{favourable}} review, Wilson Neate of Westnet {{said that}} [...] "during its finest moments, Modern {{reminds us that}} the Buzzcocks' significant contributions are often unfairly overshadowed by a tendency to {{look no further than}} the Sex Pistols or The Clash for a blueprint of British punk. The Pistols wrote the book on punk-as-situation / style / shock, while the <b>Clash</b> <b>covered</b> the political angle, but the Buzzcocks (along with Wire) took punk beyond the gesture and the pose and left perhaps the most substantial and enduring musical legacy." [...] He concluded [...] "so, to plagiarize a question asked by Pete Shelley quite a few years ago, [...] "what do I get" [...] from Modern? Quite a lot actually. During its best moments--"Soul on a Rock", Rendezvous," [...] "Runaround," [...] "Choices," [...] "Why Compromise" [...] and [...] "Under the Sun"-- this album is vintage Buzzcocks. And what more could you ask for?" [...] Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club, on the other hand, wrote [...] "the band reunited in time to ride the new punk wave, but something was missing from its two capable comeback albums. The new Modern is something else entirely: Essentially picking up where the band left off in 1981, the ironically-titled disc sounds like it was recorded just as punk turned into new wave", calling it [...] "retro in the best sense".|$|R
2500|$|In January 2003, the Clash were {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the Grammy Awards in February 2003, [...] "London Calling" [...] was performed by Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, Dave Grohl, Pete Thomas, and Tony Kanal in tribute to Strummer. Another tribute to Strummer occurred in the same month at the rock club Debaser in Stockholm, when some of Sweden's most famous rock musicians paid their tribute to Strummer by performing songs written by the Clash (the exception was Nicke Borg and Dregen from Backyard Babies, who performed [...] "I Fought the Law", which the <b>Clash</b> had <b>covered).</b> At {{the end of the}} concert, the Swedish punk band Ebba Grön reunited for the tribute, aided by Mick Jones on guitar.|$|R
40|$|A small {{fraction}} of the atomic-cooling halos assembling at z< 15 may form out of minihalos that never experienced any prior star formation, and could in principle host small galaxies of chemically unenriched stars. Since the prospects of detecting isolated population III stars appear bleak even with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), these population III galaxies may offer one of the best probes of population III stars in the foreseeable future. By projecting the results from population III galaxy simulations through cluster magnification maps, we predict the fluxes and surface number densities of pop III galaxy galaxies as a function of their typical star formation efficiency. We argue that a small number of lensed population III galaxies in principle could turn up at z= 7 - 10 in the ongoing Hubble Space Telescope survey <b>CLASH,</b> which <b>covers</b> a total of 25 low-redshift galaxy clusters.

2500|$|When the 1968 Democratic National Convention {{opened in}} Chicago, {{thousands}} of young activists from around the nation gathered {{in the city to}} protest the Vietnam War. On the evening of August 28, in a <b>clash</b> which was <b>covered</b> on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted [...] "the whole world is watching", the police used clubs and tear gas to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled verbal insults at the police, calling them [...] "pigs" [...] and other epithets. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator Abraham Ribicoff from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.|$|R
