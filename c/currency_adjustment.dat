This article focuses on capital mobility, highlighted through foreign direct investment (FDI). The determinants of intra-European FDI and their impact on country specialisation are successively considered, discerning counterbalancing and agglomeration factors. We show that such as geographic proximity, trade links and market potential contributed to FDI concentration in core countries while FDI facilitate industrial diversification in host countries. As economic integration progress, Europe moves from a product-based industrial specialisation to a more vertical specialisation based on quality differences and technological levels. The more advanced countries get more and more specialised in high-quality and technology intensive goods while peripheral countries remain dependent from low-tech and low quality products. In the same time, spatial concentration of labour-intensive industries has increased. FDI; polarisation; specialisation; IDE; polarisation; spécialisation...|$|E

Within the hour adjustment is sufficiently quick to be considered efficient but the lack of full adjustment to fundamental value is not what would be predicted within an efficient market.

Moreover, these analyses also convert total returns into their fundamental components: initial yield, growth in income, and shifts in capitalization rates. The paths of currency-adjusted income and asset values and, therefore, capitalization rates are also presented. Generally speaking, the fundamental components of retail returns across the four countries exhibit greater divergence than the office and warehouse sectors. It is interesting that the U. S. property sectors showed the worst performance, while the Australian retail and the British office and warehouse sectors were the best performers (both before and after <b>currency</b> <b>adjustments).</b> Additionally, the currency-adjusted Australian returns were adversely effected by exchange rate movements, while the British returns were positively effected. Lastly, the correlation of the quarterly percentage change in income was generally lower and less statistically significant that the correlation patterns observed among the other components of return. This might suggest that more idiosyncratic risk can be found in the real estate space markets (as proxied by income changes) than in the real estate capital markets (as proxied by the pricing of the income [...] that is, capitalization rates), which appear to be more globally influenced. ...|$|R

The costs of widening a currency area, in turn, are seen as a drop in the speed of adjustment of the terms of trade to their long-run equilibrium level. On this basis it is shown that the marginal benefits of enlarging a currency area fall, the marginal costs rise, and an optimum size arises. This size depends heavily on the optimal composition of the members, however. Exchange Rate Regime; International Trade; Optimum <b>Currency</b> Area; Trade <b>Adjustment...</b>|$|R

Real export growth, declining investment, and an eventual leveling off in both the net international investment position and the budget deficit-GDP ratio are also likely {{to be part of the}} adjustment.

This study examines a premature aspect of FCTA literature by examining how a firm’s degree of foreign exposure (measured by foreign sales revenue; foreign income (sales revenue plus other income); foreign total assets; foreign non-current and number of foreign segments) may affect the value relevance of FCTAs. Most recently, on the 18 July 2013 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a Discussion Paper {{on the topic of}} reviewing the Conceptual Framework. Despite the fact that the Conceptual Framework does not cover CI, the IASB has raised a specific interest in whether the presentation of information matters, which is precisely one of the issues examined within this study – whether the value relevance of FCTAs are different when presented in the Statement of Changes in Equity and/or notes, of in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. This is the first study conducted from the Australian perspective. The results reveal that there is inconsistent evidence as to whether FCTAs are value relevant for the sample and time period examined. FCTAs are negatively however insignificantly associated with share price in the pooled regression (2006 to 2012). The results support the hypothesis that FCTAs are value relevant when presented on the SCI, due to the more salient display of the FCTA figure. There is limited evidence supporting the hypothesis that FCTAs are more value relevance for firms when higher foreign exposure as measured by the various proxies...|$|R

The main contribution {{of this paper}} is to characterize price adjustment costs that are consistent with the observed price dynamics in the autocorrelated and heterogeneous European car market. Using the methodology developed by Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I found three main results for the estimated cost structure. First, I rationalize the incomplete degree of exchange rate pass-through with destination-currency costs of a third of total costs. Second, there is no need for large price adjustment costs to rationalize the large degree of price inertia. Intuitively, in a highly autocorrelated economic environment a small adjustment costs can rationalize the persistent prices observed. Third, my estimates of price adjustment cost seem to be producer-destination specific since a uniform cost structure is not consistent with the pricing behavior observed whilst accounting for different sources of heterogeneity. Hence I identify an unexplored temporal dimension of “pricing-to-market” behavior, which is the practice of setting prices differently across segmented markets...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we take a}} look at {{the rise}} of interest rate basis spreads in the market following the liquidity and credit crunch of 2008. We show that post 2008 the valuation of all interest rate instruments of a single yield curve for a particular currency is no longer a feasible approach and the assumption of no arbitrage between di erent tenors is no longer applicable. Following that a closer look is taken into the cause of such widening basis spreads and the impact they have had on the market with a focus on reconstituting the no arbitrage argument and looking at a post crisis multiple curve framework following an axiomatic approach as introduced by Henrard [37] and further explored by Bianchetti and Morini [6, 50]. A bottom-up market approach is taken by Ametrano [2] and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent in result. An analogy is made to quanto style cross <b>currency</b> swap <b>adjustments</b> observed by the aforementioned authors as well as Michaud and Upper [47], and Tuckman and Por rio [57]. We proceed to look at the approaches taken by authors such as Henrard [36, 37] in ex- tending the Black and Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho models to include basis spreads and Kijima et al. [42] who extend a model introduced by Boenkost and Schmidt [11] and put forward a quadratic Gaussian model and a Vasicek model. Mercurio [46] puts forward an extension to the LIBOR Market Model (also referred to as the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela model) under both forward measures and spot measures. Finally we consider the rise of using overnight index swaps in construction OIS discount curves and their application in the valuation of interest rate derivatives in the presence of collateral as well as reconciling the spread between OIS and vanilla interest rate swaps with credit risk measures.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the link between fiscal policy and debt {{sustainability}} {{in a number of}} African countries participating in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The paper finds that, on the basis of current fiscal policies, debt levels will remain unsustainable even after these countries graduate from the HIPC Initiative. This finding has important policy implications. By the very requirements of the HIPC Initiative, these countries are expected to increase significantly their poverty-reducing expenditure-possibly resulting in weaker fiscal primary balances and worsening debt sustainability outlook. As offsetting fiscal tightening may not be viable, ensuring debt sustainability may thus require increased availability of (nondebt-creating) grants. Otherwise, debt sustainability in HIPC countries may prove elusive in the long term.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, the {{mismanagement}} of Europe’s economic policy has appeared {{as one of}} the main causes of the distortion between European and American growth rates. The EMS was functioning asymmetrically and the countries with weak <b>currencies</b> beard the <b>adjustment</b> costs burden. In 1985, instead of bringing solutions to the identified blocking factors, it was decided to use market forces to re-launch Europe with the Single Market programme. According to the already prevailing liberal approach, growth and innovation were to be encouraged by both the completion of a large domestic market and the reinforcement of competition. At the end of the 1980 s, financial liberalisation and the increasingly rigid EMS mechanisms made a change of the monetary regime necessary. The single currency prevailed without the obvious consequences in terms of economic policy organisation being ever envisaged. The project was shaky from the very beginning. However, the benefits of the single currency were thought to be determining and its costs largely underestimated. Furthermore, the transitory measures towards the single currency adopted in Maastricht in December 1991, added to the aftermath of the German reunification, contributed to the halt of European growth during the long 1992 - 1998 transition period.

40|$|Slovakia {{is now one}} of the {{fastest-growing}} EU accession countries. Despite the upswing, the Slovak economy remains hampered by structural weaknesses and related macroeconomic imbalances. Over the medium term, IMF staff believes that Slovakia should aim for an external current account deficit under 5 percent GDP. However, all agreed that additional measures will be needed to reach the deficit target. The authorities' strategy remains to achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation through expenditure reduction, but they acknowledged that a more explicit expenditure policy was needed.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} costs and {{benefits}} of full dollarization compared to its closest alternative, a currency board, quantifying for Argentina where possible. Potential advantages include lower borrowing costs and deeper integration into world markets. One cost is the transfer of seigniorage to the United States. The country may also lose the “exit option” to devalue in the face of major shocks. Similarly, even a country with a currency board may lose some ability to act as lender of last resort to the banking system.

40|$|The {{external}} {{environment has}} deteriorated sharply {{as a result}} of the spiraling financial turmoil, and has led to a weakening in commodity prices and fears of a worldwide recession. Latin America and the Caribbean's fastest expansion in 40 years may be threatened as the global credit crunch makes financing scarce and squeezes demand for the region's commodities. This time around the region is better positioned to weather the crisis than in the past, given improvements in macroeconomic and financial policies as well as a reduced net dependency on external capital inflows. However, Latin American markets are feeling the effects of the crisis through a slowdown in capital inflows, large declines in stock price indexes, significant <b>currency</b> <b>adjustments</b> and an increase in debt spreads. Volatility has soared, with the closely watched Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index moving to an all-time high of 70. 33 on October 17, indicating that fear (rather than greed) has been ruling the markets. After reaching record lows in May 2007, emerging markets bond spreads are now above pre-Asian crisis levels. The JPMorgan EMBI+ Latin American composite widened by 146 basis points in the third quarter, with spreads reaching 448 basis points at the end of September. Spreads have widened sharply in recent weeks as foreign investors cut back regional exposure for the safety of U. S. Treasuries. The ongoing lack of liquidity and subsequent liquidation of assets is leading to a collapse in asset prices and a sharp widening in spreads. Daily spreads in October have risen to levels not seen since December 2002, making it much more difficult for governments that need financing to get it. Risk premiums for Latin corporates and sovereigns have risen substantially, but have remained well below U. S. junk (high-yield) bonds. Latin corporates are facing a steep rise in foreign exchange borrowing costs (although less than firms in other emerging markets), which raises concerns that refinancing risks will climb. So far, emerging markets vulnerabilities have been more focused on corporates, as sovereigns have improved public debt dynamics and countries' financing needs are under control. Market performance has been driven by the rapid deterioration of emerging markets bank and corporate market, as well as ongoing losses in emerging markets equities. From January to September 2008, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Latin American Index lost almost 28 %, while the Emerging Markets Index lost 37 % and the G- 7 Index lost 24 %. While in 2007 the Latin America component gained 47 %, almost nine times as much as the MSCI-G 7 index for developed markets, since mid-September 2008 stocks in Latin America have been doing worse than stocks in developed countries, as concerns about access to credit and the adverse impact of sharp falls in commodity prices and in local currencies contribute to increased risk aversion and to outflows of capital. Many governments in the region have used revenue from the commodity boom to pay down debt and build reserves. Now, facing a global financial crisis and the threat of recession in developed countries, the biggest question for Latin America is how long and deep this cyclical downturn will be, and how much it is going to reduce commodity prices. Prices for commodities such as soy, gold, copper and oil, which helped fund the region's boom, have fallen 28 % since their July 2 high, according to the RJ/CRB Commodity Price Index. According to Morgan Stanley (in a September 29 report), should prices return to their 10 -year average, Latin America's balanced budgets would quickly revert to a deficit of 4. 1 % of GDP. As risk aversion increases, investors are rapidly pulling out massive amounts of money, creating problems for local markets and banks. There is an ongoing shortage of dollars (as investors liquidate assets in Latin American markets), and as currencies depreciate, inflation concerns increase despite the global slowdown. In Brazil and Mexico, central banks deployed billions of dollars of reserves to stem steep currency declines, as companies in these countries, believing their local currencies would continue to strengthen against the U. S. dollar, took debts in dollars. Some companies also made bets using currency derivatives that have led to losses in the billions of dollars. Dramatic currency swings have caused heavy losses for many companies, from Mexico's cement giant Cemex SAB to the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Votorantim. Mexico's third-largest retailer, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, declared bankruptcy recently after reporting huge losses related to exchange rate bets. As concerns about corporate exposure to dollar-denominated derivatives increases, yields on bonds issued by many of Brazil's and Mexico's leading companies have started to rise, sharply raising the cost of issuing new debt. Latin American external debt issuance came to a halt in the third quarter of 2008, totaling only US$ 690 million. The cost of obtaining loans for capital expenditures, M&A and debt refinancing is also rising substantially for Latin American corporates amid contagion from the U. S. financial crisis. According to bankers, a protracted trend of shortening tenors and widening spreads has intensified in the past few weeks, indicating that bank lending is quickly following the way of bonds and equity. Finally, money transfers from Latin American migrants are expected to decline for the first time this decade, {{as a result of}} economic downturns in the U. S. and Spain, inflation and a weaker dollar. The Mexican Central Bank announced that money transfers from Mexicans living in the U. S. dropped a record 12. 2 % in August. In 2008, migrants from the region will send some 1. 7 % less in remittances year-on-year when adjusted for inflation, according to the IADB, compounding the adverse effects of the deepening financial turmoil...|$|R
40|$|Mongolia’s {{geographical}} location, {{its economic}} structure and its mineral wealth give it unique characteristics. Tapping its natural resources {{in a way}} that equally benefits the social and economic well-being of Mongolians is the greatest challenge. The resources boom in recent years directly impacted remarkable economic growth, and affected Mongolia’s economic structure, social welfare, institutional quality and environment. The unprecedented improvement in the terms of trade and the large inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) were driven by the industrialisation of Mongolia’s neighbour and a main trading partner, China. Externally generated growth is, however, a double-edged sword. The boom brought with it economic fragility and loss of international competitiveness. It made the economy vulnerable to commodity price slumps and adverse changes in FDI. The thesis constructs, tests and applies two economy-wide models for Mongolia: a comparative static CGE model, ORANIMON, and a dynamic CGE model, MONAGE. The models serve as laboratories for economic analysis in order to develop informed views on policy in Mongolia. The detailed nature of the models and the databases allow ORANIMON and MONAGE to capture salient features of the Mongolian economy. Short-, medium- and long-run simulations were undertaken for validating the modeling and evaluating the impact of the mining boom. Simulation results show that there were significant structural changes in the Mongolian economy over the period studied, 2005 to 2012. The shifts in foreign demand for Mongolian mineral export commodities contributed most of the economic growth. Maintaining flexible <b>currency</b> and wage <b>adjustment,</b> cultivating productivity through micro-economic reform and improving institutional quality are crucial for Mongolia to overcome the difficulties associated with the structural change. Areas for future research within an economic modelling framework emerge: an analysis of the impact of resources boom on poverty and inequality; a policy-relevant research related to the livestock sector; a long-term baseline for the Mongolian economy and an empirical assessment for examining the dynamic responses of macroeconomic policies to large capital outflows...|$|R
