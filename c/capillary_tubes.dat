Second, temperature pulses on catalytic surfaces have been investigated. Third, the propagation of running nerve pulses is modelled using reaction-diffusion systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>tubes</b> {{may also}} be used. A small sample of {{bacteria}} is collected {{on the end of}} the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through capillary action, and turned upside down, so that the bacterial points downwards. The hand holding the tube is then tapped on the bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th Century {{vaccination}} {{was done}} either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on ivory points for short term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass <b>capillary</b> <b>tubes</b> for this purpose towards {{the end of the}} century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|The {{preferred}} {{cooling process}} for household refrigeration appliances is a vapor compression refrigeration process with a <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> as expansion device. The vapor compression refrigeration system requires a phase {{change of the}} refrigerant inside the condenser and evaporator. Through a direct connection of condenser outlet and <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> inlet, which is commonly practiced for household refrigeration cycles, the condenser outlet defines directly the refrigerant state at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> inlet. Due to unsteady operation conditions the refrigerant state can change from subcooled liquid to saturated liquid with partially a vapor phase at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> inlet. The refrigerant flow inside the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> is either adiabatic or non-adiabatic (by utilizing internal heat exchange). In both cases the refrigerants state changes during the expansion with an increase of vapor quality towards the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> outlet. A variable vapor quality at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> inlet causes different flow patterns, especially at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> outlet. These flow patterns change periodically depending on the refrigerant state at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> inlet. Associated with the periodical changing flow patterns the occurrence of noise effects with the same periodicity and remarkable variations of the sound pressure level can be observed at the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> outlet. Â This paper presents the experimental investigations on the simultaneous occurrence of refrigerant flow patterns and corresponding noise effects at the outlet of a <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> installed in a refrigeration test cycle. The discussion of the experimental results leads to an explanation of causal relation between distinguishable flow patterns and corresponding noise effects...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the “artificial” refrigeration era, a great deal of effort has been applied on the development of high efficient systems. The efforts were primarily focused on the compressor, bringing its efficiency to record-high values. Simultaneously, the compressor noise was brought down to almost inaudible levels. As a consequence, sources of noise that were previously unnoticeable became audible and started {{to play a major role}} among refrigerator manufacturers. One of those new sources of noise, generally known as fluid borne noise, is now a growing field of interest in engineering. The aim of this work is to study the relationship between the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> flow and the acoustic behavior of household refrigerators by investigating a particular type of fluid borne noise that only occurs during the freezer mode of dual-evaporator appliances, known as fluctuating noise. To this end a household refrigerator was carefully instrumented and firstly tested in a reverberant chamber. Very heavy sound power level oscillations were found, even with the system in thermodynamic steady-state conditions. Acceleration measurements were also taken at the inlet pipe of the evaporator showing that the refrigerant flow in that region is highly pulsating, i. e., that the refrigerant flow pattern at the discharge of the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> is not steady, in contrast to the indications of the thermodynamic readings. Visualizations studies of the flow pattern at the inlet of the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> were also carried out, showing the presence of vapor bubbles – caused by an unbalance between the compressor and <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> mass flow rates – for most of the time. A needle valve was then installed in series with the freezer <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> in order to increase restriction and match the compressor and the <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> mass flow rates. The restriction provided by the optimum pair needle valve-capillary tube was converted into an equivalent I. D. <b>capillary</b> <b>tube.</b> The original freezer <b>capillary</b> <b>tube</b> was replaced by a same length smaller I. D. <b>capillary</b> <b>tube,</b> and another appliance tests were carried out.

Therefore, the two-phase flow of gas-contaminated refrigerant started to be generated notably earlier than in the case of pure refrigerant flow.

50|$|A room whose {{temperature}} {{is controlled by}} the use of capillary tube mats as a surface heat-exchanger requires flow temperatures for heating or cooling which need only be a few degrees away from the desired room temperature. At the same time, due to the large number of parallel <b>capillary</b> <b>tubes,</b> the drive energy required to maintain the flow is comparatively low in relation to “single tube systems”, which are laid {{in the form of a}} meander (typical installation of underfloor heating pipes). Due to the small distance of the <b>capillary</b> <b>tubes</b> to the surface of the room area, the system reacts very quickly. The temperature of the heating or cooling medium is given off very evenly and quickly to the environment due to the large number of <b>capillary</b> <b>tubes.</b> These two properties - very good heat transmission and low pressure loss - provide an advantage in terms of energy saving. In the broad definition of the terms of the technology, the capillary tube mat is a surface heat exchanger, and can be used for the transfer of heat between two media.|$|E
