40|$|In January of 1986 my brother, Ed M. Brogie, and I were {{tallying}} our {{lists for}} Nebraska {{when the question}} arose: 2 ̆ 2 How many species of birds do you think one could see in Nebraska in one year? 2 ̆ 2 The previous year (1985) {{had been the first}} year we had made a serious attempt at seeing western Nebraska species and chasing rarities in the state. Our efforts had yielded such birds as Bean Goose, Green-tailed Towhee, Black-necked Stilt, Red Phalarope, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker, Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Pipit, <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Finch, <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird,</b> and King Eider. When 1985 ended, my Nebraska life list stood at 290 and I had seen 237 species in the state for the year, without any real attempt to see migrant songbirds.... In summary, I found all of the 197 birds I had given a Code 1, and 53 of the 54 Code 2 species (missed Hermit Thrush). Of the 40 birds I had given a Code 3 I had found 26. Included in my total were 12 Code 4 birds and 3 Code 5 species. Each species counted in the total had at least one witness or was documented with a photograph.... All in all, 1986 was a great year for birding and I had a fun time playing the game. One always thinks about the species he missed, but I know I 2 ̆ 7 ll remember for life some that I found. It was a year I learned {{a great deal about the}} birds of Nebraska, and about Nebraska as a whole. Perhaps the best part of birding in 1986 was making new acquaintances, spending time with old friends, and just sharing the joys and experiences that go with the sport...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 spe¬cies that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). An analysis of the relative species diversity of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna establishes several areas of unusual species richness and endemicity, these most important being the Missouri Valley and associated middle to lower Niobrara Valley, the Pine Ridge area of the northwestern Panhandle, and the entire Platte Valley. Species of Birds Considered as Pandemic Breeders Across Nebraska include Pied-billed Grebe American Bittern Great Blue Heron Black-crowned Night Heron Canada Goose Mallard Northern Pintail Blue-winged Teal Red-tailed Hawk American Kestrel Northern Harrier American Coot Killdeer Rock Dove Mourning Dove Yellow-billed Cuckoo Barn Owl Great Horned Owl Long-eared Owl Common Nighthawk Belted Kingfisher Downy Woodpecker Hairy Woodpecker Western Kingbird Eastern Kingbird Northern Rough-winged Swallow Bank Swallow Cliff Swallow Barn Swallow Blue Jay American Crow House Wren American Robin Gray Catbird Loggerhead Shrike European Starling Yellow Warbler Common Yellow-throat Blue Grosbeak Chipping Sparrow Lark Sparrow Grasshopper Sparrow Red-winged Blackbird Western Meadowlark Yellow-headed Blackbird Common Grackle Brown-headed Cowbird American Goldfinch House Sparrow Species of Birds Considered to be Endemic to Specific Nebraska Regions include Northwestern Panhandle Endemics: White-throated Swift Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker Cordilleran Flycatcher Plumbeus Vireo Pinyon Jay Violet-green Swallow Brown Creeper Pygmy Nuthatch Mountain Bluebird Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrush Sage Thrasher Western Tanager Yellow-rumped Warbler Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow Dark-eyed Junco McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur Chestnut-collared Longspur; Lower Missouri Valley Endemics: Red-shouldered Hawk Broad-winged Hawk Chuck-wills-widow White-eyed Vireo Carolina Wren Summer Tanager Northern Parula Cerulean Warbler Prothonotary Warbler Kentucky Warbler Yellow-throated Warbler; Southwestern Panhandle Endemics: Mountain Plover Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Sparro...|$|R
40|$|Of {{interest}} to many {{is evidence of}} northward movement of species which generally summer on the Great Plains. In addition to White-winged Dove and Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, both slowly establishing as breeders in Nebraska, significant numbers of Glossy Ibis continue to be found, probably associated with major increases in numbers of White-faced Ibis. Perhaps the biggest surprise this late summer and early fall was {{the large number of}} Lesser Goldfinches reported from the southern Panhandle. Less exciting by far, but worthy of attention were reports of several Mute Swans in the Omaha area, including a duo of juveniles, and a couple of sightings of Monk Parakeets, last known to breed in the state in 1998. Neither would be welcome additions to the breeding avifauna of Nebraska. Notable western species found in the east included California Gull and Rufous Hummingbird, while Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> and <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Vireo crept eastward farther than usual. Most surprising in this group, however, was a Pygmy Nuthatch in Lincoln, a very rare vagrant in general. A mention also for Varied Thrush, a rare but annual visitor from way west, of which 3 were reported. Conversely, best eastern bird west was an immature Blackburnian Warbler banded in Scotts Bluff County. Relative to last year 2 ̆ 7 s good numbers, both Red-breasted Nuthatch and Purple Finch were back to normal levels. At the time of this writing, no notable incursions of winter birds had been detected. Among regular migrants, Blue-headed Vireo, Nashville Warbler, and Orange-crowned Warbler appeared in excellent numbers; the migration period for Orange-crowned Warbler occupied all of 3 months. Strangely, Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, usually abundant as a migrant in the west, was at a low ebb. In the category of phenomena, the huge roost of Purple Martins in central Omaha, peaking at 35, 000, was unprecedented as far as we know. Finally, an identification note. Two vireos of the 2 ̆ 2 Solitary 2 ̆ 2 complex were banded, measured, and well photographed in Scotts Bluff County by Nancy Gobris of Nebraska Prairie Partners. Measurements indicated both were unequivocally Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, but plumage characters indicated at least one may have been a Plumbeous...|$|R
40|$|First, some {{housekeeping}} is in order.... You {{will also}} notice {{the new order}} of species (AGAIN!!), reflecting the latest American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Checklist, published this spring. The most noticeable change concerns the placement of shrikes and vireos between flycatchers and corvids; but the order of species within some genera also differs, especially among the waterfowl, where, for instance, swans now follow the geese. And now let 2 ̆ 7 s turn to the birds! As in most summers, many species went about their business in routine fashion, hence the notation 2 ̆ 2 Routine Reports 2 ̆ 2 for many. We encourage observers to note and to forward evidence of breeding for all species, including dates for nests, eggs, and young. These data help us document changing patterns for various species. Interesting developments this summer in terms of breeding populations include {{the expansion of the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove 2 ̆ 2 colony 2 ̆ 2 at the Newcomb residence in Kearney; the continued presence of an outlying population of Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow at Morse Bluff; further evidence of the northward spread of Acadian Flycatcher in the Missouri Valley; expansion of the Cordilleran Flycatcher population in the western Pine Ridge; continuation of the outlying Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe group in Dixon Co; an increased population of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher in the Panhandle, and expansion (probably temporary) of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow into the southwest Sandhills. In addition, three species of shorebirds arrived early: Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpiper, Greater Yellowlegs, and Buff-breasted Sandpiper. A noticeable number of warblers also migrated late, including Orange-crowned and Nashville (both 2 nd latest ever), Blackpoll, Black-and-white (possibly breeding), and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s. While few rarities reached us, those that did were of interest: the 3 rd documented White-winged Dove at Dove City (Kearney), and the 3 rd record Cave Swallow [...] all banded by Charles Brown in the Keith Co area [...] as well as a Laughing Gull at Keystone L, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s 8 th documented record...|$|R

THE DESOTO NWR EIDERS. The March 1986 issue (NBR 54 : 10) reported Eiders, probably King or Common, at DeSoto NWR, and that photographs were being circulated for confirmation of the species.

The 1986 survey total of 462 Bald Eagles is the second highest total reported for Nebraska, surpassed only by the 746 recorded during last year’s unusually mild winter. —Greg Wingfield, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, North Platte JUNE NOTES FOR WESTERN NEBRASKA. Mark Brogie, Creighton, and I birded the western border of Nebraska in June 1986, trying {{to see some of}} the birds that breed out there. On 15 June we located a pair of Lewis’s Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) in the Dead Horse Burn area of Chadron State Park. The same day we encountered a pair of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbirds</b> (Tyrannus vociferans) north of Hay Springs, on the road to Metcalf Wildlife Area, Sheridan County. On 16 June, while birding Sowbelly Canyon, Brogie found a singing Solitary Vireo (Vireo solitarius) in the transition zone between the ponderosa pines and the deciduous riparian woodland. In the wide open short grass prairie west of Harrison we successfully searched for Brewer’s Sparrows (Spizelli breweri). Nesting McCown’s (Calcarius mccownii) and Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C. ornatus) were the consolation for an unsuccessful search [for Mountain Plover] in hot, inhospitable surroundings. —Bill Huser, South Sioux City MINDEN NOTES. I saw a Northern Harrier on 2 February 1986, and two Magpies 15 February, and a Prairie Falcon 27 February. During that period I also saw Red-tails and Kestrels, and an occasional Rough-leg and Ferruginous, and in March Swainson’s Hawks. I saw small groups of Lapland Longspurs and Horned Larks on 2 February, Sandhill Cranes in the Platte valley 8 March, and three Killdeer 16 March. My brother, Elwin, observed a Short-eared Owl during the winter. On 6 April Mourning Doves were here, and on 20 April I saw a Snowy Egret. On 4 May I saw three or four Lark Buntings and a Great Blue Heron. On 29 June I found a Mourning Dove nest with two eggs; on 19 July I saw a young Killdeer learning to fly, and on 3 August I saw a young Upland Sandpiper, just learning to fly, with its parents. My cousin, Robert Spicknall, and I saw a Yellow-crowned Night-Heron on 6 and 13 July. On 6 July Mr. Harvey Bell called my attention to an active nest of a Blue Grosbeak, with three young in it. On a hike 28 September I found Savannah and Grasshopper Sparrows but failed to find the usual Great Blue Heron. —Harold Turner, Minde...|$|R
40|$|Some {{days ago}} our Museum {{received}} a probably fully adult female of Porphyrio, kindly sent by Mr. A. A. van Bemmelen, the able Director of the Zoological Garden at Rotterdam, with the assurance, that the bird {{had been caught}} at and sent from the Lake Toba in the Interior of Sumatra. Peculiarly enough there is hitherto no evidence published as to the occurrence of a Porphyrio in Sumatra, except by <b>Cassin</b> in U. <b>S.</b> Exploring Expedition, Ornith. p. 308, where, treating of P. indicus, the author says that the Museum of the Philadelphia Academy contains specimens from Java, Sumatra and other islands of the Malay Archipelago. As Porphyrio indicus Horsf. ((P. calvus Vieill.) has also been found in Borneo, I was much astonished to see that our Sumatran bird differs not only from this, but also from both the known species from the Continent, though those latter may {{be considered to be}} its nearest allies...|$|R
