40|$|Customer {{engagement}} {{has been}} labeled {{as a prerequisite}} {{for the success of}} virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environments.</b> A key challenge for organizations serving their <b>customers</b> via these <b>environments</b> is how to stimulate customer engagement. This study is among the first to shed light on this issue by examining customer engagement and its drivers. Using the theory of uses and gratification as theoretical lens, we develop a model that relates characteristics of virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environments,</b> perceived benefits of using these <b>environments</b> and <b>customer</b> engagement intentions. The model is validated using partially least squares structural equation modeling on three samples of real users of different virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environments</b> in the Dutch telecom industry. The results provide clear support for the validity of the hypothesized relationships and show high robustness of the findings across the three datasets. An important finding {{of this study is that}} cognitive, social integrative and hedonic benefits appear to be significant in their influence on customer engagement intentions. Overall, the findings add to the underexplored field of customer engagement study and hold implications for research into and the management of virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

50|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on Web-based forums that facilitate user (or customer) innovation - referred to as virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environment,</b> these forums help companies partner with their customers in various phases of product development as well as in other value creation activities. For example, Threadless, a T-shirt manufacturing company, relies on the contribution of online community members in the design process. The community includes a group of volunteer designers who submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to free exposure, designers are provided monetary incentives including a $2,500 base award as well as a percentage of T-shirt sales. These incentives allow Threadless to encourage continual user contribution.|$|E
50|$|Customer {{engagement}} {{is critical}} {{for the success of}} companies or brands in a technologically connected society. This progressive <b>customer</b> <b>environment</b> requires direct communication with customers so that they are involved in the process, giving them control in exchange for their attention, to increase brand awareness and loyalty, and to earn word of mouth. These exchanges increase the success of marketing campaigns, add value to the brand, and/or product or service, and enhance customer service. Amazon re-branded into 'serving the world's largest engaged online community', the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) has created a 'Blueprint for Consumer-Centric Holistic Measurement' and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) and the Advertising Research Foundation (ARF), have put together the 'Engagement Steering Committee' to work on the customer engagement metric.|$|E

50|$|In {{relation}} to customers and the channels which {{are associated with}} sales, these are multichannel in nature. Due to the growth and importance of social media and digital advancement, these aspects need to be understood by businesses {{to be successful in}} this era of customer journeys. With tools such as Facebook and Twitter having such prominence, there is a constant stream of data that needs to be analysed to understand this journey. Business flexibility and responsiveness is vital in the ever-changing digital <b>customer</b> <b>environment,</b> as customers are constantly connected to businesses and their products. Customers are now instant product experts due to various digital outlets and form their own opinions on how and where to consume products and services. Businesses use customer values and create a plan to gain a competitive advantage. Businesses use the knowledge of customers to guide the customer journey to their products and services.|$|E
50|$|Data Servers can {{be either}} {{physical}} hosts or can be servers running as guest servers within a virtualization platform {{or a combination of}} both. It is very common for a <b>customer</b> <b>environment</b> to have a mixture of Virtual and Physical Servers. This is where attention to detail must be given to the approach of protecting the data on these servers at regular intervals. There are distinct advantages in selecting a technology that is virtual or physical independent. This would limit the number of technologies that organizations will have to get trained on, skilled up on, purchase, deploy, manage and maintain. In an ideal world, if you can reduce the complexity of managing multiple products to protect your physical and virtual infrastructure you will reap the rewards. A technology that gets installed at the operating system level ensures consistency in an environment that is either physical or virtual and eliminates API compatibility or Disk Volume Structure limitations (e.g. Raw Mapped Devices, VMFS).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{delivering}} {{high quality}} software products, {{it is important}} to test them in environments very close to the typical customer ones, where unexpected events may perturb the normal running of the application. Running tests in a realistic environment starting from the early development phases helps in reducing costs in terms of fixing. Moreover, in a distributed application, the importance of testing each single component increases when Agile methodologies are adopted because it can happen that a component is developed when its pre-requisites are not available. Often the <b>customer</b> <b>environments</b> are very complex and replicating them in a laboratory is difficult if at all possible. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the integration in the Eclipse IDE of a test tool useful for simulating the operating conditions of typical <b>customer</b> <b>environments.</b> This allows to seamlessly run complex tests directly from the Eclipse IDE without switching to a different environment...|$|R

40|$|Planned {{experimentation}} is {{a powerful}} tool to improve quality of industrial manufacturing processes, in an environment placing prime concern on top quality. The goals are to manufacture products that function best possible, to achieve a minimum variability of the production process, and to secure product robustness against noise in the <b>customer's</b> <b>environment.</b> Statistically planned experiments are a tool to achieve these goals. They consist of a few experimental runs to obtain data on the product characteristics. Each run corresponds to a planned choice of levels of production factors and noise factors. Depending on the experimental data, the production factors are classified into signal factors {{that in the first}} place affect the process mean, control factors that predominantly determine process variability, and nuisance factors {{that can be used for}} cost reduction. Noise factors are an additional category, they mirror the <b>customer's</b> <b>environment.</b> Any such cycle of manufacturing improvement should terminate with a confirmation experiment. (orig.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore and {{elaborate}} how firms are managing aesthetic with color and design choice as open innovation practice and explore its applicability in various sectors.   Two research questions are addressed: How is aesthetics with color and design choices managed by firms using open innovation practices? Can aesthetics with color and design choices be managed as open innovation practices for all kinds of technical designed products?   The study is based on a case study combined with survey method which constitutes a combination of quantitative and qualitative research for conducting productive research. In order to analyze and explain the case study as open innovation practice for designed technical products, the 4 P model of innovation, open innovation model, product design process, digital prototyping and virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environment</b> are used. The survey was used for analyzing the question on generalization for all other designed technical products.   The study shows that some mobile firms are using “theme creator”, software for themes that is used for inside aesthetics of designed technical products with customer collaboration and participation. Sony Ericsson is one firm that is establishing activities for outlook aesthetics and inside aesthetics with color and design choice for its designed technical product (mobile). These activities are interpreted as open innovation practices conducted in virtual <b>customer</b> <b>environment</b> by Sony Ericsson. The survey result shows the customer’s willingness for participation and customer’s demand for the change in color and design of designed technical products by their own choice. When combining the case study and survey results it is concluded that color and design choice is required to improve aesthetics for designed technical products...|$|E
