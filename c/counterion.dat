Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as 2+ and 2+: these are stable provided the <b>counterion</b> cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. 2− is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} results of {{computer}} simulations for a primitive model of asymmetric electrolyte solutions containing macroions, <b>counterions</b> {{and in a}} few cases, also co-ions. The results show that the valency of <b>counterions</b> {{plays an important role in}} shaping the net interaction between the macroions. For solutions with monovalent <b>counterions,</b> the macroions are distributed at larger distances, and in solutions with divalent <b>counterions,</b> the macroions come closer to each other and share a layer of <b>counterions,</b> whereas, in solutions with trivalent <b>counterions,</b> the macroions form clusters.

40|$|Adsorption of {{multivalent}} <b>counterions</b> on the charged {{surface of}} a macroion is known to lead to inversion of the macroion charge due to the strong lateral correlations of <b>counterions.</b> We consider a nontrivial role of the excluded volume of <b>counterions</b> on this effect. It is shown analytically that when the bare charge of macroion increases, its net charge including the adsorbed <b>counterions</b> oscillates {{with the number of}} their layers. Charge inversion vanishes every time the top layer of <b>counterions</b> is completely full and becomes incompressible. These oscillations of charge inversion are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations. Another version of this phenomenon is studied for a metallic electrode screened by multivalent <b>counterions</b> when potential of the electrode is controlled instead of its charge. In this case, oscillations of the compressibility and charge inversion lead to oscillations of capacitance of this electrode with the number of adsorbed layers of multivalent <b>counterions.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|Strong {{coupling}} phenomena, such as {{the like}} charged macroions attraction, opposite charged macroions repulsion, charge renormalization or charge inversion, {{are known to be}} mediated by multivalent <b>counterions.</b> Most theories treat the <b>counterions</b> as point charges, and describe the system by a single coupling parameter that measures the strength of the Coulomb interactions. In many biological systems, the <b>counterions</b> are highly charged and have finite sizes and can be well-described by polyelectrolytes.

In this work we apply a field theoretic description in the strong coupling regime to polyelectrolytes. We work out the special cases of rod-like polymer <b>counterions</b> confined by one and two charged walls respectively.

Highly charged and mobile ions are often avoided in SDS-PAGE cathode buffers, but may {{be included in the}} gel itself, where it migrates ahead of the protein. In applications such as DISC SDS-PAGE the pH values within the gel may vary to change the average charge of the counterions during the run to improve resolution. Popular counterions are glycine and tricine. Glycine has been used as the source of trailing ion or slow ion because its pKa is 9.69 and mobility of glycinate are such that the effective mobility can be set at a value below that of the slowest known proteins of net negative charge in the pH range. The minimum pH of this range is approximately 8.0.|$|E

40|$|We {{reformulate}} {{the theory}} of strong electrostatic coupling in order to describe an asymmetric electrolyte solution of monovalent salt ions and polyvalent <b>counterions</b> using field-theoretical techniques and Monte Carlo simulations. The theory {{is based on an}} asymmetric treatment of the different components of the electrolyte solution. The weak coupling Debye-Huumlckel approach is used in order to describe the monovalent salt ions while a strong coupling approach is used to tackle the polyvalent <b>counterions.</b> This combined weak-strong coupling approach effectively leads to dressed interactions between polyvalent <b>counterions</b> and thus directly affects the correlation attraction mediated by polyvalent <b>counterions</b> between like-charged objects. The general theory is specifically applied to a system composed of two uniformly charged plane-parallel surfaces in the presence of salt and polyvalent <b>counterions.</b> In the strong coupling limit for polyvalent <b>counterions,</b> the comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows good agreement for large enough values of the electrostatic coupling parameter.

2500|$|More refined {{forms of}} the {{mechanism}} are known. In 1957, Zimmerman and Traxler proposed that some aldol reactions have [...] "six-membered transition states having a chair conformation." [...] This {{is now known as}} the Zimmerman–Traxler model. E-enolates give rise to anti products, whereas Z-enolates give rise to syn products. The factors that control selectivity are the preference for placing substituents equatorially in six-membered transition states and the avoidance of syn-pentane interactions, respectively. E and Z refer to the cis-trans stereochemical relationship between the enolate oxygen bearing the positive <b>counterion</b> and the highest priority group on the alpha carbon. In reality, only some metals such as lithium and boron reliably follow the Zimmerman–Traxler model. Thus, in some cases, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction may be unpredictable.|$|E

40|$|Screening of a macroion {{such as a}} charged solid particle, a charged membrane, {{double helix}} DNA or actin by {{multivalent}} <b>counterions</b> is considered. Small colloidal particles, charged micelles, short or long polyelectrolytes can {{play the role of}} multivalent <b>counterions.</b> Due to strong lateral repulsion at the surface of macroion such multivalent <b>counterions</b> form a strongly correlated liquid, with the short range order resembling that of a Wigner crystal. These correlations create additional binding of multivalent <b>counterions</b> to the macroion surface with binding energy larger than $k_BT$. As a result even for a moderate concentration of multivalent <b>counterions</b> in the solution, their total charge at the surface of macroion exceeds the bare macroion charge in absolute value. Therefore, the net charge of the macroion inverts its sign. In the presence of a high concentration of monovalent salt the absolute value of inverted charge can be larger than the bare one. This giant inversion of charge can be observed by electrophoresis or by direct counting of multivalent <b>counterions.</b> Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures. Many corrections. Accepted to J. Chem.

50|$|The {{size of the}} <b>counterion</b> is also a factor. A smaller <b>counterion,</b> with {{a higher}} charge density, will have {{stronger}} electrostatic interactions with the carbenium ion than will a larger <b>counterion</b> which has a lower charge density. Further, a smaller <b>counterion</b> is more easily solvated by a polar solvent than a <b>counterion</b> with low charge density. The result is increased propagation rate with increased solvating capability of the solvent.|$|E

The effect of the {{addition of}} alkali metal and tetraalkylammonium chlorides to solutions of lithium salt of poly(thiophen- 3 -ylacetic acid) is investigated by NMR. The fractions of free alkali metal <b>counterions</b> are in agreement with predictions of the cylindrical Poisson–Boltzmann cell model.

40|$|Screening of a {{strongly}} charged macroion by multivalent <b>counterions</b> is considered. It is shown that <b>counterions</b> form {{a strongly}} correlated liquid {{at the surface}} of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional attraction of <b>counterions</b> to the surface which is absent in conventional solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of <b>counterions</b> near the surface. Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder and a sphere. In all three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent <b>counterions</b> in the solution they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign the net macroion charge. Absolute value of the inverted charge density can be as large as 20 % of that of the bare one. In particular, for a cylindrical macroion, it is shown that for screening by multivalent <b>counterions</b> predictions of the Onsager-Manning theory are quantitatively incorrect. The net charge density of the cylinder is smaller than their theory predicts and inverts sign with growing concentration of <b>counterions.</b> Moreover the condensation looses its universality and the net charge linear density depends on the bare one.

In our simulations, we used a coarse-grained representation of polyelectrolyte chains, <b>counterions</b> and salt ions. During simulation runs, we alternate Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation steps. Monte Carlo steps were used to perform small ion exchange between simulation box containing salt ions (salt reservoir) and simulation box with polyelectrolyte chains, <b>counterions</b> and salt ions (polyelectrolyte solution). This allowed us to model Donnan equilibrium and partitioning of salt and <b>counterions</b> across membrane impermeable to polyelectrolyte chains.
