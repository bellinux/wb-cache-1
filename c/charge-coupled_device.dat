5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

25|$|Recently, an {{alternative}} dye solution and microplate {{system has been}} developed called FLIPR® (fluorometric imaging plate reader), which uses a Calcium 3 assay reagent that {{does not require a}} washing step. As a result, change in dye fluorescence can be viewed in real time with no delay using an excitatory laser and a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of commercially viable <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) {{technology}} in the 1980s, first the pickup tubes were replaced {{with this kind of}} sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital. In 1991, Kodak {{unveiled the}} DCS 100, the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) {{or contact}} image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|Cassinis {{instrumentation}} consisted of: {{a synthetic}} aperture radar mapper, a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> imaging system, a visible/infrared mapping spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a cosmic dust analyzer, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a magnetospheric imaging instrument, a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.|$|E
25|$|P–n photodiodes are {{not used}} to measure {{extremely}} low light intensities.

5000|$|Many photodetectors can be {{configured}} {{to detect}} individual photons, each with relative advantages and disadvantages,including a photomultiplier, geiger counter, single-photon avalanche diode, superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, transition edge sensor, or scintillation counter. <b>Charge-coupled</b> <b>devices</b> can also sometimes be used.|$|R
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device)</b> at the focal point instead.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{technological}} improvements {{helped to}} further the study of planetary nebulae. Space telescopes allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits. Infrared and ultraviolet studies of planetary nebulae allowed much more accurate determinations of nebular temperatures, densities and elemental abundances. <b>Charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high optical resolution achievable by telescopes above the Earth's atmosphere reveals extremely complex structures.|$|E
40|$|The Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS) on the Indian {{remote sensing}} {{satellite}} IRS-P 3 {{has been working}} successfully in orbit for over 5 years. The <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>devices</b> (CCD) of the MOS instruments are subjected to high-energy solar radiation which degrades performance. Therefore, the observation of changes in device parameters such as temperature, dark current and illumination characteristics is necessary to correct the measured data and to maintain the sensor calibration. The analysis of these parameters is also valuable for obtaining insight into long-term behaviour of <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>devices</b> in space. This paper describes the variation of the MOS device parameters as well as preliminary results of measuring these parameters following the power supply malfunction in September 2000...|$|R
40|$|Analog <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>devices</b> and {{sampled data}} {{filtering}} have developed into mature disciplines.

50|$|The {{video camera}} tube was {{a type of}} cathode ray tube used to capture the {{television}} image prior {{to the introduction of}} <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>devices</b> (CCDs) in the 1970s. Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|Canon {{developed}} an autofocusing camera {{that uses a}} <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) to measure {{the clarity of the}} image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera's fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. The fuzzy control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.|$|E
25|$|Parallel or full field OCT using a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) camera {{has been}} used in which the sample is full-field {{illuminated}} and en face imaged with the CCD, hence eliminating the electromechanical lateral scan. By stepping the reference mirror and recording successive en face images a three-dimensional representation can be reconstructed. Three-dimensional OCT using a CCD camera was demonstrated in a phase-stepped technique, using geometric phase shifting with a Linnik interferometer, utilising a pair of CCDs and heterodyne detection, and in a Linnik interferometer with an oscillating reference mirror and axial translation stage. Central to the CCD approach is the necessity for either very fast CCDs or carrier generation separate to the stepping reference mirror to track the high frequency OCT carrier.|$|E
25|$|Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS): The ISS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures most images in visible light, {{and also some}} infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a wide-angle camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E

50|$|CCDs (<b>charge-coupled</b> <b>devices)</b> are {{alternatives}} to CMOS sensors, which {{are generally more}} sensitive and more expensive.

25|$|Framing camera (FC)— The framing camera uses 20mm aperture, f/7.9 {{refractive}} {{optical system}} with a focal length of 150mm. A frame-transfer <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD), a Thomson TH7888A, at the focal plane has 1024 × 1024 sensitive 93-μrad pixels, yielding a 5.5° x 5.5° field of view. An 8-position filter wheel permits panchromatic (clear filter) and spectrally selective imaging (7 narrow band filters). The broadest filter allows imaging at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 1050nm. In addition, the framing camera will acquire images for optical navigation while in the vicinities of Vesta and Ceres. The FC computer is a custom radiation-hardened Xilinx {{system with a}} LEON2 core and 8 GiB of memory. The camera will offer resolutions of 17 m/pixel for Vesta and 66 m/pixel for Ceres. Because the framing camera is vital for both science and navigation, the payload has two identical and physically separate cameras (FC1 & FC2) for redundancy, {{each with its own}} optics, electronics, and structure.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of the way}} the HST's {{instruments}} were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device</b> (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. [...] An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.|$|E
500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a <b>charge-coupled</b> <b>device.</b> [...] Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E
