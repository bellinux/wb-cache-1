5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The <b>core</b> <b>protein</b> is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E

25|$|The <b>core</b> <b>protein</b> has 191 {{amino acids}} {{and can be}} divided into three domains on the basis of hydrophobicity: domain 1 (residues 1–117) {{contains}} mainly basic residues with two short hydrophobic regions; domain 2 (residues 118–174) is less basic and more hydrophobic and its C-terminus {{is at the end of}} p21; domain 3 (residues 175–191) is highly hydrophobic and acts as a signal sequence for E1 envelope protein.|$|E
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} genome forms chromatin-like {{structure with}} viral <b>core</b> <b>proteins.</b> This complex supports only {{a low level}} of transcription in a cell-free system, and thus <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> have been thought to be negative factors for transcription. The mechanism how the transcription from the viral DNA complexed with <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> is activated in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we found that both <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> and histones are bound with the viral DNA in early phases of infection. We also found that acetylation of histone H 3 occurs at the promoter regions of viral active genes in a transcription-independent manner. In addition, when a plasmid DNA complexed with <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> was introduced into cells, <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> enhanced transcription. Knockdown of TAF-I, a remodeling factor for viral core protein–DNA complexes, reduces the enhancement effect by <b>core</b> <b>proteins,</b> indicating that <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> positively regulate viral transcription through the interaction with TAF-I. We would propose a possible mechanism that <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> ensure transcription by regulating viral chromatin structure through the interaction with TAF-I...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe <b>core</b> planar {{polarity}} <b>proteins</b> localize asymmetrically to the adherens junctions of epithelial cells, {{where they}} have been hypothesized to assemble into intercellular complexes. Here, we show that the <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> are preferentially distributed to discrete membrane subdomains (“puncta”), where they form asymmetric contacts between neighboring cells. Using an antibody internalization assay and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in prepupal and pupal wings, we have investigated the turnover of two key <b>core</b> <b>proteins,</b> Flamingo and Frizzled, and find that the localization of both within puncta is highly stable. Furthermore, the transmembrane <b>core</b> <b>proteins,</b> Flamingo, Frizzled, and Strabismus, are necessary for stable localization of <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> to junctions, whereas the cytoplasmic <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> are required for their concentration into puncta. Thus, we define the distinct roles of specific <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> in the formation of asymmetric contacts between cells, which is a key event in the generation of coordinated cellular asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|Corneal {{cross-linking}} using riboflavin and ultraviolet-A (RFUVA) is {{a clinical}} treatment targeting the stroma in progressive keratoconus. The stroma contains keratocan, lumican, mimecan, and decorin, <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> of major proteoglycans (PGs) that bind collagen fibrils, playing {{important roles in}} stromal transparency. Here, a model reaction system using purified, non-glycosylated PG <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> in solution in vitro has been compared with reactions inside an intact cornea, ex vivo, revealing effects of RFUVA on interactions between PGs and collagen cross-linking. Irradiation with UVA and riboflavin cross-links collagen α and β chains into larger polymers. In addition, RFUVA cross-links PG <b>core</b> <b>proteins,</b> forming higher molecular weight polymers. When collagen type I is mixed with individual purified, non-glycosylated PG <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> in solution in vitro and subjected to RFUVA, both keratocan and lumican strongly inhibit collagen cross-linking. However, mimecan and decorin do not inhibit but instead form cross-links with collagen, forming new high molecular weight polymers. In contrast, corneal glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, in isolation from their <b>core</b> <b>proteins,</b> are not cross-linked by RFUVA and do not form cross-links with collagen. Significantly, when RFUVA is conducted on intact corneas ex vivo, both keratocan and lumican, in their natively glycosylated form, do form cross-links with collagen. Thus, RFUVA causes cross-linking of collagen molecules among themselves and PG <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> among themselves, together with limited linkages between collagen and keratocan, lumican, mimecan, and decorin. RFUVA as a diagnostic tool reveals that keratocan and lumican <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> interact with collagen very differently than do mimecan and decorin...|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to scar-inducing factors, like those discussed above, astrocytes up regulate {{the production of}} chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Astrocytes are a predominant type of glial cell in {{the central nervous system}} that provide many functions including damage mitigation, repair, and glial scar formation. The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) {{have been shown to be}} up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs. CSPGs have been shown to inhibit regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but the role that the CSPG <b>core</b> <b>protein</b> vs. CS-GAGs had not been studied until recently.|$|E

25|$|At the 5' and 3' {{ends of the}} RNA are the UTR, {{that are}} not {{translated}} into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES — Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a very long protein containing about 3,000 amino acids. The core domain of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES contains a four-way helical junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot. The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frame's orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. The large pre-protein is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into the 10 smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell, or assemble into the mature viral particles. Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include <b>Core</b> <b>protein,</b> E1 and E2; nonstructural proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) is most {{frequently}} used to screen {{for the presence of}} this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner [...] "core particle" [...] enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the <b>core</b> <b>protein,</b> alternatively known as [...] core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the [...] core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease.

500|$|The {{life cycle}} of [...] virus is complex. [...] {{is one of a}} few known pararetroviruses: non-retroviruses that still use reverse {{transcription}} in their replication process. The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to NTCP [...] on the surface and being endocytosed. Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones. The partially double-stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded by a viral polymerase and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA serves as a template for transcription of four viral mRNAs by host RNA polymerase. The largest mRNA, (which is longer than the viral genome), is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the capsid <b>core</b> <b>protein</b> and the viral DNA polymerase. These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies. The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein (the DNA polymerase) synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity.|$|E
40|$|Proteoglycans of Wharton’s jelly contain mainly chondroitin/dermatan {{sulphate}} chains. The predominant proteoglycan is decorin (<b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> of 45 and 47 kDa), {{although the}} <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> of biglycan (45 kDa), versican (260 kDa) and of other proteoglycans (90, 110, 220 kDa) were also detected (Gogiel et al., 2003).

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Variola virus-like viruses by natural evolution of zoonotic Orthopoxviruses, like Cowpox virus (CPXV), {{is a global}} health threat. The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral <b>core</b> <b>proteins.</b> Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural <b>core</b> <b>proteins.</b> Moreover, since virions contained primarily K 48 -linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of <b>core</b> <b>proteins.</b> Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E 5 {{is a prerequisite for}} uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection...|$|R
