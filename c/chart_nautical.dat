50|$|In 1931, Weilbach {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, the main global producer of <b>nautical</b> <b>charts.</b> Weilbach gained a Danish agency for the Hydrographic Office’s <b>nautical</b> <b>charts,</b> which allowed it to expand its product range and its services on offer to Danish shipping companies. Until the 1950s, Weilbach competed with another <b>nautical</b> <b>chart</b> supplier in the Danish market, but since the late 1950s it has served as the main supplier of <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> to Danish shipping companies.|$|R
5000|$|A naval ship's {{navigator}} {{is responsible}} for buying and maintaining its <b>nautical</b> <b>charts.</b> A <b>nautical</b> <b>chart,</b> or simply [...] "chart", is a graphic representation of a maritime or flight region and adjacent coastal regions. Depending {{on the scale of}} the chart, it may show depths of water and heights of land, natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and man-made aids to navigation, information on tides and currents, local details of the Earth's magnetic field, restricted flying areas, and man-made structures such as harbors, buildings and bridges. <b>Nautical</b> <b>charts</b> are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. <b>Nautical</b> <b>charting</b> may take the form of charts printed on paper or computerised electronic navigational charts.|$|R

50|$|Most UKHO {{publications}} {{are available}} in both paper and digital versions. The UKHO produces <b>charts,</b> <b>nautical</b> publications, and astronomical publications. Notable nautical publications include ADMIRALTY Sailing Directions (Pilots, 74 volumes), ADMIRALTY Tide Tables (6 volumes), ADMIRALTY List of Radio Signals (6 volumes), ADMIRALTY List of Lights and Fog Signals (14 volumes) and more. Notable astronomical publications include The Nautical Almanac and The Astronomical Almanac among others.|$|R
50|$|IMO {{regulations}} {{require the}} officer be fluent in English.

2500|$|Voyage {{planning}} {{starts with}} the appraisal stage. [...] Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed mental model of how the entire voyage will proceed. [...] The appraisal stage consists of gathering and contemplating all information relevant to the voyage. [...] Much of this appraisal is done by consulting <b>nautical</b> <b>charts,</b> <b>nautical</b> publications and performing a number of technical tasks such as weather forecasting, prediction of tides and currents, and checks of local regulations and warnings.|$|R
50|$|A {{navigator}} is {{the person}} on board a ship or aircraft responsible for its navigation. The navigator's primary responsibility is {{to be aware of}} ship or aircraft position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the ship's captain or aircraft commander of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship's <b>nautical</b> <b>charts,</b> <b>nautical</b> publications, and navigational equipment, and generally has responsibility for meteorological equipment and communications.|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} way in which symbols evolved on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts,</b> the identity of originators of these symbols, the spread in their use, and the forces involved in their continuing evolution. A twofold approach is utilized to resolve these questions. First a history of <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> prior to 1800 is presented and second, the actual examination of over 4200 <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> was carried out to discover and document their symbol content. A graphic summary of the symbols used on these charts is presented along with an analysis of the data gathered in 1 ight of the history of nautical cartography. The evolution of the symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> was found to be closely aligned with one of the three types of symbols described by Dreyfuss (1972) : arbitrary, abstract or representational. The arbitrary symbols examined in this study clearly went through an evolutionary process, whereas the abstract and representational symbols remained virtually static throughout the period. The originators of the symbols are given when identifiable and the spread and evolution of the symbols is discussed. From this study it can be concluded that this type of research is most valuable in discovering the evolution of symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> and that the graphic summary could be considered a standard for evaluating the evolution and use of symbols on <b>nautical</b> <b>charts</b> prior to 1800...|$|R
