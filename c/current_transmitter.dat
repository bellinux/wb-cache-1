At {{times during the}} 1966-67 school year, each station {{originated}} a [...] "network feed" [...] which {{was sent to the}} carrier <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> of all wired student housing. At other times for this final school year, WIN and WQAD maintained separate programming.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the 1950s, {{the station}} changed {{frequencies}} and changed operating facilities, eventually moving WRSU to 680 On the AM band, {{with offices in}} the attic of a building located at 12 College Avenue; the carrier <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> were expanded to include operation in 23 dormitory buildings on three campuses. The current offices of the station began to be utilized in 1969 and are located at 126 College Avenue located in the Rutgers Student Center.|$|R

At this time, first, the user device disassociates with its <b>current</b> serving <b>transmitter</b> and deletes all the {{information}} related to it. Because the user device has already used the resources of this transmitter, it cannot disassociate itself as we explained above. In this case, the user device needs to send a disassociation message to its <b>current</b> serving <b>transmitter</b> so that this transmitter can release resources allocated for the user device to avoid the waste of resources.|$|R
50|$|In August 1973, KDUN {{was granted}} a {{construction}} permit to move the studio and transmitter site from Bolon Island (located {{on the site of}} the former drive-in theater) to Lower Smith River Road, its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> location and the studios moved from the transmitter site into town in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, {{the station}} {{had been taken}} off the air. In 1997, the station was rebuilt at its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{location}} of 6211 West 2100 South in West Valley City. On March 10, 1997, the station's callsign was changed back to KRGO. The station returned to the air, airing a Country Western format.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} SAFER Act, WJMN {{kept its}} analog signal on the air until March 3 to inform viewers of the digital {{television}} transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

50|$|Located at {{the summit}} of Provin Mountain is where the {{original}} studios and <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> for WWLP exist. WWLP first signed on from this location in March 1953. WWLP's studios remained there until 2000, when they were moved to Chicopee. The transmitter has remained there, {{as well as the}} current 475 foot (139 m) tower. WAQY, WHTX-LP, and WDMR-LP also maintain transmitters there. WUCS used to operate from this site as WPKX, prior to moving to Hartford in 2012. It is also home to numerous cellular, paging and two-way radio users.|$|R
50|$|During the Fall {{semester}} of 1959, three Siena students envisioned a college radio station {{that would serve}} the resident students and faculty. Carrier <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> were built and installed in the faculty residence and the student residence. The station began broadcasting, using the call sign WVCR (Voice of Collegiate Radio). Although the station only broadcast for six to twelve hours a day, {{until the end of}} the spring semester, it was so well received by both students and faculty, that Siena College formally approved the station concept, supported extending its broadcast area to the surrounding community, and provided new broadcast studios in Plassmann Hall.|$|R
50|$|KALW's {{original}} transmitter was {{a modified}} GE medical diathermy machine. While the original transmitter {{had not been}} used since the switch to the modern FM band in the late 1940s, it was still located at John O'Connell Technical High School until the school was demolished in the mid-1990s. The station's <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> tower is on Twin Peaks.|$|E
50|$|WDVH {{signed on}} the air on in October 1955 from its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{location}} on SE 27th street (formerly known as Kincaid Road). The call letters stand for the three partners that launched the station, Toby Dowdy, Rob Vaughn and Tom Hanson. Toby Dowdy was a country radio musician, Rob Vaughn owned the land and Tom Hanson was a radio station manager. Initially {{it was a day}} time only station.|$|E
50|$|KTFI {{started in}} 1931 with studios at its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> site until 1940 when station owner Florence Gardner {{had a new}} studio {{facility}} built in downtown Twin Falls. The station originally transmitted on 1320 kHz, moved to 1280 kHz in 1934 and then to 1270 kHz in 1942. It also transmitted on 99.7 FM from 1948 until sometime in the 1950s. In about 1980, the station callsign was changed to KTLC when the format was changed to Country.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1958, South, East and West Quad had {{separate}} transmitters, each on {{a different}} frequency, {{as well as one}} on the Hill, with a loop connecting the three studios. In 1958 John Maurer built a limiter and switching device so that sound was constant and could be switched by any studio to feed all transmitters and was wired by Cliff Vander Yacht. Dave Mills had constructed the Hill transmitter the year before and tested it at National Music Camp during the summer. Some years before, the Federal Communications Commission FCC had allocated the call sign even though the carrier <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> were not licensed. (CVY) ...|$|R
30|$|During a hard link {{switching}} procedure, {{user devices}} cannot receive the {{signal from the}} serving transmitter, {{which leads to a}} data interruption problem and then QoS degradation. Thus, the process duration of a hard link switching scheme (i.e., link switching delay), which mainly originates from the scanning period, is an important problem in terms of guaranteeing a seamless data transmission. This problem can be solved effectively in soft link switching. In soft link switching, a user device can simultaneously communicate with two or more <b>transmitters,</b> including its <b>current</b> serving <b>transmitter.</b> The link between the user device and its <b>current</b> serving <b>transmitter</b> is disconnected only after it has successfully connected to the target transmitter.|$|R

50|$|Although one {{of three}} UHF main {{stations}} in Northern Ireland, {{it is the only}} one to feature a stayed mast, the other stations at Brougher Mountain and Limavady both utilising smaller self-supporting towers. Stayed masts are however located at the UHF relay stations at Londonderry and Strabane (respectively former BBC and ITA 405-line relays) and at Black Mountain, the former ITA 405-line main station and <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> of Channel 5 that is sited adjacent to Divis. It is owned and operated by Arqiva.|$|E
50|$|WDPR also {{is heard}} at 89.9 MHz as Greenville {{repeater}} WDPG reaching the northern {{portion of the}} Miami Valley with 50,000 watts. WDPG was founded in 1985 after {{the demise of the}} former WGVO (91.9 MHz), which was operated by the Greenville City Schools. WDPR's old transmitter at 89.5 only operated at 6,000 watts to protect Louisville's WFPL at nearby 89.3. Its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> at 88.1 only operates at 600 watts to protect WNAS in New Albany, Indiana; also at 88.1.|$|E
5000|$|WCCO began {{broadcasting}} in {{the region}} on September 4, 1922 as WLAG, known as [...] "the Call of the North", from a hotel near Loring Park in Minneapolis. However, the station soon landed in financial trouble and closed down in 1924. Washburn Crosby Company, forerunner of General Mills, took over the station and renamed it WCCO for the company's initials. [...] Broadcasts resumed {{less than two months}} later on October 2, 1924 from its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> site in Coon Rapids.|$|E
50|$|WCNI was {{originally}} an on-campus AM radio station broadcast to Connecticut College {{students and staff}} via low-power carrier <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> placed in college dormitories and facilities. Although {{the presence of the}} station encouraged engagement in media arts the quality of its signal was typically poor and its interference with the broadcast signal of New York City's WNBC led to students sometimes turning off the transmitters in their dormitories - most notably during broadcasts of New York Rangers hockey games. This led to an application being filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1972 to allow WCNI to broadcast on FM frequencies. The application was filed by the Connecticut College Broadcast Association, Inc., a non-profit corporation established to limit the college's liabilities from the station's broadcasts to the general public.|$|R
40|$|The {{two main}} {{challenges}} facing {{high data rate}} visible light communication (VLC) are the low modulation bandwidth of the <b>current</b> <b>transmitters</b> (i. e. light emitting diodes, LEDs) and the inter symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. In this paper, we evaluate laser diodes (LDs) {{as a source of}} illumination and communication instead of LEDs for a VLC system in conjunction with an angle diversity receiver (ADR). The main advantage of using LDs is their high modulation bandwidth that enables communication at data rates of multi gigabits per second for VLC when using a suitable receiver, such as an ADR, which mitigates the ISI. Our proposed system uses simple on-off keying (OOK) modulation, and it is able to provide data rates of 5 Gbps and a bit-error-rate (BER) of 10 - 6 in the worst case scenario...|$|R
50|$|On October 20, 2015 the CRTC {{approved}} the CBC's application {{to operate a}} low-power FM rebroadcasting transmitter in Ucluelet, which will operate at 92.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 27 metres). The new transmitter will replace the <b>current</b> AM <b>transmitter,</b> CBXQ 540 kHz.|$|R
50|$|Fisher's Blend Station, {{owner of}} KOMO, bought NBC Blue Network {{affiliate}} KJR from NBC in 1941. In 1944, KOMO switched frequencies with KJR (then at 1000 kHz) and sold KJR off two years later. At its new frequency, KOMO began broadcasting with 50,000 watts {{of power from}} its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> site on Vashon Island in 1948. New studios {{at the corner of}} Fourth and Denny, near what is now the Seattle Center, were dedicated in February 1948 and included space for an expansion into television broadcasting. The cost of the new facility exceeded $1 million.|$|E
50|$|It {{has since}} been made public that the <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> mast (152.5 m) at Divis will be removed and {{replaced}} by a brand new guyed steel mast (192.7 m). This meant {{for a period of}} time there were two broadcast masts at the site in preparation for the digital switchover in the Ulster region which occurred in October 2012. Whilst this was certainly one of the plans, in reality a new 152m guyed mast has been constructed, and the original mast remains to carry the VHF and DAB services.|$|E
50|$|On March 13, 1958, CKAC {{raised its}} power to 50,000 watts full-time, using a {{directional}} antenna pointing east using two towers, as it moved to its <b>current</b> <b>transmitter</b> site located in Saint-Joseph-du-Lac, {{just west of the}} Island of Montreal. The station now had one of the best signals in Eastern Canada, which was quite an exceptional situation for a privately owned station. In the early days of radio in Canada, the CBC used its dual role as regulator and broadcaster to ensure that most of the country's clear-channel allocations went to CBC-owned stations.|$|E
