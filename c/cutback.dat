5|$|In July {{an attempt}} by Representative (and future Vice President) Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to impose a one-year {{moratorium}} on the proposed system-wide cuts failed 214-197. In the end the Senate approved a smaller <b>cutback,</b> citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the North Coast Hiawatha remained on the chopping block. In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E

25|$|On December 4, 2008, Abitibi Bowater {{released}} a statement concerning imminent closure of the pulp and paper mill in Grand Falls-Windsor, representing a <b>cutback</b> of 205 000 tons of paper. The mill produced its last roll of newsprint on February 12, 2009. The closure was effected due to exchange rate volatility, energy, and fiber pricing, as well as structural challenges in the North American newsprint industry. At the time of closure, the paper mill was the second largest employer of the town. From 2016 to 2017, the mill was completely demolished.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this never}} came to fruition; indeed, the Beeching report which led to <b>cutback</b> and closure was {{published}} in 1963, some 31 years before the tunnel was fully constructed. In the report, the line {{was described as a}} duplicate of the Midland Main Line. Apart from the most southerly section into London, the line was closed as a through route in 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe, although a section of the line between Nottingham and Rugby remained open until 1969. The closure became one of Doctor Beeching's largest cutbacks. It was also famous for being one of the most controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} built in its current form: a branch from Watford to St. Albans. However, the line was at times {{connected}} to two other lines. One, the Hatfield and St Albans Railway, opened in 1865 from St. Albans Abbey station to the East Coast main line at Hatfield. Mostly a local route, {{the construction of the}} Midland main line ensured that it never became popular with the critical market of passengers to London. It closed to passengers in 1951, part of a <b>cutback</b> of minor routes after the war. The whole route closed to goods in 1964, though a short stub at the Hatfield end lasted until 1968.|$|E
25|$|On {{its eastern}} end, NY5S was {{gradually}} truncated {{to its current}} terminus in Rotterdam as portions of I-890 was built over the former routing of NY5S between Rotterdam and Schenectady. The first <b>cutback</b> occurred in the early 1970s following the completion of I-890 between downtown Schenectady and exit4. The freeway was completed between the New York State Thruway (I-90) and Schenectady in the mid-1970s, resulting in the truncation of NY5S to I-890 exit2. It was truncated to its current eastern terminus at I-890 (now NY890) in the late 1980s after a reconfiguration of the interchange between the Thruway and I-890 resulted in the removal of River Road between I-890 and the current stub end of Rice Road.|$|E

25|$|The Attorney General {{appealed the}} ICC's ruling, and this appeal was tried in March 1972, but failed, {{resulting}} in the discontinuation of service from Dover Plains to Chatham on March 20, 1972. Penn Central operated the last southbound passenger train between Chatham and Grand Central Terminal on March 20, 1972, ending service {{in the middle of}} the day. Train 935, which was scheduled to leave Grand Central at 4:25 PM and run to Chatham was cut back to Dover Plains. With no scheduled return trip to Chatham, passengers who had gone south in the morning were left stranded, with service going only as far north as Dover Plains (52 miles shy of Chatham). Tracks were removed north of Millerton shortly thereafter. The <b>cutback</b> of service to Chatham was strongly opposed by the Harlem Valley Transportation Association (HVTA), which was led by Lettie Gay Carson.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 1958, the V-107 {{prototype}} performed its maiden flight. In {{order to}} garner publicity {{for the newly}} developed rotorcraft, {{it was decided to}} use the prototype to conduct a series of publicised flight demonstrations during a tour across the United States and several overseas nations. During June 1958, it was announced that the U.S. Army had awarded a contract to Vertol for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft based on the V-107, which were designated as the YHC-1A. However, this order was later decreased to three helicopters; according to aviation author Jay P. Spenser, the <b>cutback</b> had been enacted in order that the U.S. Army would be able to divert funds {{for the development of the}} rival V-114 helicopter, which was also a turbine-powered tandem rotor design but substantially larger than the V-107. All of the U.S. Army's three YHC-1As were powered by pairs of GE-T-58 engines. During August 1959, the first YHC-1A-model rotorcraft conducted its first flight; independently, it was shortly followed by the maiden flight of an improved model intended for the commercial and export markets, designated as the 107-II.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a <b>cutback</b> in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any question about whether nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E

25|$|The {{competitive}} market {{did not actually}} open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute spot market. Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed spot market price. When the market opened in May, wholesale prices averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh. Under surmounting pressure from consumers, the government adopted the Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply (EPCS) Act in December 2002. The legislation capped retail prices at 4.3 cents per kWh and Ontario Power Generation (the successor of Ontario Hydro's electricity generation division) was to provide customers with a rebate for 100% of all electricity charges above that mark, retroactive to the market opening and continuing until 1 May 2006. Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant <b>cutback</b> in new investment in transmission and distribution.|$|E
25|$|On December 3, Hill's family {{announced}} in a Facebook post {{that they had}} signed her up for in-home hospice care. A recent <b>cutback</b> in her steroids dosage, combined with further growth of her tumor, led to more severe symptoms. Three days later, the V Foundation for Cancer Research, founded by late college coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano in 1993 during his own losing fight with cancer, donated $100,000 to TCSN during halftime of the Jimmy V Women's Classic game between Connecticut and Notre Dame. A statement from Hill, taped at her home, was shown during the presentation. Despite her advancing cancer, {{she was able to}} leave hospice care to play in a third game on December 13, the Lions' first game of the season at the Harrington Center against Franklin College. Hill started the game and scored the first two points before being substituted. Hill again started and scored the first basket in the Lions' next game on December 16 against Wooster; the following day, her family announced on Facebook that she had played her last game. At that time, Benjamin sent an email to multiple media outlets stating that Hill would remain on MSJ's bench as an honorary coach as long as her health permitted. On December 30, Hill's goal of raising $1 million for TCSN had been surpassed.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations {{for a new}} CBA {{began in}} early 2010. Team owners and new NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell demanded a <b>cutback</b> in {{salaries}} and benefits under the cap system, promising to lockout the players if no new agreement was reached by March 1, 2011. The NFLPA rejected Goodellâ€™s proposal, requesting to see all league and club financial records to determine what need, if any, the clubs had for a decrease in player costs. The players voted during their 2010 team meetings to end the NFLPAâ€™s status as a labor union as of March 1, 2011, unless a new CBA was reached by that time. Although there was no salary cap in 2010, free agency activity and overall expenditures on players declined, leading the NFLPA to file a collusion case, claiming that the owners had unlawfully agreed to reduce competition for free agents. After failing to make any progress in negotiations, both sides accepted mediation {{under the auspices of}} the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in February 2011. During mediation, players and owners agreed to extend the 2006 CBA by one week. The FMCS failed to mediate a settlement and the previous CBA expired on March 7, 2011. That same day, the NFLPA announced it was no longer a union. This allowed players to file individual antitrust cases, many of which challenged the legality of the impending lockout. Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts were two of the eight named plaintiffs in the action filed in Federal District Court in Minnesota.|$|E
