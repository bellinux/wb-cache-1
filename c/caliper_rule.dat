40|$|Ergonomics is the {{scientific}} discipline that studies {{the interactions between}} human beings and {{the elements of a}} system and presents multiple applications in areas such as clothing and footwear design or both working and household environments. In each of these sectors, knowing the anthropometric dimensions of the current target population is fundamental to ensure that products suit as well as possible most of the users who make up the population. Anthropometry refers {{to the study of the}} measurements and dimensions of the human body and it is considered a very important branch of Ergonomics because its considerable influence on the ergonomic design of products. Human body measurements have usually been taken using <b>rules,</b> <b>calipers</b> or measuring tapes. These procedures are simple and cheap to carry out. However, they have one major drawback: the body measurements obtained and consequently, the human shape information, is imprecise and inaccurate. Furthermore, they always require interaction with real subjects, which increases the measure time and data collecting. The development of new three-dimensional (3 D) scanning techniques has represented a huge step forward in the way of obtaining anthropometric data. This technology allows 3 D images of human shape to be captured and at the same time, generates highly detailed and reproducible anthropometric measurements. The great potential of these new scanning systems for the digitalization of human body has contributed to promoting new anthropometric studies in several countries, such as United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France or USA, in order to acquire accurate anthropometric data of their current population. In this context, in 2006 the Spanish Ministry of Health commissioned a 3 D anthropometric survey of the Spanish female population, following the agreement signed by the Ministry itself with the Spanish associations and companies of manufacturing, distribution, fashion design and knitted sectors. A sample of 10415 Spanish females from 12 to 70 years old, randomly selected from the official Postcode Address File, was measured. The two main objectives of this study, which was conducted by the Biomechanics Institute of Valencia, were the following: on the one hand, to characterize the shape and body dimensions of the current Spanish women population to develop a standard sizing system that could be used by all clothing designers. On the other hand, to promote a healthy image of beauty through the representation of suited mannequins. In order to tackle both objectives, Statistics plays an essential role. Thus, the statistical methodologies presented in this PhD work have been applied to the database obtained from the Spanish anthropometric study. Clothing sizing systems classify the population into homogeneous groups (size groups) based on some key anthropometric dimensions. All members of the same group are similar in body shape and size, so they can wear the same garment. In addition, members of different groups are very different with respect to their body dimensions. An efficient and optimal sizing system aims at accommodating as large a percentage of the population as possible, in the optimum number of size groups that better describes the shape variability of the population. Besides, the garment fit for the accommodated individuals must be as good as possible. A very valuable reference related to sizing systems is the book Sizing in clothing: Developing effective sizing systems for ready-to-wear clothing, by Susan Ashdown. Each clothing size is defined from a person whose body measurements are located toward the central value for each of the dimensions considered in the analysis. The central person, which is considered as the size representative (the size prototype), becomes the basic pattern from which the clothing line in the same size is designed. Clustering is the statistical tool that divides a set of individuals in groups (clusters), in such a way that subjects of the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. In addition, clustering defines each group by means of a representative individual. Therefore, it arises in a natural way the idea of using clustering to try to define an efficient sizing system. Specifically, four of the methodologies presented in this PhD thesis aimed at segmenting the population into optimal sizes, use different clustering methods. The first one, called trimowa, has been published in Expert Systems with Applications. It is based on using an especially defined distance to examine differences between women regarding their body measurements. The second and third ones (called biclustAnthropom and TDDclust, respectively) will soon be submitted in the same paper. BiclustAnthropom adapts to the field of Anthropometry a clustering method addressed in the specific case of gene expression data. Moreover, TDDclust uses the concept of statistical depth for grouping according to the most central (deep) observation in each size. As mentioned, current sizing systems are based on using an appropriate set of anthropometric dimensions, so clustering is carried out in the Euclidean space. In the three previous proposals, we have always worked in this way. Instead, in the fourth and last approach, called kmeansProcrustes, a clustering procedure is proposed for grouping taking into account the women shape, which is represented by a set of anatomical markers (landmarks). For this purpose, the statistical shape analysis will be fundamental. This contribution has been submitted for publication. A sizing system is intended to cover the so-called standard population, discarding the individuals with extreme sizes (both large and small). In mathematical language, these individuals can be considered outliers. An outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations. In our case, a person with extreme anthopometric measurements would be considered as a statistical outlier. Clothing companies usually design garments for the standard sizes so that their market share is optimal. Nevertheless, with their foreign expansion, a lot of brands are spreading their collection and they already have a special sizes section. In last years, Internet shopping has been an alternative for consumers with extreme sizes looking for clothes that follow trends. The custom-made fabrication is other possibility with the advantage of making garments according to the customers' preferences. The four aforementioned methodologies (trimowa, biclustAnthropom, TDDclust and kmeansProcrustes) have been adapted to only accommodate the standard population. Once a particular garment has been designed, the assessing and analysis of fit is performed using one or more fit models. The fit model represents the body dimensions selected by each company to define the proportional relationships needed to achieve the fit the company has determined. The definition of an efficient sizing system relies heavily on the accuracy and representativeness of the fit models regarding the population to which it is addressed. In this PhD work, a statistical approach is proposed to identify representative fit models. It is based on another clustering method originally developed for grouping gene expression data. This method, called hipamAnthropom, has been published in Decision Support Systems. From well-defined fit models and prototypes, representative and accurate mannequins of the population can be made. Unlike clothing design, where representative cases correspond with central individuals, in the design of working and household environments, the variability of human shape is described by extreme individuals, which are those that have the largest or smallest values (or extreme combinations) in the dimensions involved in the study. This is often referred to as the accommodation problem. A very interesting reference in this area is the book entitled Guidelines for Using Anthropometric Data in Product Design, published by The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. The idea behind this way of proceeding is that if a product fits extreme observations, it will also fit the others (less extreme). To that end, in this PhD thesis we propose two methodological contributions based on the statistical archetypal analysis. An archetype in Statistics is an extreme individual that is obtained as a convex combination of other subjects of the sample. The first of these methodologies has been published in Computers and Industrial Engineering, whereas the second one has been submitted for publication. The outline of this PhD report is as follows: Chapter 1 reviews the state of the art of Ergonomics and Anthropometry and introduces the anthropometric survey of the Spanish female population. Chapter 2 presents the trimowa, biclustAnthropom and hipamAnthropom methodologies. In Chapter 3 the kmeansProcrustes proposal is detailed. The TDDclust methodology is explained in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents the two methodologies related to the archetypal analysis. Since all these contributions have been programmed in the statistical software R, Chapter 6 presents the Anthropometry R package, that brings together all the algorithms associated with each approach. In this way, from Chapter 2 to Chapter 6 all the methodologies and results included in this PhD thesis are presented. At last, Chapter 7 provides the most important conclusions...|$|R

The diameter was calculated as the average diameter of 10 biggest CL. Sows were subsequently slaughtered and OR was assessed by dissection of CL from both ovaries (n = 45) and average diameter of the 10 biggest CL was also calculated after measurement of CL with the <b>caliper</b> <b>rule</b> (n = 25). There was a weak relationship between OR counted after dissection of the ovaries and OR counted with TUS (β = 0. 28 ± 0. 01 CL/CL, P = 0. 01), {{but there was a}} strong relationship between the average CL diameter measured with the <b>caliper</b> <b>rule</b> after dissection and the average CL diameter based on TUS (β = 1. 0 ± 0. 1 mm/mm, P < 0. 0001).

In experiment 2, we investigated the relationship between the average CL diameter assessed by TUS (n = 100) at 23. 8 ± 2. 4 d of pregnancy and average piglet birth weight (BW) and observed an increase of 37. 6 ± 17. 8 g in piglet BW per mm increase in average CL diameter measured by TUS (P = 0. 04).

40|$|ABSTRACT Differences in hoof {{balance between}} horses, mules and donkeys were {{identified}} in order to form more specific considerations for proper management of the animals. Measurements of the natural dimensions of hooves in sixty animals were used: 20 horses from the Crioulo breed, 20 mules and 20 donkeys from the Pêga breed. Liveweight was estimated using the correlation equations in each species by heart girth. Using a <b>caliper</b> <b>rule,</b> tape measure and hoof gauge, measurements of the length and width of the frog, hoof height, angle of heel, medial and lateral dorsal length, angle of the toe and crown circumference of the hooves of forelimbs and hindlimb were taken. Within each group the hooves of the hindlimbs exhibited narrower measurements than the hooves of the forelimbs and no difference was observed between the hoof angle of both members of groups. The conformation of the hooves of donkeys is shown to be substantially different from that observed in horses, the mules being in an intermediate condition, being smaller, angled and robust frog and proportionally more developed. Similarly, the hooves of donkeys provide greater support area compared to mules and horses, in descending order, even being dimensionally smaller. We conclude that the hooves of horses, mules and donkeys, have specific patterns of geometric balance that {{must be taken into}} consideration at the time of trimming and imbalance inferences...|$|E

40|$|It is {{currently}} accepted that superoxide anion (O 2 •−) {{is an important}} mediator in pain and inflammation. The role of superoxide anion in pain and inflammation has been mainly determined indirectly by modulating its production and inactivation. Direct evidence using potassium superoxide (KO 2), a superoxide anion donor, demonstrated that it induced thermal hyperalgesia, as assessed by the Hargreaves method. However, {{it remains to be}} determined whether KO 2 is capable of inducing other inflammatory and nociceptive responses attributed to superoxide anion. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the nociceptive and inflammatory effects of KO 2. The KO 2 -induced inflammatory responses evaluated in mice were: mechanical hyperalgesia (electronic version of von Frey filaments), thermal hyperalgesia (hot plate), edema (<b>caliper</b> <b>rule),</b> myeloperoxidase activity (colorimetric assay), overt pain-like behaviors (flinches, time spent licking and writhing score), leukocyte recruitment, oxidative stress, and cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA expression (quantitative PCR). Administration of KO 2 induced mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia, paw edema, leukocyte recruitment, the writhing response, paw flinching, and paw licking in a dose-dependent manner. KO 2 also induced time-dependent cyclooxygenase- 2 mRNA expression in the paw skin. The nociceptive, inflammatory, and oxidative stress components of KO 2 -induced responses were responsive to morphine (analgesic opioid), quercetin (antioxidant flavonoid), and/or celecoxib (anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor) treatment. In conclusion, the well-established superoxide anion donor KO 2 is a valuable tool for studying the mechanisms and pharmacological susceptibilities of superoxide anion-triggered nociceptive and inflammatory responses ranging from mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia to overt pain-like behaviors, edema, and leukocyte recruitment...|$|E

Histologically, necrosis of the graft with great overgrowth of the connective tissue 1 or with hemorrhage ' has been noted. Woglom, 11 who studied regression in the Jensen rat sarcoma, conduded that the tumors were "attacked first at the periphery by some deleterious principle or condition, associated with the connective tissue of the host, " resulting in a (czone of necrobiosis followed by what appears to be secondary fibrosis.

Introdução: A morfologia, a morfometria, a classificação e terminologias acerca do palato duro têm sido pouco estudadas pelos profissionais da Fonoaudiologia, apesar da sua importância na área da motricidade orofacial. Objetivo: Analisar a relação entre as medidas lineares antropométricas de crânio e face com as medidas de largura e comprimento do palato duro. Metodologia: foram utilizados 23 crânios humanos e as medidas foram obtidas com o auxílio de um paquímetro e um pelvímetro. Foram mensuradas as seguintes medidas lineares: comprimento máximo do crânio (G-Op), distância biporion (Bi-Po), largura facial máxima (Bi-Zi), altura nasal (N-Ns), comprimento palatino (Ol-Sta) e largura palatina (Bi-Enm). Resultados: Após a descritiva completa das variáveis, observou-se uma homogeneidade das medidas de crânio, face e palato. Houve correlação com maior significância do comprimento palatino e da largura palatina com a largura facial máxima e a distância biporion respectivamente. A distância biporion foi a única medida que se mostrou significante na explicação, gerando fórmulas para a obtenção do comprimento e da largura palatina. Conclusão: É possível estimar o comprimento (Ol-Sta) e a largura palatina (Bi-Enm) por meio de dois modelos (fórmulas) através da medida da distância biporion (Bi-Po). Como não existe consenso na literatura, há necessidade de padronização na obtenção das medidas lineares do palato. Introduction: The morphology, morphometry, classification, and terminologies that {{refer to}} the hard palate are not {{extensively}} studied by the {{professionals in the field}} of Speech-language pathology and audiology, even though the study of hard palate is of great importance in the orofacial motricity field. Objective: To analyze the relation between anthropometric linear measures of the skull and face with measures of the width and length of the hard palate. Methodology: Measures from 23 human skulls were collected with the assistance of a <b>caliper</b> <b>rule</b> and a pelvimeter. The following linear distances were measured: skull maximum length (G-Op), biporion length (Bi-Po), maximum face width (Bi-Zi), nasal height (N-Ns), palatal length (Ol-Sta), and palatal width (Bi-Enm). Results: After a complete descriptive assessment of the variables, it was observed an homogeneity in the measures of the skull, face and palate. There was a correlation of greater significance between palatal length and palatal width with facial maximum width and biporion distance, respectively. The biporion distance was the only significant measure in the explanation, allowing the development of formulas for obtaining the palatal length and width. Conclusion: It is possible to estimate the palatal length (Ol-Sta) and the palatal width (Bi-Enm) by the two models (formulas) through the measures of the biporion distance (Bi-Po). There is a need for standardization when obtaining the palate linear measures, especially because there is no consensus in the literature about it...|$|E

Participaram 73 voluntários de ambos os sexos (40 homens e 33 mulheres), com idade média de 23 ± 4, 61 anos. As medidas antropométricas largura da palma, comprimento do dedo indicador, espessura da palma, largura da mão, circunferência da palma e da mão foram {{realizadas}} bilateralmente. Para as medidas lineares, utilizou-se um paquímetro digital e, para as medidas de circunferência, a fita métrica. As medidas de força de preensão foram realizadas por meio de um dinamômetro hidráulico (UFTM) Jamar®. Os valores antropométricos foram correlacionados com as medidas de força nas cinco posições de abertura. Os homens e as mulheres tiveram maior força na mão direita e, entre as posições, a maior força dos homens foi na de número 3 (45, 5 ± 15, 53 kgf) e das mulheres, na de posição 2 (25, 5 ± 6, 28 kgf). Verificaram-se correlações significativas entre a força e os valores antropométricos nas medidas da largura da mão e circunferência da palma - que representam a maior medida transversal e o maior trofismo da mão, respectivamente, no grupo dos homens e a medida de comprimento do dedo, que representa a maior medida longitudinal no grupo das mulheres. Com isso, pode-se concluir que, para os homens, a maior força está relacionada à maior medida transversal e ao maior trofismo da mão e, para as mulheres, ao maior comprimento longitudinal da mão.

The study included 73 volunteers (40 male and 33 female) with mean age of 23 ± 4. 61 years old. Anthropometric measures, such as palm width, forefinger length, palm thickness, hand width, palm and hand circumferences, were performed bilaterally. For linear measures, a digital <b>caliper</b> <b>rule</b> was used as well as a tape measure for circumference measures. Grip strength measures were performed by means of a Jamar® hydraulic dynamometer. Anthropometric values were correlated with strength measures in the five positions of the opening.

After the analysis of the results, it was observed that the correlation between the estimated values and the real values was greater for females than it was for males. As to race, the coefficients of correlation were satisfactory. They were greater in the superior arch for the dark mulatto race (0. 67), and in the inferior arch for the light mulatto race (0. 74). Considering the sides, the findings revealed a greater coefficient of correlation for the inferior arch on the left side (0. 61). It was concluded that the Tanaka-Johnston method, in spite of originating from a sample of European descendants, is indicated for the prediction of the mesiodistal diameter of canines and premolars in the different races evaluated in this research. The effectiveness of the referred method was also checked for both genders and sides in the studied sample...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} of this work was to perform a morphometric evaluation of the mandibular foramen of cats with no defined breed {{in order to establish}} its more precise topography and to offer subsides for a more effective local anesthetic blockage of the mandibular alveolar nerve. Thirty adult cats (Felis catus) (5 male and 25 female) with no defined breed were used. After collection and preparation of mandibles {{with the aid of a}} universal <b>caliper</b> <b>rule,</b> the 6 reference points were measured: LONG (from the most lateral margin of the condylar process up to the first inferior incisor tooth); TRANS (from the ventral margin up to the dorsal mandible margin between the second premolar tooth and the first inferior molar tooth); FVENTRAL (from the most rostral margin of the mandibular foramen up to the ventral mandibular margin); ANG (from the end of the most rostral margin of the mandibular foramen up to the mandible angular process), COND (from the end of the most rostral margin of the mandibular foramen up to the medial margin of the mandible condylar process) and COR (from the most rostral margin of the mandibular foramen up to the medial margin of the mandible condylar process). Following, the data obtained were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and to the student’s t-test with p = 0. 05. It was observed that for a better local anesthetic blockage of the inferior alveolar nerve, the needle should be introduced 4. 1 to 4. 4 mm from the mandible ventral margin and 12. 37 to 12. 57 mm from the angular. __________________________________________________________________________________ RESUMOObjetivou-se, avaliar morfometricamente o forame mandibular, em gatos sem raça definida, visando ainda estabelecer de forma mais precisa sua topografia, com vistas a oferecer subsídios para um bloqueio anestésico local mais efetivo do nervo alveolar mandibular. Foram utilizados 30 gatos domésticos (Felis catus) adultos, 5 machos e 25 fêmeas, sem raça definida. Após a coleta e o preparo das mandíbulas, com auxílio de um paquímetro milimetrado tipo universal, foram mensurados 6 pontos de referência, LONG (da borda mais lateral do processo condilar até o primeiro dente incisivo inferior); TRANS (da borda ventral até a borda dorsal da mandíbula entre o segundo dente pré-molar e o primeiro dente molar inferiores); FVENTRAL (da borda mais rostral do forame mandibular até a borda ventral da mandíbula); ANG (da extremidade da borda mais rostral do forame mandibular até o processo angular da mandíbula); COND (extremidade da borda mais rostral do forame mandibular até a borda medial do processo condilar da mandíbula) e COR (da borda mais rostral do forame mandibular até a borda medial do processo condilar da mandíbula). Em seguida os dados obtidos foram submetidos à análise estatística descritiva e ainda aplicou-se o teste T de Student com p= 0, 05 onde observou-se que para um melhor bloqueio anestésico local do nervo alveolar inferior a agulha deverá ser introduzida de 4, 1 a 4, 4 mm da borda ventral da mandíbula e entre 12, 37 a 12, 57 mm partindo do processo angular...|$|E
40|$|Introdução: a cicatriz é o produto final de um conjunto de eventos ordenados para a reparação dos tecidos, porém pode ser insatisfatória e gerar deformidades como os queloides. Em vista do esclarecimento incompleto de sua etiologia, bem como da participação da apoptose celular nessa gênese, os queloides são tratados com índices de sucesso variáveis, como verificado com o uso de corticoide injetável. Objetivo: comparar o efeito da triancinolona injetável em cicatrizes queloidianas quanto ao número de células em apoptose e avaliara o efeito da triancinolona injetável na alteração do comprimento, da altura e da espessura dessas cicatrizes. Casuística e método: foi realizado ensaio clínico longitudinal, prospectivo, controlado, aleatorizado, unicego, com 15 pacientes portadores de queloides de orelha distribuídos em dois grupos: grupo 1, sete pacientes submetidos apenas às exéreses dos queloides; e grupo 2, com oito pacientes submetidos às exéreses das lesões após três sessões de infiltração de 1 mL de hexacetonida de triancinolona (20 mg/mL), com intervalos de três semanas entre elas, assim como entre a última sessão e a operação. Os dois grupos foram homogêneos quanto a: idade (p= 0, 867), gênero (p= 0, 782) e tempo de evolução da cicatriz queloidiana (p= 0, 779). As cicatrizes queloidianas dos pacientes do grupo 2 foram medidas quanto ao comprimento, altura e espessura antes da injeção da triancinolona e antes do procedimento cirúrgico, usando-se paquímetro da marca Rhosse®. As peças cirúrgicas foram coradas com hematoxilina-eosina para detalhamento morfocitológico e quantificação das células por observador mascarado. O índice apoptótico foi determinado pela razão entre o número de células apoptóticas e o número de células totais, multiplicada por 100. Para a quantificação desse índice consideraram-se células apoptóticas as que apresentaram pelo menos três características destas: anoiquia, condensação de citoplasma, condensação nuclear, fragmentação nuclear e fragmentação celular. Resultado: o índice apoptótico no grupo 1 foi de 56, 82 e no grupo 2, de 68, 55, sem diferença (p= 0, 0971). Houve redução do tamanho dos queloides submetidos à infiltração de triancinolona, porém sem significância. As reduções foram 10, 12 % para o comprimento (p= 0, 6598), 11, 94 % para a altura (p= 0, 4981) e 15, 62 % para a espessura (p= 0, 4027). Conclusão: nas condições da realização desta pesquisa, pôde-se concluir que a infiltração de triancinolona nas cicatrizes queloidianas não aumentou o número de apoptoses e não houve redução das dimensões, comprimento, altura e espessura dos queloides. Introduction: Scar is the {{end product}} of ordinated events for the tissues repair; however it may be {{unsatisfactory}} and can generate deformities like keloids. In perspective of the incomplete elucidation of keloid´s etiology, {{as well as the}} involvement of apoptosis in this genesis, they are poorly treated with variable rates of success, as seen with injectable corticosteroids. Objective: To compare the effect of injectable triamcinolone in keloid scars on the number of cells undergoing apoptosis and to evaluate the effect of injectable Triamcinolone in change the length, height and thickness. Methods: This study consists in a prospective, controlled, randomized, single-masked clinical trial, conducted with fifteen patients with ear keloids divided into two groups: group 1 - seven patients underwent excisions of keloids and group 2 - eight patients underwent excisions of lesions after three sessions of infiltration with one mL of Triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg/mL) with three week intervals between them and between the last session and surgery. The two groups were homogeneous regarding age, gender and evolution of keloid scar. The keloid scars of patients in group 2 were measured for the length, height and thickness before injection of triamcinolone and before surgery, using a Rhosse® <b>caliper</b> <b>rule.</b> The specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for morphologic detailing and manually cell quantification by a masked observer. The apoptotic index was defined by the ratio of number of apoptotic cells by total cell number, multiplied by one hundred. To quantifying the apoptotic index we considered apoptotic cells if they presented at least three characteristics as anoiquia, cytoplasmatic condensation, nuclear condensation, nuclear fragmentation and cell fragmentation. Results: The apoptotic index in group 1 was 56. 82 and 68. 55 in group 2, showing no significant difference in apoptosis (p = 0. 0971). There was reduction in the size of triamcinolone infiltrated keloids, but it was not significative. The reduction was 10. 12 % on the length (p = 0., 6598), 11. 94 % on the height (p = 0. 4981) and 15. 62 % on the thickness (p = 0. 4027). Conclusion: This study, in its conditions, concluded that the infiltration of triamcinolone in keloid scars has not increased the number of apoptosis and has not reduced the size, length, height and thickness of keloid...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo avaliou a eficiência da oleuropeína (OLE) (composto fenólico extraído das folhas de Oliveira) isolada e associada aos sanitizantes comerciais ácido peracético 2 % (APA), hipoclorito de sódio 2 % (HS), peróxido de hidrogênio 3 % (PH), digluconato de clorexidina 2 % (DC), cloreto de benzalcônio 1 % (CB) e iodofor 2 % (IO), para inativação de células em suspensão e biofilmes monoespécie e multiespécie formados em superfícies de aço inoxidável ou microplaca de poliestireno por Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) e Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), todas classificadas como fortes produtores de biofilmes. Os isolados foram semeados em caldo TSB (caldo tripticase soja), incubados (37 °C/ 24 h) e corrigidos a ~ 108 células/mL (escala 0, 5 McFarland). Para bactérias em suspensão, a resistência a sanitizantes foi determinada pela Concentração Inibitória Mínima (CIM) em tubos e pelo método de Disco Difusão em Ágar (DDA), no qual as bactérias foram plaqueadas em ágar TSA contendo discos de 6 mm de papel filtro embebidos nos sanitizantes. Após a incubação, a medição dos halos de inibição foi feita com paquímetro. Para os ensaios de resistência dos biofilmes aos compostos sanitizantes, foram utilizadas microplacas de poliestireno 96 poços, as quais foram preparadas para incubação-fixação dos biofilmes e submetidas à leitura em espectrofotômetro de ELISA (600 nm). Em seguida, as placas foram lavadas com solução salina tamponada (PBS, pH 7. 4) e os sanitizantes inseridos por 1 minuto. Após neutralização com tiossulfato de sódio (5 minutos), as placas foram lavadas com PBS e metanol, coradas com cristal violeta 1 % e coradas com ácido acético glacial (33 %) para nova leitura a 570 nm. A eficácia da remoção do biofilme pelos sanitizantes foi comparada pelo índice de formação de biofilme (IFB). As imagens do aço inoxidável após tratamento com sanitizante foram feitas através de Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura (MEV) e Microscopia Confocal, para visualizar a persistência dos biofilmes. Os valores de CIM (diluição 1 : 2) mostraram que OLE não teve atividade bactericida. No método DDA, L. monocytogenes, foi resistente à OLE, enquanto E. coli e S. aureus apresentaram resistência intermediária. Os sanitizantes comerciais apresentaram boa atividade bactericida nos ensaios de CIM e DDA, sendo que as associações de OLE aos sanitizantes comerciais aumentaram o efeito germicida. Nos ensaios com biofilmes em monoespécie, somente os sanitizantes comerciais, isolados ou associados com OLE, foram eficazes de reduzir o valor de BFI em microplaca de poliestireno. Em biofilmes multiespécie, OLE apresentou efeito antimicrobiano, sobretudo sobre a associação de L. monocytogenes + E. coli + S. aureus (redução: 91, 49 %). Nenhum dos compostos avaliados foi capaz de inativar completamente os biofilmes nas superfícies de aço inoxidável, uma vez que células viáveis foram observadas após os tratamentos com os sanitizantes, indicando persistência dos biofilmes. Os resultados indicam que a oleuropeína apresentou potencial para incrementar o efeito bactericida de sanitizantes comerciais para eliminação de biofilmes em superfícies inertes, sendo necessários estudos para compreender os mecanismos de ação dessas combinações. This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} oleuropein (OLE) (a phenolic compound extracted from Oliveira leaves) alone or in association with commercial sanitizers peracetic acid 2 % (PPA), sodium hypochlorite 2 % (SH), hydrogen peroxide 3 % (HP), chlorhexidine digluconate 2 % (CD), benzalkonium chloride 1 % (BC) and iodophor 2 % (IO), for inactivation of suspended cells and monospecies or multispecies biofilms formed on stainless steel surfaces or microplate polystyrene by Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), all classified as strong producers of biofilms. The isolates were grown in TSB (trypticase soy broth), incubated (37 °C/ 24 h) and adjusted to ~ 108 cells/mL (0. 5 McFarland scale). For the bacterial suspensions, resistance to sanitizers was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in tubes and by Agar Disk Diffusion (ADD), in which the bacteria were plated on TSA agar containing 6 mm disks of filter paper soaked in sanitizers. After incubation, measurement of the inhibition halos was done using a <b>caliper</b> <b>rule.</b> For the sanitizer resistance assays with biofilms, polystyrene 96 -well microplates were prepared for incubation-fixing of biofilms and read in an ELISA spectrophotometer (600 nm). After, the plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7. 4) and the sanitizers were placed for 1 minute. After neutralization with sodium thiosulfate (5 minutes), the plates were washed with PBS and methanol, stained with 1 % crystal violet and stained with glacial acetic acid (33 %) for a new reading at 570 nm. The effectiveness of biofilm removal by each sanitizer was compared using a Biofilm Formation Index (IFB). The images from stainless steel coupons after treatments with sanitizers were obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Microscopy, to view the persistence of biofilms. MIC values (dilution 1 : 2) showed that OLE had no bactericidal activity. In the ADD assays, L. monocytogenes was resistant to OLE, while E. coli and S. aureus showed intermediate resistance. Commercial sanitizers showed good bactericidal activity in both CIM and DDA assays, and the associations of OLE with commercial sanitizers increased their germicidal effect. In the monospecies biofilm assays, only commercial sanitizers, isolated or associated with OLE, were effective for reducing the BFI values in polystyrene microplates. In multispecies biofilms, OLE had an antimicrobial effect, especially on the association of L. monocytogenes + E. coli and S. aureus (reduction: 91. 49 %). None of the compounds evaluated was able to completely inactivate the biofilms on the stainless steel surfaces, since viable cells of bacteria were observed after treatment with sanitizers, indicating persistence of biofilms. The results indicate that oleuropein {{has the potential to}} enhance the bactericidal effect of commercial sanitizers to eliminate biofilms on inert surfaces. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action of these combinations...|$|E
