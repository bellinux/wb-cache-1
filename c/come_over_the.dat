McGovern's two electoral vote victories came in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, and he failed to win {{his home state of}} South Dakota (which however had gone Democratic in only three of the previous eighteen presidential elections, and which would continue to go Republican in presidential elections to <b>come).</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> nation as a whole he carried a mere 134counties. At just over four percent of the nation's counties, McGovern's county wins remain the fewest by almost a factor of three for any major-party nominee.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on {{a two-month}} {{retrospective}} of over 40 of Grant's films. In 1982, he was honored with the [...] "Man of the Year" [...] award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He turned 80 in 1984; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a [...] "serenity" [...] had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> actor. Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year. In {{the last few years}} of his life, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show, A Conversation with Cary Grant, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years, from New Jersey to Texas, and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time. Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were [...] "ego-fodder", remarking that [...] "I know who I am inside and outside, but it's nice to have the outside, at least, substantiated".|$|E

In 2013 Kidd characterised the situation as a nuclear slowdown, requiring the industry to focus on better economics and improving public acceptance.|$|E

2500|$|In India, Lord Ellenborough had {{softened}} {{his earlier}} attitude. His primary {{objective was to}} avoid {{the expense of a}} long war. He ordered Nott and Pollock to retreat, arguing that once the British had evacuated Afghanistan, negotiations with Akbar Khan for the release of the hostages could proceed calmly. Ellenborough was opposed by his generals and by the government in Britain, all of whom insisted that stern retribution was required. He accordingly modified his orders. Pollock and Nott were again ordered to retreat, but Nott was allowed to retreat by way of Kabul if he chose, making a detour of over , and Pollock was also permitted to move to Kabul to cover Nott's retreat. The late nineteenth-century historian John William Kaye wrote that, [...] "No change had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> views of Lord Ellenborough, but a change had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> meaning of certain words in the English language." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the Liberals had {{intentionally}} scheduled {{the mandatory}} [...] "opposition days" [...] (where a specified opposition party controls the agenda) on November 15 (Conservative), November 17 (Bloc Québécois) and November 24 (NDP). These days meant that any election would <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Christmas season, an unpopular idea. Following {{negotiations between the}} opposition parties, they instead issued an ultimatum to the Prime Minister to call an election immediately after the Christmas holidays or face an immediate non-confidence vote which would prompt a holiday-spanning campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{releases}} from Benbrook Lake {{are made}} primarily through a [...] gated conduit at the southeast {{end of the}} dam. When waters rise too quickly to be released by this method, then the lake may flow over the uncontrolled spillway at the northwest end of the dam. This spillway is a [...] concrete weir with a , [...] notch in its center. As of 2005, there have only been five occasions on which the lake has been high enough for water to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> spillway and through this notch. The lake has never been high enough {{to go over the}} entire width of the spillway, which is to be expected as the spillway was designed that this should happen only during a 100-year flood event.|$|E
2500|$|The Culebra {{exercises}} {{became the}} first of many fleet landing exercises to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, consisting of the occupation and defense of the island by the advanced base force brigade. The brigade emplaced batteries of [...] field guns {{on each side of the}} entrance to Culebra's harbor and laid controlled mines offshore; the aggressor forces were simulated by a detached Marine battalion landing force with the Atlantic Fleet. The signal company, in addition to laying mines, provided communications (telegraph and telephone) for the brigade, established radio stations, and operated day and night visual stations. The engineers assisted the fixed gun companies in the preparation of gun emplacements, built docks, and established machine gun positions on certain parts of the harbor shore line. The first artillery battery emplaced [...] guns in permanent positions, holding its [...] field pieces in reserve.|$|E

2500|$|After Kennedy {{gave his}} July 25, 1969 {{televised}} speech regarding the incident, supporters responded with telephone calls and telegrams to newspapers {{and to the}} Kennedy family. They were heavily in favor of his remaining in office, and he was re-elected in 1970, with 62% of the vote, a margin of nearly a half million votes. Nonetheless, the incident severely damaged his national reputation and reputation for judgment; one analyst asked, [...] "Can we really trust him if the Russians <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ice cap? Can he {{make the kind of}} split-second decisions the astronauts had to make in their landing on the moon?" [...] Before Chappaquiddick, public polls showed that a large majority expected Kennedy to run for the presidency in 1972. After the incident, he pledged not to run in 1972 and declined to serve as George McGovern's running mate that year. In 1974, he pledged not to run in 1976, {{in part because of the}} renewed media interest in Chappaquiddick.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1972, Sunnyside Baptist Church invited Mel and Norma Gabler to speak about their work during a Wednesday night service. In {{spite of the fact}} that neither of The Gablers had any college degrees, and neither {{attended}} secondary education for more than a year they were very active in school textbook issues in the state of Texas and made great strides in restoring that state’s public education system from the historical revisionism that they and many others saw in their students' curriculum. Neal Frey, who worked with the Gablers since 1972 and now runs the organization, said [...] "that Mrs. Gabler’s larger public role was deceptive. [...] "Mr. Gabler wore the pants in that family, and Mrs. Gabler wanted it that way". The Gablers identified the changes that had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> teaching of history as generation after generation of textbooks had the Christian founding of America expunged from them. They claimed that America was losing its Christian heritage because children were never introduced to it in schools: [...] "Allowing a student to come to his own conclusion about abstracts and concepts creates frustration. Ideas, situation ethics, values, anti-God humanism - that's what the schools are teaching. And concepts. Well, a concept will never do anyone as much good as a fact". During the service, pastor Boydstun sensed a mission to provide education within a Christian setting for the students of southwest Oklahoma City. After further discussion, the church established a committee to investigate the feasibility of a Christian school and later to begin the development of the school program.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Pink Moon {{garnered}} a {{small amount}} of critical attention. Jerry Gilbert, who had conducted the only known interview with Drake the previous year, wrote the first review of Pink Moon; he was not impressed. Writing in Sounds in March 1972, Gilbert stated that, [...] "The album consists entirely of Nick's guitar, voice and piano and features all the usual characteristics without ever matching up to Bryter Layter. One has to accept that Nick's songs necessarily require further augmentation, for whilst his own accompaniments are good the songs are not sufficiently strong to stand up without any embroidery at all. 'Things Behind The Sun' makes it, so does 'Parasite' – but maybe it's time Mr. Drake stopped acting so mysteriously and started getting something properly organised for himself." [...] Another early review was written by critic Mark Plummer and appeared in Melody Maker in May 1972. Plummer appreciated the music, but was distracted by Drake's growing ascetic mythology: [...] "His music is so personal and shyly presented both lyrically and in his confined guitar and piano playing that neither does nor doesn't <b>come</b> <b>over...</b> <b>The</b> more you listen to Drake though, the more compelling his music becomes – but all the time it hides from you. On 'Things Behind The Sun', he sings to me, embarrassed and shy. Perhaps one should play his albums with the sound off and just look at the cover and make the music in your head reciting his words from inside the cover to your own rhythmic heart rhymes... It could be that Nick Drake does not exist at all." [...] Stephen Holden, in a more enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone magazine, said [...] "the beauty of Drake's voice is its own justification. May it become familiar to us all." ...|$|E
