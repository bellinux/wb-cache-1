40|$|This paper {{presents}} the find of a Mammuthus pritnigenius <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> Mousterian implements from the Last Glacial site of Asolo, in north-eastern Italy. We review {{the exploitation of}} proboscidean <b>carcasses</b> at Lower <b>and</b> Middle Paleolithic sites of Africa, Europe and the Levant, including evidence of elephant killing, and summarize recent research on hafting and use of Mousterian points as spearheads already {{before the end of}} the Middle Pleistocene. The bones and implements from Asolo are described in detail; we provide information on other Italian sites with mammoth remains and on the Mousterian record of the north-eastern quadrant of the peninsula. A possible impact fracture has been detected on a Levallois point from Asolo; its interpretation is based on comparisons to similar scars found on spear points of verified function from archaeological sites of later age, and on experimental material. We conclude that the evidence of Asolo is consistent with information from a number of Western European sites supporting a picture of Neanderthals as capable hunters of large game, such as woolly mammoth.

40|$|A needle-free transdermal {{injection}} {{device was}} evaluated for effectiveness of vaccine delivery and for injection site lesions. A total of 96 pigs were vaccinated for pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo.). Pigs {{were divided into}} three groups; the first group served as unvaccinated controls, the second group was vaccinated with conventional hypodermic needles, and a third group was vaccinated with a needle-free, air-powered injection device. Pigs were tattooed on the neck to mark the injection sites. Blood samples were collected from the pigs at 11 − 13 days and 23 − 25 days after injection, and the serological response was measured. Injection sites were collected at slaughter and dissected to evaluate tissue damage. The results showed that both injection methods produced similar serological responses in the vaccinated pigs and both were significantly greater than the unvaccinated controls. The injection site examinations have shown no lesions {{in any of the}} pigs. The results show the needle-free, transdermal injection device to be effective and safe. Elimination of needles will prevent residual needle fragments in <b>carcasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>associated</b> <b>carcass</b> defects from injection site lesion...|$|R
