25|$|The venom {{from this}} species {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of several drugs. One is called echistatin, which is an anticoagulant. Even though many other snake venoms contain similar toxins, echistatin is not only especially potent, but also simplistic in structure, which makes it easier to replicate. Indeed, it is obtained not only through the purification of whole venom, but also as a product of chemical synthesis. Another drug made from E. carinatus venom is called ecarin and is the primary reagent in the ecarin <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> (ECT) test, which is used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin. Yet another drug produced from E. carinatus venom is Aggrastat (Tirofiban).|$|E
25|$|In insects, synephrine {{has been}} found to be a very potent agonist at many {{invertebrate}} octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the Thrombotest reagent {{used with a}} steel ball coagulometer (KC) to the ISI of the same reagent used with the manual (tilt tube) technique. METHODS: The study {{was carried out by}} eight {{laboratories}} using their own KC instrument and method of testing. All laboratories used the same batch of Thrombotest to determine the <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> of fresh blood samples from 20 local healthy volunteers and 60 patients on long term oral anticoagulant therapy. KC <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> were plotted against manual <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> on double logarithmic scales. Orthogonal regression lines were calculated to assess the ISI. RESULTS: In two laboratories the ISI of the KC method was lower than that of the manual method; these differences, however, were 2 % or less. In the other laboratories no clinically important differences were observed between ISI values obtained. However, the <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> determined with the KC methods were shorter than the manual values. CONCLUSIONS: The ISI of Thrombotest determined with the KC methods was very similar to the manual value. Therefore, use of the ISI value supplied by the manufacturer without adjustment is justified. The mean normal prothrombin time, however, must be determined locally...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} pharmacokinetic {{variables and}} {{to evaluate the}} influence on <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> after SC administration of single doses of dalteparin and enoxaparin to horses. ANIMALS: 5 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES: The study {{was designed as a}} 4 -period crossover study. Each horse received a single SC injection of dalteparin (50 and 100 anti-Xa U/kg) and enoxaparin (40 and 80 anti-Xa U/kg). Plasma anti-Xa activities and <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> were measured, and pharmacokinetic variables were determined. Absolute and relative maximal prolongation of <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> was calculated, and correlation between plasma anti-Xa activities and <b>clotting</b> <b>times</b> was determined. RESULTS: The SC administration of each of the doses of the 2 preparations was well tolerated. Time course of the anti-Xa activities could be described in a 1 -compartment model. Comparison of low- and high-dose treatments revealed a disproportionate increase of the area under the plasma activity-time curve and prolongation of the terminal half-life, but the increase in maximum plasma activity was proportionate, and peak plasma concentrations corresponded with concentrations recommended in human medicine. There were only mild changes in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), whereas the influence on thrombin time (TT) was greater, dose-dependent, and more variable. A weak-to-moderate correlation between aPTT and plasma anti-Xa activities and a moderate-to-strong correlation between TT and plasma anti-Xa activities were found. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pharmacokinetic and anticoagulatory properties of low-molecular-weight heparins in horses are similar to those found in humans. Once-daily SC administration of dalteparin or enoxaparin may be useful as an anticoagulatory treatment in horses...|$|R

40|$|Serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is {{a normal}} plasma {{constituent}} in man with a circulating concentration of approximately 40 micrograms/ml. Supraphysiological amounts of SAP (150 - 300 micrograms/ml) {{have been reported to}} affect coagulation. We have investigated this further by studying the effect of SAP upon <b>clot</b> <b>times</b> in both the absence and presence of heparin, a suggested ligand for SAP and itself a modulator of coagulation processes. In the absence of heparin, SAP (5 - 125 micrograms/ml) had no effect on <b>clot</b> <b>times</b> generated by Activated Thrombofax Reagent, brain thromboplastin, Russell's Viper Venom or thrombin when assessed in normal citrated plasma. However, in the presence of amounts of heparin that had only a minor effect upon <b>clot</b> <b>times,</b> SAP (5 - 40 micrograms/ml) greatly prolonged clot formation, with the thrombin time the most sensitive to SAP. This suggested that the primary effect of SAP was at this distal level of the coagulation pathway. Evaluation by radioimmunoassay revealed that supraphysiological concentrations of SAP (150 - 300 micrograms/ml) alone reduced by approximately 25 % the release of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) from fibrinogen. In the presence of heparin, substantial synergism was observed with maximal reductions of approximately 70 % in FPA production requiring only 25 - 50 micrograms/ml SAP. This inhibition correlated with increased thrombin <b>clot</b> <b>time</b> but was unrelated to any direct modulation in either the activities of anti-thrombin III or activated Factor XIII, and was independent of an alteration in the rate of fibrinolysis. Further, while SAP itself did not interfere with the process of spontaneous fibrin polymerization, in the presence of heparin a prolonged polymerization time (greater than 145 %) was observed.

40|$|Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) is a {{recently}} identified fibrinolysis inhibitor in plasma, that when converted to an enzyme potently attenuates fibrinolysis. It is activated by relatively {{high concentrations of}} thrombin that exceed the thrombin concentration required for fibrin formation. These high concentrations of thrombin are generated by the intrinsic pathway via activation of factor XI by thrombin. The down regulation of fibrinolysis by TAFI {{can be measured in}} a clot lysis assay. When the <b>clot</b> lysis <b>times</b> of healthy individuals were determined, large inter-individual differences were observed. To determine if differences in concentration of TAFI explain the variation in clot lysis between individuals, specific assays were developed for the measurement of TAFI antigen and activity in plasma. In normal plasma, there was a dose-dependent relationship between TAFI antigen and TAFI activity. There was also a correlation between <b>clot</b> lysis <b>time</b> and plasma TAFI antigen, indicating that the amount of TAFI that is activated during the clot lysis assay, is dependent on the concentration of TAFI.

40|$|To {{explore the}} effect(s) of growth hor-mone {{signaling}} on thrombosis, we stud-ied signal transduction and transcription factor 5 (STAT 5) –deficient mice and found markedly reduced survival in an in vivo thrombosis model.

There was a modest {{increase in the}} activ-ity of several procoagulant factors, {{but there was no}} difference in the rate or magnitude of thrombin generation in STAT 5 -deficient mice relative to control. However, thrombin-triggered <b>clot</b> <b>times</b> were markedly shorter, and fibrin polymer-ization occurred more rapidly in plasma from STAT 5 -deficient mice. Fibrinogen depletion and mixing studies indicated that the effect on fibrin polymerization was not due to intrinsic changes in fibrino-gen, but resulted from changes in the concentration of a circulating plasma in-hibitor. While thrombin-triggered <b>clot</b> <b>times</b> were significantly shorter in STAT 5 -deficient animals, reptilase-triggered <b>clot</b> <b>times</b> were unchanged. Accordingly, while the rate of thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptide A was similar, the release of fibrinopeptide B was accelerated in STAT 5 -deficient plasma versus control. Taken together, these studies demon-strated that the loss of STAT 5 resulted in a decrease in the concentration of a plasma inhibitor affecting thrombin-triggered cleavage of fibrinopeptide B. This ultimately resulted in accelerated fibrin polymerization and greater thrombo-sis susceptibility in STAT 5 -deficient ani-mals. (Blood. 2010; 116 (25) : 5724 - 5733...|$|R
