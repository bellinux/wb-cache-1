5|$|According to Amineri, {{one of the}} mod's core developers, initial {{versions}} of Long War used <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game's configuration file to change content in the game.

Many of the mod's key features, including the increased number of soldiers and the lengthened campaign, first appeared in version beta 1.9, which was released in mid 2013. Shortly after Enemy Within released, Amineri and XMarksTheSpot completed development of a Java-based tool called upkmodder that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod.
