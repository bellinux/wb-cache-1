Eighty-four hours later, pistils were dissected to recover the pollen tubes, expended exudate, and labeled tissues of the stigma and style. Distribution of label revealed that at least 25 % of the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>substance</b> in excised pollen tubes was derived from G- 100 -I. The composition of expended exudate adhering to pollen tubes, of pollen tube cytoplasm, and of pollen tube walls suggests that utilization of exudate by growing pollen tubes involves uptake and incorporation into pollen tube cytoplasm of exudate polysaccharide fragments followed by extensive metabolism of at least a portion of the incorporated carbohydrate prior to its utilization for pollen tube wall biosynthesis. Results suggest the presence of at least two polysaccharide components in G- 100 -I, one which resists major degradation following injection into the style and another which undergoes measurable degradation both before and after entry into the pollen tube...|$|E
40|$|A {{quick and}} {{reliable}} technique for {{the identification of}} group B streptococci has been developed. The method requires no elaborate equipment or expensive reagents {{and can be used}} to detect the group B organisms in mixed broth cultures or to identify suspect colonies selected from agar plates. The method is a coagglutination technique in which 1 drop of specifically sensitized protein A-containing Staphylococcus aureus is mixed with 1 drop of supernatant of an actively growing culture. The soluble group-specific <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>substance</b> of the group B streptococci reacts with the staph particles to produce agglutination that is macroscopically readable. One colony of group B streptococci taken from an agar plate and inoculated into Todd-Hewitt broth will give a positive reaction within 6 h of incubation; with a larger inoculum, the positive reaction occurs within a shorter period. The method was applied for detection of group B streptococci in mixed broth cultures. In laboratory studies involving random mixtures of organisms, 59. 3 % of positive cultures were detected within the first 8 h of incubation, and 71. 7 % were found within 24 h. In clinical studies with mixed broth cultures grown directly from vaginal swabs, 78. 6 % of the positive cultures were detected within the first 8 h of incubation, and 92. 9 % were found within 24 h...|$|E

For example, these antibodies and their light chains exhibit marked restriction in electrophoretic mobility (1, 2). Quantitative precipitin studies with anti-allotypic sera indicate exclusion of allotypic markers (3). Analysis of the three N-terminal amino acid residues of the L chains has revealed a marked restriction in amino acid sequence heterogeneity when compared to normal light chains (4, 5).

40|$|Contagious bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is {{a severe}} {{respiratory}} disease of cattle that causes economic loses {{of up to}} 40 million Euros annually in sub-Saharan Africa. The preferred method of control is vaccination however the currently available vaccine confers insufficient and short term immunity hence there is {{need to develop a}} better vaccine. The disease is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) a pathogen that belongs to a group of closely related pathogens, the M. mycoides cluster. Mmm only causes pneumonia in cattle and related species but not in sheep or goats, suggesting that there must be a specific interaction between bovine lung cells and Mmm. Calves younger than six months on the other hand do not develop pneumonia but rather arthritis and associated lameness. The aim of thesis is to assess the adherence of Mmm to host cells and to further identifiy Mmm specific monoclonal antibodies that block this binding. This is the first study to describe the adhesion process for Mmm. Our hypothesis is that prevention of binding between Mmm and bovine lung epithelial cells in vivo will prevent severe disease. The identification of the Mycoplasma adhesin(s) that mediate this interaction could be candidate vaccine targets. The specific objectives of this study are to assess the manifestation of CBPP in 7 month old calves and to compare in- contact and intubation methods of infection, establish an indirect flow cytometry assay to measure Mycoplasma adherence to different host cells and produce a panel of Mmm- specific monoclonal antibodies, and select for mAbs that inhibit Mmm adherence to bovine lung epithelial cells; select <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>substances</b> with different functional groups and test their ability to inhibit Mmm cyto-adherence.

40|$|A {{previous}} report (1) from this laboratory {{was concerned with}} the preparation and properties of a water-soluble fraction, essentially a polysaccharide, from each of five yeast-like fungi. Tested by direct precipitation against the corresponding antisera these polysaccharides exhibited only partial specificity, cross-precipitin reactions being frequent. By absorption of predpitin on the intact mycotic bodies, however, a relatively high degree of specific precipitability was demonstrated for the soluble substances.

Aside from these fractions, other workers have described antigenic substances obtained by various chemical manipulations. Perlzweig and Steffen (3) in 1923 reported the finding of a material derived from the pneumococcus which was capable of active immunization upon injection into rabbits but which survived digestion with trypsin, was non-lipoidal, and gave Millon, xanthroproteic and ninhydrin reactions. Perlzweig and Keefer (4) in 1925 described an actively immunizing substance of a protein nature isolated from broth culture filtrates of Pneumococcus Type I by ultrafiltration, precipitation at a definite hydrogen ion concentration and the separation of a soluble picrate fraction. Jungeblut (5) has described an alcohol soluble substance which under certain conditions reacts specifically by precipitation with type sera. The latest studies of Julianelle (6) on skin and conjunctival hypersensitiveness in rabbits treated with products of the pneumococcus suggest the presence of a third non-type specific substance in that organism. In this paper evidence will be presented which points to the presence of a substance other than the specific carbohydrate in the autolytic products of Pneumococci Type I which reacts specifically with immune serum as determined either by the precipitin reaction, or, in vivo, by the anaphylactic behavior of guinea pigs appropriately sensitized.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for a hundred years that {{formaldehyde}} polymerizes to <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>substances</b> in alkaline media. Although the reaction has long attracted much attention, only recently has a detailed qualitative analysis of the products been carried out by chromatographic methods. We have started to re-examine this reaction by combining chromatography with radioactive tracer techniques in the hope of refining the quantitative aspects of the analysis. Our particular interest has been to develop methods for determining the relative proportions of ribose and ribulose in the mixtures of sugars formed in basic media, as well as under other polymerizing conditions. The finding of large amounts of these sugars might help to explain the occurrence of ribose as the only basic sugar in the fundamental replicating molecules [...] the nucleic acids. Formaldehyde is thought to have been present in the primitive reducing atmosphere which existed before life first appeared. The ribonucleic acids must have appeared in the constitution of reproducing systems at a very early stage in the development of living organisms.

However, {{in the study of}} bacterial polysaccharides, we have found many interesting cross-reactions that by theory would not have been expected. Among these, the one here reported is of special interest, from both a theoretical as well as a practical point of view. Przemycki (2) obtained a specific <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>substance</b> from the B. proteus organism; Furth and Landsteiner (3) also obtained a carbohydrate from B. proteus which they found to be specific. Combiesco, Soru and Stamatesco (4) have described a specific carbohydrate obtained from anthrax, and some of the chemical properties, such as rotation, presence of pentoses, hexoses, etc. The wide difference between the meningococci and the Grampositive bacilli would not lead one to suspect an immunological relationship between the carbohydrates of the two groups. Our first observation was accidental, and occurred when tests were made to determine the specificity of the anthrax polysaccharide with various immune sera. In the case of the antimeningococcus serum, we observed that an immediate precipitate formed, which increased after incubation. This was repeated with many different samples of antimeningococcic sera.

Differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 μg/ml) at pH levels of 7. 0 to 5. 5, demonstrated an effect of both pH and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. Strains of Streptococcus and Neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at pH levels as low as 6. 0 with fluoride levels up to 50 μg/ml. The most commonly isolated streptococci were Streptococcus mitior and S. salivarius. S. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 μg of fluoride per ml at pH 6. 0 and 6. 5, respectively. Veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at pH 6. 0 with 100 μg of fluoride per ml. Despite their known fluoride resistance, Actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. The pH of the medium had a definite selective effect, {{as the number of}} colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at pH 6. 0 was only 30 % of that at pH 7. 0. Representative strains of S. mutans, S. mitior, S. sanguis, and S. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the pH and fluoride levels of the medium on which they were initially isolated. Fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in {{the presence or absence of}} fluoride. The isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the pH range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community.

Hot formamide extraction of the cell walls results in a soluble fraction of group-specific carbohydrate and an insoluble residue. The Group A carbohydrate in this instance is composed of rhamnose and N-acetylglucosamine. The composition of the insoluble residue {{is similar to that of}} the mucopeptide fractions released from the cell wall by phage-associated lysin. This residue was shown by electron microscopy to be composed of discrete discs which appear similar in structure to the intact cell wall. The specific carbohydrate obtained by hot formamide extraction of Group A-variant cell walls was composed almost exclusively of rhamnose. The residue fraction was similar to that of Group A. The residue of cell walls extracted with hot formamide is extensively solubilized not only by phage-associated lysin and S. albus enzyme, but also by lysozyme, which has no measurable effect on the intact streptococcal cell wall...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{soil quality}} after 45 years of {{continuous}} production of corn (Zea mays L.) by the conventional tillage method (C) compared with adjacent poplar forest (F) and native grassland (G) sites were examined. The investigated parameters were: total and humified organic C, total N, light fraction content and composition, water-soluble organic C (WSOC), water-soluble <b>carbohydrates</b> (WSC), phenolic <b>substances,</b> biomass C, cumulative CO(2) -C (soil respiration) (C(m)), enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, protease, beta -glucosidase, urease, catalase and dehydrogenase). Empirical indexes of soil quality were also calculated: biomass C/organic C, specific respiration of biomass C (qCO(2)), death rate quotient (qD), metabolic potential (MP), biological index of fertility (BIF), enzyme activity number (EAN) and hydrolysing coefficient (HC). Results indicate that long-term corn production at an intensive level caused a marked decline in all examined parameters. Between the undisturbed systems, native grassland showed higher values of soil quality parameters than forest site. The indexes most responsive to management practices that may provide indications {{of the effects}} of soil cultivation, {{as well as of the}} differently undisturbed ecosystems were: organic C, WSC, C(m), protease, beta -glucosidase, urease and HC. Soil enzyme activities were well related with, and not more sensitive than organic carbon...|$|R

Introduction: The word {{carbohydrates}} is used {{to designate}} {{a large number of}} substances which are composed of three elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen always appears in proportion to form water, that is there were two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen and the carbon atoms in groups of six or multiples of six. It is difficult to give a positive definition of the term carbohydrates and the above is not always true in the strictest sence, as there are some substances containing the same elements with the hydrogen and oxygen in proportion to form water; yet they are not <b>carbohydrates</b> Among these <b>substances</b> may be mentioned lactic and acetic acid which are two of the products of the digested and decomposed carbohydrates. Carbohydrates or hydrates of carbon are very abundant in nature especialy in plant life. A protein form the chief part of the solid of animal tissues, so carbohydrates form the chief part of plant structure. They are found in the tissues of animals as such only in small quantities either free or in combination with other complex bodies...|$|R
40|$|Collagen is an {{important}} biopolymer in numerous applications due to its special characteristics, such as biodegradability and weak antigenecity. Interest recently, has grown in fish collagen. This stems from the fact, {{that the use of}} animal collagen is unsafe due to the effects from cattle rabies disease. Furthermore, fish collagen is 96 % identical to human protein. Modern fish production is accompanied by the formation {{of a large number of}} protein-containing wastes. Depending on the degree of fish processing waste hydrolysis we obtain different products, such as feed additives or growth accelerators. Available technologies are unacceptable, because they require the consumption of large amounts of time and energy. The enzymatic method of obtaining collagen hydrolysates is the most suitable because it can be implemented under milder conditions and it prevents the destruction of amino acids, <b>carbohydrates</b> and other <b>substances</b> contained in the waste. Application of the alkaline enzymatic hydrolysis method with hydrogen peroxide pretreatment at elevated temperature provides a collagen hydrolysate, which is characterized by a high content of total nitrogen; collagen is amorphous, has fully homogeneous structure and has a balanced amino acid composition...|$|R

The [emim][CH 3 COO] ionic liquid was selected as miscible with acetone by adjusting the quantities of water and ethanol in the solution. After regeneration, ethanol was maintained in the solution with IL. Next, ethanol {{and part of the}} added acetone were distilled and dry acetone was added to the remained solution (mainly water and [emim][CH 3 COO]) creating a phase separation. Aliphatic compounds were removed in the acetone phase (the upper phase). After this process, several biomass components remained dissolved in the IL solution comprising low molecular weight carbohydrates, a portion of the original lignin, residual non-polar biomass components, and other compounds. The precipitation and recovery of the majority of these residual solutes were performed by the addition of 2 -propanol known as a low polarity solvent. This step reduced the accumulation of the very soluble biomass compounds in the IL. Therefore, after water distillation an efficient reuse of the IL for a new pre-treatment could be attained [68]. After the pre-treatment process, the separation of dissolved low molecular weight <b>carbohydrates,</b> non-polar <b>substances,</b> low molecular weight lignin fragments, and other biomass components in ILs is a challenging task. In fact, the recycling process should remove these compounds from the IL fraction as they are responsible for decreasing of the pre-treatment efficiency of the reused ILs. The IL recovery process proposed by Dibble et al. [68] requires a minimal addition of reagents and it is assumed that it would not result in significant IL degradation. The reported recovery process resulted in 89 % of the initial IL without the addition of acid or other catalysts for the recovery of lignin and other solutes from the used IL [68].|$|R

To ensure a high food value of canned products, in establishing the technological process should take termolability account both the solubility and valuable substances that some vitamins, minerals, <b>carbohydrates</b> and nitrogenous <b>substances.</b> If the solubility of the substances determined, in particular, losses during the preliminary operations of washing, scalding, cooling, causes losses both during thermolability cooked, and during sterilization. The vitamins, which recorded the largest losses during the technological process, are vitamin C followed by B 1 and B 2 lesser extent. These vitamins, in addition to being water soluble, are thermo labile, but termolability depends largely on conditions of heating. Thus, vitamin C is destroyed in the presence of air even at a temperature of 50 ° C, but in the absence of air and acid, its resistance to heat action is much greater, mentioned that the acidic environment increases and the strength of vitamin B 1. In some cases, a short heating can contribute to keeping the vitamins in the product by removing air from the tissue and inactivation of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidation of vitamin C (ascorbinase) ...|$|R
40|$|Foliar {{chemicals}} are variable within a plant {{and this may}} affect herbivore feeding preference. This study was carried out to quantify concentrations of primary (nitrogen, water, and total nonstructural <b>carbohydrates)</b> and secondary <b>substances</b> (sinigrin) in young and old leaves of Raphanus sativus L. and to evaluate performance and survival of a generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura F. feeding on them. Forty to 50 -d-old R. sativus plants were used in both foliar chemical analysis and insect performance bioassays. Leaves located on the third to the sixth node {{from the base of}} the plant were defined as old leaves and the remaining leaves (from seventh node to the plant apex) of the plant were referred as young leaves in this study. All foliar chemicals except water differed significantly between young and old leaves. Moreover, young leaves were more nutritious but much more defended, based on sinigrin content, against S. litura than old leaves. Performance and survival of S. litura were reduced on young leaves as compared with old leaves. Male and female larval duration only differed significantly on young leaves. Female larval development time was longer than male development time on young leaves, but not on older leaves. Therefore, this study revealed that defenses in young leaves have differential effects upon male and female S. litura...|$|R
