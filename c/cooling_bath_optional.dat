40|$|Comparatively to the as {{received}} {{soda lime glass}} samples, the strength distribution after thermal shocks showed {{the appearance of a}} second branch in the Weibull curves. This branch is observed for temperature differences (ΔT) equal or higher than the critical temperature difference (ΔTc) for both water and motor oil <b>cooling</b> <b>baths.</b> The dispersion is more spread out in these two baths in comparison with the olive oil bath probably because of more pronounced slow crack growth effect. The Weibull modulus varies according to the used <b>cooling</b> <b>bath</b> and the considered temperature difference. In the case of thermal shock caused by air blast cooling at T = 20 °C, a bimodal distribution is observed for only the critical state.

5000|$|Lead shot dropped {{quickly into}} liquid <b>cooling</b> <b>baths</b> when being {{produced}} from molten lead {{is known as}} [...] "chilled lead shot", in contrast to [...] "soft lead shot" [...] which is produced by molten lead not being dropped as quickly into a liquid <b>cooling</b> <b>bath.</b> The process of rapidly chilling lead shot during its manufacturing process causes the shot to become harder than it would otherwise be if allowed to cool more slowly. Hence, chilled lead shot, being harder {{and less likely to}} deform during firing, is preferred by shotgunners for improving shot pattern densities at longer (> 30 yard) ranges, whereas soft lead shot, being softer and more likely to deform during firing, is preferred for improving shot pattern densities at very close (< 20 yard) ranges as the softer and now deformed shot scatters more quickly when fired. Soft lead shot is also more readily deformed during the firing process by the effects of chokes.|$|R
