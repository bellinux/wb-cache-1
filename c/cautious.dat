5|$|Author Joan B. Huffman is more <b>cautious,</b> {{noting that}} crucial sources are {{unavailable}} since Frances destroyed all Eustace's letters to her. However, Huffman records {{that she did}} support her husband when his sister Alice repeatedly challenged him over his drinking.|$|E
5|$|Elderly {{individuals}} {{should be}} <b>cautious</b> {{in the use}} of alprazolam due to the possibility of increased susceptibility to side-effects, especially loss of coordination and drowsiness.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, Sheaffe {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements and took command of the British forces. In sharp contrast to his predecessors' direct attacks, Sheaffe took a more <b>cautious</b> approach. This ultimately proved successful, leading to a total victory over the Americans.|$|E
5|$|A {{grandson}} of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn {{was born into}} a prominent Jewish family. He was brought up without religion until the age of seven, when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian. Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were <b>cautious</b> and did not seek to capitalise on his talent.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the <b>cautious</b> liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a <b>cautious</b> and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Tyndall {{was convicted}} of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, {{although}} he served only four months before his release. In 1987, the BNP opened discussions with an NF faction, the National Front Support Group (NFSG), to discuss {{the possibility of a}} merger, but the NFSG decided against it, remaining <b>cautious</b> about Tyndall's total domination of the BNP.|$|E
5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often spoken to friends about how {{important}} it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, <b>cautious</b> pilot.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{organized}} and <b>cautious</b> Barksdale gang is explored through characters {{at various levels}} within it. The organization is continually antagonized by a stick-up crew led by Omar Little, and the feud leads to several deaths. Throughout, D'Angelo struggles with his conscience over his life of crime and the people it affects.|$|E
5|$|Olaf Tryggvason's ships {{pass the}} {{anchorage}} of his allied enemies {{in a long}} column without order, as no attack is expected. Conveniently placed to observe the fleet, Jarl Eirik and the two kings remark upon the passing vessels. Svein and Olaf are eager to join battle, but Eirik is portrayed as more <b>cautious</b> and familiar with the Norwegian forces.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggested}} {{effects of}} the impacts were seismic waves travelling across the planet, an increase in stratospheric haze on the planet due to dust from the impacts, {{and an increase in}} the mass of the Jovian ring system. However, given that observing such a collision was completely unprecedented, astronomers were <b>cautious</b> with their predictions of what the event might reveal.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{continued}} {{to expand its}} battlefleet, laying down two ships in most subsequent years until 1920. The US {{continued to}} use reciprocating engines {{as an alternative to}} turbines until the , laid down in 1912. In part, this reflected a <b>cautious</b> approach to battleship-building, and in part a preference for long endurance over high maximum speed.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is active, loyal, and affectionate. They may meet strangers barking when {{in their}} territory, or act aloof, <b>cautious</b> or wary. The breed {{is well known}} for being {{friendly}} and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered a high quality and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much more <b>cautious</b> when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The public perception of the F-80s, which had to this point been <b>cautious,</b> improved with news of the victories.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson taking {{the center of}} the cage as Silva circled outside. Jackson opened the action with an {{overhand}} right, and immediately moved backwards. Both fighters appeared <b>cautious</b> for the opening minutes of the fight, exchanging strikes and quickly moving away. Silva focused on leg kicks, while Jackson focused on working the jab.|$|E
5|$|There was inevitably a {{slowdown}} in the pace of military operations, as Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah would move slowly and steadily and was a more <b>cautious</b> commander. The conquest of Syria continued under his Generalship and, Abu Ubaidah being an admirer of Khalid, gave him command of the cavalry and used him as a military advisor.|$|E
5|$|This bird {{can be seen}} to perch in both {{shrubbery}} {{and even}} trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-necked wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally move to a branch close to the ground. If it is being observed, it is generally <b>cautious.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the naval}} and air forces {{available}} {{for the protection of}} shipping in Australian waters were never adequate to defeat a heavy or coordinated attack, they proved sufficient to mount defensive patrols against the sporadic and generally <b>cautious</b> attacks mounted by the Axis navies during the war.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially <b>cautious</b> from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|Alexander made a <b>cautious</b> {{and slow}} advance, {{intending}} to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served in}} the 1st Division of the Italian fleet during the Italo-Turkish War, and were the workhorses of the {{operations}} off North Africa and in the eastern Mediterranean. During World War I, the ships were primarily based in Brindisi, Taranto, and Valona; they saw no action during the war due to the <b>cautious</b> fleet policies adopted by both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. The ships remained in the Italian fleet {{for a few years}} after the war, but all were discarded and broken up for scrap by 1927.|$|E
5|$|Although Sondheim was <b>cautious</b> of a {{cinematic}} {{adaptation of}} his musical, he was largely {{impressed by the}} results. The film received largely positive reviews, with Depp's performance receiving critical praise — the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 221 reviews, and Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 39 reviews. Sweeney Todd appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour. During a stopover at Naples, Miller was locked inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation, {{but managed to}} escape and rejoin the boat as {{it was about to}} leave. During his career, several cricket books were published under Miller's name, and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost-written tome, which was printed as the team left for England, criticised his captain Hassett as being too <b>cautious.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more <b>cautious</b> foreign policy. He {{supported}} US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw limited action during World War I, {{largely a}} result of the <b>cautious</b> {{strategies}} employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage them before they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance.|$|E
5|$|By May 1933, two draft bills had emerged, a <b>cautious</b> and legalistic one by John Dickinson (Under Secretary of Commerce) and {{an ambitious}} one {{focusing}} on trade associations by Hugh Johnson. Many leading businessmen—including Gerard Swope (head of General Electric), Charles M. Schwab (chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corporation), E. H. Harriman (chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad), and Henry I. Harriman, {{president of the}} U.S. Chamber of Commerce—helped draft the legislation. A two-part bill, the first section promoting cooperative action among business to achieve fair competition and provide for national planning and a second section establishing a national public works program, was submitted to Congress on May 15, 1933.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, {{a series of}} {{scalding}} cases, including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the hot spring, prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be <b>cautious</b> to hot mineral springs. As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay, and the RSAF redevelopment, public interest began to wane {{and the number of}} visitors dwindled.|$|E
5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively <b>cautious</b> publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it <b>cautious</b> approval and support.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, {{residents}} were warned to boil their water and be <b>cautious</b> of potential food contamination due to electrical outages. The War Production Board regional office in Dallas offered {{relief to the}} victims of the storm. In La Porte, a makeshift hospital was set up in city hall. At Point Bolivar, where nearly all houses were destroyed, the now-destitute {{residents were}} transported by the Galveston chapter of the American Red Cross to Galveston for housing.|$|E
5|$|France {{was willing}} to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more <b>cautious.</b> The UK {{government}} was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at ₤250million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 {{the government and the}} manufacturer agreed that ₤50million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and <b>cautious</b> animals with highly {{developed}} brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was better than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more <b>cautious,</b> however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, <b>cautious,</b> perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Thai government’s {{department}} of irrigation met {{the demands of}} Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with a promise to halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with <b>cautious</b> optimism. To circumvent the issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced {{plans to build a}} series of dams on Burma's Salween River along its border with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son Province.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut Grant's supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker {{attacked}} Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by recently enlisted United States Colored Troops. Despite having inferior weaponry, they fought bravely and finally repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief but from the <b>cautious</b> Johnston.|$|E
