2500|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{commonly}} called MIG (for metal/inert-gas), is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and filler metal, along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the weld site from contamination. [...] Constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current alternating current are used as well. With continuously fed filler electrodes, GMAW offers relatively high welding speeds; however the more <b>complicated</b> <b>equipment</b> reduces convenience and versatility {{in comparison to the}} SMAW process. [...] Originally developed for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon economically applied to steels. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry for its quality, versatility and speed. [...] Because of the need to maintain a stable shroud of shielding gas around the weld site, it can be problematic to use the GMAW process in areas of high air movement such as outdoors.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the first}} time to {{fabricate}} and apply responsive colloidal crystal (CC) films on biocomposite material - bamboo strand board (BSB). The responsive film can be easily prepared directly through the self-assembly of soft colloidal polymer spheres containing hydrophilic monomers at ambient pressure and temperature without <b>complicate</b> <b>equipment.</b> In this approach, soft colloidal polymer spheres are synthesized by emulsion polymerization using polymerizable emulsifier. Then, the polymer latex is loaded onto the surface of BSB. The colloidal polymer spheres can directly self-assemble into a robust and transparent colloidal crystal (CC) film on BSB. Neither soft matrix nor posttreatment is needed. Compared with the traditional responsive CC, the polymer film on BSB not only had sensitive response behaviors but also had good reversibility and mechanical strength, which would provide a new method for fabrication and application of responsive CC. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more <b>complicated</b> <b>equipment</b> is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. [...] A typical twist-lock is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|E

The structure and morphology of as-prepared Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), UV–vis spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area measurement and magnetic measurements, and thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis. The FT-IR, XRD, and EDS {{results indicated that the}} product was highly pure well-crystallized cubic phase of Co 3 O 4. The TEM images showed that the product powder consisted of dispersive quasi-spherical particles with a narrow size distribution ranged from 6 to 16 nm and an average size around 11 nm. The magnetic measurements confirmed that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles show a little ferromagnetic behavior which could be attributed to the uncompensated surface spins and/or finite size effects. The ferromagnetic order of the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles is raised with increasing the decomposition temperature. Using the present method, Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles can be produced without the need of expensive organic solvents and <b>complicated</b> <b>equipments.</b>|$|R
