40|$|Male {{sexuality}} in Africa is {{often associated with}} harmful sexual practices, which, in the context of HIV and AIDS, often positions men as central to the spread of the epidemic. Despite this focus on men’s practices, {{there is a lack of}} research exploring the subject positions of men living with HIV. This study explores how masculinity is constructed by a group of black South African men who self-identify as heterosexual and are living with HIV. Using discourse analysis, a construction of a normative masculinity is identified as being both idealised and perceived as a burden, in that men continually need to engage in actions that affirm their position as ‘real’ men. By depicting men as invulnerable and unemotional, this <b>construction</b> <b>limits</b> men from acknowledging health risks or accessing support. A second discourse constructs HIV and AIDS as disrupting normative masculinity, in that it restricts men’s agency through illness and the need for care. A final discourse relates to a transformed masculinity, where men living with HIV reconstruct their masculinity, as conforming to normative constructions of male identity is perceived as restrictive and harmful...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{predicting}} the three-dimensional {{structure of a}} protein starting from its amino acid sequence is {{regarded as one of}} the most important open problems in biology. Here, we solve aspects of this problem for the so-called sandwich proteins that constitute a large class of proteins consisting of only β-strands arranged in two sheets. A breakthrough for this class of proteins was announced in Kister et al. (Kister et al. 2002 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 99, 14 [*] 137 – 14 [*] 141), in which it was shown that sandwich proteins contain a certain invariant substructure called interlock. It was later noted that approximately 90 % of the observed sandwich proteins are canonical, namely they are generated by certain geometrical structures. Here, employing a topological investigation, we prove that interlocks and geometrical structures are the direct consequence of certain biologically motivated fundamental principles. Furthermore, we construct all possible canonical motifs involving 6 – 10 strands. This <b>construction</b> <b>limits</b> dramatically the number of possible motifs. For example, for sandwich proteins with nine strands, the a priori number of possible canonical motifs exceeds 360   000, whereas our construction yields only 49 geometrical structures and 625 canonical motifs...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{structure}} {{subjected to}} elevated temperature and acoustic loading present a challenging design environment. Thermal stress in a structural component has typically been alleviated by allowing thermal expansion. However, very little {{work has been}} done which directly addresses the situation where such a prescription is not possible. When a structural component has failed due to thermally-induced tensile stresses, {{the answer to the question}} of how best to stiffen the structure is far from trivial. In this work, we demonstrate that conventional stiffening techniques, for example, those which add material to the thickness of a failing panel, may actually increase the rate of damage as well as increasing load into sub- and surrounding structure. The typical compliance minimization topology optimization formulation is applied to a thermally-loaded panel resulting in extremely non-optimal configurations. To generate successful thermal stress designs where the objectives are to lower the tensile stresses while simultaneously limiting the amount of additional load into sub- and surrounding structures, a well-known characteristic of topology optimization for a single-load case mechanical loading is exploited which by <b>construction</b> <b>limits</b> additional load into surrounding structure. Acoustic loading is also a major concern as exhaust gases with random frequency content impinge on aircraft structure in the vicinity of the engines. An evolutionary structural optimization algorithm is developed which addresses both the maximum von-Mises stress and minimum natural frequency for a generic thermal protection system. The similarities between the two approaches are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|By placing {{perception}} as {{a central}} problem, Baroque culture induces the viewer into a conflict between real and illusory, as witnessed in Quadratura painting (perspective architectures) by confronting tectonic facts with simulated space. Illusion shaped by Baroque Quadratura, results from {{a full understanding of}} optical phenomena that, assimilated by perspective science and converted into image, enable the deception and disillusion of seeing, as explored by the Portuguese Jesuit mathematician Inácio Vieira in his treatise (Óptica, 1714; Prospectiva, 1716), according to coeval perspective speculation. The employment of perspective rules and procedures into space illusion established Quadratura image as architectural instrument, making it possible to overcome nature limitations, whether we speak of architectural space transformation or of visual rhetoric. By intertwining two-dimensional images and three-dimensional reality, we witness the triumph of art over nature, celebrating a metamorphosis of appearances in which projected image into architectural space becomes a structural fact conditioning understanding and perception of tectonic truth. The structural complexity of total Baroque space, in which different arts are integrated as part of a unitary mechanism, combines real and illusion in a continuous event challenging spatial boundaries perception integrating symbolic in the spatial tectonic box. From these considerations the proposed paper regards the Quadratura by Gonçalves Sena, at the altar’s vault in Santarém’s Cathedral (Portugal), which, under the Roman model of Andrea Pozzo, transforms real space organizing the relative distance between divine and believer. The link between terrene and celestial is accomplished through virtual architectures that push <b>construction</b> <b>limits</b> opening interior space into infinite sky.

40|$|An updraft tower {{cooling system}} is {{proposed}} to eliminate water use and utilize heat rejection in large-scale power plants. The updraft tower has an annular heat exchanger distributed around an inlet at the base; ambient air is drawn {{up through the}} tower chimney due to the density difference between the heated air at the base and the cooler air at the top. A secondary loop, configured as a vapor-compression cooling cycle, is used to transfer {{the heat from the}} power plant condenser to the tower base. Recuperative turbines in the tower harness the energy available in the waste heat air stream to assist in powering the secondary cooling cycle and increase the cooling system efficiency. The system feasibility is evaluated from thermodynamic perspective by comparing the net power needed to operate the system versus alternative dry cooling schemes. A detailed thermodynamic model coupling the power plant, secondary loop, and updraft tower systems is developed. Parametric studies involving changes in updraft tower geometry, heat exchanger size, and operating conditions are conducted to develop system design methodologies for optimized performance; water, R 134 a, R 600 a, and R 290 are evaluated as alternative secondary cooling cycle refrigerants. The size of the updraft tower is critical to the system performance. Increases in the tower diameter and height (up to reasonable <b>construction</b> <b>limits)</b> increase the system work output. The cooling system efficiency can be improved by lowering the secondary loop condensing temperature to reduce the compression work, but this requires a larger size tower to maintain the same heat rejection rate. Similarly, increasing the secondary loop evaporating temperature can reduce the compression work, but requires a larger heat exchange surface area. An optimum depth of the heat exchanger at the tower base (i. e., the secondary loop condenser) is identified that maximizes the work output. For an optimized system design, the required work input to the updraft tower cooling system is shown to be less than for a typical air-cooled condenser at the same heat rejection rate. By allowing the power plant condensing temperature to increase, a simple pumped loop can be used to replace the secondary vapor-compression cooling cycle as the secondary loop. With the same updraft tower parameters and heat exchangers design, the simulation model predicts the pumped loop provides better performance and consumes less power as compared to the vapor compression loop. With a tower height similar to existing water-cooled cooling towers, the updraft tower system with a pumped secondary loop can allow for dry cooling with significantly less efficiency penalty compared to air-cooled condensers. This work provides a framework for judgement of the updraft tower dry cooling system feasibility from a thermodynamic perspective. ...|$|E
