40|$|The {{family of}} 2 {{dimensional}} detection modules at AEG INFRAROT-MODULE GmbH (AIM) based on platinum silicide (PtSi) GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well (QWIP) devices or {{mercury cadmium telluride}} (MCT) focal planes for applications in either the 3. 5 mu m (MWIR) or 8 - 10 mu m (LWIR) range was recently extended. Two new devices have been realized in the configurations 640 x 512 in a 24 mu m pitch for mid and long wave applications using either a MCT photovoltaic (PV) array for the MWIR or a QWIP device for the LWIR, respectively. The existing 256 x 256 MCT MWIR was redesigned in a new configuration with increased fill factor of greater than 80 per cent for improved NETD performance. The MCT units provide fast full frame rates up to >l 00 Hz for the 640 x 512 units and 200 Hz for the 256 x 256 units. The modules achieve with short snapshot integration times of typically 1 ms excellent thermal resolutions with an average NETD < 251 mK for the 640 x 512 and NETD < 9 mK for the 256 x 256 modules. The QWIP units are operated in either a rolling frame or snapshot integration mode with typical frame rates of 60 Hz and reach a thermal resolution NETD < 25 mK for full frame integration times. The FPA's are integrated up to modules using AIM's standard dewar cooler and command/control electronics (CCE) family. The package is basically identical to the existing large FPA modules like the PtSi 640 x 486 or the QWIP or MCT 256 x 256 in 40 mu m pitch and is cooled by AIM's 1 W split linear cooler. The <b>CCE</b> of the <b>modules</b> provides the common exclusively digital interface, using 14 Bit analog to digital conversion to provide {{state of the art}} correctability, access to highly dynamic scenes without any loss of information and simplified interchangeability of the units. The main features of these modules are summarized together with measured performance data...|$|R
