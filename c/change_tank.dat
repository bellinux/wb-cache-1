5000|$|Aybee {{arrives at}} Fugate colony to {{discover}} Sandra {{in the form}} <b>change</b> <b>tank.</b> He and a puzzled Fugate revive her, and she claims to have survived a murder attempt. Her attempts to explain this to her supervisor back home fall on deaf ears, and he orders her back to Earth. Aybee encourages Sondra to make a stopover at Samarkand, because he has found a curious anomaly in the system traffic while looking for clues as to the identity of Sondra's attempted murderer: Trudy Melford's personal yacht recently {{paid a visit to}} Samarkand, a reclusive asteroid colony which has outlawed all form change. Why would the president of BEC visit a colony vehemently opposed to form change technology? ...|$|E
50|$|Form Change also {{provides}} {{an outlet for}} the aspirations of fanatics and niche social groups. Multiple colonies have been established on asteroids and cometary debris throughout the solar system, in which isolated groups implement quixotic and highly questionable form changes to bring about their own personal utopias. One such group magnifies the scale of their body so as to allow for greater brain development in the womb. Another group has established a surprisingly stable fiefdom in which physical appearance is a direct indicator of societal status. Others attempt bizarre cyborg enhancements, stabilised by regular form <b>change</b> <b>tank</b> visitations. One of the most extreme forms is reminiscent of a kangaroo with highly adapted circulatory and respiratory systems, allowing survival {{on the surface of}} Mars.|$|E
50|$|The most {{immediately}} apparent new technology, {{and the one}} which provides the backdrop {{for much of the}} story, is that of Form Change. Purposive Form Change is an extremely advanced and refined form of biofeedback, in which a Form <b>Change</b> <b>Tank</b> assists a human user in subtle or extreme modifications to his or her physiology and appearance. The most practical and widespread use of Form Change is in treating congenital defects and injuries. Limbs may be regrown, eyesight corrected, chemical imbalances adjusted, and the onset of senility delayed for decades. Carried to its logical conclusion in a consumer society, it also allows people to customise their appearance through superficial cosmetic changes, alter their sex, or even to fuse their body with another person's.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Fugate, Sondra is unnerved {{to find that}} Fugates are tens of meters tall, a form designed to allow cerebral growth unrestricted by {{the constraints of the}} mother's pelvis. The Fugates guide Sondra to the supposedly flawed equipment, then leave her alone at her request. Sondra performs every test she can imagine on the suspect Form <b>Change</b> <b>tank,</b> but is unable to find any software problems. She also rules out hardware flaws after inspecting the unbroken BEC seals. Having concluded her investigation, she suddenly realises that she has been locked in the tank chamber and the atmosphere is becoming dangerously thin and cold. With no alternative, she sets up an emergency form change regimen in one of the tanks to put her in a cold-tolerant coma, and reluctantly steps inside.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December, the 501st {{attacked}} {{an enemy}} tank formation near Losovka, which inflicted 21 enemy tank, and 28 gun casualties, {{for the loss}} of two of its own tanks and all three company commanders wounded. Because infantry support was unable to follow, the 501st withdrew. Three days later, Major Löwe, the battalion commander, went missing after he was forced to <b>change</b> <b>tanks</b> when his own was knocked out. In the next five days, the battalion destroyed 81 enemy tanks. By the end of December, 16 Tigers were operational out of 39 available, two having fallen into Soviet hands.|$|R
50|$|Her first bombing raid was on Augsburg, Germany, on February 25, 1944. She made 18 bombing {{raids on}} Berlin. In all she flew 1,129 hours and dropped 562,000 pounds of bombs. She had 21 engine changes, four wing panel changes, 15 main gas <b>tank</b> <b>changes,</b> and 18 <b>changes</b> of Tokyo <b>tanks</b> (long-range fuel tanks).|$|R

50|$|Many of the <b>changes</b> in <b>tank</b> design {{have been}} {{refinements}} to targeting and ranging (fire control), gun stabilisation, communications and crew comfort. Armour has evolved {{to keep pace}} with improvements in weaponry, and guns have grown bigger. But there have been no fundamental changes.|$|R
50|$|The SGI {{workstations}} had a Battlezone derived game in {{the early}} 1990s called BZ which added network play. BZ also had guided missiles, where the player would fly the missile after launch, returning to the tank on impact. This version evolved into the game BZFlag with a capture-the-flag mode where flags can <b>change</b> the <b>tank's</b> abilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} to constant <b>changes</b> in <b>tank</b> design was to standardize {{a few basic}} designs and mass-produce them even though technology had advanced to new improvements. This was the solution of Germany's principal opponents. The Soviet T-34, for example, was an excellent basic design that survived the war with only one major change in armament, (76.2-mm to 85-mm main gun).|$|R
50|$|Egypt {{purchased}} Shermans from Great Britain {{and used}} at least 3 in 1948 against Israel. Egypt purchased more M4A4s and M4A2s from Britain after 1948, but soon <b>changed</b> to Soviet <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Many of the <b>changes</b> in <b>tank</b> design {{have been}} {{refinements}} to targeting and ranging (fire control), gun stabilization, communications and crew comfort. Armour evolved {{to keep pace}} with improvements in weaponry - the rise of composite armour is of particular note - and guns grew more powerful. However, basic tank architecture did not change significantly, and has remained largely the same into the 21st century.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1942 the Ordnance Department set a {{production}} target of 250 a month, with Fisher {{as a second}} contractor to meet a planned expansion {{in the size of}} the army. However, by September the focus had <b>changed,</b> with <b>tank</b> production scaled back and more aircraft for the USAAF. Under this new [...] "Army Supply Program", the M6 production was cut from 5,000 to a little over 100.|$|R
50|$|Bey Wolf resides on Wolf Island, {{a private}} resort he chose {{for the name}} and the {{isolation}} it provides. Having retired, he is pursuing his own research in animal Form Change, a fairly taboo subject. Sondra Wolf Dearborn arrives unannounced and uninvited, and he berates her before sending her off, telling her to visit the distant colony and inspect the Humanity Test equipment herself for possible flaws. He is ready to put her {{out of his mind}} when he receives another unwelcome visit, this time from Trudy Melford, president of BEC: Biological Equipment Corporation, the manufacturer of all Form <b>Change</b> <b>tanks</b> for the last 150 years. Trudy Melford is one of the richest and most powerful people alive, and a personal visit to a remote island is evidence of great urgency and need on her part. Bey Wolf, annoyed by Trudy's interruption, is nonetheless intrigued by her offer of a position at BEC to work on revolutionary new forms. However, his natural cynicism and detective's instincts tell him that the two visits {{in such a short time}} are connected somehow.|$|R
50|$|The major <b>change</b> for <b>tank</b> use was {{reversing}} {{the direction of}} engine rotation. Automotive gearboxes ran the opposite way to an aircraft propeller and changing direction required modification of the camshaft lobes. The Merlin had its supercharger, reduction gear and other equipment removed from its crankshaft, greatly simplifying its construction. The dimensions were now similar to the Nuffield Liberty engine and it would fit into the Liberty Mark VI version in the Crusader tank.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{fluorine}} to the Vanguard first-stage oxidant was anlyzed. An increase in specific impulse of 5. 74 percent {{may be obtained}} with 30 percent fluorine. This increase, coupled with increased mass ratio due to greater oxidant density, gave up to 24. 6 -percent increase in first-stage burnout energy with 30 percent fluorine added. However, a <b>change</b> in <b>tank</b> configuration is required to accommodate the higher oxidant-fuel ratio necessary for peak specific impulse with fluorine addition...|$|R
50|$|The brigade's regiments {{had trained}} in the Infantry Tank role, latterly on Churchill tanks, but in the Spring of 1944 {{converted}} to Sherman and Sherman Firefly medium <b>tanks.</b> Reflecting this <b>changed</b> role, 33rd <b>Tank</b> Brigade was redesignated 33rd Armoured Brigade on 17 March 1944.|$|R
40|$|This Process Test Plan {{was written}} to gather {{temperature}} data {{to determine the}} amount of heat load remaining in tank 241 -C- 106. This process test plan is being conducted to gather the temperature data necessary to determine how much of the initial heat load is still left in 241 -C- 106. The heat load will be determined by shutting off the C- 106 exhaust system, monitoring the <b>change</b> in <b>tank</b> temperature, and plugging the resulting data into the thermal model for this tank...|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 1939, the Armoured Group {{was formed}} {{under the command}} of Major L. Furs-Żyrkiewicz. It was made up mostly of {{soldiers}} from the former armoured units of Poland. The 1st Tank Battalion was formed from these former armoured units on 2 December 1939 and left the camp at Coëtquidan for the village of Campenéac. On this day, it became an independent unit. Its name would <b>change</b> (65th <b>Tank</b> Battalion, 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Armoured Regiment), but it could trace its roots to this date as its birth.|$|R
50|$|MSFC was {{responsible}} for the external tank, but few or no <b>changes</b> to the <b>tank</b> were made; rather, NASA decided that it was inevitable that some insulation might be lost during launch and thus required that an inspection of the orbiter's critical elements be made prior to reentry on future flights.|$|R
500|$|Great {{changes in}} the {{tactical}} use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I, as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges ineffective. Although cavalry was used with good effect in Palestine, at the Third Battle of Gaza and Battle of Megiddo, generally the mode of warfare <b>changed.</b> <b>Tanks</b> were beginning {{to take over the}} role of shock combat. The use of trench warfare, barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Following the war, the armies of the world powers initiated a process of mechanization in earnest, and most cavalry regiments were either converted to mechanized units or disbanded. Historian G.J. Meyer writes that [...] "the Great War brought the end of cavalry". From the Middle Ages into the 20th century, cavalry had dominated battlefields, but from as early as the American Civil War, their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful, reducing the effectiveness of shock charges. The Western Front in World War I showed that cavalry was almost useless against modern weaponry, and it also reinforced that they were difficult to transport and supply. British cavalry officers, far more than their continental European counterparts, persisted in using and maintaining cavalry, believing that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs, and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns. Neither of these beliefs proved correct.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle has a {{modified}} suspension with seven pairs of wheels, unlike the T-72 and most tanks based on it which have six. This allowed the hull {{to be stretched}} by 1 m and installation of a more powerful 850-900 HP diesel engine 8VSA3, basically {{a variant of the}} engine mounted in TR-85. It used an old DShK machine gun for anti-aircraft purposes and was fitted with extra armour. The 125mm A555 smoothbore tank gun was developed by Arsenal Reșița factory. As a result of these <b>changes</b> the <b>tank's</b> weight increased from 41.5 tonnes (T-72M) to around 50 tonnes.|$|R
25|$|Policy {{entrepreneurs}} such as William Baroody, Edwin Feulner and Paul Weyrich {{started to}} entrench conservatism in public research institutions. Their {{aim was to}} rival the liberal regime for {{the control of the}} sources of power. The appearance of think <b>tanks</b> <b>changed</b> the history of conservatism and left an enormous imprint on the Republican right in subsequent years.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} {{an individual}} tank from a third-person perspective with computer AI controlling the other friendly tanks {{as well as}} the enemy tanks. By switching to a map screen, the player can <b>change</b> which <b>tank</b> they control and also direct tanks to different places on the map. The game carries on in real-time while the player is looking at the map. Control can be split so that two players can cooperate to control the tank so one player drives the tank while the other controls the gun. Single players can choose for the computer to take the role of the second player or control both together.|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} software tool, called DAI (Data Analysis and Interpretation) {{is developed}} upon {{request of the}} EURATOM inspectorate. This monitoring tool does more than just supervision: it interprets the signals and verifies the consistency and coherency with predefined criteria and without intervening in the process. These criteria {{are based on the}} design characteristics of the recipients and transfer mechanism. In the case of the solution process in a reprocessing plant, the signals are visualizing the solution properties (temperature, density) and <b>tank</b> levels. The <b>change</b> in <b>tank</b> level of the feeding tank is cross-checked against the corresponding <b>change</b> in <b>tank</b> level of the communicating process tank and the software verifies the coherency in total mass transferred. In particular the start of a transfer has to be recognized appropriately and that with the appropriate signal profile, that differs for siphon transfer and mechanical pumping. In order to ensure that no nuclear material is diverted, a complete accountancy system is imposed that combines verifications with high accuracy of low frequency (in general annually), with those of high frequency but with lower accuracy. Mainly the latter one, also known under near-real time accountancy, enhances the quality of executing the procedures, because it allows the inspector to localize in time a leakage problem to the operators. The monitoring tool DAI has been completely successfully validated at the Reprocessing plant of La Hague (UP 2 and UP 3) and is now in use by the inspectors. Also the IAEA has selected this DAI software tool to monitor the Tokai reprocessing plant in Japan. JRC. G. 8 -Nuclear safeguard...|$|R

50|$|Having earlier {{installed}} the Dominator twin-cylinder engine of 500 cc and 600 cc, in 1959 Norton put the old single cylinder Model 50 (350 cc) and the ES2 (500 cc) into the Featherbed frame to rationalise production. Using grade A mild steel, {{the size of}} this engine determined the space between the top and bottom rails of the full duplex cradle. In 1960 the top rails were installed {{at the rear of the}} tank. Riders complained that these wideline Featherbed frames were uncomfortably wide at 11.5 in but it was not until 1960 that the top runs of the frame were narrowed towards the front of the seat, with corresponding overall styling <b>changes</b> including <b>tank</b> and seat to create the slimline frame.|$|R
