40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the differences in}} compaction properties between microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and microcrystalline cellulose co-processed with <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SMCC). The different compaction parameters are not only compared for the pure materials, {{but also for the}} lubricated powders with magnesium stearate. Neither magnesium stearate, nor <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> facilitates extensively the densification of (silicified) microcrystalline cellulose during compaction. The difference in tablet relaxation of MCC and SMCC indicates a small negative effect of <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> on the interparticle bonding strength of unlubricated MCC. However, for lubricated MCC a larger increase in tablet relaxation at a high compression speed was found than for lubricated SMCC tablets. Accordingly, the decrease in tablet strength was larger for the MCC tablets than for the SMCC tablets when lubrication was applied. The examination of the tablet strengths of tablets compressed from physical mixtures of MCC with increasing concentrations of <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> proved the slightly negative influence of silicon dioxide on the tablet strength of unlubricated MCC tablets and the positive effect of <b>colloidal</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> addition on the tensile strength of lubricated MCC tablets.

At a suitable amount of Aerosil 200 and Aerosil R 972, the three-dimensional network led to the immobilization of a dispersing medium. The viscosity of the prepared gel was increased as the amount of Aerosil 200 or Aerosil R 972 was increased.
