6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan,</b> as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E

Black-necked swans (1600 {{at the last}} count including some ringed birds from Valdivia), fill the Laguna. The feeding swans add to the tranquility of the scene,and the main road runs through {{the side of the}} laguna giving a close up view of the Wildlife. <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>swans,</b> pimpollo (white-tufted grebe), tagua (coots),and many more, all {{can be seen in the}} lagoon.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> (Coscoroba coscoroba) is {{a species}} of {{waterfowl}} endemic to southern South America. It is {{the smallest of the}} birds called [...] "swans", but still a large species of waterfowl. It belongs to the subfamily Anserinae in the family of ducks, swans, and geese, Anatidae. It is placed in the monotypic genus Coscoroba. The <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> is traditionally considered as an early branch from the common ancestor leading to true geese and swans, and recently genetic studies have associated a phylogenetic relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae) as sister groups.|$|E
50|$|At least 46 birds {{species are}} found in the Cáhuil zone, many of them in danger of extinction. Some of them are the <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan,</b> brown-hooded gull, and white-necked heron. The area hosts at least seven duck species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> (Coscoroba coscoroba) from South America, {{the only}} species of its genus, is {{apparently}} {{not a true}} swan. Its phylogenetic position is not fully resolved; it is in some aspects more similar to geese and shelducks.|$|E
5000|$|Pebble Island can {{be divided}} into a marshy east, known for its {{waterfowl}} and wading birds, and a hilly west, known for its penguins. [...] The Pebble Island group, including the much smaller White Island and some islets, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks (100 breeding pairs), ruddy-headed geese (175 pairs), gentoo penguins (1700 pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (6800 pairs), macaroni penguins (10 pairs), southern giant petrels (20 pairs), sooty shearwaters (100 pairs), striated caracaras, white-bridled finches, blackish cinclodes and Cobb's wrens. black-necked and <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>swans</b> breed on the main island.|$|R
40|$|Context. Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be used to assess skeletal development as well as health status in wild animals. Aims. However, the information about age-related dynamics of ALP in birds, especially in precocial species, is very scarce. Therefore, before ALP measurements can be effectively interpreted, it is necessary to determine its normal variation for each species, age group and sex. Methods. Here, we report total-ALP levels of free-living <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swans</b> (<b>Coscoroba</b> coscoroba) from the most important breeding and moulting population in Brazil. Data were gathered during the moulting period and categorised according to sex and the following three different age classes: chick (n= 11), young (n= 14) and mature (n= 29). Key results. ALP levels were related to the longitudinal measure of the bones, gradually diminishing with age and showing significant differences among birds of different age classes. In all age groups, no effect of sex on T-ALP concentration was detected. Conclusions. We conclude that measuring ALP facilitates the discrimination among different-aged individuals with similar plumage characteristics and body size. © CSIRO 2010. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of morphological sexing and {{the occurrence of}} sexual dimorphism were analyzed in mature and immature <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swans</b> (<b>Coscoroba</b> coscoroba, Anatidae) near the Estação Ecológica do Taim, southern Brazil. On the basis of weight and 10 linear measurements of external morphology, multivariate analysis of vari- ance showed that males were consistently larger than females (sex confirmed via genetic markers) and mature birds were consistently larger than immatures. Overall, 38 % of immatures and 14 % of mature birds were sexed incorrectly by cloacal examination when compared to genetic data. Therefore, we performed a discriminant function analysis of different age classes based on morphometric measurements. Mature birds were sexed with 96 % accuracy using head and tarsus lengths as predictor variables, whereas immatures were sexed with 90 % accuracy based on head and forearm lengths. Method validation conducted with data for additional mature sampled in a different year showed {{that the use of}} head length alone was as accurate for sexing (92 % correct classification) than discriminant functions based on two characteristics (91 %).

50|$|The <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> {{feeds on}} various plant matter, small aquatic insects, and small fish. The female incubates the eggs, while the male stands guard and aggressively helps {{to protect the}} fledglings against predators after hatching. Coscoroba swans live to an age of {{approximately}} twenty years.|$|E
50|$|The lagoon hosts a rich biodiversity, {{including}} fresh- and {{brackish water}} fish, and water birds such as black-necked swan, <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> and Chilean flamingo. Top predators from ocean ecosystem, notably common bottlenose dolphins, {{can sometimes be}} seen at Lagoa dos Patos and exceptionally southern right whales are found at the Rio Grande outlet.|$|E
5000|$|Two genera of [...] "geese" [...] {{are only}} {{tentatively}} {{placed in the}} Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> is the closest living relative of the true geese.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} breeding {{populations of}} 15 {{bird of prey}} species and two others are likely reproducing here. Among them are Andean condor, black-chested buzzard-eagle, rufous-tailed hawk, cinereous harrier, chimango caracara, magellanic horned owl, austral pygmy-owl, to name but a few. Other birds occurring in the park include the Chilean flamingo, Darwin's rhea, <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan,</b> black-necked swan, Magellanic woodpecker, Magellan goose, and black-faced ibis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> breeds in South America from {{southern}} Chile and central Argentina south to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. In winter it flies north to central Chile, northern Argentina, Uruguay and the southeast tip of Brazil. Its habitat is well-vegetated swamps and lagoons. Its population {{is estimated at}} 10,000-25,000 birds. [...] It also has an ancient route to the Pantanal of Brazil and has been seen in large flocks in the Nhecolandia and Rio Negro regions.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{species of}} birds can be {{observed}} in the area, including two kinds of sheldgoose, the cauquén colorado (ruddy-headed goose) and piuquén (also known as the ganso cordillerano or Andean goose), the pato juarjual, a kind of crested duck, the Chilean pintail, the <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan,</b> the black-necked swan, and the Chilean flamingo.Migratory species also nest in the area, including the bandurria (black-faced ibis) and the queltehue (southern lapwing). Some come only in the summer, including the chorlo (rufous-chested plover), the playero (dunlin) and the falaropo picofino (red-necked phalarope).|$|E
50|$|Altogether, {{however, the}} only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks {{probably}} {{are not part of the}} stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis), the <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> (Coscoroba), the freckled duck (Stictonetta) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (Nettapus), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved. For example, the African white-backed duck (Thalassornis) also shows some similarities to Oxyura, but again, this may be yet another case of convergent evolution.|$|E
5000|$|Swans are {{birds of}} the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans' close {{relatives}} include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus Cygnus; in addition there is another species known as the <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan,</b> although this species is no longer {{considered one of the}} true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though [...] "divorce" [...] does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight.|$|E
5000|$|Male {{coscoroba}} swans weigh 3.8 - 5.4 kg {{and females}} weigh 3.2 - 4.5 kg. The length is from 87.5 to 115 cm and the wingspan is 155 to 160 cm. They have white plumage except for black tips {{to the outer}} six primary feathers, although this black is often barely visible on the closed wing. In flight, the black wing tips are conspicuous. The bird has a red beak, legs and feet. They look somewhat more like geese than swans. The female looks almost identical to the male. The cygnet is a patchy color, with brown and gray hues. The <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> is also lacking the black mask that other swans have where their lores are between the eyes and beak. They look like a very small swan in body and look like a goose in the head.Eggs have a measure 89 X 61 mm, with averages of 82 to 94 53 to 67 mm, with an average weight of 170 grams and range from 129 to 203 grams ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan,</b> Coscoroba {{coscoroba}} (Molina, 1782), is {{a poorly}} known aberrant Anserine endemic to South America. We captured adult birds (189 male, 157 female) from the largest population in Brazil at the Taim Ecological Reserve, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Different patterns between sexes can reflect differences in selection, and positive allometry {{may indicate that}} a character is sexually selected. We used body weight and 10 morphological measurements to examine allometric differences {{between males and females}} of C. coscoroba. Males were consistently larger than females. Analysis of scaling relationships against body mass showed that nostril, tail, wing and bill height were positively allometric (i. e., heavier birds had relatively larger character lengths), but there were no sexual differences in allometric slopes. However, for a given mass, mature females had longer tails, longer wings (up to metacarpophalangeal articulation) and shorter heads than males. In the light of current debate in the literature, we discuss whether such positively allometric traits and sexual differences in scaling may be indicative of sexual selection. Although <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan</b> is a monogamous species, increasing the size of some attributes may confer some advantage for mate selection or male-male competition and, contrary to other studies, we suggest that positively allometric slopes alone should not be considered as evidence for sexual selection of the considered traits.

40|$|Microsatellites for <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> (Coscoroba coscoroba) were {{developed}} using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) without prior enrichment. A shotgun/paired-end library was prepared according to standard protocol of Illumina Nextera DNA Library Kit with dual indexing. The PAL_FINDER_v 0. 02. 03 Perl script {{was used to}} extract readings containing microsatellites with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotides from five million readings obtained in sequencing. Readings were grouped and used in Primer 3 version 2. 0. 0 to design primers when GC content greater than 30 %, melting temperatures within 58 - 65 oC, with 2 oC maximum difference between primers, the last 2 nucleotides in 3 ’ extremity are G or C, and maximum poli-N of 4 nucleotides. When all criteria were met, {{a single pair of}} primers was selected according to the highest score in Primer 3 and with greater amplification region of the repeated sequence. We identified 3046 potentially amplifiable loci (microsatellites) of which 52 were hexanucleotides, 447 pentanucleotides, 760 tetranucleotides, 1168 trinucleotides and 618 dinucleotides. The most common microsatellite motifs in each size were: TC (51. 6 %) for dinucleotides; ATT (23. 9 %) for trinucleotides; AAAT (31. 4 %) for tetranucleotide; ATAGG (60. 6 %) for pentanucleotides; and AAAAAG (21. 2 %) for hexanucleotides. A group of ten loci (including di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides) has been sequenced, using Sanger’s method, to obtain complete sequences for fragments over 200 bp and are currently being used to study the genetic diversity of <b>coscoroba</b> <b>swan</b> populations.

40|$|The <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan</b> (Coscoroba coscoroba) is {{an unusual}} member of the Anatidae found in South America, from the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego through Chile and Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay {{as far north as}} Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. The species is not {{threatened}} globally, but some local populations have declined and the status of others is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the plasma chemistry of a wild population of Coscoroba Swans in southern Brazil during their molting period. We captured 12 chicks, 14 juveniles, and 31 mature birds. The following blood parameters were measured: glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, creatin-kinase, aspartate amino transferase, alanine-aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and pancreatic amylase. Significant differences between males and females were not observed for any of the parameters, and only the levels of alkaline phosphatase differed significantly among age groups. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.

40|$|Study o f the {{distribution}} and numbers o f the Black-necked Swan and <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan</b> shows maximum numbers in the southeast area o f the country where they inhabit shallow areas o f coastal lagoons; in particular Laguna de Rocha, a shallow logoon (0. 58 m in medium depth) which has intermittent connections with the sea, sometimes man-made. In this lagoon up to 7, 000 - 10, 000 Black-necked Swans and up to about 400 Coscoroba Swans were counted in some occasions. During October 1988 to February 1989 the mouth o f the Rocha lagoon was not open to the sea and its water level rose about one metre. This coincided with an exceptional drought, which caused dispersion and mortality o f the swans inhabiting this lagoon and other wetlands in Uruguay. The swans dispersed among atypical areas such as dry meadows, estuaries and deep waters, the salty Rio de 1 a Plata and even the waters o f the Atlantic to 2 km offshore.

Most of the 20 species are found in the cooler parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the exceptions being 3 species of Southern Hemisphere swans. All are vegetarians, obtaining much of their food from terrestrial surface vegetation in the case of geese, and from subsurface aquatic vegetation in the case of swans. The patterns of the downy young tend to be pale and simple, without strong head or back patterning, and in most species the adult plumages are also fairly simple, with whites and blacks often predominating. The white plumage of most adult swans appears to be related to visibility needs associated with their high degree of territorial spacing. The most highly territorial swans are also the most strongly vocal ones, for the same reason. However, vocalizations of the sexes are very similar, and usually differ only in minor pitch characteristics. Most of the swans and geese are quite strongly migratory, but the insular Hawaiian goose not only has become nonmigratory but also has become semiterrestrial and has evolved reduced toe webbing as it has adapted to a mountainous existence on old lava fields...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>Swan</b> (Coscoroba coscoroba) is {{an unusual}} member of the Anatidae.

This study describes the movements of Coscoroba swans banded outside the boundary of and in side the >Estaçao Ecológica do Taim> Reserve (c. 32 ° 33 'S, 52 ° 32 'W) in the southern coastal plain of the State of Rio Grande do SuI, Brazil and the phenology in this area. The analysis of banding and recapture or recovery data was conducted between 2005 and 2008, and data from birds marked between 1979 and 2006 were also obtained from >Centra Nacional de Pesquisas e Conservação de Aves Silvestres> (CEMAVE). Distance between sites, the location of marking and recapture or recovery sites, and sex and age were analyzed. A total of 1070 birds were banded and ringed during the flightless wing moult and 32 recaptures or recoveries were registered during the study period (27 inside the banding area and five outside), the resighting of a Coscoroba in Chubut, Argentina (43 ° 21 'S, 65 ° 03 'W) being most noteworthy. A route between Argentina and Brazil to the central depression of Rio Grande do Sul state (to and from the Taim area) was confirmed as well as fidelity to Taim as a molting site and important breeding area. Recaptures at Taim showed a prevalence of male adults that may indicate a greater male fidelity to the natal area and juvenile dispersal to other areas until sexual maturity is reached. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.
