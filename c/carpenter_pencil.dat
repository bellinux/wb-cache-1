50|$|Similar pencils (called 'jumbo pencils') are {{sometimes}} used by children. A pencil {{that is designed}} for a child rather than a carpenter would have a softer core, enabling the user to draw with less physical effort. Carpenter pencils {{are sometimes}} used by artists and designers to draw a thick line easily when needed. For instance, Old English letters are easier to draw with a <b>carpenter</b> <b>pencil</b> than with an ordinary pen.|$|E

50|$|Carpenters may use <b>carpenter</b> <b>pencils,</b> the {{flattened}} {{shape of}} which stops them from rolling away, while still providing a constant line width. These pencils were traditionally sharpened with tools conveniently to hand, {{such as a}} plane or sandpaper. Rotating pencil sharpeners are now available for these, in which a rotating plastic collar holds the pencil in position, although they then sharpen them to the usual conical point as for a round pencil, abandoning some distinctive aspects of the <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencil.</b>|$|R

50|$|Carpenter's pencils: These are pencils {{that have}} two main properties: their shape {{prevents}} them from rolling, and their graphite is strong. The oldest surviving pencil is a German <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencil</b> dating from the 17th Century and now in the Faber-Castell collection.|$|R

50|$|A <b>carpenter</b> <b>pencil</b> (carpentry pencil, carpenter's pencil) is {{a pencil}} {{that has a}} body with a {{rectangular}} or elliptical cross-section {{to prevent it from}} rolling away. Carpenter pencils are easier to grip than standard pencils, because they have a larger surface area. The non-round core allows thick or thin lines to be drawn by rotating the pencil. Thin lines are required for high precision markings and are easy to erase, but thick markings are needed to mark on rough surfaces. The lead is strong to withstand the stress of marking on such surfaces. The pencil is robust to survive in a construction environment, for example when placed in a bag together with heavy tools. The core is often stronger than in other pencils. Carpenter pencils are also used by builders, because they are suitable for marking on rough surfaces, such as concrete or stone. This shape and lead density aid in marking legible lines with a straight edge that are clear and easy to follow with a saw blade.|$|E

By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty {{scrap of paper}} enclosed, on which was written with a <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencil</b> in a sprawling hand, [...] "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4 Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.

50|$|Before the {{development}} of dedicated pencil sharpeners, a pencil was sharpened by whittling it with a knife. Pencil sharpeners made this task much easier and gave a more uniform result. Some specialized types of <b>pencils,</b> such as <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencils,</b> are still usually sharpened with a knife, due to their flat shape. However, since the 2000s, a fixed-blade device with a rotatable collar has become available.|$|R

6000|$|These things Redwood {{arranged}} in a locker in one corner. Along {{one side of the}} room, at a convenient height for a six-or eight-foot child, there was a blackboard, on which the youngsters might flourish in white and coloured chalk, and near by a sort of drawing block, from which sheet after sheet might be torn, and on which they could draw in charcoal, and a little desk there was, furnished with great <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencils</b> of varying hardness and a copious supply of paper, on which the boys might first scribble and then draw more neatly. And moreover Redwood gave orders, so far ahead did his imagination go, for specially large tubes of liquid paint and boxes of pastels against the time when they should be needed. He laid in a cask or so of plasticine and modelling clay. [...] "At first he and his tutor shall model together," [...] he said, [...] "and when he is more skilful he shall copy casts and perhaps animals. And that reminds me, I must also have made for him a box of tools! ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{handyman}} image recurs {{in popular}} culture. There have been songs about handymen recorded by Elvis Presley in 1964, Del Shannon in 1964, James Taylor in 1977. There are femme-fatale TV characters who fall for handymen. Handymen have been portrayed {{in books and}} films, generally positively, as do-gooder helpful types, but not particularly smart or ambitious. In a book by author Carolyn See called The Handyman, a handyman is really an aspiring but discouraged artist who transforms {{the lives of people}} he works for, as well as having sexual encounters with some of his clients, and his experiences improve his artistic output. The book suggests handymen discover [...] "the appalling loneliness of the women who call him for help" [...] whose needs are sometimes [...] "comic," [...] sometimes [...] "heartbreaking," [...] and deep down [...] "sexual." [...] A 1980 movie called The Handyman was about a carpenter-plumber who was [...] "good at what he does" [...] but is [...] "too honest and trusting," [...] and gets taken advantage of by [...] "women who find him handsome and understanding;" [...] the movie earned negative reviews from critic Vincent Canby. Other movies have used a rather tired formula of sexy-handyman meets bored-housewives, such as The Ups and Downs of a Handyman, a 1975 movie in which [...] "Handsome Bob also finds he's a fast favorite with the local housewives, who seem to have more than small repairs on their minds." [...] In Canada, there's a television show called Canada's Worst Handyman which is a reality show in which handyman contestants try their best on jobs in order to not be labeled worst handyman. Home Improvement is an American television sitcom starring Tim Allen, which aired 1991 to 1999. On the children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Handyman Negri was one of the characters residing in The Neighborhood of Make-Believe, as well as the neighborhood Mister Rogers resides in. Handy Manny is an American/Hispanic preschool television show that airs on Disney Junior and stars a handy man cartoon character named Manny. The Belgian comics and media franchise The Smurfs depicts Handy Smurf with traditional handyman's accoutrements, such as overalls, <b>carpenter's</b> <b>pencil</b> and work hat. Happy Tree Friends also has an orange beaver named Handy who is a handyman.|$|R
