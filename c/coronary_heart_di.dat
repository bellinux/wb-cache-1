SETTING: One general practice in each of 24 British towns. SUBJECTS: 7688 men aged 40 - 59 years at screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fatal and non-fatal <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease events. RESULTS: There were 1085 major <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease events during the average follow up period of 16. 8 years. Serum urate was significantly associated {{with a wide range of}} cardiovascular risk factors including body mass index, alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment, pre-existing <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease, serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure. There was a significant positive association between serum urate and risk of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease after adjustment for lifestyle factors and disease indicators. This relation was attenuated to non-significance upon additional adjustment for diastolic blood pressure and serum total cholesterol: cholesterol appeared to be the critical factor in attenuating this relation. When the association between serum urate and risk of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease was examined by presence and grade of pre-existing <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease, a positive association was seen only in men with previous definite myocardial infarction, even after full adjustment (P = 0. 07).

Objective: The current study investigated the relationship between acute kidney injury and <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease prior to coronary angiography. Methods: All patients were evaluated after undergoing coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory of the Vinzentius Hospital in Landau, Germany, in 2011. The study group included patients with both acute <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease and acute kidney injury (as defined according to the classification of the Acute Kidney Injury Group); the control group included patients without acute <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} {{is characterized}} by high plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Despite the monogenetic origin of familial hypercholesterolemia, the incidence of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease varies considerably among patients, which is only partly explained by classical risk factors. Hypertension is an important risk factor for <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease {{that is associated with}} angiotensinogen levels. Therefore, we analyzed the angiotensinogen gene as a modifier gene for <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease risk in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. METHODS: In a cohort of 1785 familial hypercholesterolemia patients, we reconstructed five frequent haplotypes of the angiotensinogen gene, based on four polymorphisms. The five haplotypes cover approximately 98 % of the genetic diversity accounted for by these four polymorphisms. The associations between the haplotypes and <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease were analyzed with the haplo. stats program, adjusted for age, sex and smoking. RESULTS: Patients homozygous for the C allele of the 4072 T>C polymorphism had a 34 % increased <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease risk (P = 0. 017) compared to patients homozygous for the T allele.

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that smoking is {{strongly}} associated with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease, many patients continue or resume smoking after being diag- nosed with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease and even after an important event such as a myocardial infarction, angio- plasty or coronary bypass surgery. The evidence that smoking causes cardiovascular disease and new events in patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease, among other serious disorders such as lung cancer and emphysema, justiﬁes the promotion of smoking cessation. All rec- ommendations on the prevention of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> dis- ease emphasize the importance of smoking cessation in the reduction of the risk of coronary death and non-fatal coronary events[3, 4]. The recent EUROASPIRE study on the status of secondary prevention of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease in nine European countries has shown, however, that success in smoking cessation among <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease patients is far from satisfactory[5]. In this era of evidence-based medicine, information from systematic reviews of published studies should guide physicians and other health professionals advising patients in smoking cessation. With this in mind, we have carried out a systematic review of published observational studies on the impact of smoking cessation on the prognosis and on smoking intervention trials in patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease...|$|R

It is shown that the dominant symptom of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease is constipation. Inclusion of agents for intestine microbiocenosis correction in standard treatment regimen of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease contributes to reduction of severity not only dysbiotic changes, but also clinical symptoms of the underlying disease...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Coronary</b> <b>heart</b> {{disease is}} known as the most common disease that causes {{mortality}} in the world, one of the examination to identify the risks of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease is measuring waist circumference. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify correlation between large waist circumferences and the incident of coroner heart disease. Method: Design used in this study was analytic observational (retrospective) with cross sectional approach. There were 63 respondents which sampling by simple random sampling. The independent variable was waist circumferences and the dependent variable was <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease. Data were collected by direct observation then analyzed by spearman correlation statistic test with significance level α≤ 0. 05. Result: The result showed that waist circumferences more than normal had significant correlation with the incident of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease (p= 0. 02). Analysis: It can be concluded that there was correlation between waist circumferences more than normal and the incident of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease to the clients with coroner cardiac disease. Discussion: Earlier screening and detection is needed to prevent <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease...|$|R
40|$|D URING {{the past}} twenty years, the island of Puerto Rico has been {{experiencing}} a gradual transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy. Concomitant with this change, mortality rates for <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease have 1 A similar phenom-enon has been noted in many other countries. 2 Despite the increase in mortality rates for <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease in Puerto Rico, these rates are still lower {{than those in the}} popula-tion of the continental United States. These facts have led us to consider Puerto Rico an interesting community for the study of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease. We have been interested in various studies of the epidemiologic aspects of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease in Puerto Rico. Recently a study was performed in two different communities on the island for the purpose of comparing a number of characteristics which could aid in the selection of a sample for a larger pro-spective study of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease. 5 This paper presents the nutritional aspects of the study, and some comments of the re-lationship of nutrition to <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{socioeconomic}} gradient in <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> {{disease risk}} factors and mortality was examined in a popu-lation-based cohort attending a cardiovascular screening between 1977 and 1983 in three counties in Norway. The inverse socioeconomic gradient in many risk factors was stronger in women than in men and often stronger in non-smokers than smokers, particularly among women. In prospective analyses, adjusting for age and smoking, income {{was a significant predictor}} of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease mortality among both sexes, and after controlling for numerous risk factors, income remained a significant predictor of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease mortality among women, but not in men. The results suggest that the socioeconomic gradient in <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease risk may be stronger among women than men, and that differences in <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease risk is likely to persist even with reductions in smoking in populations of low socioeconomic status...|$|R

We {{assessed}} {{the association of}} father’s social class, recorded {{at the time of}} birth, with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease and stroke in a British cohort of 11106 individuals born in the 1950 s. Methods. Survival analysis was used to relate social class at birth to the occurrence of either fatal or nonfatal <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease or stroke. Results. Rates of <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> disease and stroke increased across the social class distribution from highest to lowest, and patterns of association were similar for the 2 outcomes.
