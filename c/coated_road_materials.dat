It was initiated within the EC 7 th Framework Programme Transport first call and is comprised of partners from fifteen participating countries for a budget of 1, 2 million Euros. The project runs through 2009 – 2011 and involves building a European Web database and drafting best practice guides on DIsmantling and RECycling Techniques for <b>road</b> <b>MATerials</b> (“DIRECT-MAT”). The intention is that project results shall support the daily work of practitioners, researchers and standardisation bodies. Several materials are addressed – unbound, hydraulically bound and asphalt <b>road</b> <b>materials,</b> but also other <b>materials</b> related to <b>road</b> use but not commonly recycled in road construction. These include tyre shreds, sediment from ditches, industrial by-products and reinforcement materials. The work programme is organised into seven work packages where four packages focus on the various construction materials, one {{is devoted to the}} database and the remaining two work packages to management & coordination and dissemination. Dissemination activities include cooperation with a Reference Group consisting of end users in several countries; presentations in national and international papers and conferences as well as the arrangement of national seminars and a European workshop for end users. Continuous project information will be available at [URL] At present, many European countries have acquired experience in dismantling and recycling <b>road</b> <b>materials</b> back into <b>roads.</b> However, research results are not widely implemented and national documents are not often available to specialists from other countries. In this European project, twenty partners cooperate to build a web database that will provide access to validated guidelines, national document references, harmonised literature reviews and practical application case studies based on jobsite data sets. In this way DIRECT-MAT will actively contribute to generating closer cooperation between research and practice within <b>road</b> <b>material</b> recycling and also contribute to reducing the waste disposal associated with roads...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This PhD {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of a synopsis and five published papers that are focused on both the research results of studies on electrical properties of <b>road</b> <b>materials</b> and subgrade soils and their seasonal changes {{and the use of}} Ground Penetrating Radar technique in traffic infrastructure surveys. The data for this survey was collected mainly in Finland, Texas, Scotland and Sweden and thus presents many kinds of <b>road</b> <b>materials,</b> subgrade soils and climate conditions. The synopsis of this work begins with a presentation of the theory and basic principles of GPR techniques. Special attention is given to the dielectric properties and seasonal changes of unbound <b>road</b> <b>materials</b> and subgrade soils. The synopsis also presents different kinds of GPR hardware systems as well as recommendations and experiences from different data collection, processing and interpretation techniques. Special attention is given to a method whereby GPR data is integrated with other road survey data and then analysed using a number of structural diagnostic methods. Finally, the synopsis provides an overview of of the various GPR applications on roads and streets, bridges, railways and airports. The laboratory test results presented in this work show that the relationship between dielectric value and increasing water content is not linear or exponential but more likely a series of logarithmic functions. Laboratory results also showed that dielectric dispersion, which can be related to poorly performing subgrade soils and road aggregates, takes place mainly in loosely bound adsorption water and capillary water layer. As such these moisture sensitive problem materials can also be identified during the dry summer seasons when they are stiff. Dielectric value and electrical conductivity can also be related to other technical properties of <b>road</b> <b>materials</b> and subgrade soils such as frost susceptibility, shear strength, plastic limit, compaction degree and voids content. Laboratory tests and field data collected using the Percostation technique also demonstrate that a knowledge of seasonal changes and thermodynamics is very important in understanding and modelling the mechanical behaviour of road structures. Finally, laboratory and field tests indicate that colloids have {{an important role in the}} failure mechanism of the <b>road</b> <b>materials.</b> This research demonstrates that the GPR technique not only gives valuable structural information on the different types of structures and subgrade soils but it provides a wide range of information of the electrical properties of the materials under survey which can be further related to their mechanical performance. The best information will be gained if GPR data is analysed together with other non destructive testing data collected form the roads, railways and airports...|$|R

The database addresses unbound, hydraulically bound and asphalt <b>road</b> <b>materials.</b> It also addresses other <b>materials</b> related to <b>road</b> use but not commonly recycled into road construction. These include tire shreds, sediment from ditches, <b>road</b> reinforcement <b>materials</b> and industrial by-products as long as they come from the demolition of a road into which they were recycled a first time. The database provides on-line access to Best Practice Guides, practical application case studies and international literature reviews elaborated from the review of national documents. There are three different ways for searching the database: 1) Via specific documents – Literature reviews, Case study reports and Best Practice Guides – for each material type; 2) Via quick or advanced search for specific terms; 3) Via a map where case studies are geo-tagged. The DIRECT-MAT database has been developed by some fifty experts from fifteen European countries. This means that national documents, working sites data and research results have now become easily available to road authorities, CEN technical committees and researchers from other countries. This share of national knowledge and practices is expected to boost recycling, thus DIRECT-MAT will contribute to reducing waste disposal associated with roads. Furthermore, the DIRECT-MAT web database is expected to serve as a reference tool for recording and sharing working site data on the demolition and recycling of <b>road</b> <b>materials</b> throughout Europe...|$|R
