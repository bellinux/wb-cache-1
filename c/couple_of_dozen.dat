The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed).

2500|$|The Austrians were {{actually}} retreating towards Znaim in Bohemia. The Austrian army had suffered greatly during the Battle of Wagram {{and had to}} leave behind their wounded, but did make off with thousands of French prisoners, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>dozen</b> guns and a few eagles. Making good use of night marches, Archduke Charles had {{the bulk of his}} forces assembled at Korneuburg on 7 July. Charles and his senior commanders had considered various plans to continue the campaign, but in the end, Charles was not positioning his army for a continuation of the campaign. The Austrian commander's view well before the Battle of Wagram had been that Austria's best option was to make peace and, in order to achieve that, the Empire needed to have a large, battle-worthy army, which they could use as leverage during the peace talks. Between 9 and 12 August, the French from Eugène's [...] "Army of Italy" [...] clashed with Archduke John's forces in a series of skirmishes and pushed them back into Hungary, while Masséna caught up with and fought the Austrian rearguard in a several actions, most notable of which was the one at Hollabrunn. By now, Napoleon had largely understood Charles's intentions and manoeuvred against them. Marmont and his small XI Corps was the first to engage the Austrian army at the Battle of Znaim and was momentarily largely outnumbered. His 10,000 men faced some 60,000 massed enemy troops, but, in the typical style of Napoleonic warfare, Marmont decided to attack in order to pin down the enemy. He could reasonably expect to be reinforced soon and at 22:00, Napoleon arrived with reinforcements. The battle raged on the next day, with some bloody fighting going on around Znaim. The Austrians took heavy casualties, some 6,200 men, during the battle and, as time passed, the French force was set to be augmented to some 84,000 men, following the imminent arrival of Davout and Oudinot. Recognising the futility of another battle, Charles decided to ask for an armistice. He did so on his own responsibility, as he did not have permission to do so from Emperor Francis I. Ignoring the advice of his senior commanders – Maréchal Berthier was vocal in advising the continuation of hostilities and destruction of the Austrian Empire – Napoleon accepted. The Armistice of Znaim marked the end of the active phase of the 1809 war between France and Austria.|$|E

Given these features a hybrid multi-layer perceptron is trained, which simultaneously classifies and reconstructs input data.

40|$|Abstract. As {{knowledge}} engineering {{moves to the}} Semantic Web, ontologies become dynamic products of collaborative development rather than artifacts produced in a closed environment of a single research group. However, the projects differ—sometimes significantly—in {{the way that the}} community members can contribute, the different roles they play, the mechanisms they use to carry out discussions and to achieve consensus. We are currently developing a flexible mechanism to support a wide range of collaborative workflows in the Protégé environment. In this paper, we describe our overall architecture that supports flexible collaborative workflows in Protégé. This architecture comprises an ontology for representing workflows for collaborative ontology development, a customizable ontology-development environment that our system generates based on a declarative description of a workflow, and a run-time integration with a workflow execution engine. 1 Overview of Workflows for Collaborative Ontology Development Collaborative ontology development has become an active area of research and practice. On most large projects today, ontology development is a collaborative effort, involving both ontology engineers and domain experts. The number of users participating in development ranges from a handful (e. g., the Foundational Model of Anatomy [7]), to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>dozens</b> (e. g., the National Cancer Institute’s Thesaurus [9]), to the whole community contributing to the ontology in some way (e. g., the Gene Ontology [3]). With larger groups of users contributing to ontology content, many organizations define formal workflows for collaborative development, describing how project participants reach consensus on definitions, who can perform changes, who can comment on them, when ontology changes become public and so on. Some collaborative projects have been publishing and refining their workflows for years (e. g., the Gene Ontology). In other projects, ontology researchers are working actively with domain experts to make these workflows explicit and to provide tooling for supporting the specific workflows (e. g., ontology development for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO...|$|R
