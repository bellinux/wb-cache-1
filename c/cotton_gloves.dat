25|$|Prior to {{touching}} an object, individuals should {{wash their}} hands and determine the most appropriate handling procedures based on the medium being handled. Metal, paper, textiles, and other porouse materials {{require the use of}} <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves</b> to prevent oils from human skin tarnishing, staining, or otherwise damaging the object. Glass, glazed ceramics, and other potentially slippery surfaces should be handled using latex or vinyl gloves to prevent slippage. Prior to handling an object, {{it is also important to}} (1) take note of any structural weaknesses so that direct pressure on these areas may be avoided, (2) any clothing or accoutrements with the potential to scratch or catch on the object should be secured, and (3) the object's weight should be considered so that additional help may be requested when handling heavier objects.|$|E
25|$|Carnival and {{the dance}} of the Chinelos are {{intertwined}} in the municipality. Each year since the colonial period, Tlayacapan has had a Carnival just before Lent. The dance originated here as part of Carnival. The name Chinelo comes from the Nahuatl word zineloquie, which means “disguised.” During colonial times Spanish overlords were often crule and oppressive to the mestizo and indigenous populations. During Carnival, masks were permitted and the dancers gradually took on an appearance designed {{to make fun of}} the Spanish. The gown mimics the nightgowns of Spanish colonial women, with white <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves</b> also serving to imitate these women. The ornate hat encrusted with fake jewels and large feathers mimics those worn by both sexes. The mask not only served to hide identity, but also they are made with wire mesh, painted pink, with heavy eyebrows and long pointed beards to mimic the abundant facial hair of Europeans. According to tradition, the hat was created by someone named Candido rojas, the wire mesh masks by someone with the last name of Tlacomulco and the gown decorated with stripes and colored yoke by someone only known as “Barrabas.” The dancers march through the streets, striking poses and making jumping movements, often inviting onlookers to join in. They are accompanied by local bands, playing traditional music and even sons and other musical compositions created just for them. This Chinelo tradition was copied and modified by many other towns in Morelos, starting with Tepoztlán, which has its own colors and style of hat. There are also Chinelo dancers in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta and Xochimilco in nearby Mexico City. However, the dance is now a symbol of the state of Morelos.|$|E
2500|$|For {{ceremonial}} occasions, Queen's Counsel wear black breeches {{and black}} stockings instead of trousers, and patent leather court shoes with buckles. They {{wear the same}} black frock coat and waistcoat worn when appearing in court (never the [...] "bum freezer", however) but add lace at the wrists and also a lace stock at the collar. Bands are no longer worn at the collar {{in addition to the}} lace, and the winged collar is also dispensed with. They have white <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves,</b> but these are invariably carried and not worn. This part of their ceremonial dress is taken from the standard ceremonial dress worn at the Royal Court (as opposed to the Courts of Justice) by other courtiers.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of wearing two new designs of <b>cotton</b> <b>glove</b> on several hand performance capabilities and compared them against the effects of barehanded, single-layered and double <b>cotton</b> <b>glove</b> conditions when working with hand tools (screwdriver and pliers). The new glove designs {{were based on the}} findings of subjective hand discomfort assessments for this type of work and aimed to match the glove thickness to the localised pressure and sensitivity in different areas of the hand as well as to provide adequate dexterity for fine manipulative tasks. The results showed that the first prototype glove and the barehanded condition were comparable and provided better dexterity and higher handgrip strength than double thickness gloves. The results support the hypothesis that selective thickness in different areas of the hand could be applied by glove manufacturers to improve the glove design, so that it can protect the hands from the environment {{and at the same time}} allow optimal hand performance capabilities...|$|R
60|$|The girl, biting the finger-tip of {{her white}} <b>cotton</b> <b>glove,</b> was {{staring out at the}} traffic.

6000|$|He heard a clear, rather languid and {{delicate}} voice quietly speak on until it {{broke into a}} little peal of laughter, followed, when it fell silent by Sheila's--rapid, rich, and low. The first speaker seemed to be standing. Probably, then, his evening visitors had only just come in, or were preparing to depart. He inserted his latchkey and gently pushed at the cumbersome door. It was locked against him. With not the faintest thought of resentment or surprise, he turned back, stooped over the balustrade and {{looked down into the}} kitchen.

60|$|There {{was a man}} at Mr. Beilby's who was {{entitled}} to greet him with endearing terms, and to be so greeted himself, although Harry {{had never seen him}} till he attended {{for the first time at}} the Adelphi. This was Theodore Burton, his future brother-in-law, who was now the leading man in the London house--the leading man as regarded business, though he was not as yet a partner. It was understood that this Mr. Burton was to come in when his father went out; and in the meantime he received a salary of a thousand a year as managing clerk. A very hard-working, steady, intelligent man was Mr. Theodore Burton, with a bald head, a high forehead, and that look of constant work about him which such men obtain. Harry Clavering could not bring himself to take a liking to him, because he wore <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves,</b> and had an odious habit of dusting his shoes with his pocket-handkerchief. Twice Harry saw him do this on the first day of their acquaintance, and he regretted it exceedingly. The <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves,</b> too, were offensive, as were also the thick shoes which had been dusted; but the dusting was the great sin.|$|E

On his bald head was perched a little, round, red cap held in place by a rubber elastic underneath his chin.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues that restrict the biomass/waste-based nanocarbons in supercapacitor application is the poor structural inheritability during the activating process. Herein, we prepare a class of activated carbon fibers by carefully selecting waste <b>cotton</b> <b>glove</b> (CG) as the precursor, which mainly consists of cellulose fibers that can be transformed to carbon along with good inheritability of their fiber morphology upon activation. As prepared, the CG-based activated carbon fiber (CGACF) demonstrates a surface area of 1435  m 2  g− 1 contributed by micropores of 1.3  nm and small mesopores of 2.7  nm, while the fiber morphology can be well inherited from the CG with 3 D interconnected frameworks created on the fiber surface. This hierarchically porous structure and well-retained fiber-like skeleton can simultaneously minimize the diffusion/transfer resistance of the electrolyte and electron, respectively, and maximize the surface area utilization for charge accumulation. Consequently, CGACF presents a higher specific capacitance of 218  F g− 1 and an excellent high-rate performance as compared to commercial activated carbon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} model-based method for hand posture {{recognition}} in monocular image sequences that measures joint angles, viewing angle, and position in space. Visual markers {{in form of}} a colored <b>cotton</b> <b>glove</b> are used to extract descriptive and stable 2 D features. Searching a synthetically generated database of 2. 6 million entries, each consisting of 3 D hand posture parameters and the corresponding 2 D features, yields several candidate postures per frame. This ambiguity is resolved by exploiting temporal continuity between successive frames. The method is robust to noise, can be used from any viewing angle, and places no constraints on the hand posture. Self-occlusion of any number of markers is handled. It requires no initialization and retrospectively corrects posture errors when accordant information becomes available. Besides a qualitative evaluation on real images, a quantitative performance measurement using {{a large amount of}} synthetic input data featuring various degrees of noise shows the effectiveness of the approach. ...|$|R

Sometimes in the kitchen, often in the pantry, {{occasionally}} in the passages, and always in the way, for he was excitedly abrupt in his motions, might have been seen the face and figure of Francois Le Rue. Francois was obviously performing {{the part of a}} waiter, for he wore a badly-fitting suit of black, white <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves</b> three sizes too large, and pumps, with white socks, besides which he flourished a white napkin {{as if it were a}} war-banner, and held on tenaciously to a cork-screw.|$|E
60|$|But {{in spite}} of this {{acknowledged}} weakness, a brisk trade over the counter had been produced; and though the firm had never owned a large stock, an unremitting sale was maintained of small goods, such as ribbons, stockings, handkerchiefs, and <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves.</b> The Katakarion shirts also had been successful, and now there was a hope that, during the coming winter, something might be done in African monkey muffs. At that time, therefore, the bill of the house at three months, though not to be regarded as a bank-note, was not absolutely waste paper. How far Brisket's eyes were open on this matter cannot now be said; but he still expressed himself willing to take one hundred pounds in cash, and the remainder of Maryanne's fortune in the bill of the firm at three months.|$|E

She must have been very small, for she could remember looking up and seeing high above her head the two brass knobs by which the glass was fastened to its frame. Suddenly, out of the upper portion of the glass, there looked a scared red face. It hovered there a moment, and over it in swift succession there passed the expressions, first of petrified amazement, secondly of shocked indignation, and thirdly of righteous wrath. And then it swooped down upon her, and the image in the glass became a confusion of small naked arms and legs mingled with green <b>cotton</b> <b>gloves</b> and purple bonnet strings.|$|E
