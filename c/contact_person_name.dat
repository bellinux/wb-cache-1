40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} different <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> for patients with metastatic solid tumours treated in a community-based oncology group practice. Methods: Psychosocial distress was measured between 04 - 07 / 2009 using the distress thermometer and problem list. All patients were asked 3 questions: To whom do you talk, when you are distressed? Which persons are helpful to reduce your distress? How did helpful persons help you? Results: 202 patients with a median age of 68 years (37 - 85) completed the interview. Most important <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> <b>named</b> by patients were: oncologist (84 %), partner (71 %), children (64 %), friends (53 %) and general practitioner (52 %). The most helpful persons were oncologist (97 %), friends (94 %), partner (92 %), children (92 %) and general practitioner (91 %) {{and the most important}} qualities of help were listening, patience and mindfulness. The most important qualities of help from the oncologist were: therapy, listening and information/advice. Conclusion: Patients with metastatic solid tumours use a helping network of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> when they are distressed. The oncologist, partner, children, friends and general practitioner are key persons. Training of oncologists in distress management is of utmost importance. Furthermore the patient's networ...|$|R

40|$|By and large, {{librarianship}} {{seems to}} have ignored the informal communication flourishing among their clientele. Informal communication both within and with outside the organisation and various informal and interpersonal sources of information are found to play {{crucial role in the}} work of an engineer/ technologist. Some of the reasons for such an importance of informal communication for an engineer are discussed. A study of interpersonal communication looks at the 'transceiver' role of an engineer and leads to inquire into his information potential and identification of communication networks, their characteristics like density, connectedness, centrality and cluster, communication stars, isolates and technological gatekeepers. The informal and interpersonal communication among a defined set of over 800 Indian satellite technologists is investigated by sociometric analysis of the number of <b>persons</b> they regularly <b>contact</b> for work related information and with the names of five most often <b>contacted</b> <b>persons</b> provided in response to a questionnaire. The intra and inter-organisation communication of respondents and their relation with some characteristics of respondents are examined. A sociometric analysis of up to five most often <b>contacted</b> <b>persons</b> <b>named</b> by the respondents revealed that 391 respondents mentioned 515 individuals/organisations 1538 times. As much as 87 % of contacts within the organisation and the rest represented inter-organisation communication. An average satellite technologists found to be simultaneously a source of information for about 3 others in the response population (connectedness of the network). The analysis helped identification of communication stars or high information potentials (HIPs), isolates and technological gatekeepers. An examination of dyadic reflexive communication revealed existence of a cluster and some linking pins in the network. Further, similarities and dissimilarities of participants of dyadic communication are also analysed...|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the importance of}} <b>contacts</b> of a <b>person</b> (whether they are direct or indirect) in online wiki elections {{by means of a}} number of different graph-based measures. We have used the methods of influential node identification based on a local measure named degree centrality and k-neighbors to find the direct (personal) <b>contacts</b> of a <b>person.</b> Likewise, different global measures are used to find the indirect (know-how) <b>contacts</b> of a <b>person</b> <b>named</b> betweenness centrality, k-core, PageRank, and brokerage roles. The results of the election are examined in terms of the success of a candidate (admin selection) and involvement of a candidate (participation in voting). It is found that direct (personal) <b>contacts</b> of a <b>person</b> have significance in both cases. Apart from these results, research community has also shown that contacts and actions of those contacts of an individual, influence her/his participation and decision-making process respectively in voting on Wikipedia (Lee et al. 2012). Furthermore, our results also seems consistant with the findings of (Lin 2017) and (Spierings and Jacobs 2014) about the importance of contacts of a candidate in electoral outcome on other OSNs e.g. Facebook and Twitter. It is explored that importance of contacts of a candidate in terms of number of fans of a candidate on the Facebook in municipal election carried out in Taiwan. It is found that number of online fans of a candidate is positively associated to the election outcomes (Lin 2017). It has been examined, that the number of followers of a candidate positively contributes towards preferential voting against him, provided that candidate is actively participating in OSNs (Spierings and Jacobs 2014).|$|R

This study analysed the structure of informal networks of persons with PIMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data concerning the number, type and frequency of contacts were collected in 205 persons with PIMD. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> was 5. 1 (range: 0 - 26, SD: 4. 2) per year. 79. 4 % of the <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> are family, {{with an average of}} 72. 3 contacts per year. Parents had significantly more contact compared to the other informal <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In 2. 2 % of the sample contacts with peers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The informal networks of persons with PIMD consist mainly of family. The question arises how informal networks can be expanded and which role professionals have in this process...|$|R

40|$|Subjects: All {{residents}} {{during an}} 18 month period {{were included in}} this study. Intervention: Hip protectors were introduced as {{a regular part of}} health care service for all residents. Residents at high risk were encouraged to use hip protectors regularly. Each nursing home had a <b>contact</b> <b>person.</b> Main outcome measures: The percentage of residents accepting the hip protector offer, probability of continued use, reasons for terminating use, and percentage of falls with hip protector were evaluated. Results: Fifty five percent of the residents accepted the hip protector offer. The percentage increased by age, but showed no significant dependence on gender, profession of the <b>contact</b> <b>person,</b> or size of nursing home. The probability of continued use showed no significant dependence on age and gender. Nursing homes with a nurse as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> showed 51 % higher risk of residents terminating regular hip protector use than nursing homes with a physiotherapist as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> (relative risk (RR) 1. 51, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11 to 2. 05, p = 0. 008).
