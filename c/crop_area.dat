25|$|In the 20th century, global wheat output {{expanded}} by about 5-fold, but until about 1955 {{most of this}} reflected increases in wheat <b>crop</b> <b>area,</b> with lesser (about 20%) increases in crop yields per unit area. After 1955 however, there was a ten-fold increase {{in the rate of}} wheat yield improvement per year, and this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to increase. Thus technological innovation and scientific crop management with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output growth {{in the second half of}} the century. There were some significant decreases in wheat <b>crop</b> <b>area,</b> for instance in North America.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa is {{considered}} an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop.

30|$|Size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> was {{statistically}} significant at 1  % and negatively influenced a farmer’s willingness to insure his/her cocoa farm. Thus, the bigger the <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> the less likely a farmer {{would be willing to}} insure his/her farm. From the results, as the size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> increases by one acre, the probability that a cocoa farmer would insure his farm reduces by 0.003. The results again revealed that the amount (premium) farmers {{are willing to pay for}} crop insurance is positively influenced by size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> and statistically significant at 1  %. This means that as size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> increases by one acre, the amount (premium) farmers are willing to pay for crop insurance increases by GH¢ 0.56. This contradicts the findings of Kumar et al. (2011) which reported that size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> negatively influence willingness to pay an amount for crop insurance.|$|R

40|$|The {{crops that}} we grow for food need {{specific}} climatic conditions to show better performance {{in view of}} economic yield. A changing climate could have both beneficial and harmful effects on crops. Keeping the above view in mind, this study is undertaken to investigate the impacts of climate change (viz. changes in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine) on the yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of four major food crops (viz. Aus rice, Aman rice, Boro rice and wheat) in Bangladesh. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard error (HAC) and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) methods {{were used to determine}} the climate-crop interrelations using national level time series data for the period of 1972 – 2010. Findings revealed that the effects of all the climate variables have had significant contributions to the yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of major food crops with distinct variation among them. Maximum temperature statistically significantly affected all the food crops’ yield except Aus rice. Maximum temperature also insignificantly affected <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of all the crops. Minimum temperature insignificantly affected Aman rice but benefited other three crops’ yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area.</b> Rainfall significantly benefitted <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aus rice, but significantly affected both yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aman rice. Humidity statistically positively contributed to the yield of Aus and Aman rice but, statistically, negatively influenced the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of Aus rice. Sunshine statistically significantly benefitted only Boro rice yield. Overall, maximum temperature adversely affected yield and <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> of all the major food crops and rainfall severely affected Aman rice only. Concerning the issue of climate change and ensuring food security, the respective authorities thus should give considerable attention to the generation, development and extension of drought (all major food crops) and flood (particularly Aman rice) tolerant varieties...|$|R

25|$|Crop {{areas were}} farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on {{non-irrigated}} cultivation (secano), which made up 85% {{of the entire}} <b>crop</b> <b>area,</b> depended solely on rainfall {{as a source of}} water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.|$|E
25|$|GM cotton acreage in India {{grew at a}} rapid rate, {{increasing}} from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 {{million hectares}} in 2011. The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area. This made India {{the country with the}} largest area of GM cotton in the world. A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers. The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> of 2.6 million hectares in 2011. The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia– the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction). The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009 making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world. Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.|$|E

30|$|The size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> was {{measured}} in acres. It is hypothesized that the larger the <b>cropped</b> <b>area,</b> the more likely the farmer would adopt crop insurance. This is because, {{it is difficult to}} manage a large portion of farm land than a smaller portion and therefore, the more likely the farmer is to face risk like low yield and pest infestation or the impact a farmer would experience in times of perils is greater with large farm size. On the other hand, the premium a farmer will pay would increase as the size of <b>cropped</b> <b>area</b> increases.|$|R

40|$|Conveyor belt {{cropping}} is a cropping principal that {{is characterized}} by the plants being placed in one end of the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> and then transported along it throughout their development. When they reach the end of the <b>cropping</b> <b>area,</b> they are fully grown and ready for harvesting. Along the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> there are areas where work with the plants is done. There are several advantages in using such a system. The work environment is better because the climate can be adjusted to the wishes {{of the people in the}} work areas and because individual aids can be installed. The labour requirement is reduced because work that was done earlier is no longer required and work efficiency increases thanks to the improved climate. The utilization of the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> increases when movable tables are installed instead of rolling tables and because there are possibilities to space plants gradually. Since the movable <b>cropping</b> <b>areas</b> with plants is one single unit, the need of transport in the firm is reduced. Some transport inputs can be omitted. The work organization is simplified because there are fewer plants in the same size category and since the batches are more numerous. This enables the usual working peaks, for instance at harvest, to be avoided. A continuous production is achieved which makes the grower less sensitive to temporary price changes in the plants grown and decreases the losses when the crop is changed. The biological advantages are that the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> can be split in different climates and that the climate can be adjusted to the stage of plant development. There are some requirements for conveyor belt cropping: - Uniformity in the development of plants. - The harvest time must be quite short. - <b>Cropping</b> <b>areas</b> must be movable and there must be transport equipment to move the areas. To get uniformity in development and a short harvest time the cropping must be close to the biological optimum. Therefore only one kind of plant should be present on the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> at the same time. This is because few crops have the same demands on environment. The plants must be genetically defined and free from diseases. During the winter the cropping will be run with inputs of carbon dioxide and illumination. Conveyor belt cropping is especially suited to crops which react uniformly to management inputs, for example in order to initiate flowering. Chrysanthemum belongs to these. Other suitable crops for conveyor belt cropping are plants with only vegetative development, for example lettuce and Hedera. To optimize the use of the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> a production plan ought to be prepared which considers the variation in cropping time during the year. Because the plants are moved during the cropping and the cropping time varies with radiation, the empty space after harvest can not always be filled up. A model capable of optimization will calculate how many plants are needed in the <b>cropping</b> <b>area</b> for maximum utilization. Crops with short harvest time and with slight variation in cropping time during the year are the ones best suited to conveyor belt cropping. The report ends with a description of the cropping, equipment and production planning at some growers. When better models of cropping and development are available, the possibilities to controll the crops will increase and more kinds of plants will become suitable for conveyor belt cropping. There are also good opportunities to automate the cropping system to reduce human labour inputs...|$|R
