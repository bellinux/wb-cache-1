50|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> is {{a third-generation}} oral {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic sold under the brand names Cefzon and Omnicef.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> is a {{bacteriocidal}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin {{class of}} antibiotics. It {{can be used}} to treat infections caused by several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> is {{administered}} orally. It is available as capsules and a suspension. Dosage, schedule, {{and duration of}} therapy varies according {{to the type of}} infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} and {{has been}} used to treat infections of the respiratory tract including pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.|$|E
50|$|Therapeutic uses of <b>cefdinir</b> include otitis media, {{soft tissue}} infections, and {{respiratory}} tract infections, including sinusitis, strep throat (note: no documented resistance of Group A Streptococcus to penicillin {{has ever been}} reported, and penicillin or amoxicillin is preferred except in penicillin allergic patients), community-acquired pneumonia, and acute exacerbations of bronchitis.|$|E
50|$|Henri Gougerot and Alexandre Carteaud {{originally}} {{described the}} condition in 1927. The cause remains unknown, but {{the observation that}} the condition may clear with Minocycline turned attention to an infectious agent. Actinomycete Dietzia strain X was isolated from one individual. Other antibiotics found useful include azithromycin, fusidic acid, clarithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline and <b>cefdinir.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{pediatric}} {{version of}} <b>cefdinir</b> {{can bind to}} iron in the digestive tract; in rare cases, this causes a rust or red discoloration of the stool. Blood typically appears dark brown or black in stool, and testing may confirm which is present. If the reddish stool is accompanied by abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, etc., a Clostridium difficile infection caused by the antibiotic could be signified.|$|E
50|$|Acylation of {{the primary}} amine 1 with 4-bromo-3-oxobutanoyl bromide (2) leads to the amide (3). The active {{methylene}} group in that product is then nitrosated with sodium nitrite; the initial product spontaneously tautomerizes to afford the oxime (4). The bromoketone array in that intermediate constitutes a classical starting function for construction of thiazoles. Reaction of 4 with thiourea thus leads to formation of an aminothiazole moiety. Thus there is obtained the antibiotic <b>cefdinir</b> (5).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> {{is a drug}} {{appearing}} in 11 patents from 5 pharmaceutical companies in which a total of 5 different polymorphs are described. The original inventor Fujisawa now Astellas (with US partner Abbott) extended the original patent covering a suspension with a new anhydrous formulation. Competitors in turn patented hydrates of the drug with varying water content, which were described with only basic techniques such as infrared spectroscopy and XRPD, a practice criticised in one review because these techniques at the most suggest a different crystal structure but are unable to specify one; however, given the recent advances in XRPD, it is perfectly feasible to obtain {{the structure of a}} polymorph of a drug, even if there is no single crystal available for that polymorphic form. These techniques also tend to overlook chemical impurities or even co-components. Abbott researchers realised this the hard way when, in one patent application, it was ignored that their new <b>cefdinir</b> crystal form was, in fact, that of a pyridinium salt. The review also questioned whether the polymorphs offered any advantages to the existing drug: something clearly demanded in a new patent.|$|E
50|$|It was {{discovered}} by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (now Astellas) and introduced in 1991 under the brand name Cefzon. Warner-Lambert licensed this cephalosporin for marketing in US from Fujisawa. Abbott obtained U.S. marketing rights to Omnicef (<b>cefdinir)</b> in December 1998 through an agreement with Warner-Lambert Company. It was approved by FDA on Dec 4, 1997. It is available in US as Omnicef by Abbott Laboratories and in India as Cednir by Abbott, Kefnir by Glenmark, Cefdair by Xalra Pharma and Cefdiel by Ranbaxy.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of third generation cephalosporins have the aminothiazole group at position C-7. Different groups are {{found at the}} 7-α-position like 7-α-iminohydroxy and 7-α-iminomethoxy. Ceftibuten however possesses a 7-α-ethylidene group. This group gives ceftibuten higher resistance to enhanced spectrum β-lactamases. Many of the oral third generation cephalosporins are esters of parenteral forms and are hydrolysed by esterases in the digestive tract (Cefteram-pivoxil). Some of the third generation drugs can be absorbed orally without the need of esterification. This is for example done with Cefixime and <b>Cefdinir</b> by putting a vinyl group in the C-3 position.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment with {{antibiotics}} such as amoxicillin or <b>cefdinir</b> improve the response and survival rate of severely malnourished children to an outpatient treatment plan which provided therapeutic food. This confirms the recommendation, [...] "In {{addition to the}} provision of RUTF therapeutic food, children need to receive a short course of basic oral medication to treat infections." [...] contained in [...] "Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition and the United Nations Children’s Fund." ...|$|E
5000|$|Several {{virulence}} {{factors of}} P. penneri can make infections from this invasive pathogen more pronounced, persistent, {{and harder to}} eradicate. [...] These include adherence due {{to the presence of}} fimbriae or afimbrial adhesins, invasiveness, swarming phenomenon, hemolytic activity, urea hydrolysis, proteolysis, and endotoxicity. Swarming motility is the coordinated translocation of a bacterial population driven by flagellar rotation in film or on fluid surfaces. An emerging concept in microbiology, the fundamental role of swarming motility remains unknown. However, it has been observed to be correlated with an elevated resistance to certain antibiotics. Production of IgA proteolytic enzymes has also been reported in P. penneri. Secretory immunoglobulins of the IgA class are produced by mucous tissue and are particularly resistant to enzymatic breakdown by proteases. The ability to degrade a host’s secretory IgA may provide P. penneri with an advantage by permitting it to evade the host immune response, therefore gaining valuable time for the bacterium to establish a foothold for infection. However, the major mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is caused by hyperproduction of the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase, sometimes by plasmids. These inducible β-lactamases hydrolyze primary and extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, thus making P. penneri strains naturally resistant to penicillin G, amoxicillin, cephalosporins (i.e. cefaclor, cefazoline, cefuroxime, and <b>cefdinir),</b> oxacillin, and most macrolides.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefdinir</b> (Omnicef; Abbott Laboratories) is a {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic primarily {{eliminated by}} the kidney. Nonlinear renal elimination of <b>cefdinir</b> {{has been previously}} reported. <b>Cefdinir</b> renal transport mechanisms were studied in the erythrocyte-free isolated perfused rat kidney. Studies were performed with drug-free perfusate and perfusate containing <b>cefdinir</b> alone to establish the baseline physiology and investigate <b>cefdinir</b> renal elimination characteristics. To investigate <b>cefdinir</b> renal transport mechanisms, inhibition studies were conducted by coperfusing <b>cefdinir</b> with inhibitors of the renal organic anion (probenecid), organic cation (tetraethylammonium), or dipeptide (glycylsarcosine) transport system. <b>Cefdinir</b> concentrations in biological samples were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Differences between treatments and controls were evaluated using analysis of variance and Dunnett's test. The excretion ratio (ER; the renal clearance corrected for the fraction unbound and glomerular filtration rate) for <b>cefdinir</b> was 5. 94, a value indicating net renal tubular secretion. Anionic, cationic, and dipeptide transport inhibitors all significantly affected the <b>cefdinir</b> ER. With probenecid, the ER was reduced to 0. 59, clearly demonstrating a significant reabsorptive component to <b>cefdinir</b> renal disposition. This finding was confirmed by glycylsarcosine studies, in which the ER was elevated to 7. 95, indicating that reabsorption was mediated, at least in part, by the dipeptide transporter system. The effects of the organic cation tetraethylammonium, in which the ER was elevated to 7. 53, were likely secondary in nature. The anionic secretory pathway {{was found to be}} the predominant mechanism for <b>cefdinir</b> renal excretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{interaction between}} <b>cefdinir</b> and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril or quinapril) {{was investigated in}} rats. The linearity of <b>cefdinir</b> pharmacokinetics was demonstrated in three groups of rats receiving 10, 20, or 40 mg of <b>cefdinir</b> per kg of body weight intravenously. Then, three other groups of rats were established as follows: group 1 (n = 5) received <b>cefdinir</b> (10 mg/kg) intravenously, and 12 blood samples per rat were drawn between 0 and 8 h after injection of the dose; group 2 (n = 5) was treated {{in the same way}} as group 1, but captopril (0. 8 mg/kg) was coadministered by intraintestinal injection into all animals; group 3 (n = 6) was treated {{in the same way as}} group 2, but quinapril (0. 8 mg/kg) replaced captopril. Plasma <b>cefdinir</b> concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography, and the data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method. Finally, three groups of four or five rats each were set up as described above, but the <b>cefdinir</b> dose was 20 mg/kg and the animals were sacrificed 1 h after drug injection to collect blood to determine the unbound <b>cefdinir</b> fraction (fu) by ultrafiltration. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased the mean <b>cefdinir</b> area under the concentration-time curve up to 8 h by a factor of 1. 8 (captopril; P < 0. 05) and a factor of 3. 5 (quinapril; P < 0. 05). With captopril, mean <b>cefdinir</b> clearance was decreased by a factor of 2, and the volume of distribution increased by the same factor, while the fu increased from 15. 4 % +/- 3. 0 % (<b>cefdinir</b> alone) to 22. 8 % +/- 10. 9 % (<b>cefdinir</b> plus captopril). Captopril increased the <b>cefdinir</b> half-life from 0. 62 +/- 0. 17 to 2. 92 +/- 0. 95 h. With quinapril, the interaction was so strong that no elimination phase was detectable in four of the six rats, and therefore, no pharmacokinetic parameter values other than the <b>cefdinir</b> fu could be calculated; the <b>cefdinir</b> fu increased to 25. 1 % +/- 11. 1 %. It is concluded that captopril and quinapril (and/or their metabolites) have a major impact on the disposition of <b>cefdinir</b> in rats, probably by competition at the plasma protein-binding level and at the tubular anionic carrier level. This latter mechanism should also be relevant in humans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerability of three antibiotic regimens {{in patients with}} acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, multicentered, parallel-group study, patients received once-daily <b>cefdinir</b> 600 mg, twice-daily <b>cefdinir</b> 300 mg, or twice-daily cefuroxime axetil 250 mg for 10 days. Primary efficacy measures were microbiologic eradication rate, by pathogen and by patient, and clinical response rate, by patient. Results: Of 1045 patients, 589 were evaluable for efficacy. At baseline, most patients had moderate or severe cough and sputum production as well as rhonchi, wheezing, and dyspnea. The microbiologic eradication rates by pathogen were 90 % with once-daily <b>cefdinir,</b> 85 % with twice-daily <b>cefdinir,</b> and 88 % with twice-daily cefuroxime. The corresponding values for microbiologic eradication rate by patient were 90 % (once-daily <b>cefdinir),</b> 85 % (twice-daily <b>cefdinir),</b> and 86 % (twice-daily cefuroxime).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop <b>cefdinir</b> solid dispersions (CSDs) {{prepared}} using hydrophilic polymers with enhanced dissolution/solubility and in vivo oral bioavailability. CSDs were prepared with hydrophilic polymers such as hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC; CSD 1), carboxymethylcellulose-Na (CMC-Na; CSD 2), polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 30 (PVP K 30; CSD 3) at the weight ratio of 1 : 1 (drug:polymer) using a spray-drying method. The prepared CSDs were characterized by aqueous solubility, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), aqueous viscosity, and dissolution test in various media. The oral bioavailability of CSDs was also evaluated in rats and compared with <b>cefdinir</b> powder suspension. The <b>cefdinir</b> in CSDs was amorphous form, as confirmed in the DSC and p-XRD measurements. The developed CSDs commonly resulted in about 9. 0 -fold higher solubility of <b>cefdinir</b> and a significantly improved dissolution profile in water and at pH 1. 2, compared with <b>cefdinir</b> crystalline powder. Importantly, the in vivo oral absorption (represented as AUCinf) was markedly increased by 4. 30 -, 6. 77 - and 3. 01 -fold for CSD 1, CSD 2, and CSD 3, respectively, compared with <b>cefdinir</b> suspension in rats.

Cefaclor was used as internal standard. The developed method was selective and linear for <b>cefdinir</b> concentrations ranging from 0. 05 to 5 µg/ml for serum samples. The lower limit of quantification was defined as the lowest concentration on the calibration curve (0. 05 µg/ml) for which an acceptable accuracy of 111. 60 % and a precision of 7. 65 % were obtained, while the minimum detectable quantity of <b>cefdinir</b> was found to be 0. 02 µg/ml.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop {{nonionic}} surfactant based vesicles (niosomes) to improve poor and variable oral bioavailability of <b>cefdinir.</b> Materials and Methods: <b>Cefdinir</b> niosomes were formulated by sonication method using varying concentration of surfactant (span 60), with and without soya lecithin, but the cholesterol ratio was kept constant in all the formulations. The influence of formulation variables such as surfactant concentration, soya lecithin presence or absence were optimized for size and entrapment efficiency. Drug excipient interaction studies were performed using FTIR, indicating compatibility of excipients with drug. Results: The highest entrapment efficiency (74. 56 %) was observed when span 60, <b>cefdinir,</b> cholesterol and soya lecithin were used in the ratio of 5 : 1 : 1 : 1. The zeta sizer of the niosomal formulations showed the size range between 190 nm- 1140 nm.

By the time of the long-term follow-up visit, 2 to 3 weeks after completion of treatment, 156 of 191 (81. 7 %) of the assessable <b>cefdinir</b> patients and 152 of 195 (77. 9 %) of the penicillin patients remained free of GABHS. Both treatments were well tolerated, with adverse reaction rates of 18. 3 % in the <b>cefdinir</b> study arm and 15. 0 % in the penicillin study arm (P = 0. 278). Five-day treatment with <b>cefdinir</b> is safe and effective therapy for GABHS pharyngitis. Based on its twice-a-day dosage and shorter course of therapy, leading to potentially greater patient compliance, <b>cefdinir</b> may be considered for use in the treatment of pharyngitis caused by GABHS...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefdinir</b> {{were investigated}} in six hemodialysis patients. For the present study, two tests were carried out, one with 4 h of hemodialysis {{and the other}} without hemodialysis. <b>Cefdinir</b> was given orally to each patient in a dose of 100 mg, and blood was collected serially for 48 h after dosing in the test without dialysis and for 72 h in the test with dialysis. In the test without dialysis, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 2. 36 ± 0. 53 μg/ml (mean ± standard deviation) and the time to Cmax was 9. 00 ± 2. 45 h. The terminal elimination half-life (t 1 / 2) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were 16. 95 ± 1. 20 h and 69. 05 ± 14. 84 μg · h/ml, respectively. In the test with dialysis, t 1 / 2 during hemodialysis decreased approximately to one-sixth of that obtained in the test without dialysis, although t 1 / 2 in the latter elimination phase {{did not differ from}} that in the nondialysis test. AUC was reduced to 43 % of that in the test without dialysis. The fractional removal of <b>cefdinir</b> by hemodialysis was 61 %. These findings indicate that clearance of <b>cefdinir</b> is prolonged in patients with renal failure, and <b>cefdinir</b> is well removed by introduction of hemodialysis, although t 1 / 2 (during hemodialysis) and AUC were two and eight times higher than the data previously reported for healthy volunteers, respectively. The pharmacokinetic data suggest that 100 mg of oral <b>cefdinir</b> once a day would result in a sufficient concentration in plasma in hemodialysis patients, but this remains to be confirmed by multiple-dose studies...|$|E
40|$|Two {{simple and}} precise reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic {{methods have been}} developed for the determination of Cefditoren Pivoxil and <b>Cefdinir</b> in pharmaceutical dosage forms. These methods are carried out in an isocratic mode using Kromosil C 18 column (250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 µ) with a mobile phase comprised of methanol and 0. 025 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (75 : 25 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. with effluent detection at 231 nm for Cefditoren Pivoxil and a mobile phase comprised of acetonitrile and 0. 01 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (70 : 30 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. with effluent detection at 285 nm for <b>Cefdinir.</b> The retention times were found to be 2. 75 min. for Cefditoren Pivoxil and 2. 97 min. for <b>Cefdinir.</b> Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 40 - 120 µg/ml for Cefditoren Pivoxil and 20 - 100 µg/ml for <b>Cefdinir.</b> These methods are accurate, precise and found to be suitable for the quantitative analysis of these drugs in pharmaceutical dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to enhance {{solubility}} and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drug. Several techniques such as micronisation, cyclodextrin-complexation, use of surfactants, solubilizers and super disintegrants, solid dispersion in water soluble and water dispersible carriers, microemulsions and self emulsifying micro and nano disperse systems have been used to enhance the solubility and dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. Among the various approaches solid dispersion technique is most widely used. <b>Cefdinir</b> is a drug of choice for solubility and dissolution enhancement. Solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation method and melt fusion method using polyethylene glycol 3350 and PVP-K 30 as hydrophilic carriers. The prepared solid dispersions were evaluated in terms of drug content, % yield and in-vitro dissolution study. In-vitro release profiles of all dispersions were comparitively evaluated and also studied against pure <b>cefdinir.</b> The results obtained showed that the rate of dissolution of <b>cefdinir</b> was considerably improved when formulated in solid dispersions as compare to pure drug.

40|$|Background: Uncomplicated {{skin and}} skin {{structure}} infections (uSSSI) are commonly encountered community-acquired infections and are typically {{confined to the}} superficial layers of the skin. Hence, they seldom lead {{to the destruction of}} skin structures. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren pivoxil in uSSSI in Indian patients. Methods: One hundred and seventy-eight patients diagnosed with uncomplicated SSSI were enrolled in this randomized, comparative, multicentric study. Patients received either cefditoren pivoxil or <b>cefdinir</b> for ten days. Efficacy was assessed both clinically and microbiologically. Safety evaluation consisted of reporting of type, frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients completed the study. Clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil was comparable to that of <b>cefdinir</b> in the treatment of uSSSI. One hundred and five patients were eligible for per protocol (PP) analysis of bacteriological outcome and clinical efficacy. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 98. 00 &#x 0025; patients treated with cefditoren pivoxil and 98. 18 &#x 0025; patients treated with <b>cefdinir.</b> In the modified Intent to Treat (mITT) patient population, clinical cure or improvement was recorded in 97. 33 &#x 0025; patients treated with cefditoren pivoxil and 96. 20 &#x 0025; patients treated with <b>cefdinir.</b> Microbiological eradication (or presumed eradication) was recorded in 88. 00 &#x 0025; patients treated with cefditoren pivoxil and 94. 55 &#x 0025; patients treated with <b>cefdinir.</b> The above differences in the outcome rates between the two drugs were not statistically significant. Six adverse events (AEs) (two in cefditoren group and four in <b>cefdinir</b> group) were reported in this study. Conclusion: Cefditoren pivoxil 200 mg b. i. d. was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of uSSSI...|$|E
