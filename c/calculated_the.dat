5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T.

5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who <b>calculated</b> <b>the</b> length of a degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He <b>calculated</b> <b>the</b> photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E

The cross section can then be <b>calculated,</b> using <b>the</b> diffraction coefficients, with the physical theory of diffraction or other high frequency method, combined with physical optics to include the contributions from illuminated smooth surfaces and Fock calculations to calculate creeping waves circling around any smooth shadowed parts.|$|R
