That episode is one that is going to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> quite a little trouble in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".|$|E
500|$|On December 29, the United Nations General Assembly voted, 75–20 with 40 abstentions, {{to condemn}} the {{invasion}} as a [...] "flagrant violation of international law". The invasion was followed by widespread looting, as the Panamanian police stood by; Kempe reported that the looters caused half a billion U.S. dollars in damages, which the U.S. government later helped repair. Overall, the invasion would <b>cause</b> <b>U.S.</b> $1.5 billion in property damage. According to a CBS poll, 92% of Panamanian adults supported the U.S. incursion, and 76% wished that U.S. forces had invaded in October during the coup. Activist Barbara Trent disputed this finding, saying in a 1992 Academy Award-winning documentary The Panama Deception that the Panamanian surveys were completed in wealthy, English-speaking neighborhoods in Panama City, among Panamanians most likely to support U.S. actions.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{timetable}} set by the RCAF, Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan. Normally a small number of prototypes of an aircraft were hand built and flown to find problems, and when solutions were found these changes would be worked into the design and then the production line would be set up. In a Cook-Craigie system, the production line was set up first and a small number of aircraft were built as production models. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach, however: [...] "...it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> a lot of problems in Engineering. However, it did achieve its objective." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Teller's reassurances, Kennedy himself [...] "hated {{the idea}} of reopening the race" [...] and was uneasy with {{continued}} production of fallout, a negative consequence of resumed testing that its opponents within the administration stressed. Opponents of the tests also argued that renewed atmospheric tests would come at a significant moral cost to the US, given broad public opposition to the plan, and claimed that further tests were largely unnecessary, with the US already having an adequate nuclear arsenal. Arthur Dean believed that public opposition to atmospheric testing {{was so great that}} the US would have to halt such tests within four years even without an agreement. John Kenneth Galbraith, then the ambassador to India, had advised Kennedy in June 1961 that resumed testing [...] "would <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> the gravest difficulties in Asia, Africa and elsewhere." [...] Similarly, Hubert Humphrey described the moratorium as [...] "a ray of hope to millions of worried people." [...] Its termination, Humphrey warned, [...] "might very well turn the political tides in the world in behalf of the Soviets." ...|$|E
500|$|Professor Steven B. Lichtman of the {{department}} {{of political science at the}} University of Vermont reviewed the book for the Law and Politics Book Review, and identified Nelson's pluralist theory as a significant contribution. Lichtman commented, [...] "The most important contribution of Beyond the First Amendment is its attempt to offer up a new model for understanding and safeguarding free speech". He praised the author for supporting his model with case history: [...] "As a purely philosophical matter, Nelson’s pluralist framework is certainly intriguing. The model must be more than a mere talking point, though, and Nelson wisely endeavors to show how the pluralist framework can be deployed as a means of resolving actual cases". Lichtman concluded by recommending the work for academic scholars: [...] "Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech. While it is likely beyond the grasp of all but the most talented undergraduates, its overview of First Amendment theory is an excellent resource for graduate students beginning to explore the field. For scholars, it is a challenging and provocative work sure to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> to reassess how we teach and write about the subject".|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E

This included Rangers fans attacking a pub {{that had been}} bombed by the IRA three years prior, which drew particular criticism from the Orange Order in newspapers. The Orange Order stated [...] "How many of us saw the cruel irony in {{the fate of the}} Tavern on the Town public house – the one bombed three years ago by the IRA – smashed and devastated by the crazed minds who sang Orange songs. Let us be perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers {{are one and the same}} with the foul-mouthed drunks who <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' our annual rallies". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that [...] "no religious barriers will be put up at this club regarding signing of players" [...] and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this, no Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it.|$|E
500|$|I ... {{appeal to}} the House to {{consider}} well our interests in the Western Ocean, on our western coast, and the trade to China and India; and {{the ease with which}} it can be brought down the Missouri. What is this commerce? Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and at last to Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking, to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, if not to govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E

Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a [...] "coin toss" [...] away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were [...] "substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so." [...] He recalled {{that at the time of}} the interview he thought to himself, [...] "there's no way this guy will color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three", compared to Biden, who could [...] "reach higher heights but could <b>cause</b> <b>us</b> real pain." [...] As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe [...] "it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility."
