5|$|In <b>coherence</b> {{scanning}} interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the <b>coherence</b> {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of <b>coherence</b> scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the <b>coherence</b> length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Specific {{types of}} atomic <b>coherences</b> between Zeeman sublevels can be {{generated}} and detected using a method based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with frequency modulated light. Linearly polarized, frequency modulated light is employed to selectively generate ground-state <b>coherences</b> between Zeeman sublevels for which Δ m= 2 and Δ m= 4 in ^ 85 Rb and ^ 87 Rb atoms, and additionally Δ m= 6 in ^ 85 Rb. The atomic <b>coherences</b> are detected with a separate, unmodulated probe light beam. Separation of the pump and probe beams enables independent investigation of the processes of creation and detection of the atomic <b>coherences.</b> With the present technique {{the transfer of the}} Zeeman <b>coherences,</b> including high-order <b>coherences,</b> from excited to ground state by spontaneous emission has been observed.

40|$|Light-harvesting in {{photosynthesis}} {{is determined}} by the excitonic interactions in disordered antennae and the coupling of collective electronic excitations to fast nuclear motions, producing efficient energy transfer with a complicated interplay between exciton and vibrational <b>coherences.</b> Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2 DES) is a powerful tool to study the presence of these <b>coherences</b> in photosynthetic complexes. However, the unambiguous assignment {{of the nature of the}} observed <b>coherences</b> is still under debate. In this paper we apply 2 DES to an excitonically coupled bacteriochlorophyll dimer, the B 820 subunit of the light harvesting complex 1 (LH 1 -RC) of R. rubrum G 9. Fourier analysis of the measured kinetics and modeling of the spectral responses in a complete basis of electronic and vibrational states allow us to distinguish between pure vibrational, mixed exciton-vibrational (vibronic), and predominantly exciton <b>coherences.</b> The mixed <b>coherences</b> have been found in a wide range of oscillation frequencies, whereas exciton <b>coherences</b> give the biggest contributions for the frequencies in the 400 - 550 c...|$|R

25|$|The length {{over which}} the phase in {{a beam of light}} is correlated, is called the <b>coherence</b> length.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of noise-induced quantum <b>coherences</b> {{in a model}} three-level V-type system interacting with incoherent radiation, an important prototype {{for a wide range}} of physical systems ranging from trapped ions to biomolecules and quantum dots. By solving the quantum optical equations of motion for the V-type system, we obtain analytical expressions for the noise-induced <b>coherences</b> and show that they exhibit an oscillating behavior in the limit of large excited level spacing Δ (Δ /γ≫ 1, where γ is the radiative decay rate). Most remarkably, we find that in the opposite limit of small level spacing Δ/γ≪ 1, appropriate for large molecules, (a) the <b>coherences</b> can survive for an arbitrarily long time τ=(2 /γ) (Δ/γ) ^- 2 before eventually decaying to zero, and (b) <b>coherences</b> at short times can be substantial.

40|$|A vibronic-exciton {{model is}} applied to {{investigate}} the mechanism of enhancement of coherent oscillations due to mixing of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom recently proposed as {{the origin of the}} long-lived oscillations in 2 D spectra of the FMO complex [Christensson et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 116 (2012) 7449]. We reduce the problem to a model BChl dimer to elucidate the role of resonance coupling, site energies, nuclear mode and energy disorder in the enhancement of vibronic-exciton and ground-state vibrational <b>coherences,</b> and to identify regimes where this enhancement is significant. For a heterodimer representing the two coupled BChls 3 and 4 of the FMO complex, the initial amplitude of the vibronic-exciton and vibrational <b>coherences</b> are enhanced by up to 15 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the vibrational <b>coherences</b> in the isolated monomer. This maximum initial amplitude enhancement occurs when there is a resonance between the electronic energy gap and the frequency of the vibrational mode. The bandwidth of this enhancement is about 100 cm- 1 for both mechanisms. The excitonic mixing of electronic and vibrational DOF leads to additional dephasing relative to the vibrational <b>coherences.</b> We evaluate the dephasing dynamics by solving the quantum master equation in Markovian approximation and observe a strong dependence of the life-time enhancement on the mode frequency. Long-lived vibronic-exciton <b>coherences</b> are found to be generated only when the frequency of the mode is {{in the vicinity of the}} electronic resonance. Although the vibronic-exciton <b>coherences</b> exhibit a larger initial amplitude compared to the ground-state vibrational <b>coherences,</b> we conclude that both type have a similar magnitude at long time for the present model.

In systems strongly driven by an external optical field, the field frequency generates a phase dependent probe absorption. This gives further control to manipulate the relative contribution to the linear signal due to initial populations and <b>coherences...</b>|$|R

Although the <b>coherence</b> length in the a-b plane is 5 {{times greater than}} that along the c axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where ξ ≈ 40nbsp&nm). This modest <b>coherence</b> length means that the superconducting state is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects {{on the order of}} a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains.

40|$|We formalize the {{derivation}} of {{a generalized}} coarse-graining $n$-resolved master equation by introducing a virtual detector counting {{the number of}} transferred charges in single-electron transport. Our approach enables the convenient inclusion of <b>coherences</b> and Lamb shift in counting statistics. As a Markovian example with Lindblad-type density matrices, we consider the Born-Markov-Secular (BMS) approximation which is a special case of the non-Markovian dynamical coarse graining (DCG) approach.

Four interhemispheric <b>coherences</b> (frontal F 3 F 4, central C 3 C 4, parietal P 3 P 4 and occipital O 1 O 2) were observed within six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3).
