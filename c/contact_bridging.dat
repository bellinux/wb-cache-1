40|$|The authors assert hat an {{adequate}} understanding of religious proselytizing {{requires an understanding}} {{not only of the}} converts but also of organizational attempts to recruit them. Maintaining that the proselytizing of outsiders requires <b>contact,</b> <b>bridging,</b> and assimilation mechanisms, they examine the evangelistic efforts and results of 20 proselyte-minded Canadian churches over a five-year period. They find little evidence in evangelistic programs for the existence of such mechanisms f or reaching outsiders. M oreover,new convert members are f ound to be primarily family members, friends, and people from other churches. They conclude that in spite of the apparent failure to proselytize many outsiders, the organizational mechanisms may continue to persist because of the latent functions they serve. Much of the work in the Sociology of Religion relating to the subject of pro-selytism has focused on the individual convert as the unit ofanalysis. Theories and empirical studies have tried to explain proclivity to religious conversion and affiliation in terms of the nature of converts. Thus Glock (1965) has synthesized a long tradition in positing the forms of personal deprivation which serve as sources of religious involvement. 1 Lofland and Stark (1965) have proposed a process theory of conversion which focuses upon the convert and the stages through which he passes on the road to conversion. Similarly, a number of empirical studies have examined the convert and his characteristics (Beynon, 1938; Hoh...|$|E
40|$|Adolescents in migrant {{families}} often {{grow up in}} {{an environment}} with paradoxical demands. In the case of Belgian Turks, adolescents are socialized in quite different socialization systems. On the one hand, the Turkish community expects them to conform to collectivistic norms and values; the larger society on the other hand, demands 'integration', which basically means they have to adapt to individualistic norms and values. The proposed study {{is part of an}} ongoing research effort to shed light on the way in which second and third generation Belgian Turks negotiate these possibly paradoxical demands and on how living in these two ‘worlds’ is reflected in norms and values. In the here proposed study, we focus on how the composition and characteristics of the social network of adolescents plays a role in the process of transmission of values. We hereby try to find out how (1) social control within the community and (2) both 'bonding' and 'bridging' capital influence both the process of transmission of values, and what norms and values are finally internalized. We focus on social control and social capital, because – based on the social capital theory and field experience – we expect tight social networks {{to be a source of}} rigidity, because the tight structure of the network enables parents to control what their children do. Considering the fact that the Turkish community strongly emphasizes a Turkish modus vivendi, we expect adolescents that grow up in a tight community to come less into contact with native Belgians and hence individualistic norms and values. This qualitative research project can theoretically be situated on the intersection of sociology and social psychology; methodologically we position ourselves on the intersection of anthropology and sociology. The research can be characterized by a strong emphasis on epistemology and multi-method research. Preliminary insights are gathered during participant observation and informal interviews with key informants. Based on these insights, we obtained a purposive sample of 30 respondents who were interviewed alone or together with a sibling.

40|$|A {{bridging}} fault simulator of CMOS VLSI circuits with {{timing information}} is described. It can detect delay {{as well as}} logic faults. A realistic resistive two-line bridging fault model is used.

Simulation results of some of the ISCAS 89 sequential benchmark circuits are given. 1 Introduction Bridging faults in VLSI circuits are caused by unintended connections between two (or more) normally unconnected signal lines.

Direct mechanical dissipation is limited to that associated with defects in the system. This includes interaction with pinned vortices, critical flow at surface defect sites, and unintentional acoustic coupling. Dissipation of this latter type is possible in the parallel plate geometry of capacitively detected third sound. We calculate the coupling of a third sound wave across a <b>contacting</b> <b>bridge</b> to a parallel plane, and investigate the energy transfer out of the wave and flow properties of the film {{in the vicinity of the}} contact.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of fluid flow and dissolved species transport in the subsurface is a challenging task, given variability and measurement {{uncertainty in the}} physical properties of the rock, the complexities of multi-fluid interaction, and limited computational resources. Nonetheless, this thesis seeks to expand our modeling capabilities {{in the context of}} contaminant hydrogeology. We describe the numerical simulator CompFlow Bio and use it to model invasion of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminant through the vadose zone and below the water table in a fractured porous rock. CompFlow Bio is a three-phase, multicomponent, deterministic numerical model for fluid flow and dissolved species transport; it includes capillary pressure and equilibrium partitioning relationships. We have augmented the model to include randomly generated, axis-aligned, discrete fracture networks (DFNs). The DFN is coupled with the porous medium (PM) to form a single continuum. The domain is discretized using a finite-volume scheme in an unstructured mesh of rectilinear control volumes (CVs). Herein we present the governing equations, unstructured mesh creation scheme, algebraic development of fracture intersection CV elimination, and coupling of PM CVs over a fracture plane to permit asperity <b>contact</b> <b>bridged</b> flow. We include: small scale two-phase water-air and NAPL-water simulations to validate the practice of intersection CV elimination; small scale simulations with water-air, NAPL-water, and NAPL-water-air systems in a grid refinement exercise and to demonstrate the effect of asperity <b>contact</b> <b>bridged</b> flow; intermediate scale 3 D simulations of NAPL invading the saturated zone, based on the Smithville, Ontario, site; intermediate scale 2 D and 3 D simulations of NAPL invading the vadose zone and saturated zone with transient recharge, based on the Santa Susana Field Laboratory site, California. Our findings indicate that: the formulation provides a practical and satisfactory way of modeling three-phase flow in discretely fractured porous rock; numerical error caused by spatial discretization manifests itself as several biases in physical flow processes; that asperity contact is important in establishing target water saturation conditions in the vadose zone; and simulation results are sensitive to relative permeability-saturation-capillary pressure relationships.

40|$|The {{importance}} of allosteric proteasome inhibition {{in the treatment}} of cancer is becoming increasingly evident. Motivated by this urgent therapeutic need, we have recently identified cationic porphyrins as a highly versatile class of molecules able to regulate proteasome activity by interfering with gating mechanisms. In the present study, the mapping of electrostatic <b>contacts</b> <b>bridging</b> the regulatory particles with the α-rings of the human 20 S proteasome led us to the identification of (meso-tetrakis(4 -N-methylphenyl pyridyl) -porphyrin (pTMPyPP 4) as a novel non-competitive inhibitor of human 20 S proteasome. pTMPyPP 4 inhibition mechanism implies a positive cooperative binding to proteasome, which disappears when a permanently open proteasome mutant (α- 3 ΔN) is used, supporting the hypothesis that the events associated with allosteric proteasome inhibition by pTMPyPP 4 interfere with 20 S gating and affect its "open-closed" equilibrium. Therefore, we propose that the spatial distribution of the negatively charged residues responsible for the interaction with regulatory particles at the α-ring surface of human 20 S may be exploited as a blueprint for the design of allosteric proteasome regulator...|$|R

40|$|Stress-controlled {{swelling}} {{tests are}} normally {{conducted in the}} laboratory to characterize the evolution of coal permeability {{under the influence of}} gas sorption. Typically reductions in permeability are observed from gas-sorption-induced swelling even where effective stresses remain constant. This behavior remains enigmatic as the permeability of the porous coal is determined by the effective stress only. When these observations were interpreted, a matchstick or cubic coal model was assumed. Under this assumption, matrix swelling would not affect coal permeability because of the complete separation between matrix blocks caused by through-going fractures. This is why current coal permeability models have little success in explaining this inconsistency. It is generally believed that the reason for the failure is the inconsistency between the experimental conditions and the model assumptions. However, in this paper, it is considered that the reason may be the internal actions between coal fractures and matrixes have not been taken into consideration. In this study, a model capable of replicating this apparently anomalous behavior is developed. We consider the interactions of the fractured coal mass where cleats do not create a full separation between adjacent matrix blocks but where solid rock bridges are present. We accommodate the role of swelling strains both over <b>contact</b> <b>bridges</b> that hold cleat faces apart but also over the non-contacting span between these bridges. The effects of swelling act competitively over these two components: increasing porosity and permeability due to swelling of the <b>bridging</b> <b>contacts</b> but reducing porosity and permeability due to the swelling of the intervening free-faces. Under these conditions, a new permeability model is formulated. The new model is the key cross link that couples the multiphysics of coal-gas interactions. The formulation and incorporation of this permeability model into the multiphysics simulation of coal-gas interactions are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Numerical (finite difference) and {{analytical}} {{models have been}} developed for the simulation of heat flow through plasma-sprayed coatings, allowing the effective thermal conductivity to be predicted as a function of microstructural parameters. The structure is assumed to be composed of lamellar material (splats), separated by (thin) pores, within which there are areas of <b>contact</b> (<b>bridges).</b> The analytical model is based on dividing the material into two regimes, within which the heat flow occurs either by unidirectional serial flow through lamellae and pores or by being funneled through the regions of the lamellae above and below the bridges. The validity of this model is demonstrated by a comparison of the predictions obtained from it and those obtained from the numerical model. The effects of pore geometry on conductive and radiative heat transfer within the coating have been investigated over a range of temperatures and gas pressures. It is shown that the main factor controlling the conductivity is the intersplat bridge area. Comparisons are also presented with experimental conductivity data, for cases in which some attempt has been made to characterize the key microstructural features.

While the structural characteristics of the developing and adult zebrafish ventricle have been previously studied, {{little attention has been}} paid to the nature of the interface between the compact and spongy myocardium. Here we describe how these two distinct layers are structurally and functionally integrated. We demonstrate by transmission electron microscopy that this interface is complex and composed primarily of a junctional region occupied by collagen, as well as a population of fibroblasts that form a highly complex network. We also describe a continuum of uniquely flattened transitional cardiac myocytes that form a circumferential plate upon which the radially-oriented luminal trabeculae are anchored. In addition, we have uncovered within the transitional ring a subpopulation of markedly electron dense cardiac myocytes. At discrete intervals the transitional cardiac myocytes form <b>contact</b> <b>bridges</b> across the junctional space that are stabilized through localized desmosomes and fascia adherentes junctions with adjacent compact cardiac myocytes. Finally using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, segmentation and volume reconstruction, we confirm the three-dimensional nature of the junctional region as well as the presence of the sheet-like fibroblast network. These ultrastructural studies demonstrate the previously unrecognized complexity with which the compact and spongy layers are structurally integrated, and provide a new basis for understanding development and regeneration in the zebrafish heart. © 2013 Lafontant et al...|$|R

A particular challenge stems from the realization that the properties of molecular wires are strongly influenced by the combined characteristics of the molecule and the metal contacts. While gold has been the most studied contact material to date, interest in molecular wires with transition metal contacts that ar e electronically more complex than gold is growing. This thesis presents a theoretical investigation of electron transport and associated phenomena in molecular wires with transition metal contacts. An appropriate methodology is developed on the basis of Landauer theory and ab initio and semi-empirical considerations and new, physically important systems are identified.
