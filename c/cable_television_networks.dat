Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>networks</b> C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E

25|$|In the 1982–83 season, CBS {{significantly}} {{reduced the number}} of regular season broadcasts from 18 to four. The rationale was that <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>networks</b> (namely, the USA Network and ESPN) were carrying a large number of regular season games (at least 40 each). In return, CBS executives believed that the public was being oversaturated with NBA coverage.|$|E

These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did. By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals.|$|E

25|$|After {{years of}} serious {{decline in the}} 1980s, many Hollywood {{landmarks}} were threatened with demolition. Columbia Square, at {{the northwest corner of}} Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, is part of the ongoing rebirth of Hollywood. The Art Deco-style studio complex completed in 1938, which was once the Hollywood headquarters for CBS, became home to a new generation of broadcasters when <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>networks</b> MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Spike TV consolidated their offices here in 2014 as part of a $420-million office, residential and retail complex. Since 2000, Hollywood has been increasingly gentrified due to revitalization by private enterprise and public planners.|$|E

In 1993, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the Scooby-Doo franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1997, with the other Scooby series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, Scooby-Doo became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.|$|E

25|$|KTVU officially joined Fox {{seven months}} later on October 9, 1986, when the fledgling network inaugurated {{programming}} with the debut of the late night talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Similar to other Fox stations during the network's early years, KTVU was programmed as a de facto independent station, even after Fox expanded its programming into prime time on weekend evenings in April 1987. Until Fox completed the expansion of its prime time schedule (which began with the launch of a Saturday night lineup in July 1987, and was gradually rolled out to additional nights {{over the next seven}} years) and began offering programming on a nightly basis in September 1993, KTVU continued to air a movie at 8:00p.m. on nights when the network did not offer any programming. However, the station also decreased its reliance on movies during this period, due to the growing difficulty of broadcast stations in acquiring film content as the number of <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>networks</b> increased. The strong ratings that KTVU had as an independent station carried over into its tenure with Fox, turning it into one of the network's strongest affiliates; despite having its programming occasionally being pre-empted by San Francisco Giants game telecasts, Fox was very satisfied with KTVU because of its ratings performance.|$|E

500|$|Jennifer Salke, the {{president}} of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after the cancellation of Lone Star. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. Korman was so impressed by the script that, though it was after midnight, he went into the room where his sick wife was sleeping, and got into bed with her. Korman phoned Salke, and stated that the script was [...] "remarkable", and praised Killen claiming that [...] "for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life", he is [...] "making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it successfully made its way into the lower executive branches of the company, the script was declined by entertainment president Kevin Reilly, who felt apprehensive upon reading it. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>networks.</b> Newman believed that it should be a network show, and did not accept that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E

Fox, the fourth [...] "major network," [...] carried a short lived daytime soap Tribes in 1990.
