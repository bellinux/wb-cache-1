Following this opposition campaign, BSA stated that its letter expressed support for <b>cyber</b> <b>threat</b> sharing legislation in general, but did not endorse CISA, or any pending <b>cyber</b> <b>threat</b> sharing bill in particular. BSA later stated that it is opposed to CISA in its current form.

Variety and {{complexity}} of <b>cyber</b> <b>threats</b> are increasing in parallel with technological advancements in computer technologies. Therefore, it is getting harder to detect and ght <b>cyber</b> <b>threats.</b> Sharing of threat intelligence {{is a good way}} to grow immunity against various and complex threats, since it enables sharing parties to learn from others' experiences and knowledge, thereby to become alert to potential threats. XML-based standards TAXII, STIX and CybOX, of which development is led by MITRE, allow us to describe <b>cyber</b> <b>threats</b> in an extensive and standardized manner and to share them e ectively. The aim of this thesis is to convert STIX/CybOX formatted threat intelligence data to Suricata rules which can be readily implemented on Suricata IDS/IPS. To create rules for a Suricata engine based on latest threat information on a regular basis, will enable it to get familiar with emerging threats.
