40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid damages and {{excessive}} materials consumption, during the production of glass containers {{it is important to}} keep limits for the glass wall thickness. Current methods do not offer satisfying solutions regarding contactless and fast measurements, as well as integration over sufficiently large areas. A new approach is the measurement by using microwave reflections. These reflections depend on glass thickness, frequency and on the distance between the sample and the sensor (liftoff). For the measurement of glass thickness the parasitic influence of the liftoff has to be eliminated. This paper describes a solution developed for this problem. Under certain circumstances, measurements of the <b>complex</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> at constant frequency show a nearly orthogonal behaviour between lines of constant liftoff and lines of constant glass wall thickness. Therefore those two influences can be differentiated. After calibration with samples of known thicknesses, the thickness of an unknown sample can be determined by measuring its <b>complex</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The solution was confirmed regarding reproducibility and accuracy of the results for flat glass plates. Present investigations are aimed at the extension of this method to curved glass walls...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [70]- 72) A critical {{requirement in}} the design of circuits using quartz plate resonators is the electrical characterization of the resonator. An equivalent electrical network has long been known that describes the electrical characteristics of quartz plate resonators around the frequency of resonance. A number of techniques have historically been used to measure these equivalent electrical parameters. Reduction of the resulting data eventually leads to values for the circuit elements. The introduction of modem automatic vector network analyzers as a measurement tool has afforded the opportunity to simultaneously measure and visually evaluate the resonator responses to enable a “real-time” analysis of the response. The resulting magnitude and phase information represent the <b>complex</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{in the case of the}} single-port measurement. The measured complex reflection coefficients are mathematically transformed through a series of operations into the equivalent network parameters. A technique has been developed that allows the measured <b>complex</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> information to be transformed into the equivalent network values in a more direct fashion. The parameters are independently derived from the error-corrected information, resulting in potentially more accurate equivalent electrical network elemental values. An approach to the visualization of resonator response through the Smith chart presentation is also presented. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
