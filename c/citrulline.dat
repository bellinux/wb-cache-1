5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and <b>citrulline</b> occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{arginine}} from <b>citrulline</b> also {{occurs at}} a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible NOS (iNOS). This allows <b>citrulline,</b> a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, NO synthesis can be supported to some extent by <b>citrulline,</b> and not just by by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because <b>citrulline</b> accumulates in NO-producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO breakdown.|$|E
25|$|On a whole-body basis, {{synthesis}} of arginine occurs principally via the intestinal–renal axis: the epithelial {{cells of the}} small intestine produce <b>citrulline,</b> primarily from glutamine and glutamate, which is carried in the bloodstream to the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract <b>citrulline</b> from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis, increasing the dietary requirement.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased <b>citrulline</b> and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low <b>citrulline</b> and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Arginine is {{synthesized}} from <b>citrulline</b> in arginine and proline metabolism by the sequential {{action of}} the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase {{deficiency}} {{also known}} as OTC deficiency {{is the most common}} urea cycle disorder in humans. Ornithine transcarbamylase, the defective enzyme in this disorder is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, responsible for converting carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into <b>citrulline.</b> OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{arginine}} {{is classified}} as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people {{do not need to}} supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via <b>citrulline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arginine {{is also a}} {{precursor}} for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; {{is necessary for the}} synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine), <b>citrulline,</b> and glutamate. The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.|$|E
25|$|OTC {{deficiency}} {{is caused}} by mutations in the OTC gene, which {{is located on the}} X chromosome. OTC codes for the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, which is expressed only in liver. The functional enzyme consists of three identical subunits. OTC is the last enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, which consists of the reactions that take place in the mitochondria. The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase are ornithine and carbamyl phosphate, while the product is <b>citrulline.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Arginine {{residues}} in proteins can be deiminated by PAD enzymes to form <b>citrulline,</b> in a {{post-translational modification}} process called citrullination.This {{is important in}} fetal development, {{is part of the}} normal immune process, as well as the control of gene expression, but is also significant in autoimmune diseases.:275 Another post-translational modification of arginine involves methylation by protein methyltransferases.:176 ...|$|E
2500|$|Urea is {{synthesized}} in {{the body}} of many organisms as part of the urea cycle, either from the oxidation of amino acids or from ammonia. [...] In this cycle, amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea, while L-ornithine, <b>citrulline,</b> L-argininosuccinate, and L-arginine act as intermediates. [...] Urea production occurs in the liver and is regulated by N-acetylglutamate. [...] Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the reference range of 2.5 to 6.7mmol/liter) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as a component of urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in sweat.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{presence}} of ethyl carbamate is not a sensory wine fault, the compound is a suspected carcinogen which is subjected to regulation in many countries. The compound is produced from the degradation of the amino acid arginine which is present in both grape must and released in the wine through the autolysis of dead yeast cells. While the use of urea {{as a source of}} yeast assimilable nitrogen (no longer legal in most countries) was {{the most common cause of}} ethyl carbamate in wine, both O. oeni and L. buchneri have been known to produce carbamyl phosphate and <b>citrulline</b> which can be precursors to ethyl carbamate formation. L. hilgardii, one of the [...] "ferocious Lactobacillus" [...] species, has also been suspected of contributing to ethyl carbamate production. In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has established a voluntary target limit of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15µg/l for table wines and less than 60µg/l for dessert wines.|$|E
50|$|Several {{proteins}} contain <b>citrulline</b> as {{a result}} of a posttranslational modification. These <b>citrulline</b> residues are generated by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which convert arginine into <b>citrulline</b> in a process called citrullination or deimination. Proteins that normally contain <b>citrulline</b> residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Synthesis of {{arginine}} from <b>citrulline</b> also {{occurs at}} a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that also induce iNOS. Thus, <b>citrulline,</b> a coproduct of the NOS-catalyzed reaction, can be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, <b>citrulline</b> can substitute for arginine to some degree in supporting NO synthesis. However, recycling is not quantitative because <b>citrulline</b> accumulates along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO, in NO-producing cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citrulline</b> is {{made from}} {{ornithine}} and carbamoyl phosphate by ornithine carbamoyltransferase. Arginine is then synthesized from <b>citrulline</b> in the urea cycle by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL).|$|E
50|$|Citrullination or deimination is the {{conversion}} of the amino acid arginine in a protein into the amino acid <b>citrulline.</b> <b>Citrulline</b> {{is not one of the}} 20 standard amino acids encoded by DNA in the genetic code. Instead, it is the result of a post-translational modification. Citrullination is distinct from the formation of the free amino acid <b>citrulline</b> as part of the urea cycle or as a byproduct of enzymes of the nitric oxide synthase family.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} step of the catalyzed reaction, <b>citrulline</b> attacks the α-phosphate of ATP to form <b>citrulline</b> adenylate, a {{reactive}} intermediate. The attachment of AMP to the ureido (urea-like) group on <b>citrulline</b> activates the carbonyl center for subsequent nucleophilic attack. This activation facilitates the second step, in which the α-amino group of aspartate attacks the ureido group. Attack by aspartate is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This step produces free AMP and L-argininosuccinate.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-citrulline N5-carbamoyldihydrolase. Other names in common use include <b>citrulline</b> ureidase, <b>citrulline</b> hydrolase, and L-citrulline 5-N-carbamoyldihydrolase.|$|E
50|$|Thermodynamically, adenylation of the <b>citrulline</b> ureido {{group is}} more {{favorable}} than the analogous phosphorylation. Additionally, attack by <b>citrulline</b> at the α-phosphate of ATP produces {{an equivalent of}} pyrophosphate, which can be hydrolyzed in a thermodynamically favorable reaction to provide additional energy to drive the adenylation.|$|E
