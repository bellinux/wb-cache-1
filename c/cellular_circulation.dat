40|$|International audienceMantle {{convection}} in the Earth and Mars {{are dominated}} by large-scale flow, and this can be due {{at least in part}} to the effect of thermally insulating continent-like heterogeneities. Indeed, the presence of a finitely conducting lid on top of a convective isoviscous fluid at infinite Prandtl number induces the formation of a zone of hot upwelling centered beneath the lid and a large horizontal <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> {{on each side of the}} lid. In a previous paper, this lateral <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> was limited in size by the dimensions of the model. We now use very large aspect ratio models in order for this circulation to be unhampered. The large-scale circulation consists of the constructive superposition of hot and cold plumes attracted to and expelled from, respectively, the conductive lid. The width of the <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> increases with the Rayleigh number of the fluid, and we propose a scaling law to explain this expansion. Scaling laws for the velocity of the plumes and heat transfer by this large-scale circulation are also developed. Although the model used is much simpler than actual planetary mantles, the driving mechanism for the large-scale circulation must operate in a similar fashion. Important implications in terms of heat transfer can therefore be predicted...|$|E
40|$|Thiopurine {{drugs such}} as 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP) and 6 -thioguanine (6 -TG) are used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood. To test the {{hypothesis}} that variation in the expression of genes within the “thiopurine pathway” might influence 6 -MP and 6 -TG sensitivity, we generated basal gene expression profiles and IC 50 values for both of these thiopurine drugs using a model system consisting of 194 Human Variation Panel lymphoblastoid cell lines. Association analysis showed that thiopurine S-methyltransferase, ecto- 5 ′-nucleotidase (NT 5 E), and multidrug resistance protein 4 (ABCC 4) expression were correlated with thiopurine cytotoxicity. Those observations suggested the possible existence of a “thiopurine cellular circulation” involving nucleotide efflux by ABCC 4, hydrolysis of thiopurine nucleotide monophosphates outside of the cell by NT 5 E, and subsequent transport of thiopurine nucleosides back into the cell by nucleoside transporters. The existence of this <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> was confirmed {{by a series of}} functional experiments performed with cultured cells stably or transiently transfected with ABCC 4 and/or NT 5 E. Because of the central role of NT 5 E in this <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation,</b> the NT 5 E gene was resequenced using 287 DNA samples from three ethnic groups, with the identification of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 46 of which were novel.

40|$|A typical {{feature of}} the {{atmospheric}} circulation at middle and high latitudes {{is a tendency to}} fluctuate between two rather extreme circulation patterns. This behaviour of the atmosphere is most common at the Northern Hemisphere during the winter and has been known among the meteorologists for a considerable time (e. g. Garriott (1904)). One of these two states is identified by a predominantly zonal circulation or a so-called high-index circulation, the other state by a meridional or a low-index circulation. The meridional circulation is often broken up in a characteristic atmospheric pattern of cut-off lows and highs. These features usually have a time scale of several days during which they affect the weather in a very dominating way.

The results demonstrate the importance of turbulent entrainment and shear {{at the edges of}} the skirt in reducing the concentration of therapeutant within the cage. The effect of cross currents in establishing <b>cellular</b> <b>circulations</b> within the cage is identified as potentially playing a key role in the entrainment process, with the consequential finding that the rate of retention of therapeutant depends upon not only the current speed beneath the cage but also the aspect ratios of the cage and skirt attachment (h/H) respectively. Entrainment of water into the skirt and subsequent reduction in dye concentration increased by a factor of 2 when h/H = 0. 24, compared against h/H = 1.

The limestones, partly metasomatically altered to ankerite and siderite, occur as lenses in insoluble rocks. Oxygen-enriched meteoric water seeping along the faults caused siderite/ankerite weathering and transformation to ochres that were later removed by mechanical erosion. Corrosion was enhanced by sulphide weathering of gangue minerals and by carbon dioxide released from decomposition of siderite/ankerite.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{issues that}} have arisen in attempting to develop a markedly different approach to teaching biology {{at the middle school}} level. We have embarked on the development of a 7 th grade curriculum titled “Energy and the Human Body ” that deals with pulmonary and <b>cellular</b> respiration, <b>circulation,</b> and digestion (Ramirez, Clement, Nunez, and Else, 2001). One of our goals is to address some of the conflicts teachers feel in responding to the call for both inquiry and conceptual understanding under the new national standards. Teachers often feel pulled in two different directions: on the one hand they are urged to teach content in a deeper way as measured by standardized tests; on the other hand they are urged to adopt student directed inquiry methods. They often feel that open-ended methods are incompatible with strong content goals that they are asked to fulfill. The strategy used in our curriculum takes an intermediate position. The strategy is one of student-teacher co-construction that elicits student generated model elements as well as some that are introduced by the teacher (Rea-Ramirez, 1999; Steinberg & Clement, 2001; Clement & Steinberg, in press).

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out in order to study secondary circulation and flow variability in straight open channel flows over a rough bed. 3 D flow velocities and turbulence characteristics were measured using a micro Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. Two flow conditions were analyzed, with aspect ratios b/h (width over depth) of 8. 5 and 6. 3, respectively. These two cases cannot be classified in principle as narrow (b/h 10) channel flows, but exhibited well defined secondary flows in the whole cross section. Bed shear stresses and turbulence patterns were consistent with the secondary flow <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation.</b> These results contradict the general perception that secondary circulation cells die out at a distance of b > 2. 5 h from the walls. The behavior was attributed to the bed roughness (k(s) /h similar to 0. 1) and to the difference in roughness between bed and walls, the latter being much smoother. The results allowed for quantification of hydrodynamic variability in terms of secondary velocities (5 % of mean flow velocity), cores of high streamwise velocities (10 % higher than surrounding flow) and bed shear stress (20 % oscillation with respect to cross sectional averaged value). All these patterns are consistent with the very few results reported in the literature for similar roughness conditions. These results can be used to assess the background flow conditions existing in a straight channel with a plane bed, before the addition of pools and riffles as part of a restoration strategy for streams that have been channelized and do not present the flow variability needed to enhance habitat conditions...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{physical}} characteristics of surfing breaks are well {{described in the}} literature, there is little specific research on surfing and coastal management. Such research is required because coastal engineering has had significant impacts to surfing breaks, both positive and negative. Strategic planning and environmental impact assessment methods, a central tenet of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), are recommended by this thesis to maximise surfing amenities. The research reported here identifies key oceanographic considerations required for ICZM around surfing breaks including: surfing wave parameters; surfing break components; relationship between surfer skill, surfing manoeuvre type and wave parameters; wind effects on waves; currents; geomorphic surfing break categorisation; beach-state and morphology; and offshore wave transformations. Key coastal activities that can have impacts to surfing breaks are identified. Environmental data types to consider during coastal studies around surfing breaks are presented and geographic information systems (GIS) are used to manage and interpret such information. To monitor surfing breaks, a shallow water multibeam echo sounding system was utilised and a RTK GPS water level correction and hydrographic GIS methodology developed. Including surfing in coastal management requires coastal engineering solutions that incorporate surfing. As an example, {{the efficacy of the}} artificial surfing reef (ASR) at Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, was evaluated. GIS, multibeam echo soundings, oceanographic measurements, photography, and wave modelling were all applied to monitor sea floor morphology around the reef. Results showed that the beach-state has more <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> since the reef was installed, and a groin effect on the offshore bar was caused by the structure within the monitoring period, trapping sediment updrift and eroding sediment downdrift. No identifiable shoreline salient was observed. Landward of the reef, a scour hole ~ 3 times the surface area of the reef has formed. The current literature on ASRs has primarily focused on reef shape and its role in creating surfing waves. However, this study suggests that impacts to the offshore bar, beach-state, scour hole and surf zone hydrodynamics should all be included in future surfing reef designs. More real world reef studies, including ongoing monitoring of existing surfing reefs are required to validate theoretical concepts in the published literature...|$|E

The morphology {{consisted of a}} low-tide terrace with incised quasi-periodic rip channels, representative of transverse bars. Offshore (17 m depth) significant wave height and peak period ranged 0. 20 – 3. 0 m and 5 – 20 s. The mean wave direction was consistently near 08 resulting in rip channel morphology, which evolved {{in response to the}} changing wave characteristics. An inverse relationship between sediment accreting on the transverse bar and eroding in the rip channel was found. The spatial distribution of sediment is reflected in the background rip current flow field. The mean velocity magnitudes within the rip channel (transverse bars) increased offshore (onshore) with decreasing tidal elevations and increased with increasing sea-swell energy. Eulerian averaged flows were predominantly shoreward on the transverse bars and seaward within the rip channel throughout the experiment, resulting in a persistent <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation,</b> except during low wave energy. The rip current spacing to the rip channel width was {{less than or equal to}} two, which suggests that the rip currents are influenced by each other and that no two-dimensional bar return flow should be present. The vertical velocity profile on the bar indicated that the flow was predominantly shoreward. The flow field within the surf zone was depth uniform, except for significant shear occurring near the surface, owing to Stokes drift. The wave-induced transport hypothesis is evaluated.

40|$|International audienceAt the Earth's surface, continents {{and oceans}} impose {{different}} thermal boundary {{conditions at the}} top of the mantle. Laboratory experiments are used to investigate the consequences of this for mantle convection. The upper boundary of the experimental tank was made of copper plates enforcing a fixed temperature and had a conductive lid of finite width in the middle. Beneath this lid, the thermal boundary condition was of the "mixed" type, with a Biot number depending on the dimensions and thermal conductivity of the lid. Experimental values of the Biot number were scaled to Earth values. Experiments were run for a large range of Rayleigh numbers, from 104 to 107, and for several lid widths. The effects of temperature-dependent viscosity and of the shape of the lid were investigated. At steady state, in all cases, there is an upwelling beneath the conductive lid, which feeds two symmetrical and elongated convective cells. Three different dynamic regimes were identified as a function of Rayleigh number, independently of the lid width. At Rayleigh numbers lower than 1. 2 105, the upwelling is steady both in geometry and temperature structure. At Rayleigh numbers between 1. 2 105 and 2 106, this central upwelling is intermittent. At larger values of the Rayleigh number, there is no longer a simple upwelling structure, but a set of small plumes rising together and distorted by a <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> of large horizontal extent. Thus the conductive lid always imposes a large-scale flow pattern. The length of these convective cells is a function of lid width. It is equal to the lid width at large values and decreases to the Rayleigh-Bénard value as the lid width decreases to zero. A fluid loop model explains the most important features of this form of convection. The cell length is such that the upwelling temperature is minimized for a given Rayleigh number and lid width and is an increasing function of lid width and a decreasing function of Rayleigh number. Transient experiments demonstrate that the large-scale flow structure develops rapidly with even small horizontal temperature differences. Implications for the Earth are that large-scale convection cells exist in conditions which, in the absence of continents, would probably lead to a chaotic convection pattern dominated by plumes. At high Rayleigh number, continental breakup is effected by a large-scale line upwelling structure which includes a number of individual plumes...|$|E
40|$|The {{innovative}} {{concept of}} an offshore submerged multi-purpose reef combining a coastal protection function with recreational benefits including improved surfing, diving, or fishing conditions provides an appealing solution {{for the management of}} beaches. However, since the technology is relatively recent, there is still a lack of empirical knowledge about its performance in the field. The present research monitored the effect of the prototype research reef constructed at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand on the local beach morphodynamics and oceanographic conditions, being primarily concerned with implications on the coastal protection function of the technology. The beach morphodynamic response to the reef was investigated from a set of already available high resolution bathymetric surveys imaging the foreshore and surfzone morphology prior to, and throughout reef construction, and a new postconstruction survey collected as a part of this research. The reef implementation was found to disturb the pre-existing beach state functioning including the onshore/offshore migration of the underlying long shore bar, rather than cause a persistent salient response. A possible additional beach width of ~ 20 m, extending ~ 150 m alongshore was identified in the lee of the reef from shoreline analysis, but the pattern was transient throughout the monitoring period since it was superimposed on comparatively large pre-existing fluctuations. In addition, the reef structure provided a control point on the offshore morphology able to trap sediment updrift and erode sediment downdrift. Both field measurements and numerical modelling of waves and currents were used to monitor the effect of the reef on the oceanographic conditions. Wave propagation over the reef without breaking (H less than 0. 5 m) resulted in transmitted heights larger than incident by up to a factor of 2. When the reef triggered breaking, transmitted heights were reduced by up to ~ 40 %. A concurrent process was the shift of the wave energy spectra towards higher frequencies landward of the reef that resulted in reduced transmitted wave periods. Wave modelling showed that the wave shadowing was associated with significant wave rotation around the reef that induced two zones of divergent wave angles near the shoreline in the lee of the reef. The hydrodynamic response to the wave energy dissipation was the development of stronger onshore directed currents landward of the reef. Hydrodynamic modelling indicated that the reef-induced flow forced a <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> in the lee side under shore normal waves, and an onshore deviation of the ambient (unidirectional) long-shore currents under oblique waves. The research provided a rare empirical test to the theoretical design concepts, and potential supplements or refinements.

40|$|Embayed beaches are {{well-known}} for the prominent curvature of their shorelines {{and are often}} observed in states of dynamic or static equilibrium. These equilibrium states are typically assumed {{to be influenced by}} headland geometry, <b>cellular</b> <b>circulation</b> patterns, wave obliquity at the shoreline and diffraction in and around the shadow zone. One of the main aims {{of this study is to}} gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of (i) wave forcing, (ii) environmental conditions and (iii) the geological setting in long-term embayed beach evolution. In doing so, a state-of-the-art morphodynamic model was used to simulate the evolution of a schematic embayment under idealized wave forcing conditions. Wave forcing is varied between a mixture of time-invariant and time-varying cases. Environmental conditions are varied by changing sediment size, tidal amplitude and mean wave height. The geological setting is varied by changing the angle of obliquity of the waves and the bay width. Several wave climate variables influence the distribution of wave energy throughout the bay and in the shadow zone: wave direction, directional spreading and wave height. Diffraction is shown to be dominant only when the incoming wave conditions are both directionally narrow-banded and highly oblique. Nevertheless, time varying wave directions (as little as 6 %) can account for shoreline curvature in the shadow zone. Changes in environmental conditions and geological setting generally affect the rate of development of the bay as well as the equilibrium size of the bay. For example: increased tidal amplitude enhances the size of the shadow zone due to modulation of the wave energy in this area, and wider bays require an exponentially larger period of time to attain equilibrium. Progressive weakening of the residual long-shore current and sediment transport as the bay develops is shown to be consistently related to long-term, non-uniform shoreline cutback (beach rotation). Hence, the curvature of the shoreline planform is primarily due to weakened shoreline erosion processes resulting from beach rotation. The research aims are extended to investigate seasonal and event-driven changes based on real-world cases. In doing so, the model has been used to reconstruct the medium-term, quasi-equilibrium morphology of a bay by discretising the measured wave climate variability in terms of wave heights and directions into several representative wave conditions. The effect of extreme events appeared to be balanced by average forcing conditions occurring over a longer period of time. Additionally, the equilibrium bathymetry is largely determined by wave direction variability; therefore it is necessary to have a high level of directional resolution in order to obtain accurate results. A nine-month field campaign was conducted at embayed beaches of Tairua and Pauanui, Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand. During this period the beaches exhibited highly dynamic behaviour in response to storm events characterised by non-uniform cross-shore sediment movement within the bay. The residual sediment transport pathways between the surf zone and the adjacent beach and shoaling zones will be determined in future...|$|E

Mitochondrial factors including reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c, ATP, and magnesium are potent modulators of voltage-gated K+ (K-v) channels in the plasmalemmal membrane of pulmonary arterial (PA) smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Mitochondria have also been found close to the plasmalemmal membrane in rabbit main PA smooth muscle sections. Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in mitochondria localization in rat PASMCs and systemic mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells (MASMCs) may contribute to the divergent oxygen sensitivity in the two different <b>circulations.</b> <b>Cellular</b> localization of mitochondria was compared with immunofluorescent labeling, and differences in functional coupling between mitochondria and Kv channels was evaluated with the patch-clamp technique and specific mitochondrial inhibitors antimycin A (acting at complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain) and oligomycin A (which inhibits the ATP synthase). It was found that mitochondria were located significantly closer to the plasmalemmal membrane in PASMCs compared with MASMCs. Consistent with these findings, the effects of the mitochondrial inhibitors on K-v current (I-Kv) were significantly more potent in PASMCs than in MASMCs. The cytoskeletal disruptor cytochalasin B (10 mu M) also altered mitochondrial distribution in PASMCs and significantly attenuated the effect of antimycin A on the voltage-dependent parameters of IKv.

30|$|Exosomes are {{recently}} proposed nanoliposomes {{derived from}} the cellular endosomes, and they can encapsulate drugs and target CNS diseases upon the harvesting exosomes followed by post modifications {{that are similar to}} the liposome techniques [42]. The exosomes recently received great attentions as they can closely mimic membrane compositions of host cells by presenting the cell-driven surface moieties; thus, they naturally possess potentials to target diseased cells that overcome biological barriers including BBB and targeted-cellular membranes [43]. One of the outstanding cell membrane-mimicking features of exosomes, which can be applied for CNS drug delivery, is its ability to inherently express antiphagocytic markers (e.g., CD 47) that endows the capability to evade monocytes and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) reducing immune response and their clearance rate in the blood [44]. Recent studies showed that administration of drug-loaded exosomes to the mouse body or brain had significantly decreased neuroinflammatory activity and reduced septic shock compared to liposaccharide (LPS)-injected mice [45, 46]. Moreover, the enhanced endocytosis, driven by the interactions between targeting receptors on the cells and naturally expressed ligands on the exosomes, could overcome multi-drug resistance by the drug efflux transport pump such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which rejects drugs outside of cells and educes drug efficacy [47]. These exosomes have been decorated with active-targeting ligands (iRGD [48, 49], etc.), anchoring molecules (Lamp- 2 b [50], etc.), and stealth polymers (PEG [51], dextran sulfate [52], etc.) to further boost targeting efficiency, <b>cellular</b> uptake, and <b>circulation</b> half-life.

Size {{is one of many}} particle properties that can influence their behaviour in biomedical applications, including their <b>cellular</b> uptake and <b>circulation</b> lifetime. Therefore, the sizing capabilities of three established (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning mobility particle sizing (SMPS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)) and three emerging particle sizing techniques (scanning ion occlusion sensing (SIOS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS)) with Stober silica particles, 100 - 400 nm in diameter, as the test material, were evaluated. When exposed to biological media particles will spontaneously be coated with a film of biomolecules, predominantly proteins, which will subsequently define their biological identities. Being able to quantify and evaluate the composition of these so called "protein coronas" is key to understanding the bio-nano interface. In this study, the amount of immunoglobulin G (IgG) adsorbed onto gold particles, as a function of particle size and protein concentration, was measured, using a combination of techniques including DLS (and [Symbol appears here.

To view, please open pdf attachment] -potential was a good indicator of protein corona integrity, and deviations in the protein corona thicknesses measured by NTA and DCS at low protein coverage were observed. Finally, the surface chemistry of an electrospun polymer fibre scaffold was characterised using time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The concentration of a cell adhesion enhancing peptide was measured to be linearly related to that in the bulk and its co-localisation with the polymers proven through imaging.

Various approaches {{have been developed to}} prevent protein absorption to NPs. For example, NPs are modified with hydrophilic and electrically neutral polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to delay the opsonization. However, the PEG layer also interferes with the interaction of NPs and cancer cells, resulting in poor cellular uptake and endosomal escape of NPs. For successful drug delivery with NPs, it is necessary to design an optimal surface chemistry that will protect the NPs from non-specific <b>cellular</b> uptake during <b>circulation</b> without compromising NP-cancer cell interactions. ^ We developed albumin-coated NPs to resolve the conflicting needs for NP-cell interaction. We used a simple surface modification method based on dopamine polymerization (pD). The pD layer formed on NP surface provided reactive functional groups for albumin conjugation and allowed for reliable conjugation of albumin. NP-pD-Al (NPs coated with albumin via pD) had less albumin than NPxAl (NPs with albumin embedded on the surface), but it was superior to NPxAl in entering B 16 F 10 cells across the confluent endothelial barrier in a co-culture system. Moreover, NP-pD-Al was taken up by J 774 A. 1 macrophages much less than NPxAl and did not activate pro-inflammatory responses. Esterase activity assay and gel electrophoresis indicate that albumin conformation was better preserved in NP-pD-Al than NPxAl due to the mild preparation condition. ^ These results indicate that the pD method helps to maintain the native conformation of albumin on the NP surface, which was critical to avoiding macrophage uptake and enhancing transendothelial transport and NP-cancer cell interactions. The mechanism by which albumin helps transport NPs and interaction with tumor cells are currently investigated. Potential pathways include transcytosis mediated by albumin-binding glycoprotein (gp 60) expressed on endothelial cells and the interaction with secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) overexpressed in tumor cells and interstitium. ...|$|R
