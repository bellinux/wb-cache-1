50|$|The {{thinnest}} part thickness {{determines the}} maximum stress {{that can be}} transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the flange thickens and results in blank <b>holder</b> <b>contact</b> at the outer boundary rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size (initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An indicator of material formability is the limiting drawing ratio (LDR), defined as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup without flange to the punch diameter. Determination of the LDR for complex components is difficult and hence the part is inspected for critical areas for which an approximation is possible. During severe deep drawing the material work hardens and {{it may be necessary to}} anneal the parts in controlled atmosphere ovens to restore the original elasticity of the material.|$|R

50|$|The {{domain name}} seizure process used by Operation In Our Sites was codified in (b)(2), which {{provides}} a legal framework for property seizures by the government. Before the seizure, government officials are supposed to investigate suspected websites {{to find out if}} they actually purchase or access counterfeit items. The government then <b>contacts</b> the copyright <b>holders</b> to confirm ownership of the intellectual property and suspected infringement. Following the investigation, ICE and NIPRCC officials present the resulting evidence to the U.S. Attorneys, and check the domain name registration.If the domain name was registered in the U.S., the government petitions a magistrate judge to issue a seizure warrant for the domain name. With the warrant, the domain name's title and rights are transferred to the U.S. government. After the seizure, the government is supposed to send a written notice of the forfeiture deadline to the website operator within 60 days from the seizure date. The website owner can file the claim against the government within 35 days after receiving the notice. If the owner files a claim, the government has 90 days to prove that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the owner does not make a claim against the seizure, or the government successfully proves a valid seizure, the domain name is forfeited to the government.|$|R
40|$|This report {{attempts}} to answer two important questions about {{health and safety}} regulation. First, it considers whether, in {{trying to change the}} way companies and their senior officers conduct themselves in relation to health and safety, the Government should introduce new legislation; or whether instead it is just as effective for the Government to adopt voluntary codes of conduct, which have no legal basis and no capacity for outside enforcement. Second, in relation to the law that currently exists, it considers what techniques regulatory bodies should use to ensure that companies and other employers actually comply with it. It assesses whether compliance is best obtained through, on the one hand inspections and investigations with the threat of the imposition of formal enforcement notices and prosecution, or, on the other hand, through education and other forms of <b>contact</b> with duty <b>holders</b> in which regulators inform them about what they should do and encourage them to take action where necessary, but with no or little threat of actual enforcement. The report tries to answer these questions by undertaking a comprehensive review of the available published research and considers what the evidence tells us about the relative effectiveness of (a) the use of the "law" to obtain improvements in health and safety and (b) various regulatory techniques and approaches that exist to ensure companies comply with existing health and safety law...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of recoil buffer is {{made from}} a resilient and deformable material (leather, rubber, polymer e.g. a rubber butt pad on a shotgun). A second way of producing a recoil buffer is to insert a spring into the recoil train—the path/part(s) generating recoil impulse. This spring is mounted to the point(s) where the firearm <b>contacts</b> a mechanical <b>holder</b> such as a tripod or human upper torso. Reducing the initial jolt, the rate and/or extent of rearward displacement, and any internal impacts in the operating parts of a firearm can reduce the shooter's perception of recoil, and may also work to {{extend the life of}} the mechanism and its parts. More sophisticated designs use hydraulic or pneumatic shock absorbers; systems of springs, cams and levers to modify, dampen, or dissipate the rearward impulse generated as the projectile is fired down the bore of the firearm. Aftermarket buffers are often moulded bumpers or additional springs placed between operating metal parts which impact one another, such as the slide and the frame of a semi-automatic pistol. This type of buffer cushions the battering force of repeated metal on metal impact, reducing wear on parts and lengthening the service life of the firearm. Reduction of perceived recoil discomfort is an immediate added benefit of this type recoil buffer.|$|R
40|$|High speed {{machining}} using vertical CNC milling centres {{continues to}} be a popular approach in a variety of industries including aerospace,automobile,mould and die casting etc. Chatter oscillations have significant influence in restricting the metal removal rates of the machining process. The cutting process instability or chatter is assessed by prediction of frequency response at the tool tip. Present work aims at evaluating the combined effect of a spindle-housing and tool holder on the dynamics of cutting tool by considering the flexibility of spindle unit supported on bearings. The spindle-tool is analysed by using finite element modeling using Timoshenko beam theory. The dynamic characteristics and tool-tip frequency responses are obtained without considering the cutting forces. The results are compared with receptance coupling approach and using 3 D modeling in ANSYS. Further experimental modal analysis on the machining spindle of same dimensions has revealed the same dynamic modes. Using the validated FE model of the system,the effects of nonlinear bearing <b>contact</b> forces,spindle-tool <b>holder</b> interface stiffness,bearing span and axial preload, tool overhang and diameter on the frequency response and cutting process stability are studied. Optimal spindle-tool system is designed for achieving maximum dynamic stiffness. The analytically stability lobe diagrams are obtained from the real and imaginary terms of these frequency responses at the tool tip. Dynamic stability issues in helical end-milling using the two and three dimensional cutting force models are considered for the analysis. The stability boundaries are experimentally verified using the cutting tests on both CNC milling spindle and modified drilling tool spindle systems while machining Al-alloy work pieces. Vibration and sound pressure levels are also employed to assure the stability of cutting operations,while surface images are used to identify the chatter marks at various combinations of cutting parameters. Dynamic milling model is employed with the flexible spindle-tool system by considering several effects including variable tool pitch, tool run-out,nonlinear feed forces and process damping. Design and stability studies on the modified drill spindle with a custom-designed work table for milling operations allowed in understanding several interesting facts about spindle-tool systems. Some control strategies including semi-active and active methods are implemented using finite element model of the spindle-tool system to minimize the chatter vibration levels/maximize the stable depth of cut during cutting operations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. To provide information on consumers' experience, knowledge and attitudes in relation to insurance policies of five different types. The types of policy covered are: 1. Life assurance policies 2. Endowment assurance policies 3. Home insurance (buildings) (Householders survey only) 4. Home insurance (contents) (Householders survey only) 5. Motor vehicle insurance Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions a) How people have taken out their present policy(ies) b) Who advised them and what advice they were given c) Policy holders' awareness of specific clauses in their policies d) Problems that have arisen when making a claim on their policy e) Other difficulties {{members of the public}} have had to face in connection with insurance f) Attitudes of non-policy holders to each type of policy {{and the way in which}} they would obtain such a policy. Survey consists of 4 separate questionnaires. Variables common to all include: whether informant holds a policy or whether he/she has ever held a policy - if applicable; reason for no longer having one is given. If respondent has never considered taking out a policy, 'reason' is stated and a record is made of how he/she would go about obtaining one should he/she so decide. Particulars of policy held: company with which policy is held; annual yearly premium on policy; method of payment (e. g. by Giro); whether paid by instalments; if so, frequency of payment is recorded; total sum assured on policy; date policy was taken out. Procedures followed when taking out policy: whether and by whom prompted to take out policy; objectives in taking out policy; decision stages involved in first taking out policy; from whom received advice (8 categories). There is a separate section on insurance brokers, where applicable. Knowledge of policy: particularly, cover of policy; facilities linked with policy (e. g. life insurance policy and mortgage facility); amount which would be received if respondent stopped paying premiums before policy maturation date. Also, familiarity with policy document is tested (e. g. the last time that holder read or even looked at the document, and where it is normally kept). Claims (except in life insurance questionnaire) : number of claims made on policy; value of claim; whether handled by self; circumstances leading to claim; difficulties experienced; eventual outcome (e. g. claim met in full) and knowledge of the term 'averaging' on claims. Attitudes: circumstances in which respondent might decide to increase the value of his/her policy; whether he/she has ever contacted the insurance company with a view to modifying policy (if yes, who contacted and number of times is recorded); whether respondent thinks that the company should <b>contact</b> policy <b>holders</b> from time to time or whether it should be left to the <b>holder</b> to <b>contact</b> the company. Satisfaction with people who may have been contacted at some stage in connection with policy is gauged on a 7 -point scale (people listed are: insurance broker; insurance agent; bank manager; solicitor; other professional adviser). Background Variables Sex, age cohort, marital status, occupational details (including industry, job description and status, qualifications obtained), social grade, household status (i. e. sex, ages, number, occupational status, marital status, relationship to informant), home tenure and area of residence...|$|R
