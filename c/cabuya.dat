40|$|Studies of {{composite}} materials {{play an important}} role in engineering, materials, metallurgy and mechanical applications. Polymer reinforced fibers are widely used in the automotive and aeronautical industry because of their benefits such as low cost, noise control, low weight and ease of processing.

The results showed a better mechanical tensile behavior in 7. 7 % compared to the material commonly used. It was observed that 30 % long fiber in a layer order, FV+FC+FV, is a potential reinforcement of the alternative hybrid material for automotive applications. In addition, a balanced reinforcement organization, FV+FC, and micro structural adhesion with the polymeric reinforcement matrix (RP) were evidenced by scanning microscopy. The results of tensile stress and axial deformation of the best combination of composite material, FL- 30 %, are validated using the finite element method (MEF) ...|$|E

Las plantaciones de teca en la península de Nicoya, se clasificaron entre los índices de sitio 23 y 27, con una edad clave de 16 años, estas plantaciones se consideran como sitios de clase media y alta, de acuerdo al crecimiento exhibido por la teca en Costa Rica. 131 - 145 echaves 1 @ice. co. crSemestralResults are {{presented}} of two thinning experiment {{carried out with}} different goals in teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. f.), in two sites, at the Nicoya Peninsula: Puerto Carillo with 10 years of records and <b>Cabuya</b> with 23 years of research. Strong early thinnings, were done, {{based on the number}} of trees in intensively managed plantations with a shorter rotation and lighter thinning using basal area as a parameter, in the longer rotation plantations. A completely randomized block design with two replication was using. Thinnings were done at 7, 12 and 21 years in <b>Cabuya</b> and at 5, 6, and 10 years in Puerto Carrillo. Significant differences were detected in the first and the second thinning at the ages of 7 and 12, at <b>Cabuya</b> plantation, between the different thinning treatments and the control plot, but the third thinning done at 21 years of age, the differences were not significant. The thinning carried out at Puerto Carrillo, taking as a reference the number of trees, in order to leave 500 trees/ha at the age of 6, showed a superior growth in diameter that those carried out taking into account the basal area, in sites of similar quality. The high densities at early ages affect the growth in diameter and height, and also affect stand productivity.

40|$|Ten {{tropical}} highland maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars (Cacahuazintle, Chalqueno, Conico 7, INIAP 153, Morocho Ecuatoriano, Cacao, <b>Cabuya,</b> Blanco Urubamba, Umutu, and Morocho Ayacuchano) {{and their}} 45 diallel crosses were evaluated at seven locations in three Andean countries, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate heterosis and to determine heterotic patterns among the ten tropical highland maize cultivars. The total variability among entries was partitioned following the analysis II and III of Gardner and Eberhart (1966). A mixed model was used with locations as random effects and cultivars as fixed effects;Additive gene effects seemed important in the expression of all traits as indicated by the statistical significance of cultivar effects and general combining ability effects. For yield, heterosis effects accounted for 75 % of the total variability among entries suggesting that nonadditive gene effects also were important in the expression of heterosis. High-parent heterosis for yield ranged from - 10. 9 % to 111. 2 %. Only four crosses had negative high parent heterosis for yield. Negative mid-parent heterosis was expressed in most crosses for female flowering, grain moisture content, and stalk lodging. Specific combining ability effects were significant for grain moisture content, plant height, ear height, and stalk lodging. Positive high parent heterosis was expressed in nearly 50 % of the crosses for ear volume, kernel depth, and kernels per row;The earlier maturity cultivars, Cacahuazintle, Chalqueno, and Conico 7, had a similar heterotic pattern and could form a single population for recurrent selection. Another population could be formed by INIAP 153, Blanco Urubamba, and Umutu. These cultivars had the highest yields per se and had similar flowering dates. These two groups of cultivars have good heterosis response but differences in flowering time would limit their practical use as heterotic partners. The <b>Cabuya</b> and Blanco Urubamba cultivars had similar number of days to flowering and their F[subscript] 1 cross yielded 7. 37 t/ha with 28 % HP heterosis. The cultivar Cacao performed well in crosses though it was very late flowering...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} effects of the previous wetting and drying treatments of cellulosic fibers on the fiber–matrix bond strength of cement based composites. First, three kinds of fibers—abaca, <b>cabuya</b> and sisal—were subjected to five cycles of water wetting and subsequent drying. The resulting changes in the morphology, mechanical properties, drying kinetics and thermal stability were determined with scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), tensile tests and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) respectively. A reduction in the cross section, an increase in Young’s modulus and adecrease in tensile strength and tensile strain as well as a structure with thinner pores was found for the treated fibers. Second, cement based composites with untreated and treated fibers were prepared to evaluate the fiber–matrix bonding before and after accelerated aging. For this purpose the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between the fibers and the matrix was determined by the single fiber pull-out test after seven days of curing in a humidity chamber and after four aging wetting–drying cycles. The treatment of the fibers results in an increase in the interfacial shear strength of the cement composites also improving the durabilityPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|La idea que tengo de obra de arte no se centra sobre una técnica específica ni hacia la noción de obra terminada sino procesual. Ocupo la experiencia artística desde la memoria cotidiana y desde los objetos que se relacionan con el cuerpo y el espacio, en un contexto en donde se inscribe el hombre con el renacer y con el destino. Trabajos como el de Giuseppe Penone y Jannis Kounellis han contribuido formalmente al gesto escultórico de mi experiencia y al paso a un ejercicio activo con el cuerpo como el trabajo de Erwin Wurm. Aún cuando al inicio de la maestría fundé una relación feliz con la escultura, encontré ciertos materiales como los troncos y las ramas de árboles que me permitieron elaborar discursos sobre las correspondencias del hombre con la naturaleza. También encontrar relaciones del renacer con lo sintético, así que, fui incorporando otros materiales como el plástico, la <b>cabuya,</b> textiles, aluminios y elementos cotidianos in situ. / Abstract.
