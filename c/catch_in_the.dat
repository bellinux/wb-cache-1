5|$|After totaling 593 {{receiving}} yards in 2010, Hemingway surpassed this yardage total in his senior season, finishing with a career-best 699 yards. The improvement resulted in Hemingway's league-leading 2010 average of 18.5 yards per reception improving to 20.6 yards per reception in 2011, {{which was the}} third-best average per <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation (up from 15th in 2010).|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game. While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866, the header {{would become an}} important feature of the national game. This {{was linked to the}} abolition of the fair <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year that prevented all use of the hands by outfield players.|$|E
5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin of the pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become wound around bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{played a}} key part in Victoria's win over New South Wales away at the SCG. Having taken two catches as the hosts batted first, he made 61 as the {{visitors}} made 234 to take a 52-run first innings lead. After taking another <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings, he then made an unbeaten 106 to guide the Victorians to their target of 268 with five wickets in hand. Harvey's run-scoring tapered away {{in the last two}} matches of the season; he made 74 runs in three innings in the match. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 699 runs at 49.92; he had made the same number of runs in his first six first-class seasons since his debut in 1947–48. As a result of his performances in this season, he was hailed as the best batsman outside the Australian Test team.|$|E
5|$|Hassett had a {{new role}} as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. Hassett {{struggled}} {{to make an impact}} in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3/404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} North Atlantic, {{porbeagle}} fishing has been illegal in {{waters of the}} European Union since 2011. From 1985 and until the EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons respectively from European Community waters. Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and thus had no practical effect. The species is included on the red list of Norway {{and it has been}} protected in their national waters since 2012. Any porbeagle caught in EU or Norwegian waters by accident must be released.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Tallon scored only six in Australia's 236 {{and then took}} 0/10 in Scotland's second innings and did not take a <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Tallon kept wicket, conceding 26 byes and not taking a {{dismissal}} {{and he was not}} required to bat. When the match became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland's second innings, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match. Tallon took 2/15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and {{deferred}} {{until the second}} half. The Bears special teams unit struggled, with returner Marc Mariani muffing the return on both of the Vikings' first two punts. Despite this, the Bears took the lead with Robbie Gould's 55-yard field goal. However, Minnesota scored on Marcus Sherels's 65-yard punt return touchdown, the third return touchdown allowed by the Bears in 2015. Despite this, Sherels muffed his return on the ensuing punt; Blair Walsh eventually kicked a 43-yard field goal {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 10–3. After the game's next three drives ended in punts (twice by the Bears), the first turnover of the game occurred when Kyle Fuller intercepted Bridgewater's pass for Stefon Diggs. The Bears capitalized on the takeaway with Cutler's 21-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, who jumped over Rhodes to make the <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left corner of the endzone. In the third quarter, the Bears reclaimed the lead with Gould's 33-yard field goal, and after the Vikings punted, had the chance to increase the margin to six points on Gould's 51-yard attempt. However, Gould's kick went wide left, his first miss of the season and ending a 17-kick streak. Minnesota took advantage by tying the game via Walsh's 48-yard field goal. The game's next two possessions ended with touchdowns for both teams: the Bears scored with Cutler, whose targets (Jeffery and Mariani) were unavailable, running four yards and colliding with safety Harrison Smith at the goal line for the touchdown. Afterwards, the Vikings tied the score with Bridgewater throwing a pass to Diggs, who escaped Sherrick McManis to score on the 40-yard play. With 1:49 left in the game, the Bears' next drive ended with a punt to the Vikings' 22-yard line. However, aided by Bridgewater's 35-yard pass to Charles Johnson, Walsh kicked a 36-yard field goal as time expired to seal the win.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} more county {{fixtures}} before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew {{the first two}} before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Saggers played {{in all but the}} Nottinghamshire match. Against Lancashire, Saggers came in at 6/145 and held up his end, making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204. He then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as the hosts replied with 182 before the rain-affected match ended in a draw. Saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as Hampshire made 195 in their first innings. He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets (7/98) and was last man out for 17, one of only four players to pass five, as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead {{for the first time in}} the season. He then completed another stumping in the second innings and conceded four byes as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets. Saggers' final opportunity to stake a claim for Test selection was in the match against Sussex. He did not concede a bye and took a <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings. Saggers was not required to bat as Australia declared their innings closed at 5/549, and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as Australia won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|On Monday Night Football, the Bears {{traveled}} west to {{face the}} 2–6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31–20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14–3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20–7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6–5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the <b>catch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, {{both of which were}} {{among the highest in the}} NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30–39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive.|$|E
