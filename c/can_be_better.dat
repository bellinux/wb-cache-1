25|$|Eomer's {{next stop}} takes {{him to the}} town of Snowbourn on the river of the same name. The Third Marshall deems the entire Eastemnet not defensible, with Isengard forces coming from the west, Mordor orcs pouring from the south and Easterlings {{crossing}} the river from the east. By his military power, he orders all people remaining in those lands to abandon their homes and move westward across the Entwash river, where they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> defended. Fastred, the Thane ("Major") of Snowbourn openly defies this order, however, refusing to abandon his position and leading bold strikes against orc forces instead.

25|$|Much {{of the aid}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> {{understood}} {{when considering}} the economic distortions caused by the war. Most belligerent powers cut back severely on production of non-essentials, concentrating on producing weapons. This inevitably produced shortages of related products needed by the military {{or as part of}} the military-industrial complex. For example, the USSR was highly dependent on rail transportation, but the war practically shut down rail equipment production. Just 446 locomotives were produced during the war, with only 92 of those being built between 1942 and 1945. In total, 92.7% of the wartime production of railroad equipment by the Soviet Union was supplied under Lend-Lease, including 1,911 locomotives and 11,225 railcars which augmented the existing prewar stocks of at least 20,000 locomotives and half a million railcars.|$|E
25|$|More {{and more}} {{designers}} have shown inter-seasonal collections between the traditional Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer seasons. These collections are usually more commercial than the main season collections and help shorten the customer's wait for new season clothes. The inter-seasonal collections are Resort/Cruise (before Spring/Summer) and Pre-Fall (before Autumn/Winter). There is no fixed schedule for these shows {{in any of}} the major fashion capitals but they typically happen three months after the main season shows. Some designers show their inter-seasonal collections outside their home city. For example, Karl Lagerfeld has shown his Resort and Pre-Fall collections for Chanel in cities such as Moscow, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo instead of Paris. Many designers also put on presentations as opposed to traditional shows during Resort and Pre-Fall either to cut down costs or because they feel the clothes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> understood in this medium.|$|E

25|$|These {{traditional}} {{markets are}} {{a variation of}} tianguis, or open air markets, which have been {{an important part of}} commerce since pre Hispanic times. The difference is that traditional tianguis are held on specific days, with individual vendors setting up and taking down their stalls on the same day. Like tianguis, traditional fixed markets have stands occupied by various individual merchants, and tend to sell the same kinds of products: produce, groceries and other basic necessities. The difference is that the fixed markets operate every day, and individual stands are rented and occupied {{in much the same way}} as a store is. The fixed market has its origin in various attempts to replace tianguis with markets that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> regulated. However, the tianguis were never replaced. Many tianguis, especially in rural areas, now operate in conjunction with the fixed markets to expand on variety of merchandise available.|$|E
25|$|Annadurai opposed {{this move}} and the schism between his {{supporters}} and Periyar widened. He saw the gaining of independence as an overall achievement of India rather than solely that of Aryan North. Moreover, Periyar's decision on giving up participating in democratic elections was also opposed by Annadurai, {{in reaction to}} which {{he walked out of}} a party meeting in 1948. Periyar considered that candidates in elections must compromise their ideologies. Moreover, it was Periyar's idea that social reformation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> achieved outside politics, through education and canvassing the masses, rather than governments. Eventually, when Periyar married Maniammai, who was 40 years younger than he, the personal differences between Annadurai and Periyar split their supporters. Annadurai launched his own party with his party fragment, along with E. V. K. Sampath (Periyar's nephew and until then considered his political heir). The new party was named Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. DMK's presence was initially restricted to urban centres and its surrounding areas. But by appealing to the urban lower, lower middle and working classes, students, Dalits and lower castes, Annadurai was able to accelerate its growth and spread. He fought for the social justice of the lower castes and thus rapidly gained popular support.|$|E

Takao Yamada likewise points out that Hata has criticized all sides in historical controversies and he argues that Hata <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> described as a [...] "positivist".|$|E

Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and said that the film's soundtrack was better than that of the original, while praising the composition of the songs [...] "Deva Shree Ganesha" [...] and [...] "O Saiyyan". A review carried by BBC UK summed up, [...] "Blessedly free of unnecessary remixes, Agneepath is a well-crafted, evocative collection of songs that proves the adage that, when it comes to Indian music composers, sometimes two heads <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than one.|$|E
500|$|There is {{debate over}} how useful a {{multiplicity}} of different [...] "feet" [...] is in describing meter.

Actual rhythm is significantly {{more complex than the}} basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. Vladimir Nabokov noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term [...] "scud" [...] be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.|$|E

In addition to the high cost, naval officials discussing the cancellation of the DD(X) program cited the inability of the DD(X) to fire the Standard missile or provide adequate air defense coverage, and a [...] "classified threat" [...] which the navy feels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> handled by the current Arleigh Burke-class destroyers than by the Zumwalt-class destroyers.
