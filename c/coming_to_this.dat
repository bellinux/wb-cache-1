5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen {{developed}} an argument, {{published in the}} magazine Physical Review with the title Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?, based on an entangled state of two systems. Before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> argument, {{it is necessary to}} formulate another hypothesis that comes out of Einstein's work in relativity: the principle of locality. The elements of physical reality which are objectively possessed cannot be influenced instantaneously at a distance.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think {{it is unfortunate that}} anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Next {{match for}} Sri Lanka was against Bangladesh, {{who won the}} match against India and was in good {{performance}} before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> match. But Bangladesh's chances of reaching the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India in 2003. It was only due to the rain during Bangladesh's innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his 24th One-day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak {{were the only ones}} to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh' top-scoring batsman, Mohammad Ashraful, who made 45 not out from number seven.|$|E
500|$|In Christian doctrine, Christ {{came not}} just to the Jews but also to the Gentiles. It was {{understood}} that, prior to the Birth of Christ, God prepared the world for his <b>coming.</b> <b>To</b> <b>this</b> purpose, God used Jews and Gentiles alike. Jesus would not have been born in Bethlehem (where it had been prophesied that his birth would take place), {{except for the fact that}} the pagan Roman Emperor Augustus decreed that there should be a census. Likewise, when Jesus was born, the announcement of his birth was made to rich and to poor, to mighty and to humble, to Jew and to Gentile. The Three Wise Men (the [...] "Magi" [...] of the Bible) who sought out the infant King with precious gifts were pagan foreigners.|$|E
500|$|So Beautiful or So What finds Simon {{returning}} to more harmonic-based compositions than rhythm-based. This was spurred {{from when he}} realized his favorite song on his 2006 effort Surprise, [...] "Everything About It Is a Love Song", contained a chord progression he found particularly interesting. After <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> realization, he focused on the album’s three ballads, [...] "Questions for the Angels", [...] "Amulet", and [...] "Love and Hard Times". Unlike his previous rhythm-based albums, {{in which he would}} gain inspiration for his guitar parts from pre-recorded backing tracks, Simon took a more traditional approach to building the songs on So Beautiful or So What. He wrote songs at home before developing them further in the studio {{with the help of a}} natural click track, such as [...] "a percussion instrument, or even just tapping out a rhythm on his guitar." [...] He overdubbed additional elements afterwards, including additional guitar parts and percussion. Simon began envisioning the album’s sequencing when he only had a few songs written, letting it inform his songwriting.|$|E

2500|$|Creationists also dispute science's {{interpretation}} of genetic {{evidence in the}} study of human evolution. They argue that it is a [...] "dubious assumption" [...] that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship, and that scientists are <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist. Creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental.|$|E

He published his findings {{in a book}} entitled Nenia Brittanica (1793). Douglas {{was the first to}} identify burials of this type as being Anglo-Saxon rather than Romano-British, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion because of [...] "Their situation near villages of Saxon names" [...] and the fact that [...] "They are scattered all over Britain in places which the Saxons occupied, and are not discovered in the parts of Wales which they had not subdued." ...|$|E

[...] I certainly hope the Irish people force that newspaper's editor to apologise for the great hurt caused by that article". Scotland Yard received a complaint. Gately's record company also issued a complaint to the PCC. The PCC did not uphold the complaint, stating: [...] "It found the article caused some offence but there was insufficient evidence it breached the law."

It is an established legal principle that this freedom applies equally to information and ideas that are favourably received as to those which offend, shock and disturb. Though the complainants and many others found this article offensive, this does not make its publication unlawful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Uncertainty {{was cast}} on the plans by the 2008 death of Anne d'Harnoncourt, but new {{director}} Timothy Rub, who had initiated a 350-million dollar expansion at the Cleveland Museum of Art, will be {{carrying out the}} plans as scheduled. [...] In 2010, Gehry attended the groundbreaking for {{the second phase of}} the expansion, due to be completed in 2012. [...] In that phase, a new art handling facility was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a 640-foot-long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building. This north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the [...] "core project", which is scheduled for completion in 2020. The core project also focuses on the interior of the current building and will add 90,000 square feet of public space, including 11,500 square feet of new gallery space for American art and contemporary art. [...] In addition, a new space called the forum will be created, along with dining and retail spaces. Said Gehry: [...] "When it's done, people <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> museum will have an experience that's as big as Bilbao. It won't be apparent from the outside, but it will knock their socks off inside." ...|$|E
