40|$|About the book] Childhoods {{in context}} offers a {{critical}} exploration of childhood, {{drawing attention to}} the physical and social context of children and young people's lives. Three key themes <b>are</b> explored: · <b>Childhood</b> <b>is</b> always located somewhere. The book offers insights into childhood by focusing on places specially designed for {{children as well as}} the territories that children develop for themselves. · <b>Childhood</b> <b>is</b> experienced through objects, people and places and through everyday routines. Discussions about <b>childhood</b> <b>are</b> rooted in the details of children's lives, whether on the street, in an institution or in different definitions of home. · Childhood and adult identities are relational. Definitions and understandings of <b>childhood</b> <b>are</b> dependent on how adulthood is viewed. These themes are explored through accounts of home and family, school, public spaces and sites of work in local and global settings. They raise questions about methodological approaches to understanding childhoods in context which is the focus of the concluding chapter...|$|R

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

5|$|While Gascoigne was {{successful}} {{on the football}} field, his <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> marked by instability and tragedy. Initially his family lived in a single upstairs room in a council house with a shared bathroom, and moved several times during Gascoigne's early life. When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of a friend, {{who was killed in}} a traffic collision. Around this time, his father began to suffer from seizures. Gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches, and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Childhood</b> <b>was</b> {{brief and}} perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

5|$|Itachi is {{a member}} of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, {{establishing}} milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up to. His early <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan.|$|E
5|$|Lexie Grey is the {{daughter}} of Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry) and his second wife, Susan Grey (Mare Winningham). She grew up with her younger sister, Molly Grey-Thompson (Mandy Siegfried) and throughout her <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> kept unaware that she also had an older half-sister, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), born to Thatcher and his first wife, Ellis Grey (Kate Burton). Lexie is first mentioned when Molly is admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital, with Susan informing Meredith that Lexie is a student at Harvard Medical School. At some subsequent point, Lexie learns of Meredith's existence. She graduates from medical school and is accepted to take her surgical internship at Mass General hospital, but following her mother's sudden death from complications stemming from the hiccups, Lexie instead opts to move back to Seattle to be closer to her father, taking up an internship at Seattle Grace Hospital, one year behind Meredith who is due to begin her residency.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's early <b>childhood</b> <b>was</b> {{stable and}} happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially {{unprepared}} for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E
