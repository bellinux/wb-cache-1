50|$|With recent {{progress}} in CNT development and fabrication, there is promise to use various CNT based nanocomposites and nanostructures {{to direct the}} flow of photogenerated electrons and assist in charge injection and extraction. To assist the electron transport to the <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode</b> surface in a DSSC, a popular concept is to utilize CNT networks as support to anchor light harvesting semiconductor particles. Research efforts along these lines include organizing CdS quantum dots on SWCNTs. Charge injection from excited CdS into SWCNTs was documented upon excitation of CdS nanoparticles. Other varieties of semiconductor particles including CdSe and CdTe can induce charge-transfer processes under visible light irradiation when attached to CNTs. Including porphyrin and C60 fullerene, organization of photoactive donor polymer and acceptor fullerene on electrode surfaces {{has also been shown}} to offer considerable improvement in the photoconversion efficiency of solar cells. Therefore, there is an opportunity to facilitate electron transport and increase the photoconversion efficiency of DSSCs utilizing the electron-accepting ability of semiconducting SWCNTs.|$|E

40|$|A dust layer, {{especially}} {{based on}} high-resistivity dust, at the collecting electrodes may cause a back corona discharge in electrostatic precipitators (ESP). It can {{significantly reduce the}} ESP efficiency {{and as a result}} cause ecological damages. To study the dust layer influence inside ESPs, it is necessary to derive an adequate model of the ESP precipitation process with a dust layer at the <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode.</b> The research of the present thesis is focused on stationary studies of the precipitation process with a dust layer at the <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode</b> in ESPs. Three mathematical models are proposed as a description of the precipitation process with a dust layer at the <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode.</b> The models are based on Maxwell’s equations and the finite element method (FEM). COMSOL Multiphysics software is used for their implementation. In all models the dust layer has constant conductivity and the air region has constant ion mobility. In the first model there are no coupling conditions, which is required in mathematics, are given between the two regions. The solution found by COMSOL Multiphysics does not provide physically acceptable coupling conditions. In the second model, a continuous transition zone is introduced between the two regions so that no coupling conditions are required. With the large derivatives in the transition zone, the nonlinear solver in COMSOL Multiphysics does not converge. Finally, in the third model, the dust layer and the grounded <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode</b> are replaced with a boundary condition for the air region. The properties of the third model are investigated, and these models can be used to study the influence of the dust layer. The results of these investigations are reported and discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) was electrospun using {{different}} methods {{to charge the}} polymer solution. A positive high voltage relative to the <b>collecting</b> <b>electrode</b> significantly increased the fibre deposition rate. Electron microscopy showed that {{approximately half of the}} increase in fibre mass was due to thicker fibres being deposited. The current flowing from the grounded electrode was measured to determine the charge carried on the PVOH jet. This showed that for a positive voltage charging condition there is a much larger current and hence more charge carriers generated in the PVOH solution. As a result, more mass is ejected from the Taylor cone, implying that a positive voltage also produces longer fibre for a given time period. We also tested whether different substrate materials caused any variation when the charging conditions were changed. Statistically significant variation between substrates was only found when the substrate was an insulator and was expected to support a high deposition rate.
