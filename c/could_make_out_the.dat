25|$|At 12:02 Yavuzs first {{artillery}} officer <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Russian ships {{through the}} fog and ordered the crew to target Evstafi. The first salvo overshot the ship, though one shell pierced the center funnel and caused splinter damage to the wireless antennae. The Ottomans' third salvo scored two hits on Evstafi. The first one disabled the forward starboard 6-inch casemated gun and caused casualties among its crew. The second shell penetrated the casemate armour, setting fire to some 6-inch cartridges and detonating in the officers' galley, causing severe damage while some splinters penetrated the deck {{and went into the}} boiler room below. A near miss caused extensive splinter damage to an unarmoured part of the ship, destroying a bulkhead in the infirmary.|$|E
500|$|It {{was here}} where the young Como {{acquired}} polish {{and his own}} unique style, {{with the help of}} Ted Weems. Mutual's Chicago affiliate [...] WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> words to the songs he was singing. Weems told Como {{there was no need for}} him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.|$|E
60|$|Captain Mitchell, {{accustomed}} to the darkness, <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> doctor stretching out his hands blindly.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Atherton <b>could</b> just <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{figure of}} the speaker in the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Thank you, Thomas--thank you--er--a freak, you said, Thomas. Now, <b>could</b> you <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> monstrosity's {{entitlements}} {{a little}} clearer, if you please, Thomas?' ...|$|R
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; he <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{expression}} on her face. She looked {{almost as if she}} were going to cry, and yet....|$|R
60|$|He did so, {{and it was}} {{not long}} before he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{approaching}} craft quite clearly.|$|E
60|$|Listening intently, they <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} little bells, such as are carried by horses or mules.|$|E
60|$|Then all up the dim {{hillside}} I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Boers halting {{and riding}} back. One rifle across there flashed.|$|E
60|$|Not until a {{few minutes}} later <b>could</b> Malchus <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> faint outline through the driving mist. It was a lofty pile of rock {{standing}} by itself.|$|R
60|$|Then they wept, and chattered, and scolded; but in vain. They {{were forced}} to tell the truth, though, when they told it, Perseus <b>could</b> hardly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> road.|$|R
60|$|The men {{fell back}} at once, in each case, not doubting from the badges on the arms, which they <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> darkness, that Philip was bearing some {{important}} order.|$|R
60|$|A little midshipman, named Midgley, {{differed}} from both, {{and said it}} was a large dhow, for he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> top of its lateen sail.|$|E
60|$|But in {{the dark}} it was some time before the {{starosta}} <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figures on the floor. Suddenly Godfrey felt Mikail's hand on his throat.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{stooped to}} the window and looked in. The little cell was low and dark, but he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> wounded soldier lying moaning on his pallet.|$|E
60|$|In {{the hall}} Crispin <b>could</b> now <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figures of Colonel Pride and of {{three men who}} came with him. But he had scant leisure to survey them, for the colonel was in haste.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} I was laid {{in my own}} sleeping-place, and <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> {{darkness}} the outline of perhaps a dozen heads crowded around me. I sat up. ‘What is it?’ I exclaimed.|$|R
6000|$|Burnamy <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{answer that}} came from within. The lady spoke again {{in a tone of}} {{reluctant}} assent, [...] "No, I don't suppose you could; but if he understood, perhaps he would offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all a mystery, {{the most}} {{beautiful}} mystery of life," [...] Wanhope resumed. [...] "I don't believe I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> case as I feel it to be." ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, he {{indicated}} {{with his hand}} a huge pile of books, gayly jacketed in white and blue. I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> title in big gilt lettering--GOLDEN DREAMS.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} could {{let me have a}} {{thousand}} or so,' said Undy. 'I think a couple of thousand would carry it, and I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> other myself.' ...|$|E
60|$|For an hour {{they went}} at a walk, {{and then the}} horses broke into their usual pace, of their own accord. It was getting dark, now, and soon even Zaki <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> track.|$|R
60|$|They turned towards me, and {{although}} I <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> expressions of their faces, in the gloom, yet I doubted not {{but that they}} were puzzled ones at that lengthy and apparently meaningless harangue.|$|R
6000|$|When I came {{to myself}} I was laid {{in my own}} sleeping-place, and <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> {{darkness}} the outline of perhaps a dozen heads crowded around me. I sat up. [...] "What is it?" [...] I exclaimed.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a minute}} or two before Tom <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> distant figures, for his eyes were less {{accustomed}} to search for moving objects than were those of his companions.|$|E
60|$|The Indian without {{speaking}} {{led them to}} another point some twenty yards away, and pointed to another impression. This was so slight that it was with difficulty that Tom <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> outline.|$|E
60|$|He strode away {{among the}} trees. It was very dark. The {{tethered}} horses were moving restlessly; but, {{so far as}} Edgar <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> cattle were bunched together. After lighting a match he came back.|$|E
60|$|Janet {{ran to the}} thicket, and Oswald and Roger threw {{themselves}} {{down behind}} a great stone. Two minutes later, {{they could hear the}} thunder of hoofs go along the road opposite, but <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figures.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{attempts}} to persecute {{the attack on}} the hospital were dealt with shortly by West German judges in 1978 and 1983, since prosecutors emphatically claimed that <b>the</b> pilots <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> nature of the target in alleged morning fog ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} cry was repeated. It {{proceeded}} from the hut. I {{advanced to the}} window, took courage and peered in. By {{the light of a}} little brass oil lamp with a single wick I <b>could</b> faintly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> interior.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he aimed}} and slowly grew rigid. Helen {{could not take}} her fascinated eyes off him. He knelt, bareheaded, and in the shadow she <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> gleam of his {{clear-cut}} profile, stern and cold.|$|E
60|$|I knew no fear. My pulses throbbed and {{my heart}} beat ponderously but rapturously as I watched the vision growing more and more {{distinct}} until I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> pale face of ineffable sweetness and the veiled eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{could fight}} {{in their own}} way, and don't you forget it. But I guess you will not. They fought to kill, and, by what I <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> British fought to be killed. So both parties were accommodated.|$|E
60|$|The snoring {{got more}} {{distinct}} every minute, and {{sounded more like}} a tune: at last she <b>could</b> even <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> words, and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them.|$|R
60|$|Little stayed. Of {{course she}} <b>could</b> <b>make</b> nothing <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> barometer, and said so. Little smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "All there, {{the last}} I saw of it, barrin' a few inconsequential frills {{that a good}} eye <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> lacking from <b>the</b> landscape." ...|$|R
