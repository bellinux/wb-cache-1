25|$|To {{initiate}} parthenogenesis {{of swine}} oocytes, various methods exist to induce an artificial activation that mimics sperm entry, such as calcium ionophore treatment, microinjection of calcium ions, or electrical stimulation. Treatment with <b>cycloheximide,</b> a non-specific protein synthesis inhibitor, enhances parthenote development in swine presumably by continual inhibition of MPF/cyclin B. As meiosis proceeds, extrusion {{of the second}} polar is blocked by exposure to cytochalasin B. This treatment results in a diploid (2 maternal genomes) parthenote Parthenotes can be surgically transferred to a recipient oviduct for further development, but will succumb to developmental failure after ≈30 days of gestation. The swine parthenote placentae often appears hypo-vascular: see free image (Figure 1) in linked reference.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{identification}} of Cln3 and its function, accrued evidence indicated that such translational size sensing operated in yeast. First, {{it was confirmed that}} the total rate of protein synthesis per cell increases with growth, [...] a fundamental prerequisite for this model. It was later shown that treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor <b>cycloheximide</b> delayed Start in yeast, indicating that translation rate controlled Start. Finally, it was also shown that this delay occurred even with short pulses of <b>cycloheximide,</b> confirming that an unstable activating protein was required for Start.|$|E
5000|$|Scytalidium dimidiatum is a {{tinea pedis}} like {{infection}} resistant to most antifungals. it responds to <b>cycloheximide</b> ,so, {{it should be}} cultured in a medium free of <b>cycloheximide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cycloheximide</b> {{can be used}} as an {{experimental}} tool in molecular biology to determine the half-life of a protein. Treating cells with <b>cycloheximide</b> in a time-course experiment followed by Western blotting of the cell lysates for the protein of interest can show differences in protein half-life. <b>Cycloheximide</b> treatment provides the ability to observe the half-life of a protein without confounding contributions from transcription or translation.|$|E
50|$|The {{translational}} elongation freezing {{properties of}} <b>cycloheximide</b> {{are also used}} for ribosome profiling / translational profiling. Translation is halted via the addition of <b>cycloheximide,</b> and the DNA/RNA in the cell is then nuclease treated. The ribosome-bound parts of RNA can then be sequenced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cycloheximide</b> is a {{eukaryote}} {{protein synthesis}} inhibitor, {{produced by the}} bacterium Streptomyces griseus. <b>Cycloheximide</b> exerts its effect by interfering with the translocation step in protein synthesis (movement of two tRNA molecules and mRNA {{in relation to the}} ribosome), thus blocking translational elongation. <b>Cycloheximide</b> is widely used in biomedical research to inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells studied in vitro (i.e. outside of organisms). It is inexpensive and works rapidly. Its effects are rapidly reversed by simply removing it from the culture medium.|$|E

50|$|Bacterivores can {{sometimes}} {{be a problem in}} microbiology studies. For instance, when scientists seek to assess microorganisms in samples from the environment (such as freshwater), the samples will often be contaminated with bacterivores, which will interfere with the growing of bacteria for study. By adding <b>cycloheximide,</b> the bacterivores will be inhibited and the bacteria will grow normally. For bacteria adsorbed into sediment, 2g of <b>cycloheximide</b> per 100g of sediment needs to be added. For experiments with spores (for example spores of C. perfringens), {{it is not necessary to}} add <b>cycloheximide</b> to the samples.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cycloheximide</b> is {{a highly}} {{effective}} antibiotic with activity against mold, yeast, and phytopathogenic fungi, with lower activity against bacteria. It {{has been reported to}} inhibit the synthesis of both proteins and macromolecules, as well as affect apoptosis in eukaryotes.

5000|$|It {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} adapt phenotypically to several different antibiotics after exposure to a single drug, {{which makes it a}} good model for phenotypic multidrug resistance in lower eukaryotes. It has been shown to adapt to famous antibiotics like <b>cycloheximide,</b> trichodermin and amphotericin B. Cells adapted to <b>cycloheximide</b> particularly have been observed to be 40-times more resistant than non-adapted cells to the drug. These adapted cells have been studied to better understand their greater efficiency of membrane transport (efflux of drugs).|$|E

50|$|Protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors are a {{class of}} antibiotics, which prevent the production of new proteins by inhibiting the cell’s gene expression ("Protein synthesis inhibitors", PSI). They generally operate at the ribosomal level through various mechanisms that prevent the ribosome from completing translation (Vazquez, 1967). Protein synthesis inhibitors that work in prokaryotic cells are often used as clinically prescribed antibiotics, while those that act of eukaryotic cells have been adapted for research purposes. In research, commonly used PSI’s include anisomycin, <b>cycloheximide,</b> and puromycin - although the use of puromycin has stopped recently because of its toxic qualities and numerous side effects (Burka, Ballas, & Sabesin, 1975). Anisomycin has relatively high effectiveness in inhibiting protein synthesis and has a large effective time window (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012). <b>Cycloheximide</b> is frequently used in acute studies, because of its high level of inhibition and ease of reversibility (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012).|$|E
50|$|Due to {{significant}} toxic side effects, including DNA damage, teratogenesis, and other reproductive effects (including birth defects and toxicity to sperm), <b>cycloheximide</b> is generally used only in in vitro research applications, {{and is not}} suitable for human use as a therapeutic compound. Although {{it has been used}} as a fungicide in agricultural applications, this application is now decreasing as the health risks have become better understood.|$|E
50|$|Interest in the {{bioactivity}} of imide-containing compounds was {{sparked by}} the early discovery of the high bioactivity of the <b>Cycloheximide</b> as an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis in certain organisms. Thalidomide, famous for its adverse effects, is one result of this research. A number of fungicides and herbicides contain the imide functionality. Examples include Captan, which has been phased out because of its carcinogenic properties, and Procymidone.|$|E

[...] In addition, it has also been shown to have antiamnesia effects against a wide variety of memory impairing substances, including: ethanol, chlorodiazepoxide (Librium), scopolamine, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and <b>cycloheximide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dermatophyte {{test medium}} (DTM) is a {{specialized}} agar used in medical mycology. It {{is based on}} Sabouraud's dextrose agar with added <b>cycloheximide</b> to inhibit saprotrophic growth, antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth, and phenol red a pH indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a dermatophyte fungus, which utilizes nitrogenous material for preferred metabolism, producing alkaline by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize carbohydrates in the medium producing acidic by-products and no red color change.|$|E
50|$|In general, yeasts {{are grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on solid growth media or in liquid broths. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include potato dextrose agar or potato dextrose broth, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient agar, yeast peptone dextrose agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who cultivate yeast frequently use dried malt extract and agar as a solid growth medium. The antibiotic <b>cycloheximide</b> is sometimes added to yeast growth media to inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast species. This will change the yeast process.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, Barksdale {{was hired}} by the Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo MI, as a {{professional}} mycologist. While there, she discovered the chemical <b>cycloheximide</b> (trade name Actidione), an anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agent produced by the bacterium Streptomyces griseus. The chemical found initial use as a fungicide for plants affected by fungal pathogens, but is now primarily used for experimental purposes. In 1951, a year before leaving Upjohn, she became a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow at Stanford University. In 1952, she married microbiologist Lane Barksdale and left the Upjohn Company, after which she and her new husband spent a year conducting research projects in Paris.|$|E
