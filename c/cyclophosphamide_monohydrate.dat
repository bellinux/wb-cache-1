40|$|Physical {{properties}} {{pertinent to}} the solid phase of the monohydrate and anhydrate forms of cyclophosphamide were determined. <b>Cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> had a transition temperature of 47. 9 (DEGREES) C and a (DELTA) H(,fusion) of 6. 30 kcal/mol. The anhydrate form, which was different crystallographically from the monohydrate form, had a transition temperature of 51. 9 (DEGREES) C and a (DELTA) H(,fusion) of 5. 39 kcal/mol. ^ The dissociation pressure obtained from the dehydration isotherms at 21 (DEGREES) C, 25 (DEGREES) C, 30 (DEGREES) C and 35 (DEGREES) C gave a calculated (DELTA) H(,dissociation) of 13. 0 kcal/mol. The (DELTA) H(,association) was calculated as - 12. 0 kcal/mol. The hysteresis effect suggested that the mechanisms of dehydration and rehydration were different. ^ Analysis of DSC thermograms of samples from the dehydration process of <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> indicated that a simple eutectic mixture (melting point 41 (DEGREES) C) was present. The solid-liquid phase diagram showed a eutectic point at 0. 34 mole fraction of the monohydrate. The solid-liquid phase diagram constructed from the analysis of samples from the rehydration process of cyclophosphamide anhydrate showed similar results. ^ At a 21 (DEGREES) C and 0 % relative humidity, the kinetics of the dehydration of <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> followed Fickian diffusion. At 25 (DEGREES) C and above, the mechanism of dehydration changed because the temperature was approaching the melting point of the eutectic mixture. An increasing amount of atomic movement within the crystalline lattice at higher temperatures caused a greater escaping tendency of the water of crystallization. ^ Two mechanisms of rehydration for cyclophosphamide anhydrate were proposed. The first mechanism of rehydration involved the condensation of water {{onto the surface of}} the solid at higher humidity environments. Dissolution of the solid into the liquid was followed by the recrystallization of the monohydrate from solution. The second mechanism occurred in the absence of condensed water. Interaction of water molecules with cyclophosphamide molecules {{on the surface of the}} solid resulted in the conversion of crystalline form of anhydrate to the monohydrate. The lag time in the rehydration kinetics indicated that rehydration may have been initiated through a nucleation process. The extent of water penetration into the anhydrate solid was controlled by the rate of crystalline conversion to the monohydrate form from the anhydrate. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} acridineorange and Giemsastaining procedures for the fish erythrocyte micronucleusassay. The goal was to optimize the assay {{in the context of}} field watermonitoring. Fish (Carassius carassius) were exposed to a reference genotoxic agent, <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> 5 mg l− 1 for 2, 4, and 6 days before testing. Slides from each individual were scored using the two procedures. The results show that the assay was more sensitive when acridineorange was used. When slides were Giemsa stained, the presence of ambiguous artefacts, leading to false positives and increasing random variance, reduced the contrast between exposed and control samples. AcridineOrangestaining was then applied in the context of waterqualitymonitoring. Fish were exposed for 4 days to water sampled in two hydrological contexts: basal flow and spring flood. The results show that exposure to spring flood water in an agricultural stream can induce mutagenicity...|$|E
40|$|The new {{paradigm}} of personalized medicine is beginning to affect clinical practice. In particular, many of the advances in genomics and proteomics have made personalized screening and therapeutic inventions possible. On chip, cellomics approaches to screening and intervention are becoming more commonplace. Cancer therapies may benefit from the rise in 2 ̆ 7 -omics 2 ̆ 7 technologies. In addition, the availability of rapid screening data is crucial to mitigate cancer propagation and increase the possibility of patient recovery. This study is an endeavor to develop a cellomic anticancer drug screening process based on inkjet printing. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} inkjet based screening can reliably create isolated spots arrays at low volume (180 pl) and high throughput (213 spots/sec). Herein we study whether inkjet printing small volumes of anticancer drugs along with few cells has merit as a tool to fabricate cellomic chips. Inkjet printing has the potential to minimize drug use and maximize the use of cell biopsies. ^ Cells, from the hepatocellular carcinoma line HepG 2 and the epithelial cell line PHEC, were printed with an inkjet device and thus arrayed on a 96 -well plate for culture. The inkjet device was described before. At mean exponential proliferation rate, <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (Cytoxan) and dichloroacetate sodium (DCA) at standard chemotherapeutic concentrations in the range of 1 - 50 mM were printed at continuously increasing densities in order to expose cultures to a drug concentration gradient. Anticancer drugs were studied under two solvents by means of dimethyl sulfoxide and PBS. The printed volumes were in the nanoliter range accounting for 625 ± 20...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the generation}} of primed IgM and IgG antibody-forming cell precursors, and of helper T-cell populations, were analyzed in mice whose primary responses to high and low doses of SRBC were arrested at intervals by the immunosuppressive agents <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> and specific antibody. The extent to which immunological memory was established in these animals before blockade of the primary response was assessed by the hemolytic plaque assay following challenge 12 wk after priming. The presence of IgG B-memory cells and T-memory cells in suppressed mice was further investigated by the transfer into these animals of syngeneic SRBC-stimulated thymocytes or anti-θ-treated spleen cells. It {{was found that the}} progenitors of secondary IgM-synthesizing cells were primed almost immediately after injection of antigen, and that early blockade of the primary response resulted in a raised IgM response after challenge. On the other hand, priming for a secondary IgG response took at least 4 days, and was dose-dependent, although helper T populations for a secondary IgG response appeared 3 days after antigen injection. It appeared that both IgM and IgG memory cells may be considered as Y cells in terms of the X-Y-Z scheme of lymphocyte activation, but that the two populations are generated at different times after exposure to antigen. The size of either Y-cell population at any given time is dependent upon the amount of antigen available to provoke differentiation to antibody-forming Z cells, and the IgM Y-cell population in particular is likely to be depleted {{during the course of a}} normal 1 ° response. When IgM Y cells were maintained for long periods as a result of immunosuppression, their secondary antibody response was independent of the primed T cells necessary for a secondary IgG response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background IKK- 2 is an {{important}} regulator of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) which has been implicated in survival, proliferation and apoptosis resistance of lymphoma cells. In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of IKK- 2 impacts cell growth or cytotoxicity of selected conventional chemotherapeutic agents in non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s lymphoma. Two established model systems were used; Follicular (WSU-FSCCL) and Diffuse Large Cell (WSU-DLCL 2) Lymphoma, both of which constitutively express p-IκB. A novel, selective small molecule inhibitor of IKK- 2, ML 120 B (N-[6 -chloro- 7 -methoxy- 9 H-β-carbolin- 8 -yl]- 2 -methylnicotinamide) was used to perturb NF-κB in lymphoma cells. The growth inhibitory effect of ML 120 B (M) alone and in combination with <b>cyclophosphamide</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (C), doxorubicin (H) or vincristine (V) was evaluated in vitro using short-term culture assay. We also determined efficacy of the combination in vivo using the SCID mouse xenografts. Results ML 120 B down-regulated p-IκBα protein expression in a concentration dependent manner, caused growth inhibition, increased G 0 /G 1 cells, but did not induce apoptosis. There was no significant enhancement of cell kill in the M/C or M/H combination. However, there was strong synergy in the M/V combination where the vincristine concentration can be lowered by a hundred fold in the combination for comparable G 2 /M arrest and apoptosis. ML 120 B prevented vincristine-induced nuclear translocation of p 65 subunit of NF-κB. In vivo, ML 120 B was effective by itself and enhanced CHOP anti-tumor activity significantly (P = 0. 001) in the WSU-DLCL 2 -SCID model but did not prevent CNS lymphoma in the WSU-FSCCL-SCID model. Conclusions For the first time, this study demonstrates that perturbation of IKK- 2 by ML 120 B leads to synergistic enhancement of vincristine cytotoxicity in lymphoma. These results suggest that disruption of the NF-κB pathway is a useful adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy in lymphoma...|$|E
