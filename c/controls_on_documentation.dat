40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the introduction of an electronic nursing documentation system {{in a nursing home}} reduces the proportion of time nursing staff spend <b>on</b> <b>documentation,</b> and to use this information in evaluating the usefulness of the system in improving the work of nursing staff. Methods: An observational work sampling study was conducted in 2009 and 2010, 2 months before, and 3, 6 and 12 months after the introduction of an electronic nursing documentation system. An observer (ENM) used a work classification tool to record documentation activities being performed using paper and with a computer by nursing staff at particular times for periods of 5 days. Results: Three hundred and eighty three (383) activities were recorded before implementation of the electronic system, 472 activities at 3 months, 502 at 6 months, and 338 at 12 months after implementation. There {{was no significant difference between}} the proportion of time nursing staff spent <b>on</b> <b>documentation</b> 2 months before and 3 months after the implementation of the electronic system. Six months after implementation, the proportion of time <b>on</b> <b>documentation</b> increased significantly and after 12 months, settled back to original levels that were recorded in the paper-based system. Over half of the proportion of time <b>on</b> <b>documentation</b> at 6 and 12 months after implementation was spent <b>on</b> paper <b>documentation</b> tasks. Conclusion: Introduction of an electronic nursing documentation system did not reduce the proportion of time nursing staff spent <b>on</b> <b>documentation.</b> This may in part have been a result of the practice of documenting some information items on paper and others on a computer. To reduce the use of paper documentation or to achieve a paper-free documentation environment in this setting, an in-depth understanding of nursing staff’s information needs, and documentation workflow is necessary...|$|R

The objective of the study is to analyze the legislative innovations involved. The review of changes in documentation of accounting records is made. A comparative analysis of changes in the Regulation <b>on</b> <b>Documentation</b> of Accounting Records is made by sections: 1) General; 2) Primary documents; 3) Accounting records; 4) Correction of errors in primary documents and accounting records; 5) Organization of document circulation; 6) Storage of documents.

40|$|The {{passage and}} {{implementation}} of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was the most significant landmark legislation in securities regulation and corporate governance in the US since the SEC Act of 1934. In particular, Section 404 of the act requiring management assessment and assertion on the effectiveness of internal controls along with the requirement that the auditor attest to the assertion, has greatly impacted actuarial work processes for many actuaries. This paper discusses the implications of the Act for actuaries based on analysis of actuarial functions within insurance companies. Also discussed are the observed impacts within the industry to date. Based on these observations and experiences, an overview of a typical internal control framework is introduced. Impacts on Actuaries working in financial reporting are far reaching, as well are the risks created by the Act. On the other hand well designed and operated controls may serve to reinforce the professionalism of the Actuarial work product, reducing certain risks for Actuaries. In addition, there is an unrealized potential for the increased focus <b>on</b> <b>controls</b> and <b>documentation</b> to strengthen the integrity of results reported by insurers, leading to increased stability in loss reserve estimates...|$|R
