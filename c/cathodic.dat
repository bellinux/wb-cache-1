5|$|Niobium {{is used in}} {{arc welding}} rods for some {{stabilized}} grades of stainless steel and in anodes for <b>cathodic</b> protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated with platinum.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as <b>cathodic</b> depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the <b>cathodic</b> for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in <b>cathodic</b> protection (CP). For example, <b>cathodic</b> protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for <b>cathodic</b> protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, 6+, is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass {{paved the way for}} the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and <b>cathodic</b> protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
5|$|These data clearly {{indicate}} {{the stability of}} neutral ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is more}} readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a <b>cathodic</b> wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.|$|E
25|$|H. littorale has {{two types}} of {{hemoglobin}}, anodic and cathodic; anodic hemoglobin has a relatively low oxygen affinity and has marked Bohr effects, while <b>cathodic</b> hemoglobin lack significant pH effects. In H. littorale, <b>cathodic</b> hemoglobin has a pronounced reversed Bohr effect in which oxygen affinity increases with decreased pH. <b>Cathodic</b> hemoglobin has the purpose of safeguarding oxygen transport to tissues under hypoxic and acidotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cathodic</b> {{protection}} (CP) is {{a technique}} to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell. <b>Cathodic</b> protection systems are most commonly used to protect steel, and pipelines and tanks; steel pier piles, ships, and offshore oil platforms.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} requirement for optimum biofouling resistance {{is that the}} copper alloys should be freely exposed or electrically insulated from less noble alloys and from <b>cathodic</b> protection. Galvanic coupling to less noble alloys and <b>cathodic</b> protection prevent copper ion releases from surface films and therefore reduce biofouling resistance.|$|E
25|$|For larger structures, {{galvanic}} anodes cannot economically deliver enough {{current to}} provide complete protection. Impressed current <b>cathodic</b> protection (ICCP) systems use anodes {{connected to a}} DC power source (such as a <b>cathodic</b> protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires.|$|E
25|$|In {{graphite}} perchlorate, planar {{layers of}} carbon atoms are 794 picometers apart, separated by ClO4− ions. <b>Cathodic</b> reduction of graphite perchlorate {{is analogous to}} heating KC8, {{which leads to a}} sequential elimination of HClO4.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{bars are}} {{attached}} to various locations on steel ship hulls to render the ship hull <b>cathodic.</b> The zinc bars are replaced periodically. Other metals, such as magnesium, would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful metal.|$|E
25|$|Anodic {{protection}} impresses {{anodic current}} {{on the structure}} to be protected (opposite to the <b>cathodic</b> protection). It is appropriate for metals that exhibit passivity (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current {{over a wide range}} of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as solutions of sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have <b>cathodic</b> protection installed {{at the time of}} construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using <b>cathodic</b> protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is characterized by}} fast electrode kinetics, meaning that a sufficiently high current can be passed through the electrode with the 100% efficiency of the redox reaction (dissolution of the metal or <b>cathodic</b> deposition of the silver-ions). The reaction has been proven to obey these equations in solutions of pH values between 0 and 13.5.|$|E
25|$|Dissimilar buried metals such as {{copper and}} steel can {{function}} as the poles of a galvanic cell, using moist soil as the electrolyte. Stray direct currents in soil may counteract the anti-corrosion effect of a <b>cathodic</b> protection system. Design of high voltage direct current transmission systems must take care so that current flowing in the earth does not cause objectionable corrosion to buried objects such as pipelines.|$|E
25|$|A silver {{chloride}} electrode {{is a type}} of reference electrode, commonly used in electrochemical measurements. For environmental reasons it has widely replaced the saturated calomel electrode. For example, it is usually the internal reference electrode in pH meters and it is often used as reference in reduction potential measurements. As an example of the latter, the {{silver chloride}} electrode is the most commonly used reference electrode for testing <b>cathodic</b> protection corrosion control systems in sea water environments.|$|E
25|$|Pitting {{results when}} a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually {{as a result of}} de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes anodic, while part of the {{remaining}} metal becomes <b>cathodic,</b> producing a localized galvanic reaction. The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect {{due to the fact that}} it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of <b>cathodic</b> protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|Solar cells produce {{direct current}} {{electricity}} from sunlight {{which can be}} used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and <b>cathodic</b> protection of pipelines.|$|E
25|$|H-Piles are {{structural}} beams {{that are}} driven {{in the ground}} for deep foundation application. They can be easily cut off or joined by welding or mechanical drive-fit splicers. If the pile is driven into a soil with low pH value, {{then there is a}} risk of corrosion, coal-tar epoxy or <b>cathodic</b> protection can be applied to slow or eliminate the corrosion process. It is common to allow for an amount of corrosion in design by simply over dimensioning the cross-sectional area of the steel pile. In this way the corrosion process can be prolonged up to 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocenium salts are {{sometimes}} used as oxidizing agents, {{in part because}} the product ferrocene is fairly inert and readily separated from ionic products. Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the anodic direction (i.e. made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the <b>cathodic</b> direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication. Ferrocene is often used as an internal standard for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Hydro{{demolition}} is {{not used}} as much for demolition {{as it is for}} surface restoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the reinforcing steel has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound concrete and reinforcing bars (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete and maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to remove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to install a preventive <b>cathodic</b> protection system, or to remove concrete in structures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition does not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not introduce micro fractures.|$|E
25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and <b>cathodic</b> reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators. Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and <b>cathodic</b> corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|E

500|$|The main {{disadvantage}} {{of iron and}} steel is that pure iron, {{and most of its}} alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way, a cost amounting to over 1% of the world's economy. Painting, galvanization, passivation, plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by <b>cathodic</b> protection. The mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Italian doctor Luigi Galvani {{discovered}} in 1780 that connecting {{the spinal cord}} of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect [...] "animal electricity". The galvanic cell {{and the process of}} galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization, and <b>cathodic</b> protection.|$|E
500|$|The {{surveyed}} route crossed {{hundreds of}} streams and rivers. To cross these with the pipeline, engineers designed concrete [...] "jackets" [...] to surround the pipe and weight it down {{so it would}} sink {{to the bottom of}} the stream or river. Because oil is lighter than water, the pipeline would float without the concrete jackets. Dredging rivers and burying the pipeline in the streambed was not allowed due to environmental concerns. In several places—either out of fear of disturbing the river or because of the river's characteristics—pipeline bridges were constructed. The most notable of these are over the Yukon River and the Tanana River. To protect against corrosion in these wet environments, the pipeline was designed with <b>cathodic</b> protection.|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no technical means currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as <b>cathodic</b> as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{all animals}} {{have more than}} one kind of Hb present in the RBC. Multiple Hb isoforms (see isoforms) are {{particularly}} common in ectotherms, but especially in fish that are required to cope with both fluctutating temperature and oxygen availability. Hbs isolated from the European eel can be separated into anodic and <b>cathodic</b> isoforms. The anodic isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the <b>cathodic</b> lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance. [...] Several species of African cichlids raised from early stage development under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions were contrasted in an attempt to compare Hb isoforms. They demonstrated there were Hb isoforms specific to the hypoxia-raised individuals.|$|E
2500|$|A method {{commonly}} used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected.
