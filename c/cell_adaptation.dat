50|$|The RpoS gene in E. coli encodes sigma 38, a {{sigma factor}} which regulates stress {{response}} and {{acts as a}} transcriptional regulator for many genes involved in <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation.</b> At least three sRNAs, DsrA, RprA and OxyS, regulate the translation of RpoS. DsrA and RprA both activate RpoS translation by base pairing to a region in the leader sequence of the RpoS mRNA and disrupting formation of a hairpin which frees up the ribosome loading site. OxyS inhibits RpoS translation. DsrA levels are increased in response to low temperatures and osmotic stress, and RprA levels are increased in response to osmotic stress and cell-surface stress, therefore increasing RpoS levels {{in response to these}} conditions. Levels of OxyS are increased in response to oxidative stress, therefore inhibiting RpoS under these conditions.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{production}} of biopharmaceuticals commonly requires {{the use of}} serum-free medium, for safety and cost reasons. However, serum is essential to most mammalian cells growth, and its removal implies a very time-consuming process for <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Thus, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate different strategies for <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to serum-free medium. Three cell types were used to assess the impact of transfection on adaptation: one common CHO-K 1 cell line and two CHO-K 1 cells transfected with different technologies for antibody production. Cultures were started with a known cell concentration in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % serum. The effect of five combinations of supplements, that could support cells during adaptation, was tested. These supplements included insulin and trace elements (copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, sodium selenite, ammonium iron citrate, ferrous ammonium sulfate, ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride). A methodology of gradual adaptation was followed, consisting on sequential steps of serum reduction, after assuring good <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> from the previous step. After reaching 0. 625 % serum, medium was gradually switched to the chemically defined serum-free EX-CELL CHO DHFR- medium. It was observed that supplements influence <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to serum-free medium. Indeed, the combinations containing the trace element ammonium iron citrate gave the worst results, with cell death at 2. 5 % serum. In contrast, the combination of ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride proved to be the most favorable to the three cell lines. Comparing the cells, it seems that the ability to produce antibody and the transfection methodology used does not have a great impact on adaptation. During the study, some procedure details were identified as particularly important and should be carefully considered in the process of <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to serum-free medium. These include the use of a higher initial cell concentration that will allow the survival of an increased number of cells during the process; avoiding harsh procedures to the cells such as centrifugation and the use of enzymes (i. e. trypsin), due to a higher cell sensibility during adaptation; and to give enough time for a full <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> at each step...|$|E

While morphological and functional heterogeneity between individual islets exists, it is unknown whether regional differences in beta <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> occur. Therefore we investigated beta <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> throughout the pancreas in a model of high-fat diet (HFD) -induced insulin resistance in mice. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a HFD to induce insulin resistance, or control diet for 6 weeks. The pancreas was divided in a duodenal (DR), gastric (GR) and splenic (SR) region and taken for either histology or islet isolation. The capacity of untreated islets from the three regions to adapt in an extrapancreatic location was assessed by transplantation under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-treated mice. SR islets showed 70 % increased beta cell proliferation after HFD, whereas no significant increase was found in DR and GR islets. Furthermore, isolated SR islets showed twofold enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion after HFD, as compared with DR and GR islets. In contrast, transplantation of islets isolated from the three regions to an extrapancreatic location in diabetic mice led to a similar decrease in hyperglycemia and no difference in beta cell proliferation. HFD-induced insulin resistance leads to topologically heterogeneous beta <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> and is most prominent in the splenic region of the pancreas.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to neurons of the {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (LGN), neurons in the primary visual cortex (V 1) are selective for the direction of visual motion. Cortical direction selectivity could emerge from the spatiotemporal configuration of inputs from thalamic cells, from intracortical inhibitory interactions, or {{from a combination of}} thalamic and intracortical interactions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied the effect of adaptation (prolonged visual stimulation) on the direction selectivity of intracellularly recorded cortical neurons. It is known that adaptation selectively reduces the responses of cortical neurons, while largely sparing the afferent LGN input. Adaptation can therefore be used as a tool to dissect the relative contribution of afferent and intracortical interactions to the generation of direction selectivity. In both simple and complex <b>cells,</b> <b>adaptation</b> caused a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential (− 2. 5 mV, simple cells, − 0. 95 mV complex cells). In simple <b>cells,</b> <b>adaptation</b> in either direction only slightly reduced the visually evoked depolarization; this reduction was similar for preferred and null directions. In complex <b>cells,</b> <b>adaptation</b> strongly reduced visual responses in a direction-dependent manner: the reduction was largest when the stimulus direction matched that of the adapting motion. As a result, adaptation caused changes in the direction selectivity of complex cells: direction selectivity was reduced after preferred direction adaptation and increased after null direction adaptation. Because adaptation in the null direction enhanced direction selectivity rather than reduced it, it seems unlikely that inhibition from the null direction is the primary mechanism for creating direction selectivity...|$|R

Deep sequencing of murine norovirus (MuNoV) S 7 during serial passages in RAW 264. 7 cells showed that the frequencies of viral variants were altered more dynamically than previously reported.

In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN 1 was isolated, serially propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better elucidate the molecular basis of Vero <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> of variant PEDV strains, we sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN 1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200.

After comparison of the variation characteristic of classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of PEDV virus was associated with 9 ´ 26 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading frames (ORF) 1 a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF 3, 1 – 3 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences ’ synonymous mutations. The aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV.

Strain DA 1, a molecular clone of such a persistent strain, produces a prominent cytopathic effect in BHK- 21 cells but is less efficient at infecting L 929 cells. We cloned the cDNA of a derivative of virus DA 1, adapted to promote a rapid cytopathic effect in L 929 <b>cells.</b> <b>Adaptation</b> of the new variant (named KJ 6) to L 929 cells correlated with an enhanced viral entry rather than with an increased replication rate of the genome.

These two clusters of amino acids are precisely known to be part of neutralization epitopes. They also differentiate persistent from neurovirulent strains of Theiler's virus. Adaptation of the virus to L 929 cells was accompanied by attenuation of its virulence for the mouse.

As a consequence, the immature receptor activates extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which leads to apoptosis. On the other hand, in stable TDII–FGFR 3 cells receptor biosynthesis is restored and ERKs are activated from the cell surface. To identify potential mediators of <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the activated receptor we investigated gene products that are differently regulated in TDII and wild-type FGFR 3 cells. cDNA representational difference analysis reveals Sprouty 4 up regulation in the TDII–FGFR 3 cells.

Following osmotic shock, p 38 γ in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear hDlg, thereby causing dissociation of hDlg-PSF complexes. Moreover, hDlg and PSF bind different RNAs; in response to osmotic shock, p 38 γ causes hDlg-PSF and hDlg-RNA dissociation independently of its kinase activity. These findings identify a novel nuclear complex and suggest a previously unreported function of p 38 γ, which is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to osmolarity changes in the environment...|$|E

Tumors derived from these mutant cell lines are smaller and exhibit higher levels of apoptosis in hypoxic areas compared to tumors with an intact ISR.

However, the mechanisms that influence malignant progression have not been clearly elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that cells cultured under hypoxic/anoxic conditions and transformed cells in hypoxic areas of tumors activate a translational control program known as the integrated stress response (ISR). Here, we show that tumors derived from K-Ras-transformed Perk−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are smaller and exhibit less angiogenesis than tumors with an intact ISR. Furthermore, Perk promotes a tumor microenvironment that favors the formation of functional microvessels. These observations were corroborated by a microarray analysis of polysome-bound RNA in aerobic and hypoxic Perk+/+ and Perk−/− MEFs. This analysis revealed that a subset of proangiogenic transcripts is preferentially translated in a Perk-dependent manner; these transcripts include VCIP, an adhesion molecule that promotes cellular adhesion, integrin binding, and capillary morphogenesis. Taken with the concomitant Perk-dependent translational induction of additional proangiogenic genes identified by our microarray analysis, {{this study suggests that}} Perk plays a role in tumor <b>cell</b> <b>adaptation</b> to hypoxic stress by regulating the translation of angiogenic factors necessary for the development of functional microvessels and further supports the contention that the Perk pathway could be an attractive target for novel antitumor modalities...|$|E

Separation of 32 P-labeled inorganic phosphate from unreacted [gamma- 32 P]ATP by thin-layer chromatography enabled us to measure the liberation of as little as 0. 1 fmol phosphate. To distinguish the Mg(2 +) -ATPase activity of myosin isozymes from that of other hair-bundle enzymes, we inhibited the interaction of hair-bundle myosin with actin and determined the reduction in ATPase activity.

The electron scanning microscopy showed that <b>cells</b> depicted several <b>adaptations</b> to growth on hydrocarbons, such as biopolymeric spheres with embedded cells distributed over different layers on the spherical surfaces and cells linked to each other by extracellular appendages. Electron transmission microscopy revealed transparent inclusions, which were associated with hydrocarbon based-culture cells. These patterns of hydrocarbon biodegradation and <b>cell</b> <b>adaptations</b> depended on the substrate bioavailability, type and length of hydrocarbon...|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{biochemical}} mechanism of bacterial chloride resistance, few studies are available particularly on acidophiles. A recent study showed that NaCl stress in the moderate thermophiles Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus caldus is tackled by <b>cell</b> membrane <b>adaptation</b> and potential osmoprotectant aminoacid accumulation (Zammit et al. [2012]), giving an insight on specific chloride resistance genes.|$|R
40|$|Many {{natural and}} {{technological}} systems fail {{to adapt to}} changing external conditions and move to a different state if the conditions vary too fast. Such "non-adiabatic" processes are ubiquitous, but little understood. We identify these processes with a new nonlinear phenomenon [...] -an intricate threshold where a forced system fails to adiabatically follow a changing stable state. In systems with multiple time-scales such thresholds are generic, but non-obvious, meaning they cannot be captured by traditional stability theory. Rather, the phenomenon can be analysed using concepts from modern singular perturbation theory: folded singularities and canard trajectories, including composite canards. Thus, non-obvious thresholds should explain the failure {{to adapt to a}} changing environment {{in a wide range of}} multi-scale systems including: tipping points in the climate system, regime shifts in ecosystems, excitability in nerve <b>cells,</b> <b>adaptation</b> failure in regulatory genes, and adiabatic switching in technology.
