And herein I think {{lies the}} chief, {{if not the}} only reason, why {{the male and female}} in mankind are tied to a longer {{conjunction}} than other creatures, viz. because the female is capable of conceiving, and de facto is commonly with child again, and brings forth too a new birth, long before the former is out of a dependency for support on his parents help, and able to shift for himself, and has all the assistance is due to him from his parents: whereby the father, who is bound to take care for those he hath begot, is under an obligation to continue in conjugal society with the same woman longer than other creatures, whose young being able to subsist of themselves, before the time of procreation returns again, the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> dissolves of itself, and they are at liberty, till Hymen at his usual anniversary season summons them again to chuse new mates. Wherein one cannot but admire the wisdom of the great Creator, who having given to man foresight, and an ability to lay up for the future, as well as to supply the present necessity, hath made it necessary, that society of man and wife should be more lasting, than of male and female amongst other creatures; that so their industry might be encouraged, and their interest better united, to make provision and lay up goods for their common issue, which uncertain mixture, or easy and frequent solutions of conjugal society would mightily disturb.|$|E

They are divided into four orders,--the Brahmins, the Chittery, the Bice, and the Soodur, with many subdivisions in each. An eternal barrier is placed between them. The higher cannot pass into the lower; the lower cannot rise into the higher. They have all their appropriated rank, place, and situation, and their appropriated religion too, which is essentially different in its rites and ceremonies, sometimes in its object, {{in each of those}} castes. A man who is born in the highest caste, which at once unites what would be tantamount in this country to the dignity of the peerage and the ennobled sanctity of the episcopal character,--the Brahmin, who sustains these characters, if he loses his caste, does not fall into an inferior order, the Chittery, the Bice, or the Soodur, but he is thrown at once out of all ranks of society. He is precipitated from the proudest elevation of respect and honor to a bottomless abyss of contempt,--from glory to infamy,--from purity to pollution,--from sanctity to profanation. No honest occupation is open to him; his children are no longer his children; their parent loses that name; the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> is dissolved. Few survive this most terrible of all calamities. To speak to an Indian of his caste is to speak to him of his all.|$|E

The paper {{considered}} {{the course of}} moderniz-ing in the global community, and dynamic changes in-curred to the contemporary society that entailed urgency to optimize rational control over the structural changes in society {{in order to secure}} sustainability of social evolu-tion. All these have urged to reconsider relevance of the family as a fundamental social institution and a form of communal life that ensures reproduction of public life. The authors focused their attention primarily to the atti-tude survey of inhabitants of the Urals Federal District on the standing of contemporary families and challenges they face.

40|$|Returning to a {{question}} raised by M. V. Lee Badgett in {{the first issue of}} Feminist Economics, this paper traces the persistence of heteronormativity in feminist economics to assumptions that kinship is organized around <b>conjugal</b> <b>bonds.</b> These assumptions let “the family” stand automatically for a husband, wife, and their children. “Heteronormativity” is not a synonym for heterosexual privilege, but rather names tacit conceptions about what is socially normal, conceptions that make it possible to think of heterosexuals or homosexuals as essential categories of people. Critique of heteronormativity makes visible a pattern of state repression that makes proper citizens by opposing them to improper ones, a process that simultaneously shapes gender, sexuality, citizenship, and race. Such critique opens the opportunity to better understand gender, integrate scholarship on lesbians and gays, link gender analysis more directly to racializing processes, and reopen the category of heterosexuality.

They further averred that we hoed up whole acres of Indian corn and other crops, and drew the earth carefully about the weeds; and that we raised five hundred tufts of burdock, mistaking them for cabbages; and that by dint of unskilful planting few of our seeds ever came up at all, or, if they did come up, it was stern-foremost; and that we {{spent the better part of}} the month of June in reversing a field of beans, which had thrust themselves out of the ground in this unseemly way. They quoted it as nothing more than an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or three fingers, of a morning, by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter. Finally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these mendacious rogues circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated, to the last man, by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own scythes! and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident.|$|E

Part III deals with quantum properties of the brain and nonlocality. The evidence has been cited how brain can behave as a macro-quantum object and participate in nonlocal communication. The far-reaching implications of nonlocal communication in exploring some special functions of the brain have been narrated. Application of the concept of nonlocality in the process of evolution has been described in Part IV. It seems to fill up various explanatory gaps still present in various theories of evolution.

40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivos: verificar os níveis de afetividade e de conflito nas díades pai-mãe, pai-filho, (subsistema parental), identificar a ocorrência de sintomas depressivos, problemas comportamentais e cognitivos nas crianças de 9 a 11 anos, identificar sintomas depressivos nos pais e mães, buscar compreender a história de vida do pai e da mãe em suas famílias de origem, descrever a percepção que pai/marido e mãe/esposa têm do alcoolismo e suas conseqüências para as relações familiares. Participaram deste estudo quatorze famílias cujo pai era alcoolistas e tinham filhos na faixa etária entre 9 e 11 anos. Os critérios de inclusão do grupo foram: pai alcoolista com diagnóstico de dependência de álcool, isto de acordo com a décima versão da Classificação Internacional de Doenças (CID- 10) para transtornos mentais e comportamentais devidos ao uso de álcool, intoxicação aguda (F. 10. 0), e com eventuais co-morbidades, por exemplo: tabagismo, depressão e ansiedade. E tivesse no mínimo cinco anos de convivência com a esposa e os filhos. Os pais deveriam ter vínculo {{conjugal}} (oficial ou consensual). As crianças não deveriam apresentar déficits sensoriais e neurológicos evidente, históricos de ferimento na cabeça, ainda, não estarem em atendimento psicológico e /ou psiquiátrico e não terem histórico de uso ou de dependência química. A mãe não deveria apresentar dependência de álcool e drogas, podendo ser incluído mãe tabagista. Os instrumentos utilizados foram: roteiro de identificação familiar, Familiograma, Genograma e roteiro sobre o histórico de alcoolismo. Os instrumentos para avaliação das variáveis pessoais da criança foram: Escala Comportamental Infantil A 2 de Rutter (ECI), Inventário de Depressão Infantil (IDI), Matrizes Progressivas Coloridas de Raven. Para avaliar sinais de depressão nos pais e mães foi utilizado o Inventário de Beck de Depressão. A coleta de dados foi realizada por meio de três visitas para as famílias, com horário e dia marcados com os pais. Os resultados revelaram: a percepção de mais afetividade na relação mãe e filho e mais conflito na relação conjugal, sugerindo que existe mais proximidade entre mãefilho e distanciamento na relação pai-filho. A história da família de origem dos pais revelou que os mesmos foram filhos de pais alcoolistas e tiveram um relacionamento mais próximo com suas mães e distante com seus pais. Ao correlacionar o nível de afetividade de mães com seus filhos e com a presença de sintomas de depressão e problemas de comportamento observa-se que quanto mais afetividade o filho percebe em sua relação com a mãe menos sinais de depressão ele apresenta e menos sinais de problemas de comportamento. Pesquisar as relações de famílias alcoolistas pode contribuir para identificar as variáveis familiares que estão interferindo nesse percurso, planejar projetos de intervenções que incluam a família auxiliando o paciente alcoolista a restabelecer sua vida familiar e, conseqüentemente, diminuir as chances desta criança de desenvolver uma dependência. The {{present study}} aimed {{to verify the}} levels of affection and conflict in fathermother and father-son dyads (parental subsystem); to identify the occurrence of depressive symptoms, behavioral and cognitive problems in children from 9 to 11 years old; to identify depressive symptoms in their fathers and mothers {{as well as to}} understand the fatherś and motherś life history in their original families, to describe the perception that father/husband and mother/wife have about alcoholism and its consequences to the families relations. Participated from this study fourteen families whose father was alcoholics and their children. The inclusion criteria were: alcoholic father with diagnostic of the alcohol dependence according to the tenth version from the diagnostic criterion- CID 10 - Disease International Classification for mental and behaviors disorders due to use of alcohol (F. 10. 0) and eventual comorbities, for example, smoking, depression and anxiety; with children from 9 to 11 years old and had in the minimum five years of living together with the wife and the children; the parents must have <b>conjugal</b> <b>bonds</b> (official or consensus). The children could not have sensorial neurological disorders and history of the head injuries and were not attending psychological and/ or psychiatry treatment and did not have historical of using chemical dependence. The mother should not show dependence from alcohol and drugs, could be included tobacco user mother. The instruments were: family identification guide, Familiogram, Genogram and an interview guide about history of alcohol consumption. The instruments to assess personal characteristics of the children were: Child Behavioral Scale A 2, Infant Depression Inventory (IDI), Ravensś Coloured Progressive Matrices. To evaluate depressive symptoms in fathers and mothers it was used the Beck Depression Inventory. Data were collected by means of three home visits to the families, with time and day scheduled with the parents. Results showed that the subjects of the present study perceived more affectivity in mother-child relationship and more conflict in father-mother relationship. The family history showed that the parents were themselves children of alcoholics and had a closer relationship with their mothers and a distant relationship with their fathers. Comparing the level of affectivity of mothers with their children and child depressive symptoms and behavioral problems revealed that the more affectivity in mother-child relationship the less behavioral and depressive symptoms in the child. Understanding the family members relationships can contribute to identify family characteristics that {{play a significant role in}} alcoholics families and help in family intervention planning to restore family life and prevent children to become alcoholics...|$|R

Specifically, it examines factors that might be responsible for the acceptance of contraception and an expressed desire for {{a relatively small number of}} children among the Pare of Northern Tanzania. It is hypothesized that with the increasing shift towards wage labor and diminishing dependence on land and lineage relations, there is a growing reliance on the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> and the development of a partnership marriage in which husbands and wives perceive their interests as mutual. This facilitates communication, particularly about family planning. Research methodology consisted of a two-pronged approach and combined an intensive ethnographic study of the households in the Ugweno District of the Pare mountains with individual surveys administered to a sample of 512 women and in-depth interviews conducted with 20 women regarding the value of children and contraceptive and birth histories. fertility decline contraception social organization <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how different patterns of kinship and inheritance affect intergenerational relationships and {{the ramifications of}} gender inequality. Peasant societies of pre-industrial Northern Europe are contrasted with those of contemporary South Asia to illuminate some of these relationships. While Northern European kinship and inheritance systems made for high status in youth {{and a loss of}} power and status as people aged, South Asian systems make for lower power and status in youth and a rise as people age. From this follow more conflict-ridden relationships between the generations and a stronger <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> in Northern Europe, while in South Asia intergenerational ties are strong and the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> is weak. This in turn leads to a greater potential for marginalizing women in South Asia, although gender inequality exists in both settings. The convergence of low autonomy due to youth as well as sex amongst young married women in South Asia means that women are at the lowest point in their life cycle in terms of autonomy during their peak childbearing years. As shown in this paper, this has considerable implications for demographic and health outcomes: in terms of poorer child survival, slower fertility decline, and poorer reproductive health. In recent decades, a great deal has been written in the social sciences on the subject of female status and autonomy in both developed and developing country settings. A subset of this literature has specifically pointed out some of the negative demographic consequences of low female autonomy. In particular, low levels of female education and autonomy have been perceived to be barriers to improving child survival and reducing fertility. Much of this literature focuses on the low status of women relative to that of males. Yet there is also a large body of evidence, especially in the anthropological literature, that a woman’s status rises and falls over her life cycle. Several studies highlight the fact that in some societies, women have higher status when they are younger, while in others it is whe...|$|E

40|$|Child {{adoption}} {{in the face}} of reproduction gone awry continues to remain an under researched aspect of contemporary Indian reality. This paper seeks to unpack some of the critical cultural issues underscoring the deep-seated reluctance towards adoption. Drawing on a larger multi-sited research project examining the experience of infertility and assisted conception in India, the paper sheds light on the state of current adoption practices in India. Thus, when faced with infertility, couples in this research emerged as favouring secret gamete donation as a means of bypassing infertility rather than the option of adoption. Invoking the concept of systematic misrecognition, the paper situates the modalities of salvaging infertility, either through medically assisted conception or adoption, as structuring infertile people's quest for children. The paper relates the perceived stigma associated with infertility treatment and adoption with the inclusion of a "third party" that fractures the culturally conceptualized boundaries of family as inextricably tied to the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond.</b> It is therefore argued that secrecy is born out of a need to obfuscate a "public and visible" violation of a culturally priced ideal that views an intimate connection between the "married body" and the progeny. Adoption continues to remain an undesirable option because the links between an adopted child and the social parent become a public, vocal, and visible admission of infertility that cannot be subsumed, like donated gamete conception, under a conspiracy of silence.

40|$|This {{research}} {{comes in}} the wake of increasing interest in men's roles in childbearing decisions in sub-Saharan Africa. While some of the findings indicate that men tend to hinder fertility decline, we aimed to identify which men desire fewer children, under what circumstances, and why. The research was done in a Pare community in Northern Tanzania. It is our hypothesis that differences in men's fertility desires and decisions are to be sought {{in the context of their}} conjugal union. This paper, based on data from a case study from two Pare villages, attempts to examine the relationship between male attitudes toward reproduction and marital relations. The methodology consisted of a combination of an ethnographic study and in-depth interviews. A subsequent survey, the questions for which were derived from the qualitative work, was administered in order to verify the generalisability of the findings of the qualitative work. Findings show that those men who desire fewer children are younger, educated at least to the primary and often to the secondary level, their wives have also completed at least primary school, they are more affluent, and they are likely to be Christian. They are in a marital relationship where the partners chose each other, they communicate with their wives about important issues, and make joint decisions, including the number of children they should have. The discussion relates the differences in the marital patterns and fertility preferences to differences in the life plans of Christians and Muslims in this community.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{widespread}} evidence one can deduce that the arguments that are put forward to sustain the indissolubility of marriage on {{the basis of}} a purely civil legislation are not conclusive. In other words, although on the natural plane one must attribute to marriage a marked stability because of the ends of the institution, the absolute indissolubility of the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> springs only from its value as a sacramento The present study, however, in keeping with the constant teaching of the Church, wishes to demonstrate that the stability and the indissolubility of the union form part of the very logic of the institution that we call marriage, and are sine qua non conditions in order to realize its ends. To this purpose the author examines the Thomistic doctrine of marriage and, among other things, draws attention to its extraordinary present-day relevance: leaving aside arguments or a dogmatic or theological nature, the indissolubility of the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> can be demonstrated by pure reason. Such a rational process is a fundamental characteristic of the Natural Law, which includes the norm that prohibits the dissolution of marriage. The author starts from the position that marriage is a society, voluntary in its origin but natural in its ends; firstly he demonstrates that marriage has an institutional nature which gives rise to an immunity from changes made by the contracting parties in the fundamental norms that enable it to achieve its aims; and secondly he examines these ends in detail. The pro-creation of the children, together with their rearing and education, is the principal end of marriage and presupposes a stable permanent union, because it cannot be achieved in the space of a few years. The same can be said of the other end, that which has to do with the other partner: the mutual help and reciprocal love between husband and wife, and which once promised cannot be revoked, in the same way as the full gift of self which the partners made to each other on their wedding day cannot be withdrawn, as it is contrary to the very nature of the gift. And also the good of society demands the stability and permanence of the bond, over and above those examples that, in the many phenomena drawn from social circumstances, represent individual cases and special personal conditions. The indissolubility derives from the very internal logic of marriage and not from external sources; for this reason, therefore, one speaks of intrinsic indissolubility. And from its rational nature it follows that this norm can be known to all men quite apart from being a revealed truth. It is also worth while pointing out that the natural law that prescribes the indissolubility of marriage should not be considered primary, but rather secondary, natural law. This explains why this law has not always been observed in many cases in the history of mankind (quite apart from considerations of the ontological and psychological insufficiencies of the natural law that weaken its rationality). And it also explains why the natural law needs to be expounded by the Church in the Iight of revealed truth. One may conclude, with Maritain, that the natural law, nowadays under study again after the excesses of juridical positivism, will not achieve full relevance until the Gospel has penetrated the deepest recesses of the human spirit...|$|E
40|$|A cerimônia religiosa do casamento é um dos antigos ritos de passagem, remanescente na sociedade contemporânea, apesar do crescente número de uniões livres, em que o vínculo {{conjugal}} se forma sem a intervenção da Igreja ou do Estado. Este ritual parece sobreviver na atualidade e envolver psicologicamente os noivos e suas famílias de origem, marcando transição individual, familiar e social. Para a Psicologia Junguiana, os rituais e, especialmente, os ritos de passagem podem proporcionar um renascimento psicológico e consequente ampliação da personalidade. Na perspectiva do ciclo de vida familiar, as mudanças assinaladas pelos ritos de passagem, incluindo o casamento, não afetam apenas o indivíduo o qual se submete ao rito, mas sua família inteira, provocando um aumento do estresse familiar nestes períodos. Este ritual marca outros desafios que não só as famílias, mas os noivos, como casal e separadamente, terão de superar no intuito de constituir uma terceira família, como, por exemplo, formar um sistema conjugal. Este estudo teve como objetivos compreender as vivências subjetivas do casal durante o período de transição que antecede e sucede a cerimônia de casamento; compreender os relacionamentos familiares e conjugais do casal durante este período, bem como os noivos percebem a mudança dos vínculos conjugal e familiares; identificar temas arquetípicos vivenciados pelos noivos e avaliar a existência de comportamentos que possam ser compreendidos como de caráter iniciatório. Para isso, foram realizadas entrevistas narrativas com cada casal em períodos regulares imediatamente antes e após o casamento, seguidas de análise temática. Participaram do estudo cinco casais de classe média e alta que se casaram com a celebração de cerimônia católica e festa. Dividiu-se a análise e discussão dos resultados em duas partes. Na primeira, enfocaram-se as entrevistas dos cinco casais. Esta análise sinalizou a existência de uma divisão em papéis de gênero no que concerne aos preparativos para o ritual de casamento e divisão de tarefas no início da vida de casados, a ênfase na separação das famílias de origem sentida pelas noivas e a percepção dos noivos de que o casamento assinala uma mudança em suas vidas. Na segunda parte, abordou-se a história de cada casal em separado, enfocando mudanças familiares, conjugais e individuais expressivas, tanto nos homens quanto nas mulheres. Os resultados apontam para a permanência da cerimônia de casamento como rito de passagem na contemporaneidade e para a possibilidade de o mesmo constituir-se num arcabouço arquetípico iniciatório. The {{wedding ceremony}} {{is one of}} the old rites of passage, remaining in contemporary society in spite of an increasing number of free unions where the <b>conjugal</b> <b>bond</b> constitutes itself without intervention of Church or State. This ritual seems to survive currently and involve the engaged couple and their family of origin psychologically, marking a individual, familiar and social transition. For Analytical Psychology, rituals and, specifically, the rites of passage, can propitiate a psychological rebirth and consequent personality development. In the family life cycle perspective, the changes marked by the rites of passage, including marriage, affect not only the person who submits himself to the rite, but also his hole family, causing an increase of familiar stress in these periods.
