5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> avoid decay, and (3) the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
