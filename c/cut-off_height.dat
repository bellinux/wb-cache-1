50|$|The Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award was {{an annual}} college {{basketball}} award in the United States intended to honor shorter-than-average players who excelled {{on the court}} despite their size. The award, {{named in honor of}} James Naismith's daughter-in-law, was established for men in 1969 and for women in 1984. The men's award was presented to the nation's most outstanding senior who is 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) or shorter, while the women's award was presented to the top senior who is 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) or shorter. Early in the women's award's history, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>height</b> was 5 ft. The men's award was selected by a panel from the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), while the women's was selected by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). The award was discontinued following the 2013-14 season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{perform a}} {{computational}} {{investigation of the}} optical properties of nanoscale gold ‘semi-shells ’ and show how additional plasmon resonances develop as the shape is successively mutated from ‘nanoshell ’ to ‘nano-cup’, ‘half shell ’ and finally to ‘nano-cap’. The effects of aspect ratio, surface roughness and <b>cut-off</b> <b>height</b> are explored. Of special interest is a new longitudinal resonance that generates an electric current loop. We predict that this will induce an orthogonal magnetic component that will sum with the magnetic component of incident light at certain orientations. Exploitation of this phenomenon in an ordered array of semi-shells may produce anomalous optical effects due to an altered magnetic permeability...|$|E
40|$|Cut-off {{importance}} sampling (CIS) {{is introduced}} {{as a means}} of sampling individual trees for the purpose of estimating bole volume. The novel feature of this variant of importance sampling is the establishment on the bole of a <b>cut-off</b> <b>height,</b> HC, above which sampling is precluded. An estimator of bole volume between predetermined heights HL and HU > HC is proposed, and its design-based bias and mean square error are derived. In an application of CIS as the second stage of a two-stage sample to estimate aggregate bole volume, the gain in precision realized from CIS more than offset its bias when compared to the precision of importance sampling when HC = HU...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Meteor head echo {{altitude}} distributions {{have been}} derived from data collected with the EISCAT VHF (224 MHz) and UHF (930 MHz) high-power, large-aperture (HPLA) radars. At the high-altitude end, the distributions cut off abruptly {{in a manner}} reminiscent of the trail echo height ceiling effect observed with classical meteor radars. The target dimensions are shown to be much smaller than both the VHF and the UHF probing wavelengths, but the <b>cut-off</b> <b>heights</b> for the two systems are still clearly different, the VHF cutoff being located several km above the UHF one. A single-collision meteor-atmosphere interaction model is used to demonstrate that meteors in the (1. 3 – 7. 2) µg mass range will ionise such that critical electron density at 224 MHz is first reached at or around the VHF cutoff altitude and crit-ical density at 930 MHz will be reached at the UHF cutoff altitude. The observed seasonal variation in the cutoff alti-tudes is {{shown to be a}} function of the seasonal variation of atmospheric density with altitude. Assuming that the elec-tron density required for detection is in the order of the crit-ical density, the abrupt altitude cutoffs can be explained {{as a consequence of the}} micrometeoroid joint size-speed distribu-tion dropping off so fast at the large-mass, high-velocity end that above a certain altitude the number of detectable events becomes vanishingly small. Conversely, meteors at the low-mass end of the distribution will be gradually retarded such that the ionisation they generate never reaches critical den-sity. These particles will remain unobservable...|$|R

30|$|We {{observed}} tweeks at Tay Nguyen university, Vietnam (Geog. 12.65 ° N, 108.02 ° E) during winter, equinox, {{and summer}} seasons of 2013 {{to calculate the}} <b>cut-off</b> frequency, reflection <b>height,</b> and electron density of the D-region ionosphere. From these parameters, we evaluate the morphology of this region. Our survey site is at low latitudes around the equatorial region, which is near the Asia Oceanic Region; hence, the lightning density is very high. This creates favorable opportunities to study the turbulence of the D-region using the ELF-VLF waves radiated by lightning. Furthermore, the observation period is during the high solar activity year of the solar cycle 24, which we expect that the D-region perturbs much more violently. We present our experiment and data analysis method in section “Experimental data and analysis”. In section “Results and discussion”, we will discuss the results obtained over the year 2013 and compare them with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI- 2012) model. Finally, we draw out conclusion in section “Conclusions”.|$|R
40|$|Mid-upper-arm {{circumference}} (MUAC) {{based on}} a single cut-off value for all the children less than 5 years of age {{has been used for}} many years as an alternative nutritional status index for children during famines or refugee crises, and as an additional screening tool in nonemergencies. However, it has recently been questioned whether MUAC is age- and sex-independent. After reviewing the scientific evidence underlying the use and interpretation of MUAC, a WHO Expert Committee recommended a new MUAC-for-age reference for under- 5 -year-olds. In some settings, however, it is difficult to assess a child's age and in such circumstances MUAC-for-height may be a good alternative. The height-based QUAC stick is a simple means of adjusting MUAC <b>cut-offs</b> according to <b>height,</b> and the MUAC-for-height reference and the construction and use of the QUAC stick are described in this article. Described also is the use of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method to evaluate the performance of MUAC, MUAC-for-age, and MUAC-for-height in screening malnourished children...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To assess radiologists {{reporting}} {{rates of}} incidental vertebral compression fractures in imaging studies. METHODS: We performed {{a review of}} the current literature on the prevalence and reporting rates of incidental vertebral compression fractures in radiologic examinations. RESULTS: The bibliographic search revealed 12 studies: 7 studies using conventional radiology and 5 using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). The loss of <b>height</b> <b>cut-off</b> to define a vertebral fracture varied from 15 % to 25 %. Fracture prevalence was high (mean 21. 1 %; range 9. 5 %- 35 %) in both radiographic and MDCT studies (mean 21. 6 % and 20. 2 %, respectively). Reporting rates were low with a mean value of 27. 4 % (range 0 %- 66. 3 %) and were significantly lower in MDCT than in radiographic studies (mean 8. 1 % vs 41. 1 %). Notably, recent studies showed lower reporting rates than older studies. CONCLUSION: Many scientific studies have confirmed a high prevalence of vertebral compression fractures as incidental findings on imaging studies. However, the underreporting of these fractures, as determined in our study, may negatively affect patient care...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We propose an {{analytic}} {{calculation of}} the dark current density for GaAs/A 1 GaAs thick barrier quantum well infrared photo-detectors (QWIP's). We evaluate the dark current component, by integrating (a) drift velocity of the carriers via their kinetic energy (b) the non-tunneling probability factor 1 -T (E) (c) the Fermi factor and (d) the 3 -d density of states (DOS) of the multiple quantum well structure. We find that the dark currents depend on the temperature T, applied bias Vb, aluminum molar ratio (and hence barrier <b>height)),</b> <b>cut-off</b> energy) E=Ec-EF and peak wavelength according Incorporation of superlattices in infrared photodetectors leads to a T 3 / 2 term, {{which is due to}} the 2 -dimensional electronic gas (2 DEG) of the wells. We find that dark thermionic current densities (a) increase dramatically with temperature under fixed bias levels (42 mA/cm 2 at 80 °K & 30 mV and 1. 512 A/cm 2 at 100 °K & 30 mV) (b) increase with applied voltage at fixed temperatures (e. g. 0. 0018 A/cm 2 to 0. 7445 A/cm 2 at 80 °K, from 10 mV to 50 mV), both at peak wavelengths of 10 µm...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} {{impact of a}} Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplement (LNS) and an Improved Dry Ration (IDR) in blanket supplementary feeding programs.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the connection between school-age children's obesity and that of their parents as well as between child obesity and parents' educational level, as a proxy indicator of the socio-economic status (SES) of families in Tuscany. Methods The children sample was selected from " OKkio alla Salute 2010 " (a cross sectional survey carried out by the Italian Institute of Health) and consisted of 1, 751 (922 males and 855 females) 8 - 9 year-old school children. Weight and height were measured by ad hoc trained personnel, and Body Mass Index (BMI) categories were calculated using Cole et al. 's <b>cut-off.</b> Parents' weight, <b>height</b> and educational level were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. The educational levels were classified as high, medium and low.

The subjects were divided into five age groups: early childhood (2 - 5 years), middle childhood (6 - 9 years), late childhood (10 - 12 years), early adolescence (13 - 16 years) and late adolescence (17 - 19 years). Body mass indices (BMI) were calculated as ‘weight(kg) /height(m) 2 ’; body weights were defined using CDC age- and sex-specific BMI <b>cut-offs.</b> Weights and <b>heights</b> of subjects increased proportionately with age, indicative of a progressive growth pattern. Abnormal body weights occurred in 22. 4 % of the subjects (underweight, 9. 0 %; overweight, 9. 1 %; obesity, 4. 3 %). Weight abnormality reduced as the age of subjects increased; it was 43. 8, 31. 1, 20. 0, 19. 5 and 17. 7 %, respectively for early childhood, middle childhood, late childhood, early adolescence and late adolescence. Underweight occurred most in early childhood while overweight and obesity peaked at middle childhood. Weight deficiency was higher in males (10. 4 %) than females (7. 9 %) whereas weight excess was 12. 6 % in males and 13. 9 % in females. The study showed that weight deficiency and weight excess co-exist in School children and adolescents in Ota, Nigeria. Whereas weight deficiency due to under-nutrition prevailed in early childhood, weight excess resulting from over-nutrition was more prevalent in the older children and adolescents...|$|R

Methods: cross-sectional study with all children (n= 271) less than 36 months of age who attended public day care centers in mid- 1997. Children were evaluated as to their hemoglobin levels (venous blood, analyzed at the Central State Laboratory) and anthropometric indicators (weight/age, height/age, weight/height). Results: a high prevalence (63 %) of anemia associated with age, weight and height deficit, and time of admittance at kindergarten was observed. The prevalence of malnutrition was 0. 8 % according to the weight/height ratio, 5. 0 % according to weight/age deficit, and showed an inadequacy of 10. 3 % as to the height/age ratio. Thus, the percentage of anemic children was six times higher than the height deficit and twelve times higher than the weight deficit.
