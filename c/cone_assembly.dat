40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our recent}} {{efforts in the}} integration of thick plate polycrystalline chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond into Stationary Plasma Thruster channel for improved wear resistance. Prior tests on laboratory Hall discharges indicated that CVD diamond has significant erosion resistance compared to the more commonly used boron nitride ceramics. Here, we extend our studies further, and have designed and have carried out preliminary tests of a diamond replacement nose cone on a commercial, space-qualified, BHT- 200 low power Hall thruster. A preliminary performance test verified that {{the introduction of the}} diamond nose cone resulted in nearly identical levels of thrust, efficiency, and specific impulse, within experimental uncertainty. The operation on diamond resulted in a minor increase in current, most likely due to the rougher shape of the diamond test nose <b>cone</b> <b>assembly,</b> or of the use of an alumina fastener for mating the assembly to the central pole piece of the thruster. Future diamond assemblies will consist of diamond plates that are brazed together for improved mechanical and thermal performance. In parallel, we have developed and performed initial vibration testing of brazed diamond plates, to verify the mechanical integrity of the proposed (brazed) diamond nose <b>cone</b> <b>assembly.</b> Broadband sine-sweep testing at 1 / 3 gRMS of two 6. 1 mm × 5. mm × 1 mm brazed diamond plates showed a nearly rigid frequency response over the range of 20 - 2000 Hz, with some resonances at higher frequencies, outside of the normal environmental testing range.

40|$|On May 2, 2007, {{a freight}} train {{carrying}} segments of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters derailed in Myrtlewood, Alabama, after a rail trestle collapsed. The train was carrying Reusable Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM) 98 center and forward segments (STS- 120) and RSRM 99 aft segments (STS- 122). Initially, it was not known if the segments had been seriously damaged. Four segments dropped approximately 10 feet when the trestle collapsed {{and one of those}} four rolled off the track onto its side. The exit cones and the other four segments, not yet on the trestle, remained on solid ground. ATK and NASA immediately dispatched an investigation and recovery team to determine the safety of the situation and eventually the usability of the segments and exit cones for flight. Instrumentation on each segment provided invaluable data to determine the acceleration loads imparted into each loaded segment and exit cone.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is released from infected cells in an immature, noninfectious {{form in which}} the structural polyprotein Gag is arranged in a hexameric lattice, forming an incomplete spherical shell. Maturation to the infectious form is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves Gag at five sites, releasing the CA (capsid) protein, which forms a conical capsid encasing the condensed RNA genome. The pathway of this structural rearrangement is currently not understood, and {{it is unclear how}} <b>cone</b> <b>assembly</b> is initiated. RNA represents an integral structural component of retroviruses, and the viral nucleo-protein core has previously been proposed to nucleate mature capsid assembly. We addressed this hypothesis by replacing the RNA-binding NC (nucleocapsid) domain of HIV- 1 Gag and the adjacent spacer peptide 2 (SP 2) by a leucine zipper (LZ) protein-protein interaction domain [Gag(LZ) ] in the viral context. We found that Gag(LZ) -carrying virus [HIV(LZ) ] was efficiently re-leased and viral polyproteins were proteolytically processed, though with reduced efficiency. Cryo-electron tomography revealed that the particles lacked a condensed nucleoprotein and contained an increased proportion of aberrant core morphologies caused either by the absence of RNA or by altered Gag processing. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of HIV(LZ) particles containedmature capsids with the wild-type morphology. These results clearly demonstrate that the nucleoprotein complex is dispensable as a nucleator for mature HIV- 1 capsid assembly in the viral context. IMPORTANC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{extension}} and retraction of filopodia {{in response to}} extracellular cues {{is thought to be}} an important initial step that determines the direction of growth cone advance. We sought to understand how the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated to produce extension or retraction. By observing the movement of fiduciary marks on actin filaments in growth cones of a neuroblastoma cell line, we found that filopodium {{extension and}} retraction are governed by a balance between the rate of actin cytoskeleton assembly at the tip and retrograde flow. Both assembly and flow rate can vary with time in a single filopodium and between filopodia in a single growth <b>cone.</b> Regulation of <b>assembly</b> rate is the dominant factor in controlling filopodia behavior in our system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a {{group of}} children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by blindness, early dementia and pronounced cortical atrophy. The similar pathological and clinical profiles of the different forms of NCL suggest that common disease mechanisms may be involved. To explore the NCL-associated disease pathology and molecular pathways, we have previously produced targeted knock-out mice for Cln 1 and Cln 5. Both mouse-models replicate the NCL phenotype and neuropathology; the Cln 1 -/- model presents with early onset, severe neurodegenerative disease, whereas the Cln 5 -/- model produces a milder disease with a later onset. Results Here we have performed quantitative gene expression profiling of the cortex from 1 and 4 month old Cln 1 -/- and Cln 5 -/- mice. Combined microarray datasets from both mouse models exposed a common affected pathway: genes regulating neuronal growth cone stabilization display similar aberrations in both models. We analyzed locus specific gene expression and showed regional clustering of Cln 1 and three major genes of this pathway, further supporting a close functional relationship between the corresponding gene products; adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 (Cap 1), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (Ptprf) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 4 a 2 (Ptp 4 a 2). The evidence from the gene expression data, indicating changes in the growth <b>cone</b> <b>assembly,</b> was substantiated by the immunofluorescence staining patterns of Cln 1 -/- and Cln 5 -/- cortical neurons. These primary neurons displayed abnormalities in cytoskeleton-associated proteins actin and β-tubulin as well as abnormal intracellular distribution of growth cone associated proteins GAP- 43, synapsin and Rab 3. Conclusion Our data provide the first evidence for a common molecular pathogenesis behind neuronal degeneration in INCL and vLINCL. Since CLN 1 and CLN 5 code for proteins with distinct functional roles these data may have implications for other forms of NCLs as well. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental {{measurements of}} fast electron energy transport made using optical probing, x-ray and XUV imaging techniques. Hydrodynamic and hybrid particlein- cell (PIC) simulations {{were used to}} interpret the results. Measurements of fast electron heating patterns were made using the Vulcan 100 Terawatt (TW) and Petawatt (PW) lasers. For the first (100 TW) experiment the laser power was increased from 10 TW to 70 TW and a transition was observed between collimated electron flow and an annular transport pattern. Hybrid modelling showed that a form of beam hollowing accounted for this. Using the PW laser, a comparison was made of different diagnostic techniques for measuring the fast electron beam divergence. Cu K-alpha and optical probing measurements {{were found to be}} consistent, with both measuring a divergence angle significantly larger than that measured before at lower intensities. Several different target geometries were used to investigate how energy coupling from the laser into the fast electron beam is affected by the presence of a laser guide cone. Using the Vulcan PW laser, a significant decrease in energy coupling was observed when using metallic cone-slab targets. The addition of a <b>cone</b> <b>assembly</b> to plastic I AI sandwich targets acted to reduce the fast electron heating pattern. Novel cone-wire target geometries revealed that heating of a cone-guided wire plasma is maximised close to the wire surface. Computational modelling revealed that this is due to enhanced Ohmic heating. Finally, measurements were made of the dependence of laser intensity on the fast electron beam divergence. Data taken at intensities relevant to fast ignition was combined with previous published measurements. It was found that the divergence angle increased with laser intensity and had little dependence on pulse duration. PIC modelling was performed to analyse the data and possible explanations for the intensity dependence are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The Starr Soft Support {{isolation}} system incorporates an automatically reconfigurable aircraft jack into NASA's existing 1 -Hertz isolators. This enables an aircraft to float in mid-air {{without the need}} for a critical lift during ground vibration testing (GVT), significantly reducing testing risk, time, and costs. Currently incorporating the most advanced technology available, the 60, 000 -poundcapacity (27 -metric-ton) {{isolation system}} is used for weight and measurement tests, control-surface free-play tests, and structural mode interaction tests {{without the need for}} any major reconfiguration, often saving days of time and significantly reducing labor costs. The Starr Soft Support isolation system consists of an aircraft-jacking device with three jacking points, each of which has an individual motor and accommodates up to 20, 000 pounds (9 metric tons) for a total 60, 000 -pound (27 -metric-ton) capacity. The system can be transported to the aircraft by forklift and placed at its jacking points using a pallet jack. The motors power the electric actuators, raising the aircraft above the ground until the landing gear can retract. Inflatable isolators then deploy, enabling the aircraft to float in mid-air, simulating a 1 -Hertz free-free boundary condition. Inflatable isolators have been in use at NASA for years, enabling aircraft to literally float unsupported for highly accurate GVT. These isolators must be placed underneath the aircraft for this to occur. Traditionally, this is achieved by a critical lift a high-risk procedure in which a crane and flexible cord system are used to lift the aircraft. In contrast, the Starr Soft Support isolation system eliminates the need for critical lift by integrating the inflatable isolators into an aircraft jacking system. The system maintains vertical and horizontal isolating capabilities. The aircraft can be rolled onto the system, jacked up, and then the isolators can be inflated and positioned without any personnel needing to work underneath the aircraft. Also, the system accommodates changes in aircraft configuration, automatically adapting to changes in mass, and it can adjust the height of the isolators in one basic setup. Dryden personnel used the Starr Soft Support system to successfully perform a GVT on an F- 15 being structurally modified by Gulfstream, Dryden's Gulfstream III used for science research and the crew exploration module and adaptor <b>cone</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E
