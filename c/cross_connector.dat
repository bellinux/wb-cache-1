The central <b>cross</b> <b>connector</b> passes through East Branch Swamp Natural Area, and the East Loop passes the southern tip of Cranberry Swamp Natural Area, which features a little-used but rewarding loop side trail.

50|$|A {{vertical}} {{closed loop}} field {{is composed of}} pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically 50 to- 400 ft deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped <b>cross</b> <b>connector</b> {{at the bottom of}} the hole. The borehole is commonly filled with a bentonite grout surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the heat transfer. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents artesian wells from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5-6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10 kW (3 ton) of heating capacity might need three boreholes 80 to 110 m deep. (A ton of heat is 12,000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 kilowatts.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.|$|E

The two loops share a cross-connector trail, and the ultimate backpacking trip that does not use the <b>cross</b> <b>connector</b> would be 49.3 mi in length, though you should not avoid this scenic portion of the CKT system just because it is a connector trail. Some stream fords are still required, although recent sidehill work has reduced them substantially in the area of JU Branch, Burns Run, Boggs Run, and Yost Run. Much of this work has been done in recent years by Keystone Trails Association trail crews. Additional bridges were added in the East Branch area in 2007, and short access trails are planned to reach vistas over Dennison Fork and Russell P. Letterman Wild Area.

40|$|Abstract Background Most modern spinal {{implants}} contain titanium {{and remain}} in the patient’s body permanently. Local and systemic effects such as tissue necrosis, osteolysis and malignant cell transformation caused by implants have been described. Increasing tissue concentration and whole blood levels of ions are necessary before a disease caused by a contaminant develops. The aim {{of the present study}} was the measurement of whole blood titanium levels and the evaluation of a possible correlation between these changes and the number of fused segments. Methods A prospective study was designed to determine changes in whole blood titanium levels after spinal fusion and to analyze the correlation to the number of pedicle screws, <b>cross</b> <b>connectors</b> and interbody devices implanted. Blood samples were taken preoperatively in group I (n[*]=[*] 15), on the first, second and 10 th day postoperatively, as well as 3 and 12 [*]months after surgery. Group II (n[*]=[*] 16) served as a control group of volunteers who did not have any metal implants in the body. Blood samples were taken once in this group. The number of screw-rod-connections and the length of the spinal fusion were determined using radiographic pictures. This study was checked and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Tuebingen. Results The mean age in group I was 47 [*]±[*] 22 [*]years (range 16 - 85 [*]years). There were three male (20 %) and twelve female (80 %) patients. The median number of fused segments was 5 (range 1 to 11 segments). No statistically significant increase in the titanium level was seen 12 [*]months after surgery (mean difference: - 7. 2 [*]μg/l, 95 % CI: - 26. 9 to 12. 5 [*]μg/l, p[*]=[*] 0. 446). By observing the individual titanium levels, 4 out of 15 patients demonstrated an increase in titanium levels 12 [*]months after surgery. No statistically significant correlation between fused segments (r[*]=[*]- 0. 188, p[*]=[*] 0. 503) length of instrumentation (r[*]=[*]- 0. 329, p[*]=[*] 0. 231), number of interbody devices (r[*]=[*]- 0. 202, p[*]=[*] 0. 291) and increase of titanium levels over the observation period was seen. Conclusions Instrumented spinal fusion does not lead to a statistically significant increase in whole blood titanium levels. There seems to be no correlation between the number of pedicle screws, <b>cross</b> <b>connectors</b> and interbody devices implanted and the increase of serum titanium levels. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the predictors of serum chromium levels after stainless steel posterior spinal instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Abnormally elevated serum chromium levels {{have been detected}} in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis after stainless steel instrumentation. To date, the relationship among serum chromium levels, time of implantation, and implant characteristics (including surface area, rod length, numbers of hooks, screws, and <b>cross</b> <b>connectors)</b> has not been studied. METHODS. Thirty patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior instrumented spinal arthrodesis using stainless steel implants between 1998 and 2002 were prospectively studied. Serum chromium levels were measured between October 2006 and June 2007. Postoperative radiographs were used to measure rod lengths, number of hooks, screws, cross-connectors, and cables. The surface area of each component and the total surface area for each patient were calculated. Possible associations between serum chromium levels, time of implantation, and implant characteristics were investigated. RESULTS. Implant exposure, whether expressed {{in the form of}} total metal implant surface area, rod length, or number of metal interfaces, was found to be positively associated with serum chromium levels. Specifically, chromium levels increased by a multiplicative factor of 1. 0060 for every additional square centimeter of total metal implant surface area (P = 0. 02). In addition, the chromium level was found to decrease by a multiplicative factor of 0. 7766 for every additional year since surgery (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION. After adjusting for the number of years since surgery, metal implant exposure is positively associated with elevated serum chromium levels in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with stainless steel posterior spinal implants. This is the first study to identify statistically significant positive associations between specific spinal implant characteristics (other than corrosion identified by radiographs) and serum chromium levels.
