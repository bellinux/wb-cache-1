40|$|A {{recent study}} {{investigated}} the feasibility of a sequential heap leach in low grade Platreef ore in order to recover PGMs (Platinum Group Metals), by a pure hydrometallurgical route. This method comprised of two stages, an initial thermophile bioleach stage to extract base metals followed by a cyanide leach to recover precious metals, PGMs. The study conducted assessed the possibility of excluding costly stages such as concentration by flotation, smelting and pressure leaching by directly leaching low grade Platreef ore. The findings showed successful base metal recoveries; however, the production of thiocyanate during the cyanide leach raised concerns in terms of significant cyanide loss but also whether thiocyanate contributed positively to PGM recovery. Cyanide present in processing liquors is known to react with various sulphur species, depending on the mineralogy of the ore and the chemical constituents within the system. These interactions between cyanide and reduced sulphur species, generated through incomplete oxidation of sulphidic ores, are primarily responsible for thiocyanate formation. In addition, thiocyanate generated during these processes has been identified to mobilise both base metals and precious metals, forming highly stable and soluble complexes with precious metals. Recent {{work in the field}} has shown pronounced recoveries during thiocyanate leaching of PGMs from virgin catalytic converters. However, a significant portion of previous research work has focused on metallic gold, with a lack of knowledge regarding thiocyanate leaching of PGMs associated with sulphidic minerals. This study investigates the chemical kinetics of thiocyanate formation in a thiosulphate, sulphite and polysulphide system in the presence of cyanide. The initial rate kinetics of thiocyanate formation, explored in homogenous systems, displayed fairly rapid reaction kinetics in the cyanide-polysulphide system relative to the thiosulphate-cyanide system. Additionally, sulphite exhibited a minor affinity for cyanide as no measurable concentration of thiocyanate was observed. This serves to verify that polysulphides generated during incomplete oxidation of sulphidic minerals are most likely responsible for SCN- formation and not the direct interactions between sulphidic minerals and cyanide. Further, this research is an initial attempt to investigate the effectiveness of thiocyanate leaching in Pt and Pd containing minerals under varied conditions. In the process, it seeks to establish whether thiocyanate and cyanide act synergistically to promote the dissolution of Pt and Pd. Preliminary test work carried out on Platreef concentrate demonstrated that the presence of base metals significantly limited the concentration of free thiocyanate available for leaching. From the results observed, Fe (under acidic conditions) and Ni displayed a strong affinity for thiocyanate, attributed to the formation of highly stable complexes. However, Cu demonstrated a negligible effect on thiocyanate consumption, forming an insoluble salt complex, <b>CuSCN(s)</b> ...|$|R

The photocatalytic performance of pristine <b>CuSCN</b> is poorer than that of pristine ZnO nanorods due to smaller specific surface area, lower carrier mobility, and easier recombination of electrons and holes. The photocatalytic performance of <b>CuSCN</b> (NWs) is better than that of <b>CuSCN</b> (3 D) owing to the larger specific surface area of the <b>CuSCN</b> nanostructures, as shown in Fig.  4 e and f. The photocatalytic performance of <b>CuSCN</b> (3 D)/ZnO and <b>CuSCN</b> (NWs)/ZnO is better than that of ZnO due to their heterojunction structure and larger specific surface area. <b>CuSCN</b> (NWs)/ZnO has the better photocatalytic performance than <b>CuSCN</b> (3 D)/ZnO due to the smaller and better-distributed ZnO nanorods grown on <b>CuSCN</b> nanostructure and the consequent larger specific surface area. In the ZnO/CuSCN system, ZnO/CuSCN architecture has the best photocatalytic performance among ZnO, <b>CuSCN,</b> ZnO/CuSCN, and CuSCN/ZnO {{as a result of}} the heterojunction structure, larger specific surface area of the upper material of the heterojunction, and the larger contact area with the MO solution. The ZnO nanorods under <b>CuSCN</b> (3 D) structures are partially etched by the <b>CuSCN</b> reaction solution with an erosive pH, and the ZnO nanorods under <b>CuSCN</b> (NWs) structures are mainly etched by the <b>CuSCN</b> reaction solution with a pH of 1.5 only maintaining the outline and a very few remnants of ZnO nanorods as shown in Fig.  4 a and b and Additional file  1 : Figure S 3 (a, b). Although the ZnO nanorods under <b>CuSCN</b> (3 D) structures are partially etched, the interspace among the nanorods becomes bigger than that among the pristine ZnO nanorods with the consequent larger specific surface area and is clearer and neater than the ZnO nanorods under <b>CuSCN</b> (NWs) structures with almost complete etching. So, the photocatalytic performance of ZnO/CuSCN (3 D) is better than that of ZnO/CuSCN (NWs). The influence on nanostructure morphology and orientation of the heterojunction are discussed, and both can affect the photocatalytic performance in the ZnO/CuSCN system.

These results are compared with those previously reported for mononuclear and binuclear PPh 3 adducts which demonstrate a clear tendency for the copper centre to remain four-coordinate.

40|$|Temperature {{dependent}} {{current voltage}} characteristics {{in the dark}} and under illumination have been analysed on up to 3. 2 efficient solar cells with extremely thin absorber based on ZnO nanorods In 2 S 3 <b>CuSCN</b> structures. The diode ideality factor and the open circuit voltage are strongly influenced on a thermal activation process. Significant enhancement of the devices efficiency by annealing at moderate temperatures has been demonstrated. After this annealing the activation energy of the saturation current increased from 1. 00 to 1. 46 eV in the dark. Transport mechanisms at the In 2 S 3 <b>CuSCN</b> interface region are discusse...|$|E
40|$|Charge {{selective}} disordered hetero junctions {{were formed}} in evaporated In 2 S 3 layers by diffusing at 200 amp; 8201; C CuI from a <b>CuSCN</b> source. The thicknesses of In 2 S 3 layers and diffusion times were varied between 5 and 80 amp; 8201;nm and between 2 and 19 amp; 8201;min, respectively. In some cases <b>CuSCN</b> layers were etched back with pyridine. Spectral and time dependent surface photovoltage measurements {{were carried out}} in the capacitor arrangement. It was observed that a competing process of charge separation and relaxation was initiated together with the formation of the charge selective In 2 S 3 In 2 S 3 Cu hetero junctio...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid organic-inorganic {{semiconducting}} perovskite {{photovoltaic cells}} are usually coupled with organic hole conductors. Here, we report planar, inverse CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -xClx-based cells with inorganic hole conductors. Using electrodeposited NiO as hole conductor, {{we have achieved}} a power conversion efficiency of 7. 3 %. The maximum V-oc obtained was 935 mV with an average V-oc value being 785 mV. Preliminary results for similar cells using electrodeposited <b>CuSCN</b> as hole conductor resulted in devices up to 3. 8 % in efficiency. The ability to obtain promising cells using NiO and <b>CuSCN</b> expands the presently rather limited range of available hole conductors for perovskite cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>CuSCN</b> {{extremely}} thin absorber solar cell. Nanostructured TiO 2 deposited by {{screen printing}} on an ITO substrate {{was used as}} an n-type electrode. An ∼ 80 nm extremely thin layer of the system In 2 S 3 -Sb 2 S 3 deposited by successive ionic layer adsorption and a reaction (silar) method {{was used as an}} absorber. The voids were filled with p-type <b>CuSCN</b> and the entire assembly was completed with a gold contact. The solar cell fabricated with this heterostructure showed an energy conversion efficiency of 4. 9 %, which is a promising result in the development of low cost and simple fabrication of solar cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{confirm the}} {{observation}} of superconductivity at ambient pressure above 10 K in the organic metal (BEDT-TTF) 2 <b>Cu(SCN)</b> 2 as reported recently by Urayama et al [12]. In addition we have measured ESR, ac-susceptibility and thermopower in crystals of (BEDT-TTF) 2 <b>Cu(SCN)</b> 2 and have shown that in contrast to other organic superconductors here a relatively sharp superconducting transition even in the ac-susceptibility can be observed which saturates already around 8 K. The thermopower measurements indicate a clear metal-metal phase transition at 100 K and a possible second phase transition at around 50 K, while from the temperature dependence of the resistivity and susceptibility (ESR) these phase transitions cannot be observed...|$|E
40|$|Although {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} (PSCs) surpassing 20 % in certified {{power conversion efficiency}} (PCE) have been demonstrated with organic hole-transporting layers (HTLs), thermal degradation {{remains one of the}} key issues for practical applications. We fabricated PSCs using low temperature solution-processed <b>CuSCN</b> as the inorganic hole-transport layer (HTL), which possesses a highly stable crystalline structure and is robust even at high temperatures. The best-performing cell delivers a PCE of 18. 0 %, with 15. 9 % measured at the stabilized power output. Here we report the thermal stability of PSCs based on <b>CuSCN</b> in comparison with commonly used 2, 2 ′, 7, 7 ′-tetrakis-(N,N-di- 4 -methoxyphenylamino) - 9, 9 ′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). The PSC fabricated with organic spiro-OMeTAD degrades to 25 % of initial PCE after annealing for 2 h at 125 °C in air under 40 % average relative humidity. However, CuSCN-based PSCs maintain approximately 60 % of the initial value, exhibiting superior thermal stability under identical conditions. This work demonstrates that high efficiency and improved thermal stability are simultaneously achieved when <b>CuSCN</b> is used as an HTL in PSCs. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
