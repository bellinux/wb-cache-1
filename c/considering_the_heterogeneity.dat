40|$|Abstract: Data centers consume {{tremendous}} {{amounts of}} energy in terms of power distribution and cooling. Dynamic capacity provisioning is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the number of active machines to match resource demands. However, despite extensive studies of the problem, existing solutions have not fully <b>considered</b> <b>the</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> of both workload and machine hardware found in production environments. In particular, production data centers often comprise heterogeneous machines with different capacities and energy consumption characteristics. Meanwhile, the production cloud workloads typically consist of diverse applications with different priorities, performance and resource requirements. Failure to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> of both machines and workloads will lead to both sub-optimal energy-savings and long scheduling delays, due to incompatibility between workload requirements and the resources offered by the provisioned machines. To address this limitation, the Harmony, a Heterogeneity-Aware dynamic capacity provisioning scheme for cloud data centers is introduced. Specifically, use the K-means clustering algorithm to divide workload into distinct task classes with similar characteristics in terms of resource and performance requirements. A technique that dynamically adjusting the number of machines to minimize total energy consumption and scheduling delay. Simulations using traces from a Google’s compute cluster demonstrate Harmony (Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Monitoring and management system) can reduce energy by 28 percent compared to heterogeneity-oblivious solutions...|$|R

However, regarding methods to extract the infrastructures from inspection data obtained through ordinary inspections, there is actually no systematized methodology.
