40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>cultural</b> <b>itineraries</b> {{as a new}} {{category}} of heritage, a specific product {{for the promotion of}} cultural tourism in inland regions and a tool for defending small settlements from depopulation. The study describes the main characteristics of <b>cultural</b> <b>itineraries,</b> considering the factors that influence their creation and the strategies to adopt in order   for them to realistically have a future and generate sustainable tourism in the regions through which the routes pass. In order   for a cultural itinerary to be successful it is clearly indispensable to highlight the meaning of the ancient road but it is also necessary to identify the importance that it has today and can have in the future. Following the path taken by St Peter the Apostle towards Rome, this paper reconstructs stretches of that ancient itinerary, which has been historically and geographically documented. It proposes to highlight the value of a journey that undoubtedly appeals to those who are full of intellectual enthusiasm but appears to have little relevance for the faithful. Indeed, the latter have always been primarily interested in the journey’s final  destination, i. e. the great devotional route inside the Eternal City. Conferring importance on the Way of St Peter from Jerusalem to Rome would certainly help promote the inland areas of southern Italy that conserve traces of the saint’s presence. However, it would also perhaps succeed in restoring pride and confidence in this important ancient cultural presence to the Mare Nostrum and in recognising the Way’s key role in initiating intercultural dialogue and cooperation between Europe and the Mediterranean countries.  </p...|$|E

Improving the quality of urban places means to work on the relationship between: people, places, traditions and cultural identity. The relationships involve also the link between building; environment and landscape system. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to understand the complexity of urban phenomena meeting social, economic and environmental needs. It is very important boosting virtuous mechanisms for urban regeneration spreading innovation, guiding and shaping spontaneous social-change initiatives, starting from local traditions. Our research team composed by planners, architects and designers has drawn up a methodology in order to apply it in a small rural village requalification project in China. The town, named XibinZhen (Fujian Region) is undergoing in an economic and social contraction process, which is bringing it to an incessant depopulation. We recognize landscape aspects, in our case the Youxi River, like a key resource to improve the urban area and the identity related with the context. We also have identified a heritage path, which connects the two waterfronts and defines a <b>cultural</b> <b>itinerary</b> to understand and develop lifestyles, traditions and local production.

Our proposal is composed by multi-scale strategies of social innovation, economic improvement, environmental sustainable practices, through a new setting of spaces and uses. Our new vision of Xibin Town runs around three key words for development: “new”, that is to have a “for change” approach; “river”, that is to recognize what we may call “genius loci”; “town”, that is to recognize the urban character of Xibin and its role in a broader context...|$|R

O período entre sua chegada à Capital da província e sua morte configurou o momento de maior produção intelectual, enquanto jornais, álbuns ilustrados, folhas literário-científicas e almanaques constituíram os instrumentos fundamentais de divulgação das ideias de Koseritz.
