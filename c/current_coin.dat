2500|$|The current clad {{version is}} {{two layers of}} cupronickel, 75% copper and 25% nickel, on a core of pure copper. The total {{composition}} of the coin is 8.33% nickel, with the remainder copper. It weighs 0.2000 avoirdupois oz, 1/80th of a pound, 0.1823troy oz, (5.670grams). The diameter is 0.955inches (24.26mm), and the width of 0.069 inches (1.75mm). The coin has a 0.069-inch (1.75-mm) reeded (or milled) edge. Owing {{to the introduction of}} the clad quarter in 1965, it was occasionally called a [...] "Johnson Sandwich" [...] after Lyndon B. Johnson, the U.S. President at the time. As of 2011, it cost 11.14 cents to produce each coin. The U.S. Mint began producing silver quarters again in 1992 for inclusion in the annual Silver Proof set. Early quarters (before 1828) were slightly larger in diameter and thinner than the <b>current</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|E
