5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred <b>Cornu</b> {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, <b>Cornu</b> made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed <b>Cornu</b> to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in land snails of the genus Helix, {{including}} the escargot Helix pomatia, and the common garden snail Helix aspersa (also known as <b>Cornu</b> aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|E
5|$|The dart is {{shot with}} some {{variation}} in force, and with considerable inaccuracy, such that {{one-third of the}} darts that are fired in <b>Cornu</b> aspersum either fail to penetrate the skin, or miss the target altogether. Snails have only very simple visual systems and cannot see well enough to use vision to help aim the darts.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cornu's</b> {{father was}} from Dieppe, where {{he sent his}} son to train in the studio of a {{sculptor}} specialising in ivory - none of <b>Cornu's</b> early works in that medium have survived. He regularly worked as a 'sculptor in ordinary' at the court of Louis XIV. In 1673 he won the Grande Prix Colbert, later known as the Prix de Rome. In 1678 he won second prize in sculpture at the French School in Rome.|$|R
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail <b>Cornu</b> aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of <b>Cornu</b> aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, {{but he had no}} idea of Melas's position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François <b>Cornu</b> de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, but the lack of pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E

Their engines {{were used in the}} Santos-Dumont 14-bis of 1906, Paul <b>Cornu's</b> rudimentary helicopter of 1907, the Voisin biplane that was modified and piloted by Henri Farman who used it to complete Europe's first 1 kilometer circular flight in January 1908, and other significant pioneer aircraft.|$|R
5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred <b>Cornu</b> in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E

Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master who escorted them to the Harbour Master's Office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le <b>Cornu</b> performed this annually. His father John E.

This theory was awarded a prize by the Académie Nationale de Metz (National Academy of Metz), a member of which he became, and by the [...] "Société d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale" [...] (Society of Encouragement for National Industry).

50|$|Deslandres' {{undergraduate}} {{years at}} the École Polytechnique were played out against {{the aftermath of the}} Franco-Prussian War and the chaos of the Paris Commune so, on graduation in 1874, he responded to the continuing military tension with the emerging Germany by embarking on a military career. Rising to the rank of captain in the engineers, he became increasingly interested in physics and, in 1881, resigned his commission to join Alfred <b>Cornu's</b> laboratory at the École Polytechnique, working on spectroscopy. He continued his spectroscopic work at the Sorbonne, earning his doctorate in 1888 and finding numerical patterns in spectral lines that paralleled the work of Johann Balmer and were to catalyse the development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} singular {{properties of}} edge dislocation waves («EDW») - the main information {{component of the}} field formed at plane wave diffraction on half-plane. It is shown that analytical structure of this wave is completely identical to <b>Cornu’s</b> spiral, while physical simulation thereof requires joining the plane wave with an edge dislocation. Dislocations of this type are rather sensitive to action of any amplitude phase distortion on them that considering the impact of actual noise essentially hampers their experimental isolation in the pure form. At the same time spatial position of such dislocation may be effectively controlled by changing the amplitude and phase {{of one of the}} wave components. We considered peculiarities of structural evolution of the field at more complicated form of diffraction aperture...|$|R

25|$|The Celtic horn was a large, oval-curved horn {{with a thin}} {{tube and}} a {{modestly}} large bell, not unlike the Roman <b>cornu,</b> especially since it also had a crossbar {{as a means of}} supporting the instrument's weight on the player's shoulder. Like the carnyx it is therefore and in all probability an instrument of Etruscan origin from the first period of hellenization. On a Pompeian fresco, the horn is carried by a female dancer, and a Gallic warrior carries a broken exemplar, fastened together by a (leather?) band, on a Capitoline sculpture. Like the Roman <b>cornu,</b> the Celtic horn will have been held horizontally to ensure a more comfortable playing position.|$|E
25|$|In scope, {{his work}} covered {{a wide range}} of {{physical}} inquiry but, as Marie Alfred <b>Cornu</b> remarked in his Rede lecture of 1899, the greater part of it was concerned with waves and the transformations imposed on them during their passage through various media.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we prove some {{geometric}} properties of clothoids. A clothoid (or <b>Cornu's</b> spiral) is a plane curve whose curvature is a linear function of its length. In suitably chosen coordinates it is given by Frenel's integrals x(t) = R t 0 cos(B 2 = 2) d, y(t) = R t 0 sin(B 2 = 2) d. The clothoid appears in the problem to nd (a) shortest plane curve(s) joining two given points with given at them tangent angles and curvatures and with a bounded derivative of the curvature. It turns out that a regular (i. e. of the class C 3) point of a shortest curve is either {{a piece of a}} clothoid or a line segment. Some of the properties exposed in the paper are used in [5] to show that when the distance between the initial and nal points is sufficiently long, then, in general, shortest paths have infinitely many points of discontinuity of the curvature's derivative. Thus we are led to the problem to describe a procedure of constructing paths (called "suboptimal") longer no more than [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Biological tissues have {{individual}} {{optical properties}} {{that may be}} used as an identity card. The refractive index in particular, which can be measured directly, is very significant for the improvement or development of optical technologies in clinical practice. With the objective of verifying if healthy and pathological tissues can be discriminated from refractive index measurements, we have studied human colorectal mucosa. By using the total internal reflection method to measure the refractive index from healthy and pathological colorectal mucosa tissues at different wavelengths, it was possible to calculate the dispersion curves for both types of tissues. It was observed a decaying refractive index with wavelength, both for healthy and pathological tissues, which were fitted with curves described by <b>Cornu’s</b> equation for wavelengths between ultraviolet and near-infrared range. Experimental results show higher refractive index values for the pathological mucosa for all wavelengths. By performing measurements at wavelengths near 850 nm, we have detected non-monotonic behavior for the refractive index of both healthy and pathological tissues. Such abnormal wavelength dependence is evidence of lipids in both tissues. The acquired experimental data demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between healthy and pathological tissues from refractive index measurements. Similar studies can be made for different biological tissues. By using lasers with different wavelengths it might be possible to identify other tissue components. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

2500|$|The {{advent of}} social {{networking}} platforms {{may also be}} impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of {{the ease with which}} people of a certain age range—in particular those born before and after 1980—use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le <b>Cornu's</b> [...] "Visitors" [...] and [...] "Residents" [...] (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), [...] "Social networking sites, like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policy makers." [...] Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website. Same survey found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS, which is an increase from 65% in 2008, 55% in 2006. Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education, curriculum education, and learning. However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students have been known to negatively affect their academic life. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest {{a good deal of time}} in the use of such technologies.|$|R

In December, Digonet led a brigade consisting of the 67th Line Infantry Demi Brigade and a unit of converged grenadiers in a division commanded by Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau. This was in Guillaume Brune's Army of Italy. During these operations, Digonet drove the Austrians {{from the town of}} Bormio in the Valtellina. In support of Brune's campaign, he and his brigade cleared 800 Tyrolese by surprise from two mountain passes on 23 December 1800 and entered Riva del Garda.

One of the rearmost boats however, the launch from Hercule containing 30-40 men and commanded by Acting-Lieutenant Nesbit Willoughby, turned towards the frigate. Willoughby was determined to assist the wrecked crew and passengers, well aware that without help they would either be drowned or massacred by the Haitians, who could be seen making preparations to fire heated shot from the fort at the frigate.|$|E
25|$|As {{a defender}} of the {{parliamentary}} system, Carp disliked the authoritarian regime slowly introduced by the Domnitor. He and Pogor were the two anti-Cuzists of Junimea, whereas the other contributors remained neutral on the issue. In February 1866, Carp joined the political conspiracy which forced Alexander John Cuza into exile. Romania's Regents (the Princely Lieutenancy) appointed him their Intimate Secretary. He was also kept on as auditor pro bono. Carp soon rallied with the supporters of rule by a foreign dynasty, and, in Desbaterile gazette, advocated the dissolution of Parliament {{in preparation for the}} April plebiscite. When the list of candidates was narrowed down to Carol (Karl) of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Premier Ion Ghica sent Carp on his first diplomatic assignment, a secret mission to Napoleon III—Carp was to inquire about possible French objections to the enthronement of this Prussian prince, and recorded the Emperor's mild approval. Ghica and Carp, who were trying to contain a wave of separatist and anti-Prussian movements at home, registered a moral victory (made possible by the assistance of socialite Hortense <b>Cornu,</b> a personal friend of Napoleon's).|$|E
25|$|Unexpectedly {{confronted by}} a large Austro-Russian army, MacDonald was in a dilemma. He {{believed}} that his 22,000 available soldiers were outnumbered and ought to retreat, but he anticipated that Moreau might soon arrive to pitch into the Allied rear. So he hoped to hold out until his last divisions could arrive on the field. MacDonald was also aware {{of the presence of}} a force under Jean François <b>Cornu</b> de La Poype that was in position to threaten the Allied south flank. On the 18th, Veletsky's detached force surprised La Poype's 1,500 French and 2,000 Genoese at Bobbio, sending them fleeing back to Genoa. On morning of 18 June the injured MacDonald inspected his army. He found his men ready to fight and the enemy inactive. Meanwhile, Suvorov and Chasteler planned to throw three columns at the French, with the main strength on the right to break down MacDonald's flank by advancing from the Tidone to the Trebbia and finally {{all the way to the}} Nure, the next river to the east. With luck, the French would be driven back against the Po. The First Column on the right was headed by Bagration's Advance Guard followed by Schveikovsky's division. The Second Column in the center was made up of Förster's division. The Third Column included the divisions of Ott and Fröhlich. Ott was ordered to drive straight ahead to the Trebbia supported by his colleague. At some point Fröhlich's grenadiers were supposed to reinforce the right flank in order to give more weight to its attack.|$|E
