40|$|Performance of {{football}} teams varies constantly {{due to the}} dynamic nature of this sport, whilst the typical performance and its spread can be represented by profiles combining different performance-related variables {{based on data from}} multiple matches. The current study aims to use a profiling technique to evaluate and compare match performance {{of football}} teams in the UEFA Champions League incorporating three situational variables (i. e. strength of team and opponent, match outcome and match location). Match statistics of 72 teams, 496 games across four seasons (2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13) of this competition were analysed. Sixteen performance-related events were included: shots, shots on target, shots from open play, shots from set piece, shots from counter attack, passes, pass accuracy (%), crosses, through balls, <b>corners,</b> dribbles, possession, <b>aerial</b> success (%), fouls, tackles, and yellow cards. Teams were classified into three levels of strength by a k-cluster analysis. Profiles of overall performance and profiles incorporating three situational variables for teams of all three levels of strength were set up by presenting the mean, standard deviation, median, lower and upper quartiles of the counts of each event to represent their typical performances and spreads. Means were compared by using one-way ANOVA and independent sample t test (for match location, home and away differences), and were plotted into the same radar charts after unifying all the event counts by standardised score. Established profiles can present straightforwardly typical performances of football teams of different levels playing in different situations, which could provide detailed references for coaches and analysts to evaluate performances of upcoming opposition and of their own...|$|R
60|$|July 28th.--Last {{evening we}} went to the Powers's, and sat with them on the terrace, {{at the top of the}} house, till nearly ten o'clock. It was a delightful, calm, summer evening, and we were {{elevated}} far above all the adjacent roofs, and had a prospect of the greater part of Florence and its towers, and the surrounding hills, while directly beneath us rose the trees of a garden, and they hardly sent their summits higher than we sat. At a little distance, with only a house or two between, was a theatre in full action, the Teatro Goldoni, which is an open amphitheatre, in the ancient fashion, without any roof. We could see the upper part of the proscenium, and, had we been a little nearer, might have seen the whole performance, as did several boys who crept along the tops of the surrounding houses. As it was, we heard the music and the applause, and now and then an actor's stentorian tones, when we chose to listen. Mrs. P------ and my wife, U---- and Master Bob, sat in a group together, and chatted in one <b>corner</b> of our <b>aerial</b> drawing-room, while Mr. Powers and myself leaned against the parapet, and talked of innumerable things. When the clocks struck the hour, or the bells rang from the steeples, as they are continually doing, I spoke of the sweetness of the Florence bells, the tones of some of them being as if the bell were full of liquid melody, and shed it through the air on being upturned. I had supposed, in my lack of musical ear, that the bells of the Campanile were the sweetest; but Mr. Powers says that there is a defect in their tone, and that the bell of the Palazzo Vecchio is the most melodious he ever heard. Then he spoke of his having been a manufacturer of organs, or, at least, of reeds for organs, at one period of his life. I wonder what he has not been! He told me of an invention of his in the musical line, a jewsharp with two tongues; and by and by he produced it for my inspection. It was carefully kept in a little wooden case, and was very neatly and elaborately constructed, with screws to tighten it, and a silver centre-piece between the two tongues. Evidently a great deal of thought had been bestowed on this little harp; but Mr. Powers told me that it was an utter failure, because the tongues were apt to interfere and jar with one another, although the strain of music was very sweet and melodious-- as he proved, by playing on it a little--when everything went right. It was a youthful production, and he said that its failure had been a great disappointment to him at the time; whereupon I congratulated him that his failures had been in small matters, and his successes in great ones.|$|R
40|$|A falta de base cartográfica adequada para certas regiões, tem levado a um uso mais intensivo de aerofotos de pequeno formato como fonte de informação espacial ágil e de baixo custo aos usuários de sistemas que tratam imagens georreferenciadas para diversas finalidades. Uma destas finalidades é o Cadastro Técnico Rural Municipal (CTRM), o que exige que seja conhecida a {{magnitude}} dos erros inerentes ao processo. Foi desenvolvido um estudo para quantificar a imprecisão originada do uso direto, sem restituição, destas aerofotos, nas duas principais formas de entrada da informação espacial nesses sistemas: a digitalização manual, via mesa digitalizadora, utilizando-se osistema CR-SIGDER 2. 0; e a digitalização eletrônica, via "scanner", com vetorizaçãio direta no monitor SVGA, com "mouse", utilizando-se o sistema CR-IMAREA 1. 0. Os pontos de apoio para transformação de escalas foram georreferenciados aosistema UTM através de GPS e topografia. O principal parâmetro analisado foi o erro médio de posicionamento nas coordenadas. Procurou-se, ainda, descobrir qual a melhor distribuição dos pontos de apoio de campo para a transformação de escalas nestes sistemas. A melhor distribuição de pontos apresentou um erro médio de posicionamento nas coordenadas de 6. 96 metros para a mesa digitalizadora, e de 7. 53 metros para o monitor SVGA. Levando-se em consideração a pequena escala utilizada, estes resultados mostram o grande potencial das aerofotos de pequeno formato para as finalidades propostas neste trabalho, pois os mesmos se traduzem em erros de distâncias e áreas dentro da tolerância topográfica, desde que os pontos de apoio esfejam distribuídos um em cada canto da aerofoto. The lack of cartographic base for cartain regions, {{has taken to}} a more intensive use of aerial photographies of small format {{as a source of}} agile spatial information and of a low cost to the system users which treat georeferencing images to several purposes, specially to the Rural Municipal Technical Cadaster (RMTC), which demands that the magnitude of the errors inherentin the process be known. A study was developed in order to quantifi the inaccuracy, originated from the straight use, with no restitution of these aerial photographies in the two main ways of entrance of the spacial information in these systems: the manual digitizer, through digital table, using the CR-SIGDER 2. 0 system, and the electronic digitizer, through scanner, with direct vector, in the screen SVGA, with mouse, using the CR-IMAREA 1. 0 system. The supporting points to the transformation of scales were transformed to the UTM system through GPS and topography. The main parameter analysed was the average error of the position in the co-ordinates. There was also the attempt to discover which is the best distribution of the field supporting points to the scale transformation in these systems. The best point distribution presented a 6. 96 meters average error of position in the coordinates to the digitizer table, and a 7. 53 meters on to the SVGA monitor. Taken into account the small scale used, these results show the big potencial of aerial photographies of small format to the purposes proposed in this work, since they are translated in errors of distances and areas in the topographic tolerance, as long as the supporting points are distributed one in each <b>corner</b> of the <b>aerial</b> photography...|$|R
