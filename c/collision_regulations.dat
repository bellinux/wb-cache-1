The steady state equations of ship maneuvering were numerically solved using the Newton-Rhapson method {{in order to obtain}} the drift angle, the rudder angle and the ship forward speed. Results of numerical simulations show that the combined action of wind and wave has significant effect on the drift angle and the rudder angle in the range of wind and wave direction between 20. 0 degrees and 120. 0 degrees. The ship forward speed significantly changes due to alteration of wind velocity in the wind and wave direction smaller than 40. 0 degrees or in the wind and wave direction larger than 140. 0 degrees.

On {{the night}} of Saturday 12 December 1942, {{hundreds}} of American servicemen and residents of St. John’s, Newfoundland were gathered for a night of music at the Knights of Columbus hostel. At 11:10 pm a blaze that had started in the attic tore through the building burning the hostel quickly.

Today fire regulations have been put in place to prevent such tragedies from happening again. // Canoe River train crash. On 21 November 1950, a train with 388 Canadian soldiers en route to the USA for training collided with an eastbound passenger train. They met on a curve near Canoe River, British Columbia where track visibility was limited and falling snow prevented the engineers from seeing the opposing train’s smoke. While the cars of the passenger train were built entirely of steel, the troop train consisted of some steel cars and some wooden cars with steel framing. These wooden cars were surrounded by steel and buckled under the pressure of impact. All aboard the passenger train survived, but 4 railroad workers and 17 soldiers were killed. Following this <b>collision,</b> <b>regulations</b> that were already in place to ensure that wooden cars be placed {{at the end of the}} train were reinforced and the Canadian National Railway began to phase out the use of wooden cars.|$|E
50|$|It {{was decided}} to make one more sortie off Madagascar before heading for Australian waters to lay mines. Early on 12 September, a {{freighter}} was spotted 330 {{miles east of the}} island. Pinguin closed quickly on a deliberate ‘collision course’; the freighter maintained hers in accordance with the International <b>Collision</b> <b>Regulations</b> until the two ships were just over a mile apart. At this point the freighter sounded a long warning blast of its whistle. The freighter turned away from the raider. Pinguin ran up its battle ensign and de-camouflaged. The freighter crew manned her 4-inch gun and increased her speed to escape. The freighter was signalled to stop and a 75 mm warning shot was fired. The freighter fired back, hitting Pinguin with a shell that ricocheted off the surface of the sea and pierced her port side ending up in the crew's quarters close to the storage compartment containing 300 high-explosive mines. The shells fired by Benavon had no fuse caps fitted and it did not explode. One of Pinguins crew picked up the shell with his cap and threw it through the hole it had made in the ship's hull into the sea. Pinguin fired back, putting the freighter's gun and wireless out of action. It destroyed most of her lifeboats and set her on fire. The freighter's captain gave the order to abandon ship, but the bridge was hit and he was killed along with his deck officers and radio operator. A boarding party found five men aboard, three of them wounded. They and the 24 others that had already abandoned ship were taken aboard Pinguin. The total number of survivors was 28. The ship was identified as the British freighter Benavon on her way to London from Manila and Singapore with a cargo of hemp, jute and rubber. It had a crew of 49 and was armed with one 4-inch and one 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. Three of the wounded died of their injuries after boarding Pinguin, and they were buried with full military honours.|$|E
5000|$|Each side {{blames the}} other for the incident, arguing that the skipper of the other vessel miscalculated during a {{dangerous}} maneuver. Bethune {{has said that he}} believes the captain of the Japanese vessel had miscalculated while trying to scrape the bow of the Ady Gil. In a statement released by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Chuck Swift, who witnessed the incident from his ship, the Bob Barker, claimed that both vessels were stationary in the water when the Shōnan Maru 2 [...] "started up and then steered deliberately into the Ady Gil". Paul Watson initially claimed that the Ady Gil was almost stationary in the water when the Shōnan Maru 2 suddenly changed course and then steered deliberately into it. However, Watson later stated that [...] "One only needs to watch the video to see that Bethune negligently stopped his ship {{in the path of the}} whaling vessel and it was cut in half". Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research blames the collision on Sea Shepherd, who they say were attempting to entangle their rudder and propeller by repeatedly crossing their bow with lines. The Japanese Fisheries Agency said that the Shōnan Maru 2 had employed a water cannon to deter the Ady Gil, but the anti-whaling vessel undertook manoeuvres like suddenly reducing speed, resulting in the collision. Opinions in news media organisations vary similarly. Some blame the Ady Gil for powering up to intentionally propel itself into the whaler's path, some accuse the Shōnan Maru 2 of intentionally ramming a stationary vessel - with both sides basing their views primarily on the released video footage. Others place the blame more evenly. An investigation into the collision by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) was inconclusive and unable to assign blame for the collision. AMSA was unable to verify claims made by Sea Shepherd, while the Japanese government declined to participate with the investigation saying any information it had might be needed for an inquiry by its own authorities. [...] New Zealand authorities found both parties were at fault for the collision. The inquiry by Maritime New Zealand found that the Shonan Maru No. 2 should have kept clear of the Ady Gil under international <b>collision</b> <b>regulations,</b> and had ample opportunity to avoid hitting it. It also found that the Ady Gil failed to take avoiding action, and its helmsman did not see the Japanese ship bearing down until seconds before the impact.|$|E
40|$|A new {{autonomous}} ship {{collision free}} (ASCF) trajectory navigation and control {{system has been}} introduced with a new recursive navigation algorithm based on analytic geometry and convex set theory for ship collision free guidance. The underlying assumption is that the geometric information of ship environment {{is available in the}} form of a polygon shaped free space, which may be easily generated from a 2 D image or plots relating to physical hazards or other constraints such as <b>collision</b> avoidance <b>regulations.</b> The navigation command is given as a heading command sequence based on generating a way point which falls within a small neighborhood of the current position, and the sequence of the way points along the trajectory are guaranteed to lie within a bounded obstacle free region using convex set theory. A neurofuzzy network predictor which in practice uses only observed input/output data generated by on board sensors or external sensors (or a sensor fusion algorithm), based on using rudder deflection angle for the control of ship heading angle, is utilised in the simulation of an ESSO 190000 dwt tanker model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system...|$|R
40|$|A new {{navigation}} method, {{called a}} Line of Sight Counteraction Navigation (LOSCAN) algorithm {{has been introduced}} to aid manoeuvre decision making for collision avoidance based on a two-ship encounter. The LOSCAN algorithm is derived from {{an extension of the}} basic principle of traditional missile proportional navigation, recognising that the objective of the latter is target capture rather than target avoidance. The basic concept is to derive an acceleration command so as to increase the misalignment between the ships' relative velocity and the line-of-sight. The algorithm includes a risk assessment and the generation of appropriate navigation commands to manoeuvre own ship free of collision if a risk of collision exists. Numerical examples have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The relationship between the distance at the closest point of approach with respect to early warning distance, and with the norm of the acceleration, has also been analysed. In operation, the collision avoidance decision making process is a complicated problem, with its solution subject to ship states, practical dynamic constraints, <b>Collision</b> Avoidance <b>Regulations</b> (COLREGS), encountering ship manoeuvre coordination and human decision making factors.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} <b>collision</b> <b>regulations</b> and an automatic collision avoidance system (ACAS). Automation of ship operations is increasingly common. The automation of the collision avoidance task may have merit on grounds of reduced manual workload {{and the elimination of}} human error. Work to date by engineers and computer programmers has focused on modelling the requirements of the current <b>collision</b> <b>regulations.</b> This thesis takes a new approach and indicates that legislative change is a necessary precursor to the implementation of a fully automatic collision avoidance system. A descriptive analysis has been used to consider the nature of the collision avoidance problem and the nature of rules as a solution. The importance of coordination between vessels is noted and three requirements for coordination are established. These are a mutual perception of: risk, the strategy to be applied, and the point of manoeuvre. The use of rules to achieve coordination are considered. The analysis indicates that the current <b>collision</b> <b>regulations</b> do not provide the means to coordinate vessels. A review of current and future technology that may be applied to the collision avoidance problem has been made. Several ACAS scenarios are contrived. The compatibility of the scenarios and the current <b>collision</b> <b>regulations</b> is considered. It is noted that both machine sensors and processors affect the ability to comply with the rules. The case is made for judicial recognition of a discrete rule-base for the sake of an ACAS. This leads to the prospect of quantified <b>collision</b> <b>regulations</b> for application by mariners. A novel rule-base to match a pm 1 icular ACAS scenario has been devised. The rules are simple and brief. They avoid inputs dependent on vision and visibility, and meet all the aforementioned coordination requirements. Their application by mariners to two-vessel open sea, encounters was tested on a navigation simulator. The experimental testing of such a rule-base is unique. Mariners were given experience of applying the rule-base in certain circumstances and asked by questionnaire what their agreeable action would be. This was compared with their usual action. While the number of experiments was small, an indication was given of the impm 1 ant issues in applying a quantified rule-base. Aspects identified for fm 1 her study include the testing of rule base elements in isolation, and the use of quantified rules in multi-ship and confined water encounters. The Nautical Institut...|$|E

40|$|The Surveying Coastal Ocean Autonomous Profiler (SCOAP) {{is a large}} {{catamaran}} marine autonomous surface craft (MASC) for unattended weeks-long, spatially explicit, multidisciplinary oceanographic {{water column}} profile sampling in coastal/estuarine waterbodies. Material transport rates/pathways, crucial to understanding these ecosystems, are typically poorly known. SCOAP addresses demanding spatiotemporal sampling needs and operational challenges (strong currents, open coastal sea states, complex bathymetry, heavy vessel traffic). Its large size (11 -m length, 5 -m beam) provides seaworthiness/stability. The average speed of 2. 5 m s− 1 meets the representative goal to traverse an 18 -km transect, sampling 10 min at each of 10 stations 2 km apart, nominally 4 times daily. Efficient hulls and a diesel–electric energy system can provide the needed endurance. The U. S. Coast Guard guidelines are followed: lighting, code flags, the Automatic Identification System (AIS), and <b>collision</b> avoidance <b>regulations</b> (COLREGs) -based <b>collision</b> avoidance (CA) by onboard autonomy software. Large energy reserves obviate low-power optimization of sensors, enabling truly multidisciplinary sampling, and provide on-demand propulsion for effective CA. Vessel stability facilitates high-quality current profile observations and will aid engineering/operation of the planned winched profiling system, performance of an anticipated radar system to detect/track non-AIS vessels, and potential research-quality meteorological sensor operation. A Narragansett Bay test deployment, attended by an escort vessel, met design goals; an unattended open coastal deployment is planned for Rhode Island Sound.

The research is opportunistic since my background both in the Royal Navy and as a civilian lecturer at BRNC facilitated unprecedented access and the potential for original discoveries. I took a mixed-methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative features within a pragmatic paradigm, based upon an eclectic selection of methodological models to suit the case, in order to achieve a measure of triangulation upon the learning with the aim of understanding it: I chose not to be bound by anyone theoretical perspective. In order to facilitate this I set five research questions. My aim was to add to the existing body of research on learning in order to generate some practical recommendations for improving learning the <b>Collision</b> <b>Regulations</b> to the benefit of the College and the wider seafaring community. I reached four principal conclusions: first, that there were a number of practical ways in which the learning could be improved; second, that the biggest single factors in determining success or failure were the attitude towards learning and the confidence exhibited by the students; third, that the failure-rate is not as high as expected and the majority of students at this level do not find it as difficult as anecdotal and historical evidence suggests and fourth, that to describe and understand the unique context of learning at BRNC requires a combination of several theoretical approaches to learning.

40|$|Convergent gene pairs with {{head-to-head}} configurations are {{widespread in}} both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and are speculated {{to be involved}} in gene regulation. Here we present a unique mechanism of gene regulation due to convergent transcription from the antagonistic prgX/prgQ operon in Enterococcus faecalis controlling conjugative transfer of the antibiotic resistance plasmid pCF 10 from donor cells to recipient cells. Using mathematical modeling and experimentation, we demonstrate that convergent transcription in the prgX/prgQ operon endows the system with the properties of a robust genetic switch through premature termination of elongating transcripts due to collisions between RNA polymerases (RNAPs) transcribing from opposite directions and antisense regulation between complementary counter-transcripts. Evidence is provided for the presence of truncated RNAs resulting from convergent transcription from both the promoters that are capable of sense–antisense interactions. A mathematical model predicts that both RNAP <b>collision</b> and antisense <b>regulation</b> are essential for a robust bistable switch behavior in the control of conjugation initiation by prgX/prgQ operons. Moreover, given that convergent transcription is conserved across species, the mechanism of coupling RNAP collision and antisense interaction is likely to have a significant regulatory role in gene expression...|$|R

The International <b>Regulations</b> for Preventing <b>Collisions</b> at Sea contains the rules which deal with traffic situations at sea, but despite the <b>regulations</b> <b>collisions</b> occur. The study has focused on two questions: What situations are perceived as the most difficult by the navigating officers? How are these situations solved by the navigation officers? The study has been carried out by using in-depth interviews with five Swedish watchkeeping officers.
