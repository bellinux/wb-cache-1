When the VR finally embarked on major capital investment in the early 1950s, diesel and electric traction were under consideration. Although diesel locomotives of the early 1950s typically had far lower power outputs than the H class, they could be run in multiple-unit operation, with one crew controlling two or more locomotives. In August 1952, two new B class diesel-electric locomotives established their credentials during trials by hauling a 1,121 ton goods train up Ingliston Bank and covering in 44 minutes the same distance two A2 class locomotives took to haul a 690-ton load in 67 minutes. The B class locomotives proved their ability to provide the same (if not better) performance as the H class, but without the heavy axle load and requirements for upgraded infrastructure. They became the new motive power not only for The Overland, but also mainline goods service. The days of mainline steam locomotives were numbered.|$|E

Jazz Ltd’s motto was clear: [...] "If you want to dance, go to the Aragon Ballroom. If you want to drink, try any bar. You can make love in a taxi. But if you want to hear Dixieland, this is the place." [...] No unescorted women were allowed unless they sat with Ruth at the bar. Men had to wear suit jackets and women could not wear trousers.

Leaving the prestige and comfort of NBC Sports was natural for Simmons and Connal who strongly believed {{in the idea of}} a 24-hour sports network. However, at the time cable and satellite channels were just in their infancy with HBO launching in 1975 and CNN yet to go on the air. Simmons and Connal and the young ESPN team got the network up on time launching with the first SportsCenter hosted by George Grande and Lee Leonard followed by a slow-pitch softball game. Together, Simmons and Connal led the company through its infancy building a first <b>class</b> <b>operation</b> in Bristol, Connecticut. During his three years, Simmons gave start to some of ESPNs most important franchises including SportsCenter, The NFL Draft and full coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Additionally, he is credited for the hiring of Chris Berman, Bob Ley, Greg Gumbel, Bryant Gumbel, George Grande, and many others. He left ESPN to become Commissioner of the USFL in 1982.|$|E
