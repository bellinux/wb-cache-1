40|$|This {{document}} proposes {{an amendment}} for the ISO/IEC TR 15285 “An operational model for characters and glyphs”. The amendment may have two annexes for the TR. One discusses about a “character repertoire design guidance for Syllabic Scripts ” and another discusses about a “recommended functionality for supporting sophisticated input assistance”. Both annexes are independent {{to each other}} but have strong interrelation between the two. Problem description: 1. Most of the syllabic scripts {{needs to have a}} rendering process of a string of multiple <b>coded</b> <b>elements</b> for presentation of them. And also, sometimes, a string unit of the <b>coded</b> <b>elements</b> should be handled as if it is one single character for data processing purpose, and sometimes it requires a single normalized sequence of the <b>coded</b> <b>elements</b> (for processing, such as sorting) even though human being would type-in the sequence differently. Therefore, there is a needs of well-defined “processing unit of <b>coded</b> <b>elements</b> ” to handle the most of the syllabic scripts for machine process and presentation purposes. In addition to that, even though the “unit ” is defined, glyph shape is not always defined as one shape. Sometimes, there are multiple candidate shapes are available for the one singl...|$|R

500|$|Reserved <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> are codes {{which have}} become obsolete, or are {{required}} in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories (click on the links for the reserved codes of each category): ...|$|E

500|$|The ISO 3166/MA may reserve <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> {{for other}} {{entities}} {{that do not}} qualify for inclusion based on the above criteria. For example, because the European Union is not a country, it is not formally included in ISO 3166-1, but for practical reasons, the ISO 3166/MA has [...] "reserved the two-letter combination [...] {{for the purpose of}} identifying the European Union within the framework of ISO 3166-1".|$|E
500|$|The {{codes are}} chosen, {{according}} to the ISO 3166/MA, [...] "to reflect the significant, unique component of the country name {{in order to allow}} a visual association between country name and country code". For this reason, common components of country names like [...] "Republic", [...] "Kingdom", [...] "United", [...] "Federal" [...] or [...] "Democratic" [...] are normally not used for deriving the <b>code</b> <b>elements.</b> As a consequence, for example, the United Kingdom is officially assigned the alpha-2 code [...] rather than , based on its official name [...] "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" [...] (although [...] is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom). Some codes are chosen based on the native names of the countries. For example, Germany is assigned the alpha-2 code , based on its native name [...] "Deutschland".|$|E

30|$|Aiming {{to analyze}} the {{different}} agglomeration topologies {{and how they are}} related to architectural problems, we defined the research questions described in Section 3.2. To answer our research questions, the criteria used for correlating code-anomaly agglomerations and single code anomalies with architectural problems were the following. A code-anomaly agglomeration and an architectural problem are related if they co-occur in, at least, one <b>code</b> <b>element.</b> Even though both agglomeration and architectural problem usually involve many elements, in our definition is sufficient that they co-occur in one element. Similarly, an individual code anomaly and an architectural problem are correlated if they occur in one <b>code</b> <b>element</b> together. We considered this decision appropriate because there were no previous evidence to base our study on. Therefore, in this first study we had {{to analyze the}} largest set of possible relations between agglomerations and architectural problems.|$|R

The writer writes this thesis {{in order to}} find out the <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> and also the language levels that are mostly used by reported repondents in Deteksi features. The writer selects the topics about young people and the problem as her sources of data. As the writer thinks that there are various kind of topics in Deteksi so she thinks that there might be others <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> that used among the different topic. In doing this study the writer refers to Holmes thmries of code mixing as the related theories, while the theory from Lumintaintang and Harijatiwidjaya, as the supporting theories. The writer analyzes the <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> in every utterance in each episode and then she classifies them into 3 categories of Englistr, Javanese and Jakartanese. Then she finds what language level that are found in the data. After that she calculates the percentage of the <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> in each category. From the analysis of the whole episodes, she finds out that the Jakartanese <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> occur 68. 3 % and the language level is on the level of word. The Javanese <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> occur 22. 77 o/o and the dominant language level is on the level of word. Whereas the English <b>code</b> mixing <b>elements</b> occur 8. 93 yo with 6 elements occur on the level of phrase, 1 element on the level of clause and the rest elements occur on the level of word.
