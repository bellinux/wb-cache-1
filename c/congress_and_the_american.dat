25|$|This president, by {{engaging}} in such incredible abuses of power, breaches of trust with both the <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people, and misleading us into this tragic and unbelievable war, the violation of treaties, other international law, our constitution, our own domestic laws, and then his role in heinous human rights abuses; I think all of that together calls for impeachment.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{has several}} long-distance hiking trails, the most {{prominent}} is the Buckeye Trail which is a 1,444-mile (2,324km) hiking trail that loops around the state of Ohio. Part of it is on roads and part is on wooded trail. Additionally, the North Country Trail (the longest of the eleven National Scenic Trails authorized by <b>Congress)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Discovery Trail (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the United States) pass through Ohio. Much of these 2 trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.|$|E
25|$|In sharp contrast, <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{states had}} {{no end of}} {{difficulty}} financing the war. In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise {{that it would be}} made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States.|$|E

25|$|In an {{open letter}} to the President, the <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people, eighty economists, {{including}} Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith, stated that the FairTax would boost the United States economy. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research and Americans For Fair Taxation, GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the year after the FairTax goes into effect. Real investments could increase by as much as 76% initially and remain 15% above present levels. In addition, the incentive to work would increase by as much as 20%, the economy’s capital stock would increase by 42%, labor supply by 4%, output by 12%, and real wage rate by 8%. A study in 2007 by the Beacon Hill Institute of Suffolk University stated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University finds that the shift to the FairTax would raise marginal labor productivity and real wages {{over the course of the}} century by 18.9% and long-run output by 10.6%. Further, studies of the FairTax at Boston University and Rice University suggests the FairTax will bring long-term interest rates down by as much as one third. As falling tax compliance costs lower production costs, exports would increase by 26% initially and remain more than 13% above present levels. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University’s Economics Department, revenues to Social Security and Medicare would double as the size of the economy doubles within 15 years after passage of the FairTax. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.|$|E

2500|$|Catharine Hitchcock Tilden {{was born}} in Dundee, Monroe County, Michigan, December 13, 1844. She was the {{daughter}} of Hon. Junius Tilden (Yarmouth, Massachusetts, November 28, 1813 - Monroe, Michigan, March 1, 1861), formerly a prominent lawyer of that state, and Zeruah (Rich) Tilden (Wellfleet, Massachusetts, January 28, 1813 - Dundee, Michigan, June 30, 1854). The mother was a descendant of Governor Treat, of Connecticut; Governor Roberts, of New Hampshire; and of Governor Prence, of Massachusetts; {{as well as of the}} Mayflower pilgrims, Elder Brewster, [...] "of blessed memory," [...] and stout Stephen Hopkins. Four of the mother's ancestors served in the Continental <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War. Col. John Bailey, of the 2nd Massachusetts Regiment, was at Bunker Hill and Monmouth, crossed the Delaware with Washington, and was at Horatio Gates's side in the northern campaign which ended in Burgoyne's surrender. The Gad Hitchcocks, father and son, served as chaplain and as surgeon. The elder Gad, in 1774, preached an election sermon in which he advocated the cause of the Thirteen Colonies and brought forth the wrath of Gage and the thanks of the Massachusetts General Court. Samuel Tilden, private from Marshfield, Massachusetts, and member of the Committee of Safety, completes the list of her Revolutionary ancestors. When the mother died, she left two children (Catharine and her sister, Augusta), four children having died earlier.|$|E
