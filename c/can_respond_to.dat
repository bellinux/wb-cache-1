5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis <b>can</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
