On successive rotations, the [...] "full roller" [...] repeatedly contacts the lane on the same full circumferential circle, on which the oil accumulates, {{making it harder for}} the side-roll to find traction and create hooking action. The [...] "full-roller" [...] had been the dominant choice before the changes in lane coatings and oil.

With a 3/4-roller a bowler puts the ball into a rotation whose <b>contact</b> <b>ring</b> is smaller, and on successive rotations enlarges (subsequent examination of the ball often shows a flaring of the circles of oil). This is because at every spot along the circle, friction reduces the rotation, and that includes the spin component, causing rotation on a continually larger circle. This has the effect of bringing relatively dry ball surface in contact with the lane, increasing traction for both forward-roll and side-roll. It probably goes without saying why bowlers often wipe oil off the ball.|$|E

A maximum Q-factor of 10. 4 is obtained for TFSOI-layer shielded on-chip inductors. The inductor-to-inductor isolation is - 62 dB (for a spacing of 100 mum) at 10 GHz, which is close to the ideal isolation of the open probes.

50|$|A 3-way socket {{has three}} {{electrical}} contacts. In {{addition to the}} two contacts of the standard socket, a third contact is added. This contact is positioned off-center {{in the bottom of}} the socket (contact two in photo). This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb. A problem of these devices is that the ring contact of the socket (contact two in photo) digs into the lead seal on the lamp bulb's <b>contact</b> <b>ring</b> and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, popping noises, and loss of power to the low wattage filament as the lead seal on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.|$|E

In particular the extent to which asymptomatic infections in vaccinated people contribute to ongoing mumps virus transmission is uncertain.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the electron transmission through {{a structure of}} serial mesoscopic metallic rings coupled to two external leads. A set of analytical expressions based on the quantum waveguide transport and the transfer matrix method are derived and used to discuss the effects of geometric configurations on transmission probabilities. It is found that in the <b>contact</b> <b>ring</b> case {{the existence of an}} applied magnetic flux is necessary to create transmission gaps, while in the non-contact ring case transmission gaps always appear irrespective of whether there is an applied magnetic flux or not. The transmissions for periodic rings with a defect ring and periodic rings built by two sorts of rings are also briefly studied. It is also found that the transmission periodicity with wave vector must be ensured by the commensurability of two characteristic lengths, i. e., of the half perimeter of a ring and the connecting wire between two adjacent rings. The special points of wave vector and magnetic flux which give rise to the transmission resonance and antiresonance are analyzed in detail.

We are working to compare the Fe mineralogical composition of martian meteorites with in-situ measurements on Mars. Our samples were hand picked from the > 1 mm size fraction of saw fines on the basis of lithology, color, and grain size (Table 1).

40|$|A {{series of}} free-mass {{designs for the}} ultrasonic/ sonic driller/corer (USDC) has been {{developed}} to maximize the transfer of energy from the piezoelectric transducer through the horn to the bit, {{as well as to}} minimize potential jamming. A systematic development was made producing novel designs of free-mass configurations where the impact force is spread across a minimal area maximizing the impact on the bit. The designed free masses were made to operate at high temperatures (500 C) as on Venus, and they can be made to operate at extremely low temperature, too. In normal operation, the free mass bounces between the horn and the bit, impacting both repeatedly. The impact stress profile, maximum stress, contact time duration, and the required yielding stress for the materials of the free mass, bit, and horn are all affected by the contact area. A larger contact area results in lower stress in the contact region, and avoids yielding of the materials. However, before the excitation voltage is applied to the transducer, the horn, free mass, and the bit are pressed together. Larger contact area results in a stronger coupling of the bit to the horn transducer, which greatly changes the vibration characteristics of the transducer, and makes the USDC difficult to start. To obtain optimum performance, a catalog of free-mass designs is required, allowing maximum flexibility during trade-off for these conflicting contact area requirements. For this purpose, seven different designs were conceived: point contacts, circular contacts, point/circular <b>contacts,</b> line <b>contacts,</b> <b>ring</b> <b>contacts,</b> line/ring contacts, and dashed line contacts. Besides point/circular and line/ring contacts, the free mass can be designed as any of the above shapes.
