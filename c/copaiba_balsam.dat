50|$|The {{northern}} {{end of the island}} catches most of the rainfall and is heavily forested, featuring species such as bamboo, mahogany, rosewood and locust. The south is drier and dominated by savanna-like brush, including cacti, <b>Copaiba</b> <b>balsam,</b> logwood and acacia.|$|E
50|$|The resin of {{the tree}} (known internationally as East Indian <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam)</b> is used in India, where it {{is the source of}} kanyin oil and gurjun oil, and in Cambodia, where the almost solid resin is {{especially}} used to prepare torches. The red brown wood has use documented for India, Cambodia and Yunnan, China. In Cambodia the wood is popular for sawing, woodwork and teacabinet-work. In herbal medicine, the plant has been traditionally used for treating gonorrhea, leprosy, psoriasis and other skin diseases. In the home-gardens of South China, it is cultivated both as a medicinal and as a perfume plant.|$|E
50|$|He overcame great obstacles, {{including}} {{the prohibition of}} colored folk becoming priests, but he still wanted to obtain a college education. The intelligence of Valdes in 1792 led the town council of Peru to ask the King to overlook the color of Valdes' skin, and Charles VI did so. In 1807, Valdes entered {{the gates of the}} University he had been prohibited from entering long ago. Upon entry, he read his thesis, and obtained his bachelor's degree immediately upon entry (with special permission). Also, the time of practice required between the bachelor's and doctor's degrees were waived completely for Valdes, {{and at the same time}} he obtained his doctorate degree together with his bachelor's degree. In 1811, he became a Professor of clinical medicine in the University of San Marcos. His research on the influence of <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> in children's convulsions was reprinted in France. In 1815, he was elected to the Royal Academy of Madrid.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> (Copaifera officinalis) effect on Walker 256 {{carcinoma}} inoculated into vagina and uterine cervix of rats. METHODS: Eighteen female Wistar rats weighing between 180 - 250 g were used, distributed into 2 groups (GCop, GC). On the 1 st {{day of the}} experiment, 0. 3 ml of Walker 256 carcinoma (2 x 10 (6) concentration) was inoculated in both groups; on the 3 rd day of the experiment, it was given 4. 8 ml/kg of distilled water to the GC group, and 4. 8 ml/kg of <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> to the GCop group. On the 12 th day, euthanasia was performed and the tumor was grafted, being weighted and verified its volume. The data were submitted to statistical analysis with ANOVA test. RESULTS: It was observed that <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> presented a negative inhibitory potential of 70 %. CONCLUSION: The <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> stimulated the tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the immunohistochemistry of the uterine cervix of 20 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) bearing the Walker 256 tumor, treated with copaiba oil (Copaifera officinalis). METHODS: The animals were grouped into four subgroups, with five rats each: the GCT and GCopT received distilled water and topically copaiba, respectively, while the GCG and GCopG received distilled water and copaiba by gavage, respectively. The substances were administered for nine days. On the 12 th day, after euthanasia, the tumor pieces {{were sent to}} the identification of T CD 4 +, T CD 8 + and Natural Killer cells. RESULTS: It was found that the pattern of expression for specific markers of phenotypes of cells involved in tumor immune response was similar in all groups, regardless the administration way of copaiba oil (topical or gavage). CONCLUSION: <b>Copaiba</b> <b>balsam,</b> administered either topically or by gavage, did not alter the pattern of tumor immune response in rats bearing Walker 256 Tumor...|$|E
40|$|Chemoprevention by {{components}} of natural products has aroused lively interest in last years. Among natural substances, terpenoids {{seem to be}} potentially useful in prevention and treatment of several diseases, cancer included. β-Caryophyllene (β-CRY) is a sesquiterpene contained in several essential oils as those from Eugenia caryophyllata, Salvia spp., Lavandula angustifolia L., Piper nigrum L. and <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam</b> (Copaifera reticulata Ducke); it is known to possess anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties. In this work, β-CRY has been evaluated for its potential antimutagenic activity against the genotoxicity induced by known mutagenic agents. The experiments were carried out by using two in vitro tests: 1. 	the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strains and on Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA strain, with and without the extrinsic metabolic activation system; 2. 	the micronucleus assay (MN) on cultured human lymphocytes. Data obtained showed a strong antimutagenic activity of beta-caryophyllene in both assays and encourage further studies to investigate the potential role of this substance as chemopreventive agent...|$|E

40|$|The {{microorganism}} Sclerotinia {{was isolated}} from roots of Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni in plantations {{in the northwest}} of Parana and submitted to the cultivation {{in the presence of}} extracts and vegetable balsams of Tarragon (Artemisia draconculus), Thyme (Thymus vulgaris), Manjerona (Origanum majorona), Mint citrata (Mintpiperita var. citrata), Purple Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), Andiroba (Carapa guanensis) and Copaíba (Copaifera reticulata Ducke). The first five oils were extracted by steam drags, after the drying of the vegetable in greenhouse with circulation of air at 45 °C. The last two were used in natura. A suspension (100 ìl) of fungus previously cultivated, was added to each plate. The results show that after 7 days of incubation the thyme oils 10 ìl, purple basil 25 ìl, manjerona 25 ìl, mint citrata 50 ìl, tarragon 50 ìl were capable to inhibit the growth of Sclerotinia, while the andiroba oil only reached this result with 200 ìl. The <b>copaiba</b> <b>balsam,</b> even in the concentration of 500 ìl, was unable to inhibit the growth of the microorganism...|$|E
