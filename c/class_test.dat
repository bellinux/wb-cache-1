Brown, who was in the parking lot smoking a cigarette, was surprised to see Harris, whom he had earlier noted had been absent from an important <b>class</b> <b>test.</b> Harris seemed unconcerned when reminded of this fact by Brown, commenting, [...] "It doesn't matter anymore." [...] Harris then elaborated: [...] "Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home." [...] Brown, feeling uneasy, walked away. Several minutes later, students departing Columbine for their lunch break observed Brown heading down South Pierce Street away from the school.

40|$|Runtime <b>class</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{technique}} whereby virtual function calls are transformed into statically-bound function calls {{through a series of}} conditional branches. Through this transformation, the overhead of virtual function calls can be significantly reduced. However, the drawback of these tests is that by relying on conditional branches, the amount of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is limited and the mispredict penalties can be relatively high. We show that by using predication during <b>class</b> <b>testing,</b> these drawbacks can be eliminated, and the benefits of <b>class</b> <b>testing</b> can be improved upon. Predication is a supported feature in Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, which converts control dependencies into data dependencies, and thus eliminates the mispredict penalties. With analytical cost models and experimental results, we show that predicated <b>class</b> <b>testing</b> can reduce the direct cost of virtual function calls by 43 % on an average, which in contrast to ot [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Taking aspects as {{incremental}} {{modifications to}} their base classes, {{this paper presents}} an incremental approach to testing whether or not aspect-oriented programs and their base classes conform to their respective behavior models. We exploit a rigorous aspect-oriented extension to state models for capturing the impact of aspects on the state transitions of base class objects {{as well as an}} explicit weaving mechanism for composing aspects into their base models. We generate abstract <b>tests</b> for base <b>classes</b> and aspect-oriented programs from their state models. As base <b>class</b> <b>tests</b> are not necessarily valid for aspect-oriented programs, we identify several rules for maximizing reuse of concrete base <b>class</b> <b>tests</b> for aspects according to the state-based impact of aspects on their base classes. To illustrate our approach, we use two examples that indicate distinctive types of aspect-oriented applications and exhibit fundamental features in complex applications: aspects removing state transitions from base classes and aspects adding and modifying state transitions in base classes. Our results show that majority of base <b>class</b> <b>tests</b> can be reused for aspects, but subtle modifications to some of them are necessary. In particular, positive (or negative) base <b>class</b> <b>tests</b> can become negative (or positive) aspect tests. We also discuss how several types of aspect-specific faults can be revealed by the state-based testing...|$|R
