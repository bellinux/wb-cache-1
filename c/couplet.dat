5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way <b>couplet</b> of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way <b>couplet</b> is brief, and SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a <b>couplet</b> (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a <b>couplet</b> may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{isolated}} single hepatocytes, hepatocyte <b>couplets</b> {{retain their}} apical polarity, and, during short-term culture form an enclosed canalicular space or vacuole {{between the two}} adjacent cells into which biliary secretion is initiated. Hepatocyte <b>couplets</b> were prepared after partial collagenase perfusion of rat liver. Centrifugal elutriation was used to fractionate the preparation into six couplet-containing suspensions. Image {{analysis was used to}} determine the size of cultured <b>couplets.</b> The size of the <b>couplets</b> ranged from 34. 1 +/- 0. 76 microns and 684 +/- 24. 1 microns 2 (mean length and area respectively +/- S. E. M.) in Fraction 2, to 43. 7 +/- 0. 57 microns and 1033 +/- 33. 8 microns 2 length and area respectively in Fraction 7. Glutamine synthetase activity was assessed in each freshly eluted fraction and was shown to be predominant in Fractions 6 and 7. Pretreatment of rats with CCl 4, which selectively destroys perivenous hepatocytes, decreased the proportion of <b>couplets</b> in these fractions by over 67 %, and their glutamine synthetase activity by over 97 %. It was concluded that Fractions 2 and 3 contained predominantly <b>couplets</b> of Zone 1 (periportal) origin, Fractions 4 and 5 those from Zone 2, and Fractions 6 and 7 predominantly <b>couplets</b> of Zone 3 (perivenous) origin. The development of canalicular secretory activity was assessed in the <b>couplets</b> after a 15 min incubation with a fluorescent bile acid, cholyl-lysyl-fluorescein (CLF). This was sigmoidal in all fractions, but slower in the periportal <b>couplets,</b> taking 5. 1 h for 50 % to show secretory activity in Fraction 2, compared with 2. 7 h for Fraction 7. Incubation of hepatocyte <b>couplets</b> with 1 or 10 microM taurodehydrocholate, a non-toxic bile acid analogue, did not influence the rate of development of accumulation of CLF by the <b>couplets</b> or the area of the canalicular vacuole in any fraction. However, it did decrease the CLF content of <b>couplets</b> incubated with CLF for 15 min to a greater extent in those of perivenous origin. After subjecting the <b>couplets</b> to oxidative stress by incubation with 20 microM menadione (2 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone), it was evident that periportal <b>couplets</b> were less able to maintain canalicular secretory activity than perivenous <b>couplets...</b>|$|R

5|$|NY92 {{begins as}} a city-maintained highway at an {{intersection}} with US11 (State Street) in downtown Syracuse. The route heads eastward on East Genesee Street, passing under I-81 before splitting into a one-way <b>couplet</b> at Almond Street. For the next two blocks, the eastbound and westbound lanes of NY92 are separated by a small park situated within the block formed by Almond Street, Forman Avenue, and both directions of Genesee Street. The <b>couplet</b> ends just east of Forman Avenue, at which point NY92 continues on as a highway two lanes wide with dedicated cycle lanes in each direction.|$|E
5|$|In Preston, {{the open}} fields return as NY220 follows another waterbody, {{this time the}} {{slightly}} larger Mill Brook. The route crosses the stream just before entering the town of Oxford, where they split. While Mill Brook curves around the western extents of the village of Oxford, NY220 serves the village directly, entering it on Butler Street. It veers eastward at a junction with State Street and follows it to Washington Avenue. Here, State Street splits into a one-block long one-way <b>couplet.</b> Eastbound NY220 shifts south to follow LaFayette Park; NY220 westbound, meanwhile, is routed on State Street.

5|$|The two routes remain {{concurrent}} as they snake to {{the northwest}} through Tompkins County. Southwest {{of the city of}} Ithaca in the town of Ithaca, NY34 and NY96 meet NY13. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting NY327 and NY13A before crossing over the inlet of Cayuga Lake and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NY96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into a one-way <b>couplet,</b> with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. NY79, also routed on a one-way <b>couplet</b> here, crosses NY96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NY79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street.|$|E

While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a <b>couplet,</b> {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E

5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac <b>couplet,</b> {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below.

Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of NY33 has been located in {{downtown}} Buffalo since 1930; however, {{the exact location of}} its terminus has varied over time. In the mid-1970s, the northbound and southbound directions of NY5 were split and rerouted to follow a series of streets through downtown Buffalo. Northbound NY5 left the southbound direction {{at the north end of}} the Skyway and followed Church, South Division, Ellicott, and Chippewa Streets around downtown to Main Street, where both directions converged and continued north on Main Street. As a result, NY33 was truncated eastward to the junction of Genesee and Ellicott Streets. At some point between 1979 and 1985, a pair of ramps were constructed between the west end of the Kensington Expressway and Oak and Elm Streets, a pre-existing one-way <b>couplet</b> one block to the west of Michigan Avenue. NY33 initially followed the new ramps to Genesee Street; however, the route was altered in the latter half of the 1980s to connect to Ellicott Street (by this point part of NY5 north) by way of Goodell and East Tupper Streets, another pre-existing one-way <b>couplet.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed <b>couplet.</b> Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
