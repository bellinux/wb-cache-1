30|$|A {{distributed}} ledger is hosted and updated on a decentralized network of computers that nobody owns. As the authors note, the key innovation {{is a novel}} way to store and update a chain of information (e.g., a series of exchanges, or immutable copies of documents) that anyone can examine and verify without altering. Like cash, tokens in {{distributed ledger}}s are anonymous, although governments could easily compel taxpayers to reveal the addresses they own. Yet most cash exists today not as bills or coins but as computer data showing how much people have on deposit. These data are held in private, <b>centralized</b> <b>ledgers</b> controlled by institutions such as banks. Distributed ledgers are public and require no trusted intermediary to verify who has title to what.|$|E
