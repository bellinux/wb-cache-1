40|$|For decades, the <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fair</b> Information <b>Practice</b> {{have served}} as a model for data privacy, {{protecting}} personal information collected by governments and corporations. But professional data management standards such as the <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fair</b> Information <b>Practice</b> do not take into account a world of distributed data collection, nor the realities of data mining and easy, almost uncontrolled, dissemination. Emerging models of information gathering create an environment where recording devices, deployed by individuals rather than organizations, disrupt expected flows of information in both public and private spaces. We suggest expanding the <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fair</b> Information <b>Practice</b> to protect privacy in this new data reality. An adapted understanding <b>of</b> the <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fair</b> Information <b>Practice</b> can promote individuals’ engagement with their own data, and apply not only to governments and corporations, but software developers creating the data collection programs of the 21 st century. To support user participation in regulating sharing and disclosure, we discuss three foundational design principles: primacy of participants, data legibility, and engagement of participants throughout the data life cycle. We also discuss social changes that will need to accompany these design principles, including engagement of groups and appeal to the public sphere, increasing transparency of services through voluntary or regulated labeling, and securing a legal privilege for raw location data...|$|R

The original purpose of the League described in its charter was to “protect the general public patrons of the theater, owners of theatrical entertainments, operators of theaters and reputable theater ticket brokers against the evils of speculation of theater tickets.” The League's first successful act was the writing of the Theater Ticket <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>Practice</b> (together with Actors' Equity) which became a state law in 1940. These efforts are still relevant today, as ticket resellers in New York State are required to obtain a license from the Department of State and are prohibited from reselling tickets within 500 feet of theatres or box offices.|$|E

The investigation went forward even though on reality shows, the Network Code generally covers professional performers, but not the participants. Some parents on hand for the final day of filming accused the producers of feeding children lines, re-casting dialog and repeating scenes, all of which suggested that the children functioned as actors.

Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fair</b> trade <b>practices</b> would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor.

The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent of the written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions.

30|$|According to the TRA, {{attitudes are}} {{influenced}} by behavioral beliefs, which are beliefs about the likely consequences of a given behavior (Ajzen 1991). Numerous {{studies have found that}} beliefs regarding ethical issues in apparel and textiles are important precursors of attitude formation (Dickson 2001; Kozar and Connell 2010; Littrell et al. 1999). These studies have shown that consumer awareness regarding sweatshop labor, ethical <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct, <b>fair</b> trade <b>practices,</b> environmental effects of acquisition, use and disposal of production waste materials and other social issues all {{play an important role in}} consumers’ apparel purchase decisions. However, minimal research has investigated the role of values and norms on attitude formation. Given changing consumer dynamics (i.e. more ethically aware consumers) it is imperative to understand what factors influence consumption choices. Increasingly, consumers are using non-product attributes, like CSR practices, to evaluate and patronize retail apparel brands. Given the complex nature of apparel consumption decisions, it is important to understand the inherent nature of consumers’ value orientations and their influence on the purchase decision process.|$|R
