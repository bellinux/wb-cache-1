5000|$|A lewis (sometimes {{called a}} lewisson) {{is one of}} a {{category}} of lifting devices used by stonemasons to lift large stones into place with a <b>crane,</b> <b>chain</b> block, or winch. It is inserted into a specially prepared hole, or seating, in the top of a stone, directly above its centre of mass. It works by applying principles of the lever and utilises the weight of the stone to act on the long lever-arms which in turn results in a very high reaction force and friction where the short lever-arms make contact with the stone inside the hole and thereby prevents slipping.|$|E

50|$|Unnoticed by the captain, crew, port {{officials}} and customs authorities, stowaways may {{gain access to}} a ship {{with or without the}} assistance of port personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways hide in empty containers, cargo holds, tanks, tunnels, behind false panels, stores, accommodation areas, engine rooms, void spaces, <b>cranes</b> and <b>chain</b> lockers.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Crane {{expanded}} his company, Stephen Crane Associates, by forming {{a deal with}} Sheraton hotels {{across the country and}} in Canada. <b>Crane's</b> Polynesian-themed <b>chain</b> of restaurants called Kon Tiki were known for their elaborate decor and precise bar service. There were Kon Tikis in Sheraton Hotels in Montreal, Portland, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Honolulu, and Boston. Crane also operated Ports o' Call restaurants in Dallas and Toronto.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze a {{systematically}} {{designed and}} easily tunable backstepping-based boundary control concept developed by Thull, Wild, and Kugi (2006) for a gantry <b>crane</b> with heavy <b>chain</b> and payload. The corresponding closed-loop system is formulated as an abstract evolution equation {{in an appropriate}} Hilbert space. Non-restrictive conditions for the controller coefficients are derived, under which the solutions are described by a $C_ 0 $-semigroup of contractions, and are asymptotically stable. Moreover, by applying Huang's theorem we can finally even show that under these conditions the controller renders the closed-loop system exponentially stable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out at Cargotec Sweden, MacGregor Cranes who {{manufactures}} marine cargo cranes at production partners in China and South Korea. MacGregor Cranes source components to their production partners from both European and Asian suppliers. MacGregor Cranes has implemented a distribution center in Germany. Today when the production has increased five folded, the amount of Asian suppliers has increased and many European suppliers have chosen to shift some production to China or South Korea. This has led MacGregor Cranes to reconsider if a distribution center in Asia could decrease the costs and increase the Supply Chain efficiency. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to evaluate MacGregor <b>Cranes</b> current Supply <b>Chain</b> by mapping it and measuring performance metrics. A Supply Chain with focus on a distribution center in Asia will be evaluated and then compared against the existing Supply Chain. Literature was collected about Supply Chain Management, Supply Chain strategies, ways to evaluate a Supply Chain and a distribution centers role in a Supply Chain. This literature search resulted in a theoretical frame of references which thereafter were used as guidance when collecting the empirical data and when performing the analysis. MacGregor <b>Cranes</b> Supply <b>Chain</b> was mapped and quantitative data about the Supply Chain was collected from the enterprise resource planning system SAP R/ 3. Interviews were conducted in order to gather information about MacGregor <b>Cranes</b> Supply <b>Chain</b> strategy and how they graded the importance of different attributes. Primary and secondary information were collected about how other Nordic companies had managed their distribution center in China. The analysis of the empirical data revealed that the main advantages with the current distribution center is that sea freight can be utilized for a large share of the components sourced in Europe and that MacGregor Cranes has a good Supply Chain flexibility since they are able to hold and stock components from Europe that not is needed in the production. The disadvantage is that MacGregor Cranes is relying on their Asian suppliers to store components and some suppliers have limited storage capacities in terms of space and a lack of systematic methods to monitor the stock levels. The evaluation of the current Supply Chain let the authors to recommend alternatives for how a Supply Chain with a distribution center in China could be set up. This resulted in the recommendations that MacGregor Cranes in the short term, 1 - 2 year, should continue to work towards increasing the amount of suppliers in Asia before implementing a distribution center in China. The authors recommend MacGregor Cranes to develop the relationship between the suppliers located in Asia with the main objective to use suppliers as stock keeping units. A long term recommendation, 2 years or more, is to set up a distribution center in China to supply components for all production partners. A Vendor Managed Inventory, VMI, concept for selected components should be implemented at the distribution center, which would give MacGregor Cranes an opportunity to handle the duality of cost minimization and maintaining a high service level.

40|$|Minimizing shutterings {{assembling}} time on construction sites can yield significant savings in labor costs and crane moves. It requires solving a pairing problem that optimizes {{the ability for}} the <b>crane</b> to move <b>chains</b> of shutterings as a whole when they can be later reused together to frame another wall of the site. In this paper, we show that this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense as well as both its multiflow and ordering aspects. We also introduce a linear relaxation that computes reasonably good lower bounds of the objective, and describe a Tabu Search based on pairings insertion and ejection that builds promising solutions...|$|R
5000|$|On the Rose's Thorn, Bane has {{suspended}} Robin {{in the air}} using a <b>crane,</b> and has <b>chained</b> a large {{weight to}} Robin's legs. Candice begins to pull off Robin's mask, but Bane stops her, telling her to be patient, for {{it will be more}} pleasurable wait until Batman has arrived, so she can unmask them both. Using the crane, Bane lowers Robin into the ship's hold, which begins to rapidly fill with water. Batman arrives at the ship, with Bane ready for him. Pumping the growth chemicals into his body, the now-larger Bane begins to duel with Batman. Many of Batman's attacks are largely ineffective, but he is able to use his agility to counter Bane's attacks. After a short while, Batman manages to shoot Bane with a large harpoon gun, sending him flying off the ship and into the water.|$|R
60|$|The stony shores {{ran away}} {{right and left}} in {{straight}} lines, enclosing a sombre and rectangular pool. Brick walls rose high above the water!--soulless walls, staring through hundreds of windows as troubled and dull as the eyes of over-fed brutes. At their base monstrous iron <b>cranes</b> crouched, with <b>chains</b> hanging from their long necks, balancing cruel-looking hooks over the decks of lifeless ships. A noise of wheels rolling over stones, the thump of heavy things falling, the racket of feverish winches, the grinding of strained chains, floated on the air. Between high buildings the dust of all the continents soared in short flights; and a penetrating smell of perfumes and dirt, of spices and hides, of things costly and of things filthy, pervaded the space, made for it an atmosphere precious and disgusting. The Narcissus came gently into her berth; the shadows of soulless walls fell upon her, the dust of all the continents leaped upon her deck, and a swarm of strange men, clambering up her sides, took possession {{of her in the}} name of the sordid earth. She had ceased to live.|$|R
50|$|Cranford Countryside Park is a 144-acre {{public park}} in Cranford, in the London Borough of Hillingdon, England. Situated in close {{proximity}} to Heathrow Airport, it is bordered by the M4 Motorway to the north, and by the towns of Harlington and Cranford to the South West and South East respectively. Although its namesake Cranford is within the London Borough of Hounslow, the park itself is geographically in fact part of the London Borough of Hillingdon, as it straddles the southernmost point of this borough. Despite this, the park is managed under Hounslow's council authority. Although the park is in an urban location, it is vehicle-accessible only by a small road before a motorway entrance slip, and as such it {{has been described as a}} 'hidden gem'. The park features in the London Parks & Gardens Trust’s ‘Inventory of Historic Green Spaces’ and is centrally positioned among the <b>Crane</b> Valley’s parkland <b>chain.</b> It is fully open to the public from 07:30-21:00 during the summer months, and closes instead at dusk during the autumn, winter and spring. Facilities include an information centre, toilets, a car park, a children's playground and a bridle route. Situated roughly 1 mile south of Hayes & Harlington railway station and one mile north-west of Hounslow West tube station, Cranford Park is accessible by rail; however London Bus routes 81, 105, 111, 195, 222, H98, H28, and E6 serve passengers closer to the park's location.|$|R
