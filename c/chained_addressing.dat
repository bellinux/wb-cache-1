By using an approach based on Lyapunov functions, we provide estimates for geometrically ergodic Markov chains under weak assumptions. In an autoregressive model, our bounds cannot be improved in general. We illustrate our theory by showing quantitative estimates for approximate versions of two prominent MCMC algorithms, the Metropolis-Hastings and stochastic Langevin algorithms.

We here present an algorithm that overcomes all of these shortcomings by involving two different nested hash chains: one dedicated to seed updating and the other used for OTP production. Our algorithm provides forward and non-restricted OTP generation. We propose a random challenge–response operation mode.

This last step allow us to setup the proper environment for simulating the actual business process execution, {{as well as the}} related communication actions with its business partners. Finally we can state that the reported experience has shown to be a valuable approach for the effective simulation of supply chains' behavior in the food market, and it can be regarded as a proper prototyping paradigm for medium- and small-sized supply chains...|$|R

These problems are concerned with decisions related to the size of orders and their schedule. In general, products share or compete for common resources and thus require coordination of their replenishment decisions whether replenishment involves manufacturing operations or not. This research is concerned with joint replenishment problems (JRPs) which are part of multi-item lot sizing and scheduling problems in manufacturing and distribution systems in single echelon/stage systems. The principal purpose of this research is to develop three new periodic review policies for stochastic joint replenishment problem. It also highlights the lack of research on joint replenishment problems with different demand classes (DSJRP). Therefore, periodic review policy is developed for this problem where the inventory system faces different demand classes that are deterministic demand and stochastic demand. Heuristic Algorithms have been developed to obtain (near) optimal parameters for the three policies as well as a heuristic algorithm has been developed for DSJRP.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a processing <b>chain</b> <b>addressing</b> safety at level crossings composed of a foreground extraction based on CICA followed by a robust 3 D localization. The latter proves its effectiveness compared to stereo-matching algorithms found in the literature. The experimentations showed that the method is applicable to real-world scenes in level-crossing applications. The foreground extraction method based on CICA has already been evaluated in terms of Recall (95 %) and Precision (98 %) {{on a set of}} 300 images with manually elaborated ground truth. Real-world datasets have been shot at four different level crossings, including a hundred scenarios per level crossing under different illumination and weather conditions. The global chain including foreground extraction and 3 D localization, still needs to be evaluated intensively on the above dataset. According to the experimentations, the localization of some objects may fail. However, the localization of one among sixty objects fails, {{this is due to the}} smaller number of pixels having confidence measure larger than a fixed threshold. The starting point of the belief-propagation process highly depends on the number and repartition of pixels, having hight confidence measure, inside an object. This drawback can be handled by introducing the temporal dependency in the belief-propagation process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A “lifting ” of a Markov {{chain is}} a larger chain {{obtained}} by replacing each state of the original chain {{by a set of}} states, with transition probabilities defined {{in such a way that}} the lifted chain projects down exactly to the original one. It is well known that lifting can potentially speed up the mixing time substantially. Essentially all known examples of efficiently implementable liftings have required a high degree of symmetry in the original <b>chain.</b> <b>Addressing</b> an open question of Chen, Lovász and Pak, we present the first example of a successful lifting for a complex Markov chain that has been used in sampling algorithms. This chain, first introduced by Sinclair and Jerrum, samples a leaf uniformly at random in a large tree, given approximate information about the number of leaves in any subtree, and has applications to the theory of approximate counting and to importance sampling in Statistics. Our lifted version of the chain (which, unlike the original one, is non-reversible) gives a significant speedup over the original version whenever the error in the leaf counting estimates is o(1). Our lifting construction, based on flows, is systematic, and we conjecture that it may be applicable to other Markov chains used in sampling algorithms. ...|$|R

The ILM-PR policy implies several changes with regard to other previous models proposed in the literature, which consider continuous review as their inventory policy. One of these changes is {{the inclusion of the}} undershoot concept, which has not been considered in previous ILM models in the literature. Based on our model, we are able to design a distribution network for a two-level supply <b>chain,</b> <b>addressing</b> both warehouse location and customer assignment decisions, whilst taking into consideration several aspects of inventory planning, in particular, evaluating the impact of the inventory control review period on the network configuration and system costs. Because the model is a very hard-to solve combinatorial nonlinear optimisation problem, we implemented two heuristics to solve it, namely, Tabu Search and Particle Swarm Optimisation. These approaches were tested over small instances in which they were able to find the optimal solution in just a few seconds. Because the model is a new one, a set of medium-size instances is provided that can be useful as a benchmark in future research. The heuristics showed a good convergence rate when applied to those instances. The results confirm that decision making over the inventory control policy has effects on the distribution network design...|$|R

Production now often entails the sourcing of inputs and components from multiple suppliers based in several countries. These trends are likely to leave their imprint on international trade patterns: Are countries now specializing in particular stages of global production processes, or (to borrow from Paul Krugman (1995)) specific slices of the value <b>chain?</b> <b>Addressing</b> this question requires first and foremost an industry-level measure of relative production line position. In this short article, we present three different approaches to building such a measure of the “upstreamness ” of an industry. These measures capture the number of stages before final use at which an industry typically enters into production processes. The three approaches are motivated in distinct ways, but we prove that they yield an equivalent measure of industry upstreamness. On the empirical side, we construct this measure using the 2002 US Input-Output (I-O) Tables as a benchmark. The high level of disaggregation in the US Tables allows us to calculate upstreamness for a total of 426 industries. We separately also construct our measure using the I-O Tables for selected OECD member countries from the STAN Database, in order to verify that upstreamness is a stable attribute of industries across different countries (with some caveats, see details in Section III).
