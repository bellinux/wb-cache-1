40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a novel technical solution that is aimed {{to improve the quality of}} <b>cable</b> <b>crimp</b> terminations in the electronics industry. The automotive, aero and military vehicle industries are of special interest due to their stringent requirements for guaranteed quality assurances in relation to their safety-critical products. The emphasis is on handheld crimping tools, where a new scheme for measuring the relevant crimp force is proposed using a small embedded computer to process information; so as to make an on-instrument statement regarding the crimp process quality. The thesis includes a detailed review of the current technical practices in the cable termination business, with a particular emphasis on the quality estimations for crimped connections using the crimp force monitoring (CFM) scheme. A comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art crimp force monitoring schemes and technologies is presented. A gap in the tool chain is identified whereby the industry has a preference for the use of hand tools in some selected processes; but the CFM scheme cannot be currently integrated directly with such hand tools. The bulk of the work in this thesis is thus focused on the development of a technical solution that will address this need for integration of hand tools with the CFM scheme. The concept is to develop a fully embedded subsystem that can be attached directly to a hand tool and this system will perform all of the signal processing and the statistical analysis so that each crimped joint can be trusted to meet the relevant stated quality parameters. In the course of development work a fully functional prototype subsystem is developed for the CFM solution, for application to hand tools. Analytical and statistical measurement and assessment algorithms were developed to a standard, which allows a final quality rating to be applied to crimped joint connections. Such algorithms are designed to be embedded directly onto the instrumentâ€™s microcomputer. The new system has been evaluated and tested in the course of this research project and it has currently been accepted by a number of industries for a planned volume qualification assessment...|$|E
40|$|Cutting <b>cable</b> and <b>crimping</b> {{compression}} {{connections are}} the two most commonly performed tasks by direct-bury line workers who repair and bury underground cable for electric power utilities. Battery-powered tools, rather than manual (Figure 1), do the demanding work of cutting <b>cable</b> and <b>crimping</b> connectors while the worker holds the tool in place. The focus of this study is whether the cost of battery-powered tools for direct-bury line workers can be justified on injury and illness data and other factors...|$|R
50|$|Crimp {{connections}} are used typically to fix connectors, such as BNC connectors, to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the connector. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the <b>cable</b> for <b>crimping.</b>|$|R

40|$|The crimpings of the Pole Face Windings (PFW), used {{to connect}} the {{rectangular}} copper conductor of the main windings with its supply cable, could have defects due to the manufacture process. They could lead to an extensive high electrical resistance. To locate these defects, the PFW are powered with 80 Ampere DC and the voltage drop over the electrical resistances of the crimping is measured. The measurements are done between the PFW current leads and the corresponding pick-up. By subtracting {{the resistance of the}} supply cable and the interconnection <b>cable</b> the <b>crimping</b> resistance is calculated. During the long shutdown 2005 and the annual shutdown 2006 / 2007 a total of 34 main units, and their PFWs, have been refurbished [1]. The refurbished main units are equipped with new PFW. On this PFW the crimping technique was improved and the defect of high crimping contact resistance should not appear. Nevertheless to have complete picture of the situation the 34 refurbished main units and the 66 none refurbished units were measured...|$|R
50|$|The {{switches}} have {{an integrated}} time-domain reflectometer (TDR) built into every copper port, providing {{the ability to}} accomplish diagnostic monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of the connected cables. This allows the equipment manager the ability to test and troubleshoot the <b>cables</b> for defects (<b>crimped,</b> cut, shorted or damaged cables) without {{going out to the}} switch room to test the cables from the switch to the end equipment. The tests can be accomplished on a single port or on multiple ports at the same time. The test can be accomplished through the command line or through one of several Graphical user interfaces called Device Manager (DM), Java Device Manager (JDM) or Enterprise Device Manager (EDM).|$|R
50|$|The Switches have an {{integrated}} time-domain reflectometer (TDR) built into every copper port, providing diagnostic monitoring and troubleshooting {{capabilities of the}} connected cables allowing for the troubleshooting of <b>cable</b> defects (<b>crimped,</b> cut, shorted or damaged cables) from the telnet, SNMP, web and console management interfaces. This test provides a very reliable test to identify if the cable is good or faulty. The Switches also include {{an integrated}} packet sniffer built into every port that can export the information on to a web page report (see the jpg to the right, an example of top 25 talkers on a switch) or export the information to an IPFIX server. The web base reports will report top 10, 25, or 50 talkers. Reports can also be created and sorted on source address, destination address, TOS, protocol, port number, source or destination ports, packet count, byte count, or first or last packet times. Multiple ports can be monitored simultaneously or individually. A license {{is not required to}} enable this function. The Management of the system is accomplished through a serial console (which presents both a menu structure and a command line interface), a web interface or with the device manager tools, which uses SNMP to communicate with the device.|$|R

40|$|Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is a {{versatile}} technology amenable {{to a variety}} of measurements and nondestructive monitoring of infrastructure conditions. It can be utilized to monitor deformation of soil/rock and structures, monitor changes in fluid levels, and monitor water content of soils. Furthermore, this monitoring can be automated using systems controlled by a datalogger that acquires and stores data that can then be retrieved via phone line or telemetry. The principles involved in TDR measurements are presented in a companion paper and this paper focuses on case histories in which TDR was used to monitor deformation. These cases include, 1) cables in rock supporting a highway at one site, and a school building at a second site, subject to mine subsidence, 2) cables through scour critical bridge footings, and 3) cables in a deforming rock pedestal supporting a highway. These case histories demonstrate installation techniques, remote monitoring capabilities, and typical results. Other applications are briefly summarized to illustrate the diverse uses of TDR technology.

40|$|The {{internal}} defects {{of cable}} joints always accelerate {{the deterioration of}} insulation, until finally accidents can arise due to {{the explosion of the}} joints. The formation process of this damage often involves changes in the electromagnetic, temperature and stress distribution of the cable joint, therefore, it is necessary to analyze the electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical distribution of cable joints. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper sets up a 3 -D electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model of <b>cable</b> joints under <b>crimping</b> process defects. Based on the model, the electromagnetic losses distribution, temperature distribution and stress distribution of a cable joint and body are calculated. Then, the coupling fields characteristics in different contact coefficient k, ambient temperature Tamb and load current I were analyzed, and according to the thermal-mechanical characteristics of a cable joint under internal defects, the temperature difference Î”Tf and stress difference Î”Ïƒf of cable surface are applied to evaluate the internal cable joint defects. Finally, a simplified model of the cable joint is set up to verify the accuracy of the coupling field model proposed in this paper, which indicates that the model can be used to analyze the coupling fields characteristics of cable joints and the method can be applied to evaluate crimping process defects of cable joints...|$|R
