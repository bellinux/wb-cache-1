Speed, in an interview he gave to Inside Edition on October 18, 2011, said that he declined to take the offer saying that the track conditions were too dangerous for Indy-type cars. Likewise, A. J. Allmendinger, who also had previous open-wheel experience, had expressed early interest, though he later declined, recalling, [...] " [...] we raced CART at Vegas...it scared the living hell out of me." [...] Finnish media reported that [...] Formula One World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, who was splitting time between the World Rally Championship and NASCAR in 2011, had also been approached {{to take part in}} the race, but Räikkönen rejected the offer as he was not confident of having a competitive car, rather than having concerns over safety.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of Syed's man-against-machine challenge {{is focused on}} rewarding advances in AI software and not advances in hardware. In the annual challenge, programs are run on machines chosen and provided by Syed himself, under the criterion that it be a typical, inexpensive, off-the-shelf home computer. The challenge would not be open to anyone requiring expensive multi-processor machines such as those used to challenge top-level chess players, much less something like the custom-built supercomputer Deep Blue, {{even though it was}} the success of this hardware-intensive approach which inspired Arimaa's invention. Syed believes that even the computer used in the 2004 challenge match (a Pentium 4 2.4 GHz system with 512 MB of RAM) had sufficient hardware to win the <b>challenge</b> <b>prize</b> if only it was running the proper software. Supercomputers might already have the power to conquer Arimaa by brute force using conventional AI software, and eventually personal computers will too, if hardware continues to advance at the current rate. This is why the Arimaa <b>challenge</b> <b>prize</b> is offered only until the year 2020.|$|E

The next attempt to found an IFK club in Gothenburg was made on 5 September 1897, when two brothers named Friman, Eric Clase and Anton Johansson reconstructed the club. The club was active until at least 1899, but after that no information can be found that confirms the club still existed. During those years, the main activity was athletics, and for a short time in 1899, four-time Olympic gold medalist Eric Flemming was active in the club.|$|E

Contemporary sources from 1912 are lacking, suggesting that the story was apocryphal, however.

50|$|In recent years, the Space Frontier Foundation {{has been}} {{supportive}} of various private sector efforts {{such as the}} Ansari X Prize, the SpaceShipOne project, and entrepreneur Robert Bigelow's {{plans to build a}} space hotel.

For example, the Foundation has criticized NASA's Space Shuttle and Ares I, claiming that the shuttle's work could be better done by private sector companies. However, the Foundation has supported some recent NASA efforts, such as NASA's Centennial <b>Challenges</b> <b>prize</b> program for stimulating private-sector innovation and the new NASA direction of cancelling Constellation in favour of technology development and supporting commercial companies.|$|R
