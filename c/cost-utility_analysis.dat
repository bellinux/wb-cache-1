40|$|Australia {{supports}} {{the control of}} tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea for reasons of aid effectiveness {{and a desire to}} decrease the chance of importing tuberculosis to Australia. This paper analyses the case for this support using both <b>cost-utility</b> and cost-benefit <b>analysis.</b> We reach three conclusions. First, Australia directly benefits from its investment in controlling tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea, with a cost of $US 13 million (in 2012 prices) over 10 years earning a net present value of $US 22 million. Second, the longer and more extensive the basic directly observed short course therapy, or basic DOTS, to control tuberculosis, the higher are the returns for Australia. Finally, in addition to surpassing all commonly used benchmarks for being a cost-effective investment for Australia, a basic DOTS expansion also generates a health benefit for Papua New Guinea that compares well as one of the ‘ten best health buys’ in developing countries...|$|R

We start with an overview of the cost implications of child and adolescent mental health problems across a range of health, social care and other sectors, and provide evidence for the long-term cost consequences of child and adolescent mental health problems as individuals move into adulthood. We then describe the types of methods used for the economic evaluation of interventions and treatments for young people with mental health problems (cost-offset, cost-effectiveness, <b>cost-utility</b> and cost-benefit <b>analysis).</b> We consider the relevance of economic evidence both for professional practice and for strategic decisions about how to allocate available resources so as to get more out of them (in terms of – for example – better outcomes for children and families, or a fairer distribution of access or use of services), and about the incentives needed to help achieve those allocations...|$|R

However, there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of the intervention in these target groups. From 1997 on most analysts have taken this partly into account by distinguishing between invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease. In order to be relevant, future analyses should use quality adjusted life-years, adapt life-expectancy for people at risk of infection, narrow the targeted age groups, include realistic programme costs and discuss the potential influence of unrelated future costs. Finally, estimating the impact of antimicrobial resistance (not included in any of the analyses) seems particularly challenging for the future...|$|R

Cost estimates were biased because of difficulties of diagnosis; exclusion of patients who do not seek healthcare; exclusion of over-the-counter medication; difficulties in estimating productivity loss. There is limited evidence on costs of seasonal/perennial and intermittent/persistent AR. Little is known of the economic value of pharmacotherapy of AR, although levocetirizine appears to be cost-effective as compared with placebo. Economic evaluations suffered limitations from small sample sizes, short trial duration, lack of standardized effectiveness measure, restricted scope of costs.

40|$|Laboratory testing {{as a part}} of {{laboratory}} in vitro diagnostic (IVD) has become required tool in clinical practice for diagnosing, monitoring and prognosis of diseases, as well as for prediction of treatment response. The number of IVD tests available in laboratory practice has increased over the past decades and is likely to further increase in the future. Consequently, there is growing concern about the overutilization {{of laboratory}} tests and rising costs for laboratory testing. It is estimated that IVD accounts for between 1. 4 and 2. 3 % of total healthcare expenditure and less than 5 % of total hospital cost (Lewin Group report). These costs are rather low when compared to pharmaceuticals and medical aids which account for 15 and 5 %, respectively. On the other hand, IVD tests {{play an important role in}} clinical practice, as they influence from 60 % to 70 % of clinical decision-making. Unfortunately, constant increases in healthcare spending are not directly related to healthcare benefit. Since healthcare resources are limited, health payers are interested whether the benefits of IVD tests are actually worth their cost. Many articles have introduced frameworks to assess the economic value of IVD tests. The most appropriate tool for quantitative assessment of their economic value is cost-effectiveness (CEA) and <b>cost-utility</b> (CUA) <b>analysis.</b> The both analysis determine cost in terms of effectiveness or utilities (combine quantity and quality of life) of new laboratory test against its alternative. On the other hand, some investigators recommended calculation of laboratory test value as product of two ratios: Laboratory test value = (Technical accuracy/Turnaround time) × (Utility/Costs). Recently, some researches used multicriteria decision analysis which allows comparison of diagnostic strategies in terms of benefits, opportunities, costs and risks. All analyses are constructed to identify laboratory test that produce the greatest healthcare benefit with the resources available. Without solid evidence that certain laboratory tests are cost-effective, laboratory services cannot be improved. Consequently, simple policy measures such as cost cutting may be imposed upon many laboratories while patients will have limited access to laboratory service...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{scarcity}} of resources, combined with increased demand {{and the introduction of}} newer, more expensive technologies, choices have to be made about the allocation of funds between competing therapeutic options and priorities. Economic evaluation provides a means of making such choices more rational and the allocation of resources more efficient. Essentially, there are four types of health-economic evaluation: cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, <b>cost-utility</b> and cost-benefit <b>analysis.</b> Costs associated with cardiovascular care amount to 12 - 13 % of the Swedish healthcare budget. Most of the direct costs associated with treating cardiovascular disease are spent on inpatient care. The indirect costs associated with morbidity and mortality are much greater than direct costs. The treatment of hypertension provides {{a good example of how}} direct costs of therapy must be balanced against long-term benefits. Long-term costs of uncontrolled hypertension include those resulting from other cardiovascular diseases for which hypertension is a significant risk factor, involving the brain, kidneys and arterial system. Benefits from anti-hypertensive therapy are greater in older patients and in those with more severe blood pressure elevation.

40|$|Objective: A {{consequence}} of the integration of psychiatry into acute and public health medicine is that psychiatrists {{are being asked to}} evaluate their services. There is pressure on mental health-care systems because it is recognized that funds should be directed where they can provide the best health outcomes, and also because there are resource constraints which limit our capacity to meet all demands for health care. This pressure can be responded to by evaluation which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of psychiatric treatment. This paper seeks to remind psychiatrists of the fundamental principles of economic evaluation in the hope that these will enable psychiatrists to understand the methods used in evaluation and to work comfortably with evaluators. Method: The paper reviews the basic principles behind economic evaluation, illustrating these with reference to case studies. It describes: (i) the cost of the burden of illness and treatment, and how these costs are measured; (ii) the measurement of treatment outcomes, both as changes in health status and as resources saved; and (iii) the various types of economic evaluation, including cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, <b>cost-utility</b> and cost-benefit <b>analysis.</b> Results: The advice in the paper provides psychiatrists with the necessary background to work closely with evaluators. A checklist of the critical questions to be addressed is provided as a guide for those undertaking economic evaluations.

Women are approximately twice as susceptible as males, but males are more likely to have progressive disease. The onset of the disease normally occurs between 20 and 40 years of age, with a peak incidence during the late twenties and early thirties, resulting in many years of disability for a large proportion of patients, many of whom require wheelchairs and some nursing home or hospital care. The aim of this study is to update a previous review which considered the cost-effectiveness of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), such as interferons and glatiramer acetate, with more up to date therapies, such as mitaxantrone hydrochloride and natalizumab in the treatment of MS. The development and availability of new agents has been accompanied byan increased optimism that treatment regimens for MS would be more effective; that the number, severity and duration of relapses would diminish; that disease progression would be delayed; and that disability accumulation would be reduced. However, doubts have been expressed about the effectiveness of these treatments, which has only served to compound the problems associated with endeavors to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of such interventions.

40|$|Valuing {{the health}} of {{children}} for <b>cost-utility</b> or cost-benefit <b>analysis</b> poses a number of additional challenges when compared with valuing adult health. Some of these challenges relate to the inability of young children to value changes in health directly and the potential biases associated with using proxy respondents. Other challenges arise from children {{not being able to}} perform as independent economic actors, but dependent on others for care and decision making. In addition, illness in children may affect parent/caregiver quality of life, further complicating the measurement of value associated with a change in a child's health status. We review the most common approaches (QALYs and willingness-to-pay values) for valuing health in economic evaluations and consider the methodological and practical issues associated with measuring child health using each framework. Recommendations for advancing the field of valuing child health for economic evaluations will vary by age; a `one size fits all' approach does not readily fit. Although limitations exist for all of the methods considered for valuing child health, the currently recommended approach for infants and preschoolers is direct valuation by a proxy respondent. For school-age children and adolescents, existing multi-attribute instruments can be applied in some situations but direct valuation may be required for others. Future research should focus on minimising bias from proxy respondents, consideration of a family- or household-based approach to valuing health effects, and development of generic instruments with domains that are appropriate to children and that vary with age.

For each treatment option the costs and quality adjusted life years were calculated to estimate the incremental <b>cost-utility</b> ratio. The <b>analysis</b> was performed from the perspective of the Polish public payer and society over a 30 -years time horizon. The clinical parameters were derived mainly from the PURSUIT-SC and PURSUIT-M clinical trials. Different direct and indirect costs and utility values were assigned to the various model health states. The treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with golimumab/standard care instead of a standard care alone resulted in 0. 122 additional years of life with full health. The treatment with golimumab/standard care was found to be more expensive than treatment with the standard care alone from the public payer perspective and from social perspective. The incremental cost-utility ratio of golimumab/standard care compared to the standard care alone is estimated to be 391, 252 PLN/QALY gained (93, 155 €/QALYG) from public payer perspective and 374, 377 PLN/QALY gained (89, 137 €/QALYG) from social perspective.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} disease {{characterized}} by acute symptomatic episodes with variable severity and duration. Pharmacological asthma management aims {{to achieve and}} maintain control without side effects, thus improving {{quality of life and}} reducing the economic impact. Recently, a clinical trial showed the non-inferiority of beclomethasone/formoterol (BDP/F) versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) in adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma. However, this study did not provide evidence on costs and did not quantify quality-of-life parameters. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of BDP/F versus FP/S in patients with moderate to severe asthma from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model (MM) was used, with five health states for the different levels of asthma control: successful control, sub-optimal control, outpatient-managed exacerbation, inpatient-managed exacerbation, and death. Model data were derived from the ICAT SE study and from expert panels. Three outcomes were considered: time spent in successful control state, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The model shows that BDP/F treatment led to a slight increase of weeks in successful control compared with FP/S, with a lower cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlights that in 64 % and 68 % of the Monte Carlo simulations, BDP/F outperformed FP/S in terms of weeks in successful control and QALYs. Considering the expected cost of the two strategies, in 90 % of simulations BDP/F was the least expensive choice. In particular, BDP/F was cost saving as compared with FP/S in about 63 % and 59 % of simulations as shown by the <b>cost-utility</b> and cost-effectiveness <b>analysis,</b> respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, from the Italian NHS perspective, BDP/F treatment is associated with a reduction in cost and offers a slight increase of effectiveness in terms of weeks spent in successful control and QALYs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several {{systematic}} reviews {{have suggested}} that greater nurse staffing {{as well as a}} greater proportion of registered nurses in the health workforce is associated with better patient outcomes. Others have found that nurses can substitute for doctors safely and effectively in a variety of settings. However, these reviews do not generally consider the effect of nurse staff on both patient outcomes and costs of care, and therefore say little about the cost-effectiveness of nurse-provided care. Therefore, we conducted a scoping literature review of economic evaluation studies which consider the link between nurse staffing, skill mix within the nursing team and between nurses and other medical staff to determine the nature of the available economic evidence. DESIGN: Scoping literature review. DATA SOURCES: English-language manuscripts, published between 1989 and 2009, focussing on the relationship between costs and effects of care and the level of registered nurse staffing or nurse-physician substitution/nursing skill mix in the clinical team, using cost-effectiveness, <b>cost-utility,</b> or cost-benefit <b>analysis.</b> Articles selected for the review were identified through Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Google Scholar database searches. REVIEW METHODS: After selecting 17 articles representing 16 unique studies for review, we summarized their main findings, and assessed their methodological quality using criteria derived from recommendations from the guidelines proposed by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health Care. RESULTS: In general, it was found that nurses can provide cost effective care, compared to other health professionals. On the other hand, more intensive nurse staffing was associated with both better outcomes and more expensive care, and therefore cost effectiveness was not easy to assess. CONCLUSIONS: Although considerable progress in economic evaluation studies has been reached in recent years, a number of methodological issues remain. In the future, nurse researchers should be more actively engaged in the design and implementation of economic evaluation studies of the services they provide...|$|R

In this study, patients were randomized to receive either OncoVAX (R) therapy or no therapy after surgical resection {{of the primary}} tumor and stratified by stage of disease. Since the biologic essence of the effective tumor immunotherapy is the presence in the vaccine of a minimum number of viable, metabolically active, autologous tumor cells, the processing of the vaccine product, occurred within 48 h after surgery. Analysis of prognostic benefit in the pivotal phase III trial, with a 5. 8 year median follow-up, showed that a beneficial effect of OncoVAX (R) is statistically significant for all endpoints including recurrence-free interval, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival in Stage II colon cancer patients. Surgery alone cures approximately 65 % of Stage II (Dukes B- 2, B- 3) colon cancer patients. In the remaining patients, OncoVAX (R) in an adjuvant setting, significantly prolongs recurrence-free interval (57. 1 % relative risk reduction) and significantly improves 5 -year overall survival and recurrence-free survival. No statistically significant prognostic benefits were achieved in Stage III (Duke's C- 1 -C- 3) patients. A health economics assessment was performed on these results in Stage II colon cancer patients using disease-free survival and overall survival (for the entire intent-to-treat population).

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS, also called myalgic encephalomyelitis/encephalopathy or ME) is a debilitating condition with no known cause or cure. Improvement may occur with {{medical care and}} additional therapies of pacing, cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy. The latter two therapies {{have been found to}} be efficacious in small trials, but patient organisations' surveys have reported adverse effects. Although pacing has been advocated by patient organisations, it lacks empirical support. Specialist medical care is commonly provided but its efficacy when given alone is not established. This trial compares the efficacy of the additional therapies when added to specialist medical care against specialist medical care alone. Methods/Design 600 patients, who meet operationalised diagnostic criteria for CFS, will be recruited from secondary care into a randomised trial of four treatments, stratified by current comorbid depressive episode and different CFS/ME criteria. The four treatments are standardised specialist medical care either given alone, or with adaptive pacing therapy or cognitive behaviour therapy or graded exercise therapy. Supplementary therapies will involve fourteen sessions over 23 weeks and a 'booster session' at 36 weeks. Outcome will be assessed at 12, 24, and 52 weeks after randomisation. Two primary outcomes of self-rated fatigue and physical function will assess differential effects of each treatment on these measures. Secondary outcomes include adverse events and reactions, subjective measures of symptoms, mood, sleep and function and objective measures of physical activity, fitness, cost-effectiveness and <b>cost-utility.</b> The primary <b>analysis</b> will be based on intention to treat and will use logistic regression models to compare treatments. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by repeated measures analysis of variance with a linear mixed model. All analyses will allow for stratification factors. Mediators and moderators will be explored using multiple linear and logistic regression techniques with interactive terms, with the sample split into two to allow validation of the initial models. Economic analyses will incorporate sensitivity measures. Discussion The results of the trial will provide information about the benefits and adverse effects of these treatments, their cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, the process of clinical improvement and the predictors of efficacy. </p...|$|R

[...] As early as 2005 McCabe et al argued that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general. Drummond et al argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along than the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the health}} status is {{assessed}} from the description part, the 5-digit number {{can be converted}} into a preference weight which is {{also referred to as}} a single weighted index score. It can be done by using methods for generating HRQoL weights, such as visual analogue scale (VAS), the time-trade-off (TTO), and the standard gamble (SG). The choice of the valuation methods can vary. The initial purpose of having visual analogue scale in the EQ-5D questionnaire was to get preference weights using the scale, but the time-trade-off has become favored because it is a [...] "choice task", not a [...] "rating task" [...] which easily involves some scaling bias. Time-trade-off is recommended when performing <b>cost-utility</b> <b>analysis</b> using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as an outcome, but other methods could be chosen for different type of analyses. A value set was developed using time-trade-off in many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Japan, and Germany. The index score of a value set derived from the general population sample can be regarded as a [...] "societal valuation of the respondent's health state" [...] in that country. In contrast, the scores from the visual analogue scale in the questionnaire indicates the respondent's own assessment of his/her health status".|$|E
