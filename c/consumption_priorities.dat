Specifically, the calculated redirection of <b>consumption</b> <b>priorities</b> by those reduced to subsistence levels is {{embodied in the}} utility function and the biological necessity of consuming sufficient nutrition to support health is modeled as a subsistence constraint. This methodology is then applied to the potato culture that existed in Ireland prior to the 1845 - 48 famine. It is suggested that the evolution of this culture was shaped by subsistence-driven behavior similar to the behavior that underlies the Giffen effect.

30|$|Theoretically, {{people are}} desired to always improve their {{consumption}} standards, {{but due to}} income limitations, individual <b>consumption</b> <b>priorities</b> vary. Therefore, there emerges a hierarchical structure in consumption patterns in terms of people’s need-oriented consumption. Friedrich Engels, writing in the preface for Wage Labour and Capital (1891), classified consumption types into “means of life, of the enjoyment of life, and of the development and activity of all bodily and mental faculties” (see Marx 1961). Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs categorized personal needs into physiological needs, safety needs, the need for love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Maslow argued that people would meet their needs sequentially, that is to satisfy physiological needs first and to satisfy self-actualization last. As for the lower class, {{to the need for}} survival is fundamental: humans must survive first, and only then seek development. Adopting a quantitative methodology to distinguish household-based consumption data from survival-oriented consumption (basic consumption required to maintain household labour for production and reproduction) and development-oriented consumption (pursuit of improved living standards and future development opportunities) 6 has significant implications for policymakers as they implement top-down design: to not only initiate targeted methods to boost the consumer market, but also to provide recommendations for the supply-side reform.|$|E

This study considers the factors determining Permethrin Impregnated Bednets (PIB) use {{in the context of}} a PIB promotion project in a rural area of Benin undertaken between 1992 and 1995. Quantitative data, on socio-demographic characteristics, malaria knowledge, attitudes, and practices, were gathered from 191 households of PIB users and non-users for comparative purposes using a questionnaire format. Qualitative data were collected from 23 focus group discussion sessions and 16 semi structured interviews. Women's income, men's educational level, and women's participation in communal organizations were the principal variables distinguishing user households from non-user households. Recourse to non-western medicine and, in particular, to medicinal teas which are considered preventive or curative correlates negatively with PIB use. The qualitative data shows that informants consider exposure to the sun, especially while engaged in agriculture work, a principal cause of malaria, and that PIB adoption is not considered justified in a context where there is a quasi chronic shortage of financial resources and where confidence in the efficacy of non-western medicine prevails. Because they have primary responsibility for the health of their families and are more aware of children's vulnerability to malaria, women are more inclined than men to want to buy PIBs. However, because the household head, who is most often male, sets family <b>consumption</b> <b>priorities</b> using family income, women often have to resort to using their own income, which is often considerably lower than that of men, to buy PIBs. Support for community initiatives which are directed to women's work, linked with intensive effort to sensitize men to the mechanisms of malaria transmission and the principal groups at risk, is seen as a means to increase PIB acquisition and use.

Lizards were collected over a four month period (August-November) in which the carcasses were dissected allowing for the measurement of fat body tissue content as well as concentrations of glycogen present in ~ 25 - 75 mg subsamples of liver. Results suggest a correlation between lipid storage and glycogen storage. Fat body content in hatching lizards significantly differed over time (F= 5. 318, p= 0. 002, r 2 = 0. 512), and a graphical trend relating a significant increase in fat body content between the months of September and October. While the total glycogen content did not show a significant difference between dates (p= 0. 228, r 2 = 0. 138), graphical trends also reveal an increase in total glycogen content between the months October and November.

40|$|In {{traditional}} literature, {{a number}} of authors posit that physicians, like a consumer or a firm, adopt maximization behavior, while others claim that they are motivated by the attainment of a target income. These three approaches may seem contradictory, yet the present study aims {{to show that they}} are in fact complementary. This paper aims to highlight the overlapping of these approaches by using a theoretical model - the agent model. From this model, we deduce the income effect, the individualistic substitution effect, the monopolistic effect and their respective elasticities to detect target income behavior. We develop also two theoretical models of leisure and income renouncement to determine the priority which the physician gives to consumption and leisure. Unlike other models, our results show that about 20 % of physicians prefer to reach an altruistic objective rather than a leisure or an target income. These last result implies a ranking of target priorities. Moreover, we observe that the Slutsky relation cannot be used to determine individualistic substitution, monopolistic substitution and income effects exactly when leisure is an inferior good. Nor can we confirm the adoption of a target income behavior when income and monopolistic elasticities are negative. Renouncement models indicate that between 60 % and 67 % of GPs have a clear <b>consumption</b> <b>priority</b> and that they accept a renouncement of their leisure in order to maintain their current level of income. Our results demonstrate that it would be necessary to introduce monopolistic power of physicians and their altruistic priority to test inducement demand. ...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{critical}} services over Internet often rely on geographically distributed architectures of replicated servers. Content Delivery Networks (CDN) are {{a typical}} example where service {{is based on}} a distributed architecture of replica servers to guarantee resource availability and proximity to final users. In such distributed systems, network links are not dedicated, and may be subject to external traffic. This brings up the need to develop access control policies that adapt to network load changing conditions. Further, Internet services are mainly session based, thus an access control support must take into account a proper differentiation of requests and perform session based decisions while considering the dynamic availability of resources due to external traffic. In this paper we introduce a distributed architecture with access control capabilities at session aware access points. We consider two types of services characterized by different patterns of resource <b>consumption</b> and <b>priorities.</b> We formulate a Markov Modulated Poisson Decision Process for access control that captures the heterogeneity of multimedia services and the variable availability of resources due to external traffic. The proposed model is optimized by means of stochastic analysis, showing the impact of external traffic on service quality. The structural properties of the optimal solutions are studied and considered {{as the basis for the}} formulation of heuristics. The performance of the proposed heuristics is studied by means of simulations, showing that in some typical scenario they perform close to the optimum. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

Our criteria for success is that the boat should receive sufficient power to run anywhere in a 2. 5 meter squared area. Having defined the field in which power will be required by our boat, we will fill this field with microwave RF energy.

Degrowth touted {{as an alternative to}} mainstream paradigms of development, aims to ensure a high quality of life for people in a society where work, production and consumption are reduced. As a weapon to the problems accrued by capitalism, degrowth reorients the current unsustainable and inequitable path through the transition to a smaller economy with less production and consumption. By arguing that natural limits to growth of many destinations have already been surpassed and their carrying capacity levels have been reached, degrowth proposes the abandonment of growth which promotes nothing other than a quest for profits on part of the owners of capital and results in disastrous implications for the environment and the humanity. As a philosophical concept and movement, degrowth is revolutionary and anticapitalist directed to sustainable change which results from an interest in locality and place, small and medium-sized enterprises, employment generation and reduction in working hours, ecology and quality of life, decommodification of tourism activity, carbon reduction in transport, changed pattern of production and <b>consumption,</b> and high <b>priority</b> in the travel experience...|$|R

This review identified promising results of BI for women, especially pregnant women and female college students, in different forms of application (face-to-face, by computer or telephone) despite a substantial heterogeneity in the clinical trials analyzed. in primary care, which is a setting involving quite different characteristics, the results among women were rather unclear. in general, the results indicated a decrease in alcohol consumption among women following BI, both in the number of days of consumption and the number of doses, suggesting that the impact on the woman's reproductive health and the lower social acceptance of female consumption can be aspects favorable for the effectiveness of BI in this population.

40|$|The rise of {{renewable}} energy has generated tensions over its means and ends. Civil society groups have been promoting decentralisation of energy production, greater community control over resources and equitable access. Renewable energy {{has been seen as}} a special opportunity due its spatially distributed sources, for example, wind, sun, biomass, etc. In response to such proposals, energy decentralisation has been linked with renewable energy sources by some governments and local authorities, especially in Scandinavia. A similar vision also has appeared in many UK policy documents on decarbonisation over the past decade. Together these policies aim to enhance community involvement and GHG savings through renewable energy, including bioenergy. Focusing on the UK government’s innovation priorities, this paper addresses the following questions: How do UK policy incentives shape future bioenergy? How do priorities link innovation, infrastructures and knowledge? Here we argue that UK support measures generally promote bioenergy innovation as input-substitutes to supply centralised infrastructures for current <b>consumption</b> patterns. These <b>priorities</b> arise partly from the UK state’s relatively weak capacity to implement energy innovation, which remains dependent on large private-sector companies. Dominant pathways involve several epistemic assumptions, for example, that cost-effective GHG reductions correspond to inherent efficiencies of large-scale systems; that national economic benefits correspond to large companies selling novel technology or licensing patents abroad; and that mere input-substitution or fossil fuels is politically more reliable...|$|R
30|$|To begin with, {{note that}} there are no {{statistically}} significant differences across groups in the drought phase. Further, for all but the left out group, the average price per TLU increases in the recovery phase compared to the drought phase. In addition, the differences across groups in the recovery phase become significant in a variety of comparisons but most noticeably in the left out group receiving less per TLU than all the other groups. There is some further evidence that the moving from and combining groups do better than the staying with group as well. The main finding to stress with regard to the left out group is they are left out in a further dimension; prices of livestock for the other groups recover as the drought ends, but they remain relatively stagnant for the left out group. If we recall from Table  5 that they sell about the same rate in both drought and recovery, we see that they may fall further behind the other groups in recovery. Note that the decline in sales rates seen in the recovery phase for the moving out and combining groups may be possible due to the higher price per TLU they are realizing. Perhaps, the left out groups are less able to bargain as immediate <b>consumption</b> needs take <b>priority</b> as suggested by the results of Turner and Williams (2002), or possibly, the animals are in qualitatively worse condition due to the limited mobility and limited access to inputs revealed in the data analysis presented above.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} one of the public health <b>priorities.</b> <b>Consumption</b> of oral {{contraceptives}} increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and it still remains a concern. This study aimed to investigate the effect of exposure on pill contraceptive low-dose  levels on homocysteine and nitric oxide. methods: In this cohort (retrospective+ prospective) study, 100 women with normal menstrual cycle aged betwen 20 - 35 years old refered to health care centers of Yazd, Iran in 2015.   This study was conducted through face to face interviews by the researcher who asked for demographic and anthropometric characteristics. Anthropometic indices  was measured and the levels of homosysteine and nitric oxide was determined. The data were analyzed using t-test, chi- square test and ANOVA by SPSS 21. Results: The mean and standard deviation of homocysteine levels in the exposed group acompared to non-exposed group were (3 / 848 ± 2 / 357 μmol/L) and (3 / 284 ± 1 / 616 μmol/L) as well as the mean and standard deviation of nitric oxide in the exposed group were (p-value= 0 / 41) and (181 / 360 ± 90 / 44 μM) and in the non-exposed group were (162 / 654 ± 90 / 913 μM) and (p-value= 0 / 29), respectively. According to these results, there was not found any statistical significant  difference among these results. Conclusion: Taking low dose oral contraceptives in healthy women did not change any differences in homocysteine and nitric oxide levels as a modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Special {{interest}} tourists demand high-quality accommodation {{that respects}} its local environment and resources, enhances existing cultures, whilst meeting their expectations {{in terms of}} comfort and service. With its mix of volcanoes, monkey puzzle tree forests, indigenous Mapuche culture, ski resorts and {{a high concentration of}} National Parks, the micro-region of Araucania Andina in Chile’s 9 th Region has become increasingly attractive as a destination for this type of tourist. As this demand increases the infrastructure of the region must adapt and evolve. Accommodation must provide comfort both during the cold wet winters which coincide with the main influx of international tourists and the short hot summers of the local peak holiday season. At the same time minimizing energy <b>consumption</b> is a <b>priority</b> in the face of national and international energy shortages and in some cases lack of connection to the national grid due to isolated locations. This paper presents a review of the current tourism accommodation available in the micro-region, including post occupancy evaluation of selected cabins, hostels, lodges and Bed and Breakfast establishments with in situ measurements of summer and winter dry bulb temperature and relative humidity. Initial results show that most accommodation is inefficient in its energy use and provides poor hygro-thermal comfort. However innovation and some exemplary projects do exist. The findings of this paper form the benchmark for the design of a sustainable construction system, using local resources for thermal insulation, and the transfer of technology and best practice in energy generation, waste disposal, sewage water plants and heating systems for the tourism infrastructure in the micro-region of Araucania Andina...|$|R
