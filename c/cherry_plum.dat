25|$|Chianti Classico {{wines are}} characterised in their youth by their {{predominantly}} floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet. As the wine ages, aromas of tobacco and leather can emerge. Chiantis {{tend to have}} medium-high acidity and medium tannins.

Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of <b>cherry,</b> <b>plum</b> and raspberry and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert Tom Stevenson notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.|$|E
