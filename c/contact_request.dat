This paper discusses the problem of spam over IP telephony and reviews published techniques to reject likely nuisance callers. The techniques investigated include content filtering, black lists, white lists, gray lists, call rate monitoring, IP/domain correlation, reputation systems, consent-based communications, address obfuscation, limited-use addresses, computational puzzles, Turing tests, payments at risk, legislation, centralized SIP providers, circles of trust and authenticated identity. The advantages and disadvantages of each are analyzed. It is concluded that no single technique is sufficient and that a framework of multiple techniques is required.

40|$|While {{recognising}} {{that the}} current compliance system is still evolving, this report identifies among its strengths the greater flexibility it gives providers, the improved structure of sanctions {{and the value of}} the <b>Contact</b> <b>Request</b> option. As a background to its conclusions and recommendations, the Review noted that the new compliance system remained in an evolutionary stage {{at the end of its}} first year. The same applied to the Job Services Australia (JSA) and Disability Employment Services (DES) systems which were introduced at the same time and have considerable impacts on the operation of the new compliance system. SOME STRENGTHS The Review concluded that at the end of its first year the new compliance system appeared to be operating in line with the Government’s stated objectives of improving engagement with job seekers and providing better protection of highly vulnerable job seekers. Key features which have been positively received, and appear to be working well, include: 	greater flexibility for providers (especially through the new <b>Contact</b> <b>Request</b> option and greater discretion to re-engage job seekers without initiating compliance action); 	the new structure of failures and sanctions (leading, as intended, to an increased number of early, lower-level sanctions and a major reduction in high-level sanctions); 	 improved ways of engaging with job seekers (especially the <b>Contact</b> <b>Request</b> option, Comprehensive Compliance Assessment process, and Compliance Activity option); 	better protection for highly vulnerable job seekers (especially through the use of Vulnerability Indicators and the new Comprehensive Compliance Assessment process). SOME DIRECTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT The new compliance system appears to be a significant improvement on the previous system. Nevertheless, the Review identified a number of directions in which there remains room for further improvement. They include: 	less complexity and more transparency in the rules, processes, IT systems and other official materials affecting the operation of the compliance system, JSA and DES; 	better communication and interaction between relevant government agencies, and by them with employment service providers and job seekers; 	higher attendance rates by job seekers at meetings with providers and at required participation activities; 	further intensification of reviews for some job seekers (especially those who may be persistent evaders of participation requirements or face major barriers to compliance).  SOME RELATED ISSUES The Review also considered some aspects of the changing context in which the new system is operating, especially the contemporaneous introduction of JSA and DES. In particular, it identified some strengths and concerns in relation to the impact on the compliance system of changes affecting 	assessments of the barriers faced by individual job seekers and of the assistance with which they should be provided; 	development and notification of participation requirements for individual job seekers through Employment Pathway Plans; 	exemptions of some job seekers from engagement with employment service providers; 	performance monitoring of employment service providers. RECOMMENDATIONS Among an extensive range of recommendations the report proposes that: 	the system 2 ̆ 7 s documentation should be simplified and clarified; 	the interoperability of the IT systems should be improved; 	stats on the system should be regular and reliable; 	an independent consultant should be engaged to undertake an Annual Report of the flow of Participation Reviews (PRs); 	a new Case Conference procedure should be introduced for job seekers incurring multiple PRs; and 	monitoring should be undertaken of job seeker attendance rates. The Independent Review of the Job Seeker Compliance Review was conducted by a panel comprising the following members: Prof Julian Disney (Chair); Ms Anna Buduls; Mr Peter Grant...|$|E

40|$|In current online social {{networks}} (OSNs) such as Facebook, a new connection request usually only includes {{the name and}} photo of the requestor and possibly a list of mutual contacts. Given {{that the creation of}} a forged user profile is not too complicated, it is challenging to verify if the <b>contact</b> <b>request</b> is indeed genuine or from a forged account. Accepting a connection invitation from a forged profile might severely compromise the user’s privacy, since the attacker gets access to a wealth of personal information and social relationships. In this paper, we present a novel and intuitive paradigm for secure establishment of friendship links in OSNs. We propose an interaction scheme that utilizes cues from snapshots captured using omnipresent smartphones to match and thus verify links in OSNs. We present a proof of concept implementation of our scheme using Android smartphones and embedding the same with Facebook. Finally, we show results from a user study with 25 participants, which demonstrates the intuitive and secure nature of our solution...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{structure}} of social networks provides constraints and opportunities on im-portant economic activities like public good provision and innovation sharing. Studying how network ties are formed, therefore, has valuable economic applications. In this paper, I study a common method of tie formation, 3 -point referrals, where two strangers (A and B) form a tie {{with each other}} through the introduction of a mutual ac-quaintance (M). I propose two mechanisms by which the strength of existing ties between A-M and B-M affect referral decisions. Stronger ties mean i) M has more information on A and B’s payoffs ii) M has more empathy on A and B’s payoffs. Game theoretical analysis at the triad level predicts that more information and balanced empathy result in more referrals, as A and B put more trust on M ’s referral decision and increase the probability that they initiate/accept a <b>contact</b> <b>request</b> through M ’s referral. Using 3 -point referral data from an online business social network, www. LinkedIn. com, I find evidence that both mechanisms are at work. This paper contributes to the existing social network literature in three dimensions-firstly, by linking strategic new tie formation to existing broader network structure; secondly, by providing empirical evidence from a large-scale, novel dataset; and thirdly, by providing policy guidelines for online network administrators on how to increase the total activity (and ex-ante welfare) in online social networks...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo analisar a interaÃÃo entre produtor/anunciante e leitor/consumidor por meio de categorias de anÃlise propostas por estudos da linguagem visual, em exemplares de gÃneros anÃncios. Para isso, seguimos a proposta teÃrico-metodolÃgica de Kress; van Leeuwen (2006) que, ao estruturarem uma gramÃtica para a anÃlise de imagens, apontam quatro princÃpios referentes Ã interaÃÃo interpessoal nos textos nÃo-verbais: o contato (pedido, interpelaÃÃo ou oferta), a distÃncia social (social, pessoal, Ãntimo), a atitude (objetividade ou subjetividade) e a modalidade (valor de verdade). Para a verificaÃÃo da interaÃÃo segundo as categorias, analisamos uma amostra composta por 40 exemplares de gÃneros anÃncios e apÃs esta anÃlise verificamos que a aplicabilidade das categorias de anÃlise propostas pelos autores se mostrou produtiva e recorrente em todos os exemplares analisados. Constatamos que, como propÃe a GramÃtica do Design Visual, com a utilizaÃÃo dos passos definidos pelo modelo teÃrico-metodolÃgico para construir uma imagem hÃ uma maior facilidade em atingir a interaÃÃo pretendida com o leitor. ConcluÃmos, portanto, que a construÃÃo e compreensÃo do texto nÃo-verbal nÃo acontece simplesmente de maneira intuitiva, pois existem caminhos, como a utilizaÃÃo do olhar, enquadramento e perspectiva adequados, que seguidos pelo produtor e pelo leitor do texto, proporcionam a interaÃÃo pretendida. This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} the interaction between producer/advertiser and reader/consumer through categories of analysis proposed by studies of visual language in examplaries of genres advertisements. For this, we follow the Kress, van Leeuwen (2006) theoretical-methodological proposal which when structuring a grammar for image analysis, suggest four principles related to interpersonal interaction in non-verbal texts: <b>contact</b> (<b>request,</b> summons or supply), social distance (social, personal, intimate), attitude (objectivity or subjectivity) and mode (truth value). To verify the interaction according to the categories, we analyzed a sample of 40 examplaries of genres advertisements and after this analysis {{we found that the}} applicability of the categories of analysis proposed by the authors showed up productive and recurrent in all examplaries analyzed. We noted that, as proposed by the Grammar of Visual Design, using the steps defined by the theoretical-methodological model to build an image there is a greater ease in achieving the desired interaction with the reader. We therefore conclude that the construction and understanding of non-verbal text does not simply happen intuitively, because there are ways, such as using the look, framing and perspective appropriate, followed by the producer and by the reader of the text, which provide the interaction required...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} a desk-top analyser, used in general practice, on the mean number of blood tests per contact, prescribed or analysed by general practitioners. A randomized controlled trial was used. The mean number of blood tests per <b>contact</b> <b>requested</b> by two groups of GPs, before and after the introduction of a Reflotron in the intervention group was compared. Practitioners were assigned to the control group or to the intervention group by stratified randomization. Flemish GPs, known by the Flemish Institute of General Practice as interested in research were enrolled into the study. There were two registration periods of 8 weeks each. The weekly number of doctor-patient <b>contacts</b> and all <b>requested</b> or performed blood tests for each patient were registered. During the second period the members of the intervention group were asked to use the Reflotron, following their own judgement, and to register the total number of tests per contact, performed with it, on a special form. In the Reflotron group there was a slight increase in the median of the relative differences between the intervention and the base-line period (3 %). In the control group the median of the relative differences decreased (- 7 %). The difference between both groups was not statistically significant (P = 0. 17).
