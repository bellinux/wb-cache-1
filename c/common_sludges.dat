40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{strategy}} is proposed {{to reduce the}} complexity of the activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM 1) which describes the biotransformation processes in a <b>common</b> activated <b>sludge</b> process with N-removal. The key feature of the obtained reduced model is that it combines high predictive value (all state variables keep their biological interpretation) with very low computation time. Therefore, this model is a valuable tool in a risk assessment environment (designed for the evaluation of wastewater treatment plants facing stricter effluent norms) as well as in on-line (MPC) control strategies. The complexity reduction procedure consists of four steps. In the first step representative input/output data sets are generated by simulating the full ASM 1 model. In the second step the ASM 1 model is rewritten in state space format with linear approximations of the nonlinear (kinetic) terms. In the third step the unknown parameters in the linear terms are identified based on the generated input/output data. To reduce the amount of parameter sets that have to be identified (to cover the full operation range of the plant), a Multi-Model interpolation procedure is introduced as a last step.

In this study, five processes including mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (CAD and TAD), mesophilic and thermophilic high-solids anaerobic digestion (HSAD and THSAD) and anaerobic digestion with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THPAD) are compared using life cycle environmental and economic assessment. Particularly, the uncertainty derived from variable sludge organic content and biogas production is analyzed.

However, for low-organic-content sludge, high-solids processes like THSAD and HSAD are much better than the others mainly owing to their less consumption of thermal energy.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to define new methodologies and new Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) schemes for urban waste water reuse for the {{sustainable}} irrigation of energy crops. In the new proposed scheme, wastewater is sent to the WWTP characterized by simplified treatment schemes, able to remove pathogens and dangerous components for the environment, but releasing nutrients useful for the fertigation of energy crops. The more important advancement is that the proposed plant has a significant operational flexibility, guaranteed by the possibility of gradually changing the plant configuration passing from the configuration of the irrigation period to that of the period without irrigation. The proposed plant is also able to selectively remove only the harmful substances. The wastewater reclamation is obtained modifying a <b>common</b> activated <b>sludge</b> process with predenitrification. Numerical simulations have been performed by implementing the ASM 1 model using SIMULINK in MATLAB code. For the sedimentation tank the model proposed by Takács has been used. The developed model allows us to run simulations in nonirrigated and irrigated periods, which are characterized by different plant configurations. The simulation results show that the effluent concentrations of the various substances (readily and slowly biodegradable organic matter, nitrites, nitrates and ammonia) are highly variable depending on the plant configuration. The advantage is that with the same system, by setting up a plant configuration rather than another, we can define the quality level of the effluents that may be more suitable for irrigation of the biomass or for protection of the receiving water...|$|R
40|$|Recycling play a {{key role}} on saving of natural {{resources}} and on reducing pollution. The recycling of aluminium alloys is also cost-effective, since it reduce the material cost and creates a considerable energy-saving. The use of recycled Al alloys (usually called secondary) has improved in recent years also because of their comparable mechanical properties with primary aluminium alloys. During the production of secondary aluminium alloys, the scrap are mixed regardless of their specific chemical composition, and then master alloys or pure elements are added to the molten metal. Furthermore, certain impurity elements are either difficult or expensive to remove, and their role in mechanical properties can be important. Due to the presence of these additional trace elements, a number of complex intermetallic phases can therefore form in multi-component Al-Si alloys. Mechanical and physical properties of alloys and castings are strongly related to sizes, morphologies and distribution of these intermetallic phases, which are in turn a function of alloy composition and cooling rate. The Al–Si based alloys are transversally used in different foundry processes. Among all the technologies, high-pressure die-casting (HPDC) represents the most common process to produce automotive components by secondary Al–Si alloys because it allows one to increase the production by lowering the cycle time and to obtain economically components with complex geometries and high quality surface. The effects of trace elements and intermetallics phases on features of aluminium castings are still not fully understood, especially when components are made by means of HPDC process. The motivation of the research presented in this doctoral thesis was, therefore, to fill this gap in knowledge. The study has aimed at understanding the influence of various trace elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of secondary die-cast aluminium alloys and, in particular, on secondary AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) die-cast alloys. A literature review and a sufficient background of previously reported results on the influence of trace elements on the features of aluminium alloys as well as the formation of intermetallic phases were carried out. It was found that the mechanical and microstructural analysis generally referred to primary cast Al alloys with low concentration of trace elements outside of those studied. Furthermore the samples were usually produced on gravity die-cast, while some intermetallics phases were frequently observed in high-pressure die-casting, where higher cooling rates and different feeding conditions exist. Special attention has been given to: The effects of Bismuth addition on secondary die-cast aluminium alloys: Bismuth substitute the lead in free-cutting wrought Al alloys, and this is leading to a steady increase of Bi content in secondary Al alloys due to the recycling process. The nucleation temperature of primary Fe-rich intermetallic compounds, as function of Fe, Mn and Cr content and cooling rate: Fe-rich phases have a high specific gravity and tend to segregate to the bottom of aluminium melts and holding furnaces. These phases form primary solid particles, generally called sludge, thus reduce the effective capacity of the furnace. The influence of Fe, Mn and Cr addition, separately or in combination, on the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of secondary die-cast aluminium alloys: sludge crystals are hard and brittle compact inclusions which can compromise the machining operations, with a considerable effects on the cutting tool life, and even more degrade the mechanical and physical properties of the component. As recycling of aluminium alloys becomes more <b>common,</b> <b>sludge</b> will be a problem of increasing importance due to the concentration of Fe, Mn and Cr in the scrap cycle...|$|R

30|$|The sludge {{found in}} crude oil storage tanks {{typically}} {{is made up}} of water, petroleum hydrocarbons, and solids. It forms when crude oil properties are changed due to several factors. Storage conditions, storage period, the composition of the crude oil, the amount of water and sediments, the temperature of the crude oil, and the mechanical conditions of the storage tanks represent the most <b>common</b> causes of <b>sludge</b> formation (Corti and Falcon 1989; Altunina and Svarovskaya 2012). Depending on the source of petroleum sludge, its composition can be quite varied, but typically, it is composed of 5 %– 90 % hydrocarbon oil phase, 1 %– 52 % water, and 0.8 %– 86 % solid particles (Goulin et al. 2011; Mansur et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2014; Monteiro et al. 2015; Lima et al. 2014). Sludges are produced by gradual settlement of heavy oil fractions such as asphaltene, paraffin, and solid particles; thus, they can be classified into asphaltene-based crude oil sludge, and paraffin-based crude oil sludge (Reynold and Heuer 1993; Woodrising Resources Ltd; McLean and Kilpatrick 1997; Jafari Behbahani et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Annually, {{large amounts}} wasted {{activated}} sludge {{are produced by}} municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTP’s). In the Netherlands annually ± 353 thousand tons of sludge is produced (Henze, et al. 2008). Due to strict regulations regarding the disposal of heavy metals on agricultural lands and corresponding risks of diseases spreading, it {{is not allowed to}} use wastewater sludge as fertilizer for agricultural purposes (Cimochowicz-Rybicka, 2013). Therefore sludge has to be incinerated for which the costs could rise up to 500 € per ton of wet sludge (Henze, et al. 2008). In order to reduce sludge volumes and therefore reduce sludge disposal costs, sludge has to be pre-treated. In the Netherlands, the most <b>common</b> <b>sludge</b> pre-treatment technique is thermal pressure hydrolysis (TH). TH is a costly process since large amounts of energy are consumed by heating the sludge (Schepers and Elzen, 2013). In addition, the TH system requires a lot of maintenance and is hardly scalable which in the future may cause problems regarding the growing world population, with the corresponding growing sludge production levels (Schepers and Elzen, 2013). In {{order to be able to}} handle the expected future sludge amounts new techniques have to be developed based on the improvement of sludge reduction, pathogen removal and increase of potential sludge benefits. In this study a newly developed sludge treatment technique is examined. The technique is developed by the company Whirlwind International and is based, on “active hydrodynamic cavitation” (Bakker, 2012). Literature describes ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ as a situation in which passive hydrodynamic cavitation is accompanied by external forces (Bakker, 2012). In this research ‘hydrodynamic cavitation’ was generated by using a constriction (venturi pipe) which caused a sudden pressure drop within a stream flow. A vibrating ball was placed within the constriction to create the ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ event. In this research it was chosen to use secondary sludge from WWTP Houtrust during the ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ treatments since literature shows that an active hydrodynamic cavitation especially has a positive effect on the conversion of secondary sludge during the digestion phase (Rens, et al. 2005) and has less effect on primary sludge (Nickel, 2002). The cavitation treated sludge was assessed on three parameters: 1. improvement of the methane production levels, 2. improvement of the dewatering efficiency and 3. improvement of the total suspended solids (TSS) reduction levels. Based on the results it can be concluded that an active hydrodynamic cavitation treatment can result in the improvement of the methane production levels up to ~ 20 %, improvement of the TSS reduction levels by 0 - 3 % and the improvement/decline of the dewatering efficiency by ± 3 %. Profitability results shows that profits related to extra methane production levels are of significant less importance than the profits that can be achieved by the improvement of TSS reduction levels and dewatering efficiencies. However due to the large data ranges in TSS reduction levels and dewatering efficiencies both profits and losses can be generated which on average can rise up to ± € 350, 000 per year which accounts for ± 17 % difference on the total yearly sludge treatment costs. Based on the current study it is not likely that profits can be generated since these calculations are mostly based on assumptions. Overall can be concluded that the effect of an active hydrodynamic cavitation treatment on the improvement of the profitability of waste water sludge is still doubtful since results show broad data ranges and several assumptions were made for the calculations. Further research is needed to obtain a dataset without these data ranges and should especially be focused on the improvement of dewatering efficiencies...|$|R

However, complying with health and environmental standards is necessary before applying biosolids to land. Thus, sludge stabilization is required to make biosolids safe enough for their agricultural use. Side effects of stabilization processes on agronomic features of sewage sludge are not quite known, although their understanding is essential for biosolids management. Based on a model equivalent to the Mitscherlich equation, effects of the most <b>common</b> processes for <b>sludge</b> stabilization were evaluated (composting, liming, heat-drying and solar irradiation) in relation to the agronomic effectiveness of biosolids to yield Lolium perenne L. on two tropical soils, with NH 4 H 2 PO 4 as a reference. Sewage stabilization processes have affected the ability of biosolids to promote plant growth. Their effectiveness was usually higher than fertilizer in a Spodosol and lower in an Oxisol. Solar-irradiated sludge presented the highest effectiveness among the biosolids and reached peak yields at the lowest application rate independent on soil type.

A combined reed bed – freezing bed technology has been successfully developed to dewater and treat septage. Lab column studies established that freeze-thaw conditioning can restore drainage in clogged sand drying beds dosed with <b>common</b> biological <b>sludges</b> and that septage can be dosed at 10 cm/week for 2. 5 - 5. 0 months before clogging is observed. Pilot studies showed that freezing beds can operate without the need for a cover with the applied sludge effectively melting any snow cover in regions with moderate snowfall. Septage freezing was successfully modelled following an accepted model for ice formation on water bodies while septage thawing was modelled using a regression analysis with initial frozen depth and precipitation found to be insignificant and degree days of warming controlling the rate of thawing. Model results were utilized to produce a freezing bed design loading map for North America based on temperature normals. Field scale planted and unplanted reed bed – freezing bed systems were constructed and tested with varying hydraulic loading rates (1. 9 - 5. 9 m/y) and solid loading rates (43 - 144 kg/m 2 /y) over a 5 year period resulting in a recommended design hydraulic loading rate of 2. 9 m/y or 75 kg/m 2 /y. Drainage rates doubled after freeze-thaw conditioning compared to during the growing season, suggesting that freeze-thaw conditioning restores filter hydraulic conductivity. No effect of solid loading rate, planted versus unplanted filters and 7 versus 21 d dosing cycles on filter drainage was observed; however, drainage varied significantly with hydraulic loading rate. The filters separated almost all contaminants with filtrate equivalent to a low-strength domestic wastewater which can be easily treated in any municipal or decentralized wastewater system. The dewatered sludge cake had similar nutrient and solid content to a solid dairy manure and met biosolid land application standards in terms of metals and pathogens.

The present work aimed {{to study the}} initial effects of a dosage of chlorine to control bulking in lab bench scale using a Jar-test. Although results of the monitoring of the treatment effluent system indicate good efficiency, Thiothrix I and Type 0675 bacteria were identified. In the first phase, doses were tested in the return sludge with sodium hypochlorite of 125 g L- 1 of active chlorine. A concentration of 25 mg L- 1 showed a positive effect after 1 h of sedimentation, breaking the filaments. In the second phase, concentrations of 20 to 27 mg L- 1 were tested, relating them to the total suspended solids and settled volume at 1 h. The concentration of 25 mg L- 1 showed a positive effect: the total suspended solids of return sludge showed values of 4933 mg L- 1 and a settled volume of 947 mL L- 1, whereas the control was 943 mL L- 1. This concentration helped sedimentation of sludge, but has affected the activities of other microorganisms. A possible explanation for why only high doses had {{a positive effect on}} the bacteria could be due to the presence of a sheath that acted as a protective cover against external agents in this species of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge (municipal, or industrial) {{treatment}} {{is still a}} problem in so far {{that it is not}} satisfactorily resolved in terms of cost and final disposal. Two <b>common</b> forms of <b>sludge</b> disposal are possible; the first being direct disposal on land (including agriculture) and the second being incineration (ash production), although neither of these methods are universally applied. Simplifying the issue, direct sludge disposal on land is seldom applied for sanitary and environmental reasons, while incineration is not popular for financial (high costs) reasons. Very often medium and large wastewater treatment plants apply anaerobic digestion for sludge hygiene principles, reducing the amount to be disposed and for biogas (energy) production. With the progress in sewage biological treatment aiming at nutrient removal, primary sludge has been omitted in the working processes and only surplus activated sludge requires handling. Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is more difficult due to the presence of microorganisms, the decomposition of which requires a relatively long time for hydrolysis. In order to upgrade the hydrolysis effects, several different pre-treatment processes have already been developed and introduced. The additional pre-treatment processes applied are aimed at residual sludge bulk mass minimization, shortening of the anaerobic digestion process or higher biogas production, and therefore require additional energy. The water-energy-waste Nexus (treads of) of the benefits and operational difficulties, including energy costs are discussed in this paper. The intensity of pre-treatment processes to upgrade the microorganism’s hydrolysis has crucial implications. Here a low intensity pre-treatment process, alkalisation and hydrodynamic disintegration - hybrid process - were presented in order to achieve sufficient effects of WAS anaerobic digestion.

40|$|Feast {{and famine}} cycles are <b>common</b> in {{activated}} <b>sludge</b> wastewater treatment systems, and they select for bacteria that accumulate storage compounds, such as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Previous {{studies have shown}} that variations in influent substrate concentrations force bacteria to accumulate high levels of rRNA compared to the levels in bacteria grown in chemostats. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that bacteria accumulate more rRNA when they are subjected to feast and famine cycles. However, PHB-accumulating bacteria can form biomass (grow) throughout a feast and famine cycle and thus have a lower peak biomass formation rate during the cycle. Consequently, PHB-accumulating bacteria may accumulate less rRNA when they are subjected to feast and famine cycles than bacteria that are not capable of PHB accumulation. These hypotheses were tested with Wautersia eutropha H 16 (wild type) and W. eutropha PHB- 4 (a mutant not capable of accumulating PHB) grown in chemostat and semibatch reactors. For both strains, the cellular RNA level was higher when the organism was grown in semibatch reactors than when it was grown in chemostats, and the specific biomass formation rates during the feast phase were linearly related to the cellular RNA levels for cultures. Although the two strains exhibited maximum uptake rates when they were grown in semibatch reactors, the wild-type strain responded much more rapidly to the addition of fresh medium than the mutant responded. Furthermore, the chemostat-grown mutant culture was unable to exhibit maximum substrate uptake rates when it was subjected to pulse-wise addition of fresh medium. These data show that the ability to accumulate PHB does not prevent bacteria from accumulating high levels of rRNA when they are subjected to feast and famine cycles. Our results also demonstrate that the ability to accumulate PHB makes the bacteria more responsive to sudden increases in substrate concentrations, which explains their ecological advantage...|$|R

There have been many changes to the original policy, {{as a result of}} boundary reviews, delays in developing sludge management plans, development in technology and changes in tendering policy, most notably a move to design-build-operate (DBO) projects. As a result, there are now 35 designated Hub Centres. Only 5 of the Hub Centres are producing Class A Biosolids. These are Ringsend, Killamey, Carlow, Navan and Osberstown. Ringsend is the only Hub Centre that is fully operational, treating sludge from surrounding regions by Thermal Drying. Killamey is producing Class A Biosolids using Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) but is not, as yet, treating imported sludge.

Analysis of sludges from the Hub Centres showed that all Irish sewage sludge is safe for agricultural reuse as defined by the Waste Management Regulations Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) (S.

40|$|NDcityline iaks "-system is {{a complex}} {{wastewater}} treatment concept developed for Nam Dihn City. In this concept, sewage treatment is decentralized organized and the sludge treatment in a centralized manner, where the sludge from wastewater treatment (WWT) sites ist transported via sludge pipelines to the sludge treatment location. Following the demands of sustainability "NDcityline iaks "-system is based on results of material flow analysis (MFA). The MFA considers the theory of hierarchy of natural resources {{for the development of}} a suitable recycling concept, where sewage and sludge discussed as available natural resources. On this way, WWT-process and sludge treatment process offer a large series of so-called by-products (reusing of treated water for industrial purposes, methane gas, low and high temperature heat, cool, electricity, CO 2 -conversion into biomass, activated carbon, heavy oil, coal, fertilizer). The approach of trickling filter technology for the WWT-process reduces remarkable the costs for the construction, the operating costs and the area consumption in comparison to <b>common</b> used activated <b>sludge</b> technology. A linked municipal sewage and solid waste management and a specialized facility management increase the volume and efficiency of by-products. The mentioned orientation of management components supports new settlement of companies in direct neighborhood of treatment plants. In result of a successful strategy of industry settlement, the approaches of by-products create chances to refinance the investment and the operating costs in a certain time connected with lower costs for settled enterprises. The "NDcityline iaks "-system considers ecological aspects by reusing natural resources and a full recycling concept. It supports directly the future economic development of local industry and offers chances to link industrial and agricultural development in the region (e. g. via food processing industry). Finally, the lower costs and the presented option for refinancing offer better chances to construct WWT-plants without increase of any further fees for the population following the demand for safety of supply in the sense of sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Composting {{of sewage}} <b>sludge</b> is a <b>common</b> {{practice}} for <b>sludge</b> disposal. Some previous studies found {{high levels of}} polychorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) after composting, especially octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) but also 1234678 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1234678 -HpCDD) to a lesser extent. In this work, the concentrations of OCDD, 1234678 -HpCDD {{and the rest of}} the 17 toxic congeners of PCDD/Fs were determined in compost obtained under different conditions. Although the toxicity of the two compounds mentioned above is small, their generation may reach undesirable levels. The PCDD/F content was analyzed in a composting plant and in a laboratory test. In both cases, the composted material was a mixture of sewage sludge, straw and sawdust. The composting plant was a tunnel with air turbine aeration and with a turner to homogenize and move the mixture upwards. The laboratory tests were carried out with Dewar vessels (with air dispersion at the bottom and controlled temperature) and with small vessels inside a controlled oven with non-forced aeration. The laboratory runs were also carried out with the addition of pentachlorophenol in some runs, as a dioxin precursor. The highest OCDD levels were found in three samples of the composting plant (30000 – 90000 pg/g dry matter or dm), with toxicity values surpassing the limit level for soil amendment (17 pg I-TEQ/g dm). Their formation was analyzed considering their concentration vs. that of octachorodibenzofuran (OCDF), which is not formed during composting. In the laboratory, in experiments carried out in a vessel with non-forced aeration conditions and with the addition of pentachlorophenol, the formation of OCDD was significant (e. g. from 80 to 1500 pg/g dm). That means that these two factors, non-forced aeration and the presence of pentachlorophenol, can cause the OCDD formation. Support for this work was provided by Research project GRE 13 - 14 from the University of Alicante, Research project PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 007 from the Generalitat Valenciana (Spain) and Research project CTQ 2013 - 41006 -R from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) ...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{membrane}} bioreactors (AnMBRs) {{may provide}} a sustainable treatment technology for the digestion of mixed municipal sludge based {{on their ability to}} achieve elevated volatile solids (VS) conversion and a net positive energy balance. However, AnMBRs may have throughput limitations particularly when operated at high solids inventories due to membrane fouling. This study characterized the anaerobic digestion bioprocess and the membrane performance under various operating conditions and identified the foulant mode using the classical ‘Hermia-Field’ blocking models while operating the system under low crossflow and low transmembrane pressures. Using the in-vitro yeast estrogen screen (YES) bioassay the sludge and permeate quality was assessed for its estrogenic potential. The permeate was analysed for a group of environmentally relevant trace organic compounds. The study used a side-stream pilot scale AnMBR with two parallel negative tubular membranes and a flow through anaerobic digester (AD) as a control. Each reactor was fed in parallel from a <b>common</b> mixed <b>sludge</b> source. The tubular ultrafiltration membranes were polyvinylidene difluoride based with a nominal pore size of 20 nm, operated at a crossflow of 1 – 1. 2 m/s and a transmembrane pressure of 34 – 54 kPa. Four operating conditions that included different SRT:HRT ratios under ambient (25 C), mesophilic (35 C) and thermophilic (55 C) temperatures were investigated. The main AnMBR advantage over the AD is the ability to decouple and independently control the system SRT and HRT resulting in increased throughput, at lower HRT, while maintaining a low food to microorganisms ratio by increasing the SRT. This operational strategy was used and under mesophilic conditions, the AnMBR showed a 54 and 64 % volatile solids conversion at SRT:HRT of 30 : 15 and 21 : 7 days, with loading rates of 2. 1 ± 0. 4 and 3. 7 ± 0. 9 kg COD/m 3 · d, respectively. Under ambient and thermophilic operating conditions, the SRT/HRT ratio was adjusted considering the system kinetics and the AnMBR showed a 49 and 55 % volatile solids conversion at SRT/HRT of 40 : 8 and 22 : 7 days, with loading rates of 3. 5 ± 0. 4 and 3. 4 ± 0. 8 kg COD/m 3 · d, respectively. Under all the operating conditions the AnMBR was operated at more than double the loading rate and showed an improvement of 13 – 30 % increase in volatile solids conversion, compared to the AD. A comparison of the energy balance between the AnMBR and AD showed a net positive energy balance for the AnMBR when operated at mesophilic and ambient temperatures but not during thermophilic operation. The AD proved sustainable under ambient operation only. The membrane performance showed a median sustainable flux of 6 – 7 ± 2 LMH which was maintained through inter-permeation cycle rest and clean-in-place (CIP) strategy. The frequency of the CIP increased with an increase in SRT, TS and during ambient operation due to an increase in viscosity of the mixed liquor. The dominant fouling mode was found to be cake fouling under all operating conditions and primarily of a reversible type. The permeability decline was assessed and found to be affected primarily by TS, SRT/HRT ratio and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) protein to polysaccharide ratio. The estrogenicity of the feed sludge was found to persist in anaerobically treated mixed municipal sludges and the AnMBR permeate. This was corroborated by the permeate chemical analysis which found a significant contribution from a small number of estrogens...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{mechanism}} of cake layer formation is described by an MBR fouling model. One of the important inputs of the model is the particle size distribution of activated sludge. This information {{is the result of}} an in-house developed image analysis software. The program has proven itself as an effective and reliable software in activated sludge image analysis. However, it used to experience some difficulties when dealing with some less <b>common</b> activated <b>sludge</b> morphologies and it resulted in less accurate information of the activated sludge characteristics. The three common issues which are (i) images with a lot of small filaments that are not attached to flocs, (ii) images with dark regions in flocs and (iii) images with bright filaments are solved by improving and adding new algorithms into the segmentation and recognition part. These adjustments and the implementation of an overall simplification of the algorithm significantly improve the image analysis procedure in terms {{of the quality of the}} resulting information and the computation time. The filtration model is developed based on the combination of the model proposed by Broeckmann et al. [15] with the particle size distribution of activated sludge and particle deposition rules inspired by Yoon et al. [134]. A three dimensional cake layer with multi-size particles is created and it can provide the required input information (e. g., the porosity profile of the cake layer and the cake layer thickness) for the fouling model. A very close resemblance between the model predictions and the experimental data is not obtained due to a lack of information on the particle size distribution of the activated sludge in the available data, but the correct trend of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) evolution is predicted: first a rather fast increase due to pore blocking, then a very slow increase and finally a TMP jump. The strong influences of particle size distribution, shear stress and compression on the characteristics of the formed cake layer are demonstrated by the model. Finally, in order to complete the operation of an MBR system, a physical cleaning model is developed and integrated in the filtration model. This model is basically based on the removal of the top layers during the relaxation phase and the washing out of the particles which were deposited above the pores during the backwashing phase. The latter takes into account a fraction of pores that will stay permanently blocked. The former model for the relaxation phase calculates the percentage of the cake layer that will be removed as a function of the fraction of the extracellular polymeric substances in the cake layer (as a measure of its stickiness), the viscosity of the permeate, the shear stress and the relaxation time. In addition, interaction between particles during cake layer build-up is introduced. Such interaction can be due to hydrophobic forces which help aggregating the flocs or can be due to general stickiness of extracellular polymers. By introducing a contact angle between particles which reflects the degree of interaction, particles are prevented from freely rolling to a stable position. Instead, they get stuck somewhere in between, preventing the deposited particles from blocking pores. The influence of operational parameters and of some model assumptions on the TMP evolution is investigated and reflect the to be expected trends. A higher flux induces a higher TMP (which is easily explained by Darcy’s law), a lower shear stress enables a faster fouling and more interaction between activated sludge flocs (e. g., as a measure for their higher hydrophobicity) also reduces fouling. Future research will focus on the further calibration and validation of the model for which additional (specific) data is required. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge or biosolids is {{the solid}} waste that has been left after {{wastewater}} is treated in a domestic wastewater treatment facility. The most <b>common</b> way of <b>sludge</b> disposal is to dispose it on the land, sea or air (incineration). However, these methods are not environment-friendly, costly and time consuming that requires expertise and knowledge. An ideal way to manage sewage sludge is {{to use it as}} a soil amendment in agricultural land due to itâs high organic matter and other base cations. Sewage sludge contains high levels of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and zinc that can be harmful to both plants and the environment. Hence, these metals need to be removed before the sewage sludge is used as a soil amendment. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of Dipterocarpus verrucosus to uptake and translocate heavy metals from sewage sludge contaminated soil. The D. verrucosus seedlings were planted on six different planting media; Control (100 % soil), T 1 (80 % soil and 20 % sewage sludge), T 2 (60 % soil and 40 % sewage sludge), T 3 (40 % soil and 60 % sewage sludge), T 4 (20 % soil and 80 % sewage sludge) and T 5 (100 % sewage sludge) for the duration of 16 weeks. The growth performance, of height of D. verrucosus was measured using diameter tape, while the basal diameter was measured using a venier caliper for every two weeks for a period of 16 weeks. The plant biomass was determined using a destructive sampling method. Plant samples were collected after harvest and soil samples were collected before and after planting. The Atomic Absorbtion Spectrophotometer (AAS) was used to determine the concentration of heavy metals in the planting media and the plant parts (leaves, stem and roots). The highest plant biomass was recorded in the T 1 growth media of 20 % sewage sludge and 80 % soil. D. verrucosus plant was able to remove heavy metals of Cd, Cu, Pb, Fe and Zn effectively. The highest concentration of heavy metal in the roots of the D. verrucosus plant was Fe, recorded in the T 5 growth media (1879. 75 ppm). The highest accumulation of Zn (68. 47 ppm) in D. verrucosus was recorded in the stem of D. verrucosus in the T 5 growth media whereas the stem of the D. verrucosus in T 3 recorded the highest Cd accumulation (2. 85 ppm). The highest Pb uptake was recorded in the roots of D. verrucosus in T 5 (37. 3 ppm), while the lowest accumulation of Pb was noted in the stem of the D. verrucosus in Control (23. 49 ppm). For Cd, the highest Translocation Factor (TF) (4. 01) was recorded in T 1. The lowest Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) for Cu was recorded at T 5 (0. 22). The highest TF for Lead was recorded in control (2. 22) while the lowest was in T 1 (1. 64). The BCF for Zn was lowest at T 3 treatment (0. 16). The D. verrucosus plant was found to be suitable for taking up heavy metals from sewage sludge especially Cd, Zn, Cu and Pb. The roots of D. verrucosus are ideal in removing and storing Fe, while the stem of the D. verrucosus plant is ideal for the uptake and accumulation of Zn. However, more studies need to be conducted, especially in field conditions, in order to optimize the potential of the D. verrucosus plant as a phytoremediator...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} development has brought prosperity {{to millions of}} people, but has also left a legacy of polluted environment that continues to impact our natural resources, and ultimately, human well being. Nowadays, many synthetic organic chemicals are of growing concern, because of their high toxicity and high persistence in the environment and in biological systems. Furthermore, the high lipophilicity {{of many of these}} xenobiotics greatly enhances their bioaccumulation, thereby posing potential health hazards. On the other hand, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the barriers of the environment, where the undesired xenobiotic compounds dissolved in sewages are biotranformed and/or sorbed to <b>sludge.</b> The most <b>common</b> method of <b>sludge</b> disposal in Europe is stabilization by anaerobic treatment, thickening, and spreading on agricultural land or landfills. This yields valuable biogas, and recycles nutrients to agriculture, as well as conditioning of the soil. Problems related to agricultural recycling of sludge include the presence of pollutants, including priority pollutants identified in the EU urban water directives. These include metals, halogenated organics, pharmaceuticals, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APE), phthalic acid esters (PAE), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Metals are currently managed by precipitation, while halogenated aromatics are readily removed by anaerobic dehalogenation. However, pharmaceuticals, LAS, APE, PAE, and PAH are often present in significant quantities in the sludge. Additionally, due to their low solubility most of the compounds will fractionate to the solids portion (i. e., sludge), rather than to the soluble portion (i. e., effluent). As another factor, many of these compounds are inhibitory, and the impact on digester performance is unknown. In this work, we identify the impact of these pollutants on the anaerobic process itself, as well as degradation of the target compounds. For the pharmaceuticals we used a glucose based synthetic medium and continuous reactors operated in a draw and fill mode. For the other compounds we used different types of biological sludge (primary, secondary and mixture) and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Additionally in order to assess their impact in anaerobic digestion process batch experiments took place, for all xenobiotics. Furthermore, organic acids are widely recognised as the most appropriate process indicator. To assess comparative impact separately, the (CSTR) reactors were simulated using a widely used model (ADM 1), and the kinetics were assessed statistically by estimating uncertainty in key parameters. The response of the reactors to each pharmaceutical was different. In particular, triclosan and ofloxacin seemed to inhibit the anaerobic digestion process, increasing the dissolved COD concentration rapidly, This upset lasted for some days, but afterwards, the reactor came back to normal levels of performance. Specific methanogenic activity tests showed that triclosan and propranolol inhibited the methanogenesis step significantly, on the other hand clofibric acid and sulfamethoxazole seemed not to affect methanogenesis even at high concentrations. The relative toxicity of the pharmaceuticals may be different at different concentrations. All pharmaceuticals found to be persistent under anaerobic conditions with the exception of sulfamethoxazole. The other target toxic organic compounds had no statistical impact on performance in the contaminated reactors, as compared to an uncontaminated control. This was not only observed in gas flow, but also by statistical analysis of the dynamic removal of acetate and propionate. However, LAS, NPEO, NP and phenanthrene were highly persistent, with no demonstratable removal. DEHP was partially degraded. The mass transfer rate was rate limiting for DEHP removal, meaning that, the solids functioned as a tank equalizing the concentration of the DEHP throughout the solid particle and responded to the changes in the surface concentration at a slower rate than that attributed to biodegradation. Finally it was demonstrated that applying a post-aeration method for anaerobically digested sludge it is possible to reduce some of the selected organic micropollutants. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) for timely detection and diagnosis of process faults. Although early industrial implementations of SPM have confirmed its huge potential in terms of increased production efficiency, cost reduction, quality improvement, and waste reduction, several barriers against the successful implementation and operation of SPM systems still exist. The general objective of this work is to facilitate industrial adoption of SPM by lowering these barriers. The {{first part of this}} thesis proposes a new small-scale application of SPM to <b>common</b> lab-scale activated <b>sludge</b> experiments. The activated sludge to inoculate these experiments is most often taken from large-scale wastewater treatment plants. The transfer from industrial facility to experimental set-up induces a transient period. To avoid interference of this transient with experimental results, it is crucial to assess whether the activated sludge has reached stable conditions before starting any experimental procedure. A new multivariate stability assessment technique is proposed and validated on experimental data. The second part examines handling process dynamics in SPM-based fault detection. Two recently proposed extensions to incorporate dynamics in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Batch Dynamic PCA and Auto-Regressive PCA, are investigated. The techniques are benchmarked on an extensive simulated dataset in which faults on different variables with varying magnitude, fault sign, and fault type are introduced at distinct onset times. The third part analyzes contribution plots, the conventional technique for fault isolation in SPM, i. e., the task of confining the cause of a process fault to a small subset of the measured variables. Contribution plots suffer from the so-called smearing effect: faulty variables mathematically increase the contribution of non-faulty variables, possibly leading to ambiguous results. This part provides deeper insight into the cause and nature of contribution smearing. The final part of this thesis explores fault classification as a means for direct diagnosis of recurring process faults for batch processes. Several data preprocessing steps are proposed. Furthermore, the influence of the number of training batches and data pretreatment on classification performance is investigated.
