After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace.

5|$|On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant's {{superior}} {{as commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, was also apprehensive. Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant's success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston's high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was well aware that any delay or reversal might be an opportunity for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.|$|E
5|$|Raj appealed {{before the}} court against the gag order imposed on him, stating {{that he had to}} move around {{different}} places in Maharashtra for propounding the philosophy of his party and that such an order was an infringement of his 'fundamental rights'. On 22 February, the court dismissed his appeal to re-track the extension of the gag order passed against him, following which MNS started a signature <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> support against the gag order. According to MNS, Maharashtrian actors Nana Patekar and Shreyas Talpade had shown support in opposing the gag order, along with actors Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty. Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty, however, later denied the MNS's claim. This move by MNS prompted the police to serve a show cause notice to Raj, asking him why the gag order should not be extended.|$|E

He was a key organiser of the successful <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the councillors released, and subsequently wrote pamphlets telling the history of the campaign.

5000|$|The {{amendment}} {{passed the}} Tennessee Senate easily. However, {{as it moved}} on to the House, vigorous opposition came from people in the liquor industry, who thought that if women got the vote, they would use it to pass Prohibition. Distillery lobbyists came to fight the amendment, bringing liquor. “Both suffrage and anti-suffrage men were reeling through the hall in an advanced state of intoxication,” suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt reported. Nevertheless, the suffragists thought they could count on a one-vote victory in the House. Then the speaker, whom they had counted on as a “yes” for the amendment, changed his mind. Yet suddenly, Harry Burn, the youngest member of the House, a 24-year-old [...] "no" [...] vote from East Tennessee, got up and announced that he had received a letter from his mother (Febb Ensminger Burn) telling him to [...] "be a good boy and help Mrs. Chapman Catt." [...] "I know that a mother’s advice is always the safest for a boy to follow", Burn said, switching sides, and the amendment was ratified that day, August 18, 1920, officially becoming part of the Constitution when it was certified as law on August 26, 1920; August 26 later became known as Women's Equality Day. Suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt calculated that the campaign for women's right to vote had involved 56 referendum campaigns directed at male voters, plus 480 <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Legislatures <b>to</b> submit suffrage amendments <b>to</b> voters, 47 <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> constitutional conventions <b>to</b> write woman suffrage into state constitutions; 277 <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> State party conventions to include woman suffrage planks, 30 <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> presidential party <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> include woman suffrage planks in party platforms and 19 campaigns with 19 successive Congresses.|$|R

After deliberating on the matter, WWF President Jack Tunney was forced to suspend him for missing the tag team match and subsequent matches against the Heenan Family. This was part of a wrestling storyline, to allow André time off for production of the film The Princess Bride which was being filmed in the UK and also to allow him to fulfill a contracted tour of Japan. He was also beginning to develop health problems from the gigantism that caused his size that led him to having major back surgery and limited his wrestling ability at that time.|$|E
25|$|Lenihan's support evaporated, and Haughey {{concluded}} that the election {{was as good as}} lost. Haughey distanced himself from Lenihan, as he did not want any share in the blame. This had unintended consequences, as disquiet with the Fianna Fáil organisation concerning Haughey's leadership increased dramatically. An episode of an RTÉ current affairs television programme featured Fianna Fáil members in Roscommon openly attacking Haughey's leadership and character. Many canvassers now restarted the <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Lenihan elected. However, Lenihan's personal confidence was shattered and although he recovered somewhat in the polls {{towards the end of the}} campaign, it was insufficient. Lenihan won the first count with 44% of the first-preference votes— Robinson attaining 39%. However, transfers from Currie proved critical and the majority of these went as expected against Fianna Fáil. Lenihan became the first Fianna Fáil presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election. Robinson now became president, the first woman to hold the office, and the first candidate to be second on first preference votes to win the presidency.|$|E
25|$|Looking over St Martin's Square is {{the statue}} of Horatio Nelson. The bronze statue was the first public {{monument}} for Birmingham and was sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It is also the first figurative memorial to Lord Nelson to be erected in Great Britain (only second in the world after Montreal) and was unveiled on 25 October 1809, as part of King George III's Golden Jubilee celebrations. It was originally located {{on the edge of}} the previous Bull Ring and stood on a marble base, but this was damaged when the statue was moved in 1958 and the current Portland stone plinth dates from 1960. As part of the Bullring development, the developer agreed to restore the statue and railings, but in 2003 when the Bullring opened, there was no sign of the railings.

25|$|In Southeast Asia, {{presence}} of Hui Muslims may date back 700 {{years to the}} time of Zheng He who was a Hui. Hui also became part of the wave of Chinese migrants that peaked between 1875 and 1912, and they inhabited Penang, Sabah, Singapore and Pangkor prior to World War II. Most were Hokkien-speaking coolies and merchants originating from Fujian. The colonial British welfare system was commissioned according to language groups, so the Hui were classed as Hokkien. The small number of Hui may have become assimilated into mainstream Chinese society and local Muslim populations. In 1975, five Hui leaders started a <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> every clansman to put up a notice listing their ancestral for 40 generations, as a way of reminding them of their origins. The exact Hui population is unclear today as many families left Islam before independence. In 2000 official census figures gave the number of Muslim Chinese in Malaysia as 57,000 but most were Han converts. According to the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association the surnames Koay, Ma, Ha, Ta, Sha, Woon, and An (or Ang) may indicate Hui ancestry.|$|E
