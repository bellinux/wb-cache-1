5|$|Hemorrhagic <b>cystitis,</b> {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic <b>cystitis</b> is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial <b>cystitis,</b> psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful {{in the treatment of}} high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, <b>cystitis,</b> digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (<b>cystitis)</b> and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial <b>cystitis</b> (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp was {{the last}} {{surviving}} Earp brother and the last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died {{at home in the}} Earps' small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic <b>cystitis</b> on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. His brother Newton died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Charlie Welsh's daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law, Alma, were the only witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently too full of grief to assist. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia. He had no children.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and <b>cystitis.</b> In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was <b>cystitis.</b> His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

25|$|Urinary tract infection*, {{specifically}} <b>cystitis</b> or bladder infection, {{is common}} in dogs and usually caused by bacteria. Signs include blood in the urine (hematuria), difficulty urinating (dysuria), and frequent urination (polyuria). The most common types of bacteria cultured from the urine of dogs with <b>cystitis</b> are E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|Used in Thailand as main {{ingredient}} in kidney tablets {{to relieve the}} symptoms of <b>cystitis,</b> pyelitis and urethritis.|$|E
25|$|This urodynamic {{profile is}} {{associated}} with a lower risk of urologic complications, such as <b>cystitis</b> and bladder stones.|$|E
25|$|Bacteriuria is the {{presence}} of bacteria in the urine which can indicate a urinary tract infection such as <b>cystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pelvic pain generally, {{can affect}} anybody {{and has a}} variety of causes; endometriosis in women, bowel adhesions, {{irritable}} bowel syndrome, and interstitial <b>cystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is also {{associated}} with ureteral stenosis and interstitial nephritis. In bone marrow transplant recipients it is notable as a cause for hemorrhagic <b>cystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Memantine is, in general, well-tolerated. Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common {{adverse effects}} include vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, <b>cystitis,</b> and increased libido.|$|E
25|$|Interstitial <b>cystitis</b> (IC), {{also known}} as bladder pain {{syndrome}} (BPS), {{is a type of}} chronic pain that affects the bladder. Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away, needing to urinate often, and pain with sex. IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Another {{virulence}} factor commonly {{present in}} UPEC is the Dr family of adhesins, which are particularly associated with <b>cystitis</b> and pregnancy-associated pyelonephritis. The Dr adhesins bind Dr {{blood group antigen}} (Dra) which is present on decay accelerating factor (DAF) on erythrocytes and other cell types. There, the Dr adhesins induce the development of long cellular extensions that wrap around the bacteria, accompanied by the activation of several signal transduction cascades, including activation of PI-3 kinase.|$|E
25|$|DMSO {{has been}} {{examined}} {{for the treatment}} of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial <b>cystitis.</b> A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought significant relief to the majority of the 213patients with inflammatory genitourinary disorders that were studied. The authors recommended DMSO for genitourinary inflammatory conditions not caused by infection or tumor in which symptoms were severe or patients failed to respond to conventional therapy.|$|E
25|$|Feline lower {{urinary tract}} {{disease is a}} term {{that is used to}} cover many {{problems}} of the feline urinary tract, including stones and <b>cystitis.</b> The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in adult cats, though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of urinary tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the urinary system, which if left untreated is fatal.|$|E
25|$|In {{young women}} painful periods often occur without an {{underlying}} problem. In older women {{it is more}} often due to an underlying issues such as uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, or endometriosis. It is more common among those with heavy periods, irregular periods, whose periods started before twelve years of age, or who have a low body weight. A pelvic exam in those who are sexually active and ultrasound {{may be useful to}} help in diagnosis. Conditions that should be ruled out include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, interstitial <b>cystitis,</b> and chronic pelvic pain.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} often {{attributed to}} fibromyalgia {{that may be}} due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, genitourinary symptoms and interstitial <b>cystitis,</b> dermatological disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Intranasal {{progesterone}} as a {{nasal spray}} {{has been found}} to be effective in achieving therapeutic levels, and was not associated with nasal irritation, but was associated with an unpleasant taste of the spray. Rectal, intramuscular, and intravenous routes may be inconvenient, especially for long-term treatment. Plasma levels of progesterone are similar after vaginal and rectal administration in spite of the different routes of administration, and rectal administration is an alternative to vaginal progesterone in conditions of vaginal infection, <b>cystitis,</b> recent childbirth, or when barrier contraception methods are used. Intramuscular injection of progesterone may achieve much higher levels of progesterone than normal luteal phase concentrations and levels achieved with other routes.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Rappe {{suffered}} from chronic <b>cystitis,</b> {{a condition that}} liquor irritated dramatically. Her heavy drinking habits and the poor quality of the era's bootleg alcohol could leave her in severe physical distress. She developed a reputation for over-imbibing at parties, then drunkenly tearing at her clothes from the resulting physical pain. But {{by the time of}} the St. Francis Hotel party, her reproductive health was a greater concern. She had undergone several abortions in the space of a few years, the quality of care she received for such procedures was probably substandard, and she was preparing to undergo another (or, more likely, had recently done so) as a result of being impregnated by her boyfriend, director Henry Lehrman.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{enlargement}} {{can cause}} difficulties emptying the bladder completely. This situation, {{in which there}} is residual volume in the bladder is prone to complications such as <b>cystitis</b> and bladder stones, also commonly found in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. It was often suggested to change the voiding position of symptomatic males, however study results showed heterogeneity. A meta-analysis of people with prostate enlargement and healthy males showed a significant reduction of residual volume, while a trend towards an improved urinary flow rate and decreased voiding time was found. The effect of changing ones position is thought to arise from relaxation of the pelvic musculature, which are contracted in the standing position thereby influencing urodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal <b>cystitis</b> may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Most infections with {{adenovirus}} {{result in}} infections {{of the upper}} respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often show up as conjunctivitis, tonsilitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic <b>cystitis</b> (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|On December 24, 2008 {{at about}} 3:30p.m. (JST), Iijima {{was found dead}} in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing. She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She had been dead for about seven days, police said. On March 3, 2007, Sports Nippon had {{reported}} that Ai Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), <b>cystitis,</b> and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, {{and that there was no}} suggestion of either suicide or murder.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are used}} {{primarily}} in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used {{in the treatment of}} a number of other medical disorders, including anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), Neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, trichotillomania, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial <b>cystitis</b> (IC), nocturnal enuresis (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} {{treatment was}} given to a Northern Irish teenager, Jonathan Simms, beginning in January 2003. The medication, called pentosan polysulphate (PPS) and used to treat interstitial <b>cystitis,</b> is infused into the patient's lateral ventricle within the brain. PPS {{does not seem to}} stop the disease from progressing, and both brain function and tissue continue to be lost. However, the treatment is alleged to slow the progression of the otherwise untreatable disease, and {{may have contributed to the}} longer than expected survival of the seven patients studied. Simms died in 2011. The CJD Therapy Advisory Group to the UK Health Departments advises that data are not sufficient to support claims that pentosan polysulphate is an effective treatment and suggests that further research in animal models is appropriate. A 2007 review of the treatment of 26 patients with PPS finds no proof of efficacy because of the lack of accepted objective criteria.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{are said}} to be {{susceptible}} to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 /ml or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100nbsp&mg, is less than 1 μg/ml and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6. Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple <b>cystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|At one {{veterinary}} teaching hospital, between 50 and 80% of cats {{had one or}} more medical complications post-surgery; 19.8% developed complications after release. Other {{studies have}} reported medical post-op complication rates as 24% (Jankowski 1998), 53% (Martinez 1993), 1.4% (Pollari 1996), 82.5% for blade and 51.5% for shear technique (Tobias 1994), and 80% (Yeon 2001). Reported medical complications include: pain, hemorrhage, laceration of paw pads, swelling, reluctance to bear weight on affected limb, neuropraxia (transient motor paralysis), radial nerve damage, lameness, infection, abscess, tissue necrosis, wound dehiscence, incomplete healing, protrusion of 2nd (middle) phalanx, claw regrowth, scurs (growth of deformed claw segments), retention of flexor process of third phalanx, chronic draining tracts, self-mutilation, dermatitis, lethargy, palmigrade stance (walking on wrists), chronic intermittent lameness, chronic pain syndrome, flexor tendon contracture, and <b>cystitis</b> (stress-associated bladder inflammation). Claw regrowth has been seen by veterinarians anywhere from weeks up to 15 years after onychectomy.(Veterinary Information Network).|$|E
25|$|UC San Diego {{is one of}} {{the most}} active health science {{research}} institutes in the country. Of the $1.07 billion it received in research funding in 2017, $615.7 million was dedicated to health sciences research at UC San Diego Health medical centers and the School of Medicine. Several pioneering medical innovations have been made by UCSD researchers, such as the development of the chemotherapy drug Cetuximab, the use of gene therapy in the treatment of congenital defects, the discovery of insulin resistance as a cause of diabetes, the understanding of genetic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, the link between vitamin D deficiency and certain cancers, the first human trials of robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery, the development of the first oral drug for treating interstitial <b>cystitis</b> called Elmiron, the demonstration of HIV latency, the link between the p53 gene and rheumatoid arthritis, the identification of the genetic basis for familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, the discovery of an early warning sign for autism, the connection between inflammation and cancer, the use of green fluorescent protein as a surgical and research aid, the nation's first sleeve gastrectomy, and the discovery of a potential treatment for chronic lymphomatic leukemia called Cirmtuzumab.|$|E
