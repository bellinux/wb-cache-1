500|$|Integrin signaling, which <b>control</b> <b>cell</b> movement, {{spreading}} and adhesion to {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM), and survival, {{is the best}} established signaling pathway for NEDD9. Integrins are transmembrane proteins that nucleate focal adhesions, structures that provide bi-directional signaling between ECM and actin cytoskeleton. [...] NEDD9 stabilizes formation and regulates turnover of focal adhesions, influencing cell motility and the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In response to integrin activation, FAK or the related kinase RAFTK recruits NEDD9 into a focal adhesion site, binds it via the N-terminal SH3 domain and phosphorylates the NEDD9 Src-binding site. This allows SRC or SRC family kinase to bind NEDD9 via its SH2 domain. Phosphorylation of the NEDD9 substrate domain by Src and other kinases results {{in the creation of}} binding sites for Crk and other adaptors that associate with SH2 binding motifs. NEDD9 Crk complexes activate Rho and Ras family GTPases via the recruitment of their nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as DOCK1, DOCK3 [...] DOCK180 and C3G.|$|E

30|$|After {{the entire}} {{treatment}} transgenic P. pastoris CL 2 cells were irregular and ranged {{in size from}} similar to 3.3 {{times larger than the}} <b>control</b> <b>cells.</b> This appears to be due to the loss of the glucanes-net integrity resulting in spheroplasts. Coomasie blue staining showed that P. pastoris CL 2 cells became permeable to the dye, but staining was absent in the <b>control</b> <b>cells.</b> This also indicated a loss of cell wall integrity. In P. pastoris CL 2, the amount of cell debris increased after the entire treatment compared to the untreated <b>control</b> <b>cells</b> suggesting that the treated cells became fragile and were easily broken up.

2500|$|Anti-oncomirs are a {{class of}} miRNAs that {{negatively}} regulate oncogenes. Let-7 is the first identified anti-oncomir that functions as a [...] "post-transcriptional-gatekeeper" [...] of certain genes that <b>control</b> <b>cell</b> growth. For example, in lung cancer some oncogenes are down-regulated by Let-7, which functions to maintain normal cell progression. Other anti-oncomirs, including miR-143 and miR-145, {{have been shown to}} down-regulate a wide range of human cancer cell lines. Tumor formation has been observed when miR-143 and miR-145 are down-regulated, particularly in colon and gastric cancer cells. When expressed in colon cancer cells, miR-143 and miR-145 are able to slow growth at the translational level by interfering with MAPK7, an enzyme responsible for cell growth. As an avenue of therapeutic research, chemical devitalization (i.e., artificial modification) of miR-143 and miR-145 may prove to be more effective version of their natural counterparts. Specifically, modified miRNAs may be imparted with increased resistance to nucleases that would otherwise break down the miRNAs.|$|E
2500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} cancerous tumor because {{of its ability to}} <b>control</b> <b>cell</b> growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. [...] To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.|$|E
2500|$|Choline is in {{high demand}} during {{pregnancy}} as a substrate for building cellular membranes, (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for addition of methylation to DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing [...] "fat" [...] portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making cellular membranes, (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy {{and continues to be}} rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphytidyl choline (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help <b>control</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation/differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition.|$|E

2500|$|Apoptosis in HeLa {{cells is}} {{inhibited}} by proteins {{produced by the}} cell; these inhibitory proteins target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressing proteins. These tumor-suppressing proteins regulate the cell cycle, but are rendered inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein. HPV E6 and E7 are inhibitory proteins expressed by the human papillomavirus, HPV being responsible {{for the formation of}} the cervical tumor from which HeLa cells are derived. HPV E6 causes p53, which regulates the cell cycle, to become inactive. HPV E7 binds to retinoblastoma tumor suppressing proteins and limits its ability to <b>control</b> <b>cell</b> division. [...] These two inhibitory proteins are partially responsible for HeLa cells' immortality by inhibiting apoptosis to occur. CDV (Canine Distemper Virus) is able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory proteins. This is an important oncolytic property of CDV: this virus is capable of killing canine lymphoma cells. Oncoproteins E6 and E7 still leave p53 inactive, but they are not able to avoid the activation of caspases induced from the stress of viral infection. These oncolytic properties provided a promising link between CDV and lymphoma apoptosis, which can lead to development of alternative treatment methods for both canine lymphoma and human non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Defects in the cell cycle are thought to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cells, so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defects in the cell cycle is useful for cancer treatment.|$|E

Current {{therapeutic}} treatment has achieved significant success in reducing mortality rates but there are still a minority of patients for whom treatment is unsuccessful. A form of targeted therapy for breast {{cancer is the}} treatment with the Src/ABL inhibitor, Dasatinib. This project explores whether the transcription factor Proline Rich Homeodomain (PRH) mediates dasatinib sensitivity in breast tumour cells. Here we show that immortalised, non-tumour MCF- 10 A <b>control</b> <b>cells</b> are more sensitive to dasatinib than MCF- 10 A PRH knockdown cells Similarly, tumorigenic MCF- 7 <b>control</b> <b>cells</b> are more sensitive to dasatinib treatment than MCF- 7 PRH knockdown cells suggesting that in both of these cell types reduced viability following dasatinib treatment is mediated in part through PRH. In contrast, no significant difference in dasatinib sensitivity was found between the highly metastatic MDA-MB- 231 <b>control</b> <b>cells</b> and MDA-MB- 231 PRH knockdown cells. However, MDA-MB- 231 <b>control</b> <b>cells</b> are more sensitive to dasatinib treatment than MCF- 7 and MCF- 10 A <b>control</b> <b>cells.</b> We further investigated the molecular mechanism by which dasatinib sensitivity is mediated through PRH in the MCF- 7 control and MCF- 7 PRH knockdown cells.
