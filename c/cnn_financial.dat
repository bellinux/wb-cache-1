40|$|How can I {{actually}} {{measure the}} entrepreneurial activity in my region? This {{is a question}} we at the Kauffman Foundation often hear from economic and policy leaders. As cities around the globe rally to foster entrepreneurship, the challenge of how to consistently measure and benchmark progress remains largely unanswered. While anecdotal evidence abounds, most ecosystems struggle to answer straightforward, yet often elusive, questions: How many new startups does our city or state have? How much are our ventures growing? How many of our businesses are surviving? To begin {{to answer these questions}} and address this challenge, we introduce the new Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship, the first and largest index tracking entrepreneurship across city, state, and national levels for the United States. In this release, we introduce the Kauffman Index: Startup Activitythe first of various research installments under the umbrella of the new Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship. For the past ten years, the original Kauffman Index authored by Robert W. Fairliehas been an early indicator for entrepreneurship in the United States, used by entrepreneurs and policymakers, from the federal to state and local levels. The Kauffman Index also {{has been one of the}} most requested and far-reaching entrepreneurship indicators in the United States and, arguably, the world. In the policy world, the Index has been referenced in multiple testimonies to the U. S. Senate and House of Representatives, by U. S. Embassies and Consulates across various countriesincluding nations like Spain, Ukraine, and United Kingdomby multiple federal agencies, by state governments and governors from fifteen states from Arizona to New Yorkand by the White House's office of the President of the United States. On the academic side, more than 200 research papers quote the Kauffman Index. In media circles, the Kauffman Index has been highlighted in more than 100 media channels, including most major publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, TIME, <b>CNN,</b> the <b>Financial</b> Times, and Harvard Business Review. Originally, the Kauffman Index tracked one of the earliest measures of business creation: When and how many people first start working for themselves, becoming entrepreneurs. Now, we are expanding it to include other dimensions of entrepreneurship. The new and expanded Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship 2015 remains focused primarily on entrepreneurial outcomes, as opposed to inputs. That means we are more concerned with actual results of entrepreneurial activitythings like new companies and growth rates. The Kauffman Index: Startup Activity algorithm presented in this report takes into account three variables:  Rate of New Entrepreneurs  Opportunity Share of New Entrepreneurs  Startup Densit...|$|R
50|$|The {{special counsel}} {{investigation}} {{has expanded to}} include Trump and his associates' financial ties to Russia. The FBI is reviewing the financial records of President Trump, the Trump Organization, Trump's family members, and his campaign staff, including Trump's real estate activities, which had been under federal scrutiny before the campaign. According to <b>CNN,</b> <b>financial</b> crimes may be easier for investigators to prove than any crimes stemming directly from collusion with Russia. Transactions under investigation include Russian purchases of Trump apartments, a SoHo development with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, transactions with the Bank of Cyprus, real estate financing organized by Jared Kushner, and Trump's sale of a mansion to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev. The special counsel team has contacted Deutsche Bank, which is the main banking institution doing business with The Trump Organization.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Define a {{representation}} and a learning algorithm {{to learn from}} financial news. Motivation: Extracting automatically relevant information from wire news is of increasing importance {{in a variety of}} areas. We are developing state of the art learning techniques to extract information from on-line <b>CNN</b> <b>financial</b> news. Previous Work: Difficulties in extracting quantitative knowledge from text have traditionally prevented that field from evolving beyond particular applications. McCallum [2] introduces a set of tools based on bag of words and information gain to extract symbolic information from text documents. Freitag et al [1] present a framework that combines bag of words with web structure information for classification purposes. Despite the significant experimental results they obtain, their approach is restricted to averyspecifictype of web pages. Attempts to provide a link between Machine Learning and linguistics to take advantage of semantic and syntactic information have been made (for example [3]) although no direct application has been implemented yet. Approach: In our initial approach we plan to use techniques such as “bag of words ” [2], and benchmark it with focus on different parts of the information (Title, body, HTMLtags). Revision of String Kernel approaches and application of alternate hierarchical structures is a second step we are planning to undertake. The ultimate goal is to quantify information in financial text news, possibly incorporating knowledge from the field of linguistics, for feature extraction and classification purposes. Difficulty: Despite the large amount of news available, processing of text corpora with machine learning is still an open field. Extracting meaningful features from text corpora, summarizing semantic and syntactic information, yet reducing redundancy and ambiguity is the key item to be addressed by most oftheapplications in text recognition. Impact: Aframework able to quantify text news would dramatically decrease complexity of any classification task requiring up to date information...|$|E
