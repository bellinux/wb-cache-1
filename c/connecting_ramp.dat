25|$|Southern Freeway, Interstate 280: Seismic damage also {{forced the}} {{long-term}} closure of Interstate 280 in San Francisco (north of US 101), another concrete freeway {{which had never}} been completed to its originally planned route. The uncompleted northernmost stub of I-280 was demolished during August–October 1995 while one <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> between northbound I-280 and southbound US 101 was opened in December 1995. The full I-280 project was completed in late 1997.|$|E
25|$|In late 1952, the Board of Transportation began {{construction}} on {{a connection between}} the IND and both the Fulton El and the Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, which included a new underground station at Grant Avenue. The connection from the 80th Street elevated station {{to the rest of the}} BMT Fulton El was severed on April 26, 1956 and the IND was extended east (track direction south) from Euclid Avenue via the intermediate station at Grant Avenue, and a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> (known as the Grant Avenue ramp). The new service to Lefferts Boulevard began three days later. On June 28, 1956, the connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Rockaway Boulevard was opened.|$|E
500|$|The {{first section}} of I-70 in Maryland was {{constructed}} as Baltimore National Pike, a four-lane divided highway relocation and reconstruction of US40 from the Pine Orchard community west of Ellicott City west to {{the east end of}} Patrick Street in Frederick. [...] US40 was constructed from Pine Orchard to MD32 in West Friendship between 1949 and 1951. [...] An overpass of MD32 and two-way ramp connection between the two highways were constructed in 1951 and 1952. [...] An overpass and <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> were also constructed at MD97, which was included in the portion of US40 constructed from West Friendship to Morgan Station Road west of Cooksville between 1950 and 1952. [...] The third section of Baltimore National Pike was built from Morgan Station Road into Carroll County just west of the Patapsco River in 1952 and 1953. [...] The next section of relocated US40, from west of the Patapsco River through the Ridgeville section of Mount Airy into Frederick County [...] west of MD27, broke ground in 1953 and was completed by 1955. [...] An interchange with MD27 in Ridgeville was constructed in 1953 and 1954.|$|E
50|$|Divided volleyball {{interchanges}} {{create a}} wide median between the carriageways {{of the two}} interchanging highways, using this space for <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only a few {{physical}} {{signs are}} around of the canceled freeway, {{mostly in the}} form of incomplete <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> or ramp stubs. Some previous evidence of the Mount Hood Freeway has been eliminated with new roadwork.|$|R
50|$|The Marquette Interchange, which connects I-43 with I-94,and I-794, was {{completely}} reconstructed over a four-year span, beginning in October 2004 and ending in September 2008. This project eliminated left-hand exits and widened <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> between I-94 and I-43 to ease congestion problems.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} meet the minimum {{vertical}} drop requirement of 800 m, the starting gate was in a newly constructed lodge at the mountain's summit, with a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> to the mountain proper.|$|E
50|$|Exit 40 {{originally}} had only same-directional off-ramps under the expressway {{providing access to}} realigned sections of NY 25. When exit 41 was originally constructed, it had no south-to-west <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp.</b> Westbound access to the expressway was provided at the nearby exit 40 on-ramp at NY 25. An alternate design for exit 42 called {{for it to be}} similar to the one proposed for NY 135 and Bethpage State Parkway, and westbound exit 46 was originally a partial cloverleaf. Exit 47 was intended for the extension of the Bethpage State Parkway near Washington Avenue in Plainview. This was to be a partial cloverleaf with southbound-only off-ramps and northbound-only on-ramps in both directions. The west-to-southbound ramp would also have an additional <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> to a two-way frontage road for a development and an industrial area near exit 46. Exit 47 is now intended as a truck inspection site between exits 46 and 48.|$|E
50|$|The Regional-Express and Interregio-Express {{services}} {{take about}} 30 minutes to reach Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof. The Stadtbahn services {{take a little}} less than an hour. The S32 services, which are operated by the DB, run to the Hauptbahnhof, while the S4 services run via a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> at Albtalbahnhof to reach the station forecourt and then continue to Karlsruhe city. Every weekday, one S4 service runs via Bretten, Eppingen and Heilbronn to Weinsberg.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the windmill, called the diverging windmill, increases capacity by altering the direction of traffic flow of the interchanging highways, making the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> much more direct. The interchange is named for its similar overhead appearance to the blades of a windmill.|$|R
50|$|The Airport Link and busway project {{involves}} 15 km of tunnelling {{including the}} road (6.7 km of twin tunnels), busway tunnels and <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps,</b> {{as well as}} 25 bridges and result in over 7 km of new road. The Airport Link is Australia's longest road tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{interchanges}} were redesigned. The {{original version}} of exit 32 contained a partial cloverleaf with NY 110 and <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> {{to and from}} CR 47. The original version of exit 36 was also a partial cloverleaf. The old version of exit 37 was a partial cloverleaf that included a direct entrance to the former headquarters of the Long Island State Park Commission, and utilized eastbound re-entry to nearby exit 38, which had a north to east loop <b>ramp,</b> and eastbound <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> to and from Sylvan Road, the frontage road along the eastbound lane of the parkway between exits 37 and 39. The interchange between the Southern, Sagtikos, and Heckscher state parkways (exit 41A), was originally intended to be another trumpet interchange, rather than the wye interchange it became.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2009, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) began a {{relocation}} {{project for}} the northbound ramp of exit 275, which includes a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> with I-275. This project was designed to prevent weaving {{in the vicinity of}} I-275 and SR 56, a hazard that has occurred since the exit 275 and SR 56 were built across I-75 in 2003. Completion was expected to take place in early 2012. [...] This has been completed.|$|E
50|$|Amenities at {{the station}} are basic - there is no ticket {{provision}} (so all tickets have to be purchased on the train or in advance) and only a single stone waiting shelter is provided, along with timetable poster board, Digital CIS display and customer help point next to the station entrance. Step-free access {{is available from the}} car park to the platform, but the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> is quite steep and assistance may be required for disabled passengers wishing to travel from here.|$|E
50|$|Minor Regional Route 310 {{begins in}} the Santa Ana {{district}} and continues through Pozos northwards, parallel to Route 147. It runs through CR-27 without any official <b>ramps</b> <b>connecting</b> them. Since Route 310 runs through Pozos, connecting to Escazu, it is still an alternate route to CR-27. It is not recommended unless the previous routes are heavily congested. Route 310 ends in Route 121 in the Escazu canton after once more passing through CR-27 (with <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps)</b> due to its southwards facing U-shape.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this document is to present a comparison between the Viability Assessment Design Layout and a 25 MTU/acre conceptual repository design. The scope of this analysis is comparing the linear dimensions and the quantities of the major design elements, for example, emplacement drifts, perimeter mains, exhaust mains, performance confirmation drifts, <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> and vertical development...|$|R
50|$|A full Y-interchange (also {{known as}} a {{directional}} T interchange) is typically used when a three-way interchange is required {{for two or three}} highways interchanging in semi-parallel/perpendicular directions, {{but it can also be}} used in right-angle case as well. Their <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> can spur from either the right or left side of the highway, depending on the direction of travel and the angle.|$|R
50|$|A half-trumpet {{interchange}} {{is essentially}} a trumpet interchange with either its loop ramp or the outer <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> (but not both), and only one of its directional ramps, instead of two, {{designed to meet the}} continuous highway in one direction, usually on a 90-degree or semi-perpendicular angle. Should the need arise it can easily be upgraded into a full trumpet interchange, making it a three-way interchange. Two examples exist in Michigan: Between Main Street and State Highway 14 in Ann Arbor, and between Edward N. Hines Drive and Ford Road.|$|E
50|$|Maple Avenue {{had crossed}} the median on NY 27 between North Ocean Avenue and NY 112 until 1975. This road could also {{have been used as}} a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> to both roads. Today, the north section only intersects the {{westbound}} service road, while the south section was converted into a dead end street north of Austin Street. NY 112 was originally proposed to be accessible via connecting ramps to side streets such as Franklin Street along the eastbound lane and an extension of Sinn Street along the westbound lane.|$|E
50|$|A half-clover {{interchange}} {{is essentially}} half a cloverleaf interchange, constructed to connect {{in just three}} directions instead of four. These are rarely used due to the traffic weaving that they cause and {{the large amount of}} land that they consume, but they can be built in areas where the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> along the loop of a trumpet interchange is not feasible due to building developments or physical limitations. Half-clovers are designed to be readily upgraded to full cloverleaves if the terminating highway is ever extended past the through highway. Numerous half-clovers exist along I-90/I-94 in the Chicago, Illinois area.|$|E
50|$|The {{highway is}} a four level stack interchange. US 101 serves {{the first level}} of the complex. The second level marks the {{southern}} termini of both I-280 and I-680, as their primary lanes head into each other; I-280 then runs from the interchange southwesterly to Downtown San Jose, while I-680 runs northeasterly. The third level contains <b>ramps</b> <b>connecting</b> northbound US 101 to northbound I-280 and southbound US 101 to northbound I-680, and the fourth level is a <b>ramp</b> <b>connecting</b> southbound I-680 to southbound US 101. This ramp is a site of major traffic, as {{there are only two}} lanes of the ramp from southbound I-680 to southbound US 101. The fourth-level <b>ramp</b> <b>connects</b> the third level ramp as they enter US 101, while the third-level ramp heading to northbound I-680 <b>connects</b> a <b>ramp</b> from northbound US 101 to northbound I-680. A one-lane <b>ramp</b> <b>connects</b> southbound US 101 to northbound I-280 and a cloverleaf <b>ramp</b> <b>connects</b> southbound I-280 to northbound US 101. The ramps to and from US 101 south then extend over the cloverleaf interchange with Story Road.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1991, {{alongside}} the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> between Highway 403 and Highway 410, which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic, while new overpasses were constructed for the Highway 401 express lanes.The 2.2 km link opened on November 2, 1992, {{at a cost of}} $7.3 million.|$|R
5000|$|Interstate H-201—also {{known as}} the Moanalua Freeway and {{sometimes}} numbered as its former number, Hawaii State Rte. 78—connects two points along H-1: at Aloha Stadium and Fort Shafter. Close to H-1 and Aloha Stadium, H-201 has an exchange with the western terminus of Interstate H-3 to the windward side of Oahu (Kaneohe). This complex of <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps,</b> some directly between H-1 and H-3, is in Halawa.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, {{construction}} work began {{on a second}} bridge for a second track immediately adjacent to the existing Rhine crossing, as the bridge commissioned in 1991 {{had turned out to}} be a bottleneck. Double-track operations began on 12 May 2000. Operations were commissioned on Stadtbahn line S 51 and S 52 to Germersheim in 2010. While the S 52 service, like the S 5, only used the section between Wörth and the Betriebsbahnhof Rheinbrücke (Rhine bridge yard), the S 51 runs from Wörth on the Winden-Karlsruhe line to just before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof and then turns onto the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> to the Albtalbahnhof.|$|E
50|$|On December 1, 1954, {{the first}} 22 mi stretch (the portion lying east of SR 18) opened near the present-day exit 218 for I-76 and I-80. Several motorists {{attended}} a dedication ceremony, with over 1,000 people joining a caravan, following a snow plow and a patrol cruiser, {{to become the}} first to drive the turnpike. The remaining section from exit 218 west to Indiana opened on October 1, 1955. A <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> near the Indiana state line closed on August 16, 1956, the day before the Indiana Toll Road was opened; this ramp had been used to allow traffic access to US 20 to cross into Indiana.|$|E
50|$|As the Long Island Expressway {{was being}} built across Long Island, it was {{specifically}} designed to accommodate certain topographical conditions and proposed interchanges. Exit 30 was originally a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Cross Island Parkway. Eastbound exit 30S was for Easthampton Boulevard with a <b>connecting</b> <b>ramp</b> to the southbound Cross Island Parkway. Exit 31 was originally a westbound only interchange for Douglaston Parkway; it was later combined with the exit for the Little Neck Parkway. Exit 39A was intended for the proposed extension of the Wantagh State Parkway near Powell Road in Old Westbury. It {{was intended to be}} a full Y interchange with an east-to-southbound-only off-ramp and a north-to-westbound-only on-ramp running beneath Powell Road.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route102 (NY102) is an east–west {{state highway}} in Nassau County, New York, in the United States.

5000|$|Many urban freeways have entirely {{separate}} carriageways (and <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps)</b> to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes {{in such a}} configuration {{are often}} referred to as [...] "express lanes"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not [...] "split" [...] into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic.|$|R
50|$|A {{windmill}} interchange {{is similar}} to a turbine interchange, but it has much sharper turns, reducing its size and capacity. A variation of the windmill, called the diverging windmill, increases capacity by altering the direction of traffic flow of the interchanging highways, making the <b>connecting</b> <b>ramps</b> much more direct. The interchange is named for its similar overhead appearance to the blades of a windmill. The Vaanplein junction in the Netherlands was a windmill from its opening in 1977.
