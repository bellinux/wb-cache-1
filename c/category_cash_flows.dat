Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual accounting data in predicting future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> No published research has studied <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> accounting data to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> accrual components and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> models. In addition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are investigated to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> data are selected directly from the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have better predictive power than past earnings. Additionally, the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model and the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual components of earnings model have better predictive power than the earnings model. The findings of testing the models in an out-of-sample period suggest that the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model is a better predictor of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> than the other models. Furthermore, additional year lags of accounting data can improve the predictive power of the model.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles. The gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> An examination of the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. The results from the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary.

This decrease in the current value of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is based on the market dictated rate of return.

40|$|Understanding marketing’s {{contributions}} to the financial performance of firms is an important question for the field. A critical performance metric is <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability, or the potential for downside <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes relative to a target level. In Essay One, I conceptually develop the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability construct and distinguish it from a seemingly related construct, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, by tracing their unique nomological networks. I also provide a deeper examination of how market-based assets reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability. Specifically, I systematically describe the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of two market-based assets—brand equity and customer relationships—on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability. In Essay Two, my focus is on two value appropriation activities that support brand equity and customer relationships—advertising and receivables management, respectively. I examine how the incremental effect of advertising expenditures and accounts receivable on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes is moderated by two contextual factors: business scope (a firm characteristic) and consumer sentiment (an environmental characteristic). I simultaneously explore three <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes—levels, volatility, and vulnerability. To test these relationships, I utilize a dataset composed of over 2, 500 firms from 1999 to 2013. I find that the incremental effect of advertising and receivables on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> outcomes is contingent on business scope and consumer sentiment and provide managers strategic prescriptions based on these findings. Specifically, (1) narrow business scope firms can maximize <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance via low levels of receivables; high levels of advertising increase <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels and decrease <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, but not <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability; (2) broad business scope firms can increase <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels and reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> vulnerability via low levels of advertising and receivables; however, high levels of advertising and receivables are needed to reduce <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility; (3) when consumer sentiment is low, firms can maximize <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance via low levels of advertising and receivables; and (4) when consumer sentiment is high, no clear strategy emerges and firms must engage in trade-offs based on their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance goals...|$|R

Sixty companies of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) have been identified as a sample in the current study. Thirty companies were classified as debt restructuring and another 30 matching companies were classified as non-debt restructuring companies. The classification was done {{in order to determine the}} differences between <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> related ratios such as <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> changes, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over total debt, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over total assets, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> over current liabilities and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> per share issued. The study hypothesized that the means for the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> based ratios have no significant difference between debt restructuring and non-debt restructuring companies. Based on trend analysis, there is no obvious pattern obtained from the graph plotted using average figure for each of the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> related ratios. Trend analysis and Mann- Whitney U test show that no significant difference exists between the means for debt restructuring and non-debt restructuring companies for all the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> related ratios. The results from stepwise logistic regression analysis further strengthen the hypothesis that the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> information does not have predictive power. Even though <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> information has no predictive ability to forecast financial distress, it is useful for inter-company comparison...|$|R
40|$|I {{classify}} firms {{into groups}} of high, low, and negative sensitivity. I find that investment-cash flow sensitivity is nonmonotonic {{with respect to}} financial constraints, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> and growth opportunities. Firms classified as negative <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> sensitive have the lowest <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> highest growth opportunities, and appear the most financially constrained. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> insensitive firms have the highest <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> lowest growth opportunities, and appear the least financially constrained. To a large extent, the negative relationship between <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and investment {{is driven by the}} opposite trends followed by investment and <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> as firms grow through stages of their life cycle.
