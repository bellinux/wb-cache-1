This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods.

40|$|Many {{experiments}} using driving simulators or real roads {{have shown}} that using a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> while driving may cause an accident because it delays visual information processing by the driver. In this research, we examined the influence on driving performance of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use on a course that simulated streets. Driving conditions were driving only, listening to the car radio, hands-free <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and using a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> with the left hand. Driving performance measurements included braking response time to the brake lights of a preceding car, eye movement, distance from the vehicle in front and lane observance. The subjects were 50 drivers, including ten driving instructors. The mean glance duration when manipulating a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> was longer than when manipulating a hands-free set or car stereo. Braking reaction delay time increased in the following order: driving only, car radio, hands-free and, longest of all, <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> When the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> was used, car speed was slowest, and {{the distance from the}} vehicle in front became the longest. Glance duration other than to the front, indicating divided attention, was shortest during the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and there were also fewer instances of eye movement. In the case of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use, stable driving appeared to be more difficult, as there was substantial steering wheel deflection. In this experiment, it was confirmed that use of a hands-free set is effective to some extent, but driving performance was poorer than with driving only.

40|$|All {{mobile phone}} {{subscribers}} must pay a subscription fee {{to enjoy the}} convenience of this technology. Subscribers pay for the actual time spent talking on the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> Generally, {{there are two kinds}} of billing. With prepaid service, the subscriber buys a prepaid card and pays for the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service in advance. As the subscriber uses airtime the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> account is debited the appropriate amount of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service used. When the subscriber runs out of dollars in the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> account, they can no longer call until the account is prepaid for additional <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service or airtime. With postpaid service, cellular carriers bill customers based on how many minutes of airtime they use each month. When the customer places a call on an activated <b>cellular</b> <b>phone,</b> each minute the phone is connected is counted. Cellular carriers bill the customer on a monthly basis for the airtime used. There are some issues worth discussing such as fairness, non-repudiation, and non-usurpation. In this paper we propose a fair and secure mobile billing system. We introduce the "observer" concept to supervise billing to make it more objective and accepted by both cellular carriers and subscribers. The proposed scheme can detect illegal phone calls in real time and the subscriber cannot deny the deserved fees. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Problematic <b>Cellular</b> <b>Phone</b> Use Scale has been used for the evaluation of addiction to <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> and for the evaluation of the level of depression Beck Depression-Scale has been used. In the analysis of data, Ki-Sguare-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman Correlation Analysis have been used. p< 0. 05 has been agreed as the value of statistical sifnificance. 579 (% 82. 7) people in the study -group are female and 121 (% 17. 3) people in it are male. The average of their age is 20. 14 Â± 1. 76 years (min: 17,max: 26). It has been established that the students in the type of A at the department of midwifery have much more addiction to the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> (p< 0. 05 for each one). As the time of daily <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use has increased, the level of addiction has increased.

25|$|In {{an effort}} to limit the {{potential}} harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as car phones and bag phones) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power. Modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.|$|E
