40|$|Abstract [...] In {{this paper}} we discuss a model being used to {{optimize}} the system design of the Computer Centre {{of one of the most}} important Italian banking groups. Data and transactions, processed by the system, are grouped respectively indata sets and by type, so it is possible to deal with the large dimensions of the corresponding optimization models. The transactions ' arrivals are considered as stochastic variables and their probability values are estimated on the base of theoretical considerations. The solutions for two optimization problems, constructed and solved for different scenarios, are discussed in detail. 1. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM The scenario described by our model considers the daily transactions arriving at the main computer centre of an important Italian banking group. All the <b>computerized</b> <b>banking</b> operations are managed by this centre. For a better understanding a picture of our scenario is given in Fig. 1. There are four basic entities: (a) the data storage units (D. S.

40|$|The {{cybersecurity}} {{market is}} the fastest growing market in the United States; as such, leaders in financial institutions recognize their businesses are vulnerable, as money is accessible within <b>computerized</b> <b>banking</b> systems. The purpose of this multiple case {{study was to explore}} what strategies financial service leadersÂ use to recruit cybersecurity professionals. The conceptual framework for this study was the hierarchy of needs and stakeholder management theory. Data collection involved company archival documents and semistructured, open-ended interviews with 5 financial service leaders in the Midlands area of South Carolina who recruited skilled cybersecurity professionals to support long-term business sustainability. Coding, clustering, and theme development evolved through coding key words and actions, drawing ideas together into clusters, and evolving the prominent ideas into themes. During data analysis, the theoretical propositions underwent a sequential process, which included coding the data by hand. The use of member checking and methodological triangulation increased the trustworthiness of the study. Analysis revealed 3 themes: increased training, broadened social networking, and improved communication. Financial service leaders can use training to educate and recruit new cybersecurity professionals. Also, findings suggest the need for training to improve social networking and communicate as a team to increase profitability. The findings from this study may contribute to social change by helping business owners recruit skilled professionals to prevent or reduce cybersecurity threats...|$|E

40|$|Item banks {{developed}} by licensure agencies {{range from a}} collection of items stored on index cards to highly sophisticated electronic databases. Regardless of the storage mechanism, most banks contain items that have been organized and referenced according to procedures established by the licensure agency. This chapter outlines useful practices for building and maintaining a computerized item bank. We address storage of item text, graphics, and statistical history. We deal {{with the creation of}} paper-and-pencil and computerized tests from an item bank and the use of Item Response Theory (lRT) to calibrate and equate item banks. New directions in item banking are also discussed. Apparently coined in England during the mid- 1960 s, the term 2 ̆ 2 item bank 2 ̆ 2 was used to describe a group of test items that were 2 ̆ 2 organized, classified and catalogued like books in a library 2 ̆ 2 (Choppin, 1985). Subsequently, Bruce Choppin and others interested in item banking based on Item Response Theory (Hathaway, Houser, 2 ̆ 6 Kingsbury, 1985) attempted to distinguish between 2 ̆ 2 item banks 2 ̆ 2 (a collection of items calibrated with an IRT measurement system and equated to a common scale) and 2 ̆ 2 item pools 2 ̆ 2 (collections of items grouped by content but not calibrated). This distinction has not been widely embraced and often today the terms 2 ̆ 2 item bank 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 item pool 2 ̆ 2 are used interchangeably. Computerized item banking employs a computer software program to store collections of test items and their associated classifications and statistics. Computerization allows easy storage and retrieval of hundreds (for some organizations the number may be thousands or even tens of thousands) of items. A well organized, well-maintained computerized item bank can facilitate and enhance the construction of both paper-and-pencil and computerized tests. Items can be sorted and filtered to enable easy review by content experts and psychometric staff. The basic plan for item bank construction includes writing content valid, grammatically correct items (see Chapters 5 2 ̆ 6 6), categorizing items according to the content outline or 2 ̆ 2 blueprint 2 ̆ 2 that the testing agency utilizes, and entering the items into the computerized bank. Once a valid item bank is created, the orchestrated efforts of content experts and psychometricians are required to maintain it. Content experts must review the item bank on a systematic schedule to ensure that (a) items are current and relevant to the field of practice; (b) duplicate and similar items are identified and flagged; and (c) content within the bank is representative of the test blueprint. Psychometricians must also review the bank to guarantee that (a) the range of item difficulty is appropriate; (b) misfitting items have been identified and flagged for rewrite; and (c) the pass/fail standard is current. Licensure and certification agencies test a large range of candidates. Some agencies test less than 50 candidates per year whereas others test hundreds of thousands of candidates. Still, even agencies that test relatively few candidates usually have item banks of at least several hundred items. Although switching to computerized item banking involves the initial cost of developing or purchasing software and possible conversion costs for existing items, graphics, and statistics into the computerized bank, cost savings are realized in the long run by reducing professional and clerical time for item maintenance and test production. Another important benefit of computerization is reduction of error- the more data are manually manipulated, the greater the chance for mistakes. Thus, even very small testing agencies will benefit by computerizing their item banks. The following sections of this chapter outline various computerized item banking components. Licensure agencies need to review their item banking needs (both current and future) to decide which components of <b>computerized</b> <b>banking</b> are applicable for them...|$|E

40|$|Many {{services}} can be self-provided. An individual user or a user firm can, for example, {{choose to do}} its own accounting - choose to self-provide that service - instead of hiring an accounting firm to provide it. Since users can 'serve themselves' in many cases, {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that they can also innovate with respect to the services they self-provide - possibly without the assistance of service providers. In this paper, we conduct the first quantitative exploration of the importance of services innovation by users, focusing on the field of commercial and retail banking services. We find that 55 % of today's <b>computerized</b> commercial <b>banking</b> services were first developed and implemented by non-bank firms for their own use, and 44 % of today's <b>computerized</b> retail <b>banking</b> services were first developed and implemented by individual service users rather than by commercial financial service providers. Manual precursors to these services - manual procedures that carried out functions similar to computerized services in our sample - were almost always developed by users as self-services. Our empirical findings differ significantly from prevalent producer-centered views of service development. We speculate that the patterns we have observed in banking with respect to the major role of users in service development will prove to be quite general. If so, this will be an important matter: on the order of 75 % of GDP in advanced economies today is derived from services. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice in service development. Service innovation Service development User innovation...|$|R
