5000|$|The Tandy 1000 EX was {{designed}} as an entry-level IBM-compatible personal computer. The EX was a compact computer that had the keyboard and 5.25" [...] floppy drive built into the <b>computer</b> <b>casing.</b> The 5.25" [...] drive was accessible {{on the right-hand side}} of the computer. The EX was marketed as a starter system for people new to computing, and sold for US$1,000.00 from RadioShack in December 1986. The EX and, later, the HX would be among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their (relatively) low price. The EX doubled the on-board memory to 256 KB.|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are common}} flame retardants {{that are used}} {{in a wide variety of}} products such as <b>computer</b> <b>casing</b> and carpet. 1 These chemicals accumulate in both the environment and the human body. 2 Recent findings indicate that exposure to low concentrations of these chemicals may damage the nervous and reproduc-tive systems. Recently, the European Union banned PBDE compounds through the European Directive on Waste Elec-trical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and the Europea...|$|E
40|$|Robotics is {{becoming}} an increasingly important field in engineering research. The MARS (Multiple Autonomous Robots) team at the University of Pennsylvania fabricates smallscale, car-like robots. These robots are fitted with 12 infrared sensors and an omni directional camera for sensing {{as well as an}} onboard laptop computer with a wireless network. The robots can perform a variety of functions and tasks that, although seemingly simple individually, can be combined and manipulated to allow the robots to perform more complicated tasks. Over the course of the summer, I have participated heavily in the upgrade of the hardware on the robots. Participating in efforts on calibration, <b>computer</b> <b>casing,</b> and robot chassis, I have helped to make improvements, introduce new ideas, and documenting all of my summer efforts. The following will discuss the overall robot structure and then continue to explain my findings and efforts to the MARS project {{over the course of the}} summer. 1...|$|E
50|$|By 1986 Carapelli was {{exporting}} various computer {{parts to}} Canada and India including <b>computer</b> <b>casings,</b> power supplies, motherboards & additional add-on peripherals and by 1991 {{the company had}} started exporting notebooks from every OEM manufacturer under the Impulse brand moniker to Canada. At that time Impulse was ranked 3rd in notebook sales nationwide.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} lock is {{a lock on}} a computer. A lock may be used on a <b>computer's</b> <b>casing</b> {{to prevent}} it from being opened to remove or swap out parts, or install unauthorized components. And a lock may be used on a computer to disallow it from being turned on or used without a physical key. There are also locks to attach cables to laptops to prevent them from being taken.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to various}} in-character {{interviews}} with Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat attended Astana University, {{where he studied}} English, journalism and plague research. He created five new plagues which [...] "killed over five million goats in Uzbekistan." [...] Prior to his plague research, Borat worked as an ice maker, gypsy catcher, animal puller (one who produces semen from animals) and computer maintenance engineer (specifically, removing dead birds which had nested in the vents in the <b>computer's</b> <b>casing).</b> He {{now works as a}} professional journalist and announcer on Kazakh television. This job [...] "helps Borat and other Kazakhs express themselves in ways they otherwise {{would not have been able}} to do." ...|$|R
50|$|The Snow White design {{language}} {{was developed by}} Hartmut Esslinger's Frog Design, and was used from 1984 to 1990. The Apple IIc was the first Apple product to use the {{design language}}. Snow White is characterised by its heavy use of vertical and horizontal lines for both decoration, ventilation and {{to create the illusion}} that the <b>computer</b> <b>casings</b> were smaller than they actually were. The colour palette mostly consisted of light gray (Platinum) and off-white (fog). Other motifs include minimal surface texturing and an inlaid three-dimensional Apple logo which was diamond cut to the exact shape. The last Apple product to use the Snow White design language was the Macintosh IIfx which was released in 1990.|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste computers {{is an issue that}} is gaining increasing interest around the world. In this paper, results from the fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor of three different waste <b>computer</b> monitor <b>casings</b> composed of mainly acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer and two different waste <b>computer</b> body <b>casings</b> composed of mostly poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) type polymers are presented. Preliminary characterization of the waste plastics was investigated using coupled thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FT-IR). The results showed that the plastics decomposed in two stages. For the ABS-containing monitor casings, aromatic and aliphatic material were released in the first and second stages. The PVC-containing <b>computer</b> body <b>casing</b> samples showed a first-stage evolution of HCl and a second stage evolution of aromatic and aliphatic material and further HCl. In addition, each of the five plastics was fast-pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C. The fluidized bed pyrolysis led to the conversion of most of the plastics to pyrolysis oil, although the two PVC computer body cases produced large quantities of HCl. The pyrolysis oils were characterized by GC-MS and it was found that they were chemically very heterogeneous and contained a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, halogenated, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{durables}} are non-packaging {{products that}} have varying life spans, including toothbrushes, pens (short-term), <b>computer</b> <b>casings,</b> whitegoods inserts, and automotive parts (long-term). Generally, {{the lifetime of}} the durables is 5 - 10 years, which induces a disposal lag [Scheirs, 1998, 305]. Rapid advances in technology continually reduce the product life span of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE), which is now less than 2 years in some cases [Brennan, 2001]. The properties of recycled engineering plastics in consumer durables can be higher in value than virgin commodities. Their mechanical properties are frequently retained, even after medium to long-term use (~ 10 - 15 years). Typically, engineering plastics currently includes computer and electronic housings as well as automotive plastics. This section looks at decision-making strategies related to recycling materials used for manufacturing durable consumer products...|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} {{consisting of a}} polymer and additives with different physico-chemical properties. We developed a broad screening method to elucidate the nature of compounds present in plastics used in electrical/electronic equipment commonly found at homes (e. g., electrical adaptors, <b>computer</b> <b>casings,</b> heaters). The analysis was done by (a) solvent extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high accuracy/resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) with different ionization sources or (b) direct analysis of the solid by ambient mass spectrometry high accuracy/resolution TOFMS. The different ionization methods showed different selectivity and sensitivity for the different compound classes and were complementary. A variety of antioxidants, phthalates, UV filters, and flame retardants were found in most samples. Furthermore, some recently reported impurities or degradation products derived from flame retardants were identified, such as hydroxylated triphenyl phosphate and tetrabromobisphenol A monoglycidyl ether...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{chip area}} network which enables {{wireless}} communication among chips fosters development in wireless communication {{and it is}} envisioned that future hardware system and developmental functionality will require multimaterial. However, the traditional system architecture is limited by channel bandwidth-limited interfaces, throughput, delay, and power consumption {{and as a result}} limits the efficiency and system performance. Wireless interconnect has been proposed to overcome scalability and performance limitations of multihop wired architectures. Characterization and modeling of channel become more important for specification of choice of modulation or demodulation techniques, channel bandwidths, and other mitigation techniques for channel distortion and interference such as equalization. This paper presents an analytical channel model for characterization, modeling, and analysis of wireless chip-to-chip or interchip interconnects in wireless chip area network with a particular focus on large-scale analysis. The proposed model accounts for both static and dynamic channel losses/attenuation in high-speed systems. Simulation and evaluation of the model with experimental data conducted in a <b>computer</b> desktop <b>casing</b> depict that proposed model matched measurement data very closely. The transmission of EM waves via a medium introduces molecular absorption due to various molecules within the material substance. This model is a representative of channel loss profile in wireless chip-area-network communication and good for future electronic circuits and high-speed systems design...|$|R
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{systems are}} {{designed}} based upon having redundant systems with replaceable orbital replacement units (ORUs). These ORUs {{are designed to}} be swapped out fairly quickly, but some are very large, and some are made up of many components. When an ORU fails, it is replaced on orbit with a spare; the failed unit is sometimes returned to Earth to be serviced and re-launched. Such a system is not feasible for a 500 + day long-duration mission beyond low Earth orbit. The components that make up these ORUs have mixed reliabilities. Components that make up the most mass-such as <b>computer</b> housings, pump <b>casings,</b> and the silicon board of PCBs-typically are the most reliable. Meanwhile components that tend to fail the earliest-such as seals or gaskets-typically have a small mass. To better understand the problem, my project is to create a parametric model that relates both the mass of ORUs to reliability, as well as the mass of ORU subcomponents to reliability...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) {{that have been}} widely produced and used as flame retardants since the 1970 ’s in many consumer products such as carpet and drape linings, plastics used in electronics, <b>computer</b> and television <b>casings</b> and polyurethane foam used in chairs, sofas and mattresses. PBDEs are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which, by definition, are toxic in nature, persistent in the environment and accumulative in living organisms. Animal studies have found PBDEs to cause health defects such as fetal malformations, delayed onset of puberty, decreased sperm count, behavioral changes, permanent learning and memory impairment, endocrine disruption, as well as cancer at high doses. Recent research involving humans reported that elevated breast milk PBDEs levels in their mothers are associated with cryptorchidism (absence of one or both testes from the scrotum) in newborn boys and adverse birth outcomes as well as elevated serum PBDE levels in mothers are associated with low sperm count in young men. There are three commonly manufactured PBDE commercial mixtures: Penta-, Octa-, and Deca-BDEs. Two of them (Octa- and Penta-BDEs) have been banned by the European Union and are being voluntarily phased out in the United States. However, Deca continues to be manufactured, used, and imported in the United States. This MPH thesis consists of a literature review of peer reviewed scientific articles concerned with PBDEs in the environment and in humans, {{as well as a}} discussion concerning different routes of exposure to PBDEs and their blood, milk and tissue levels as surrogates for body burdens in North Americans and in people from other countries. Results of this literature review shows PBDE levels in human blood, milk and tissues are higher in North Americans than people from other countries worldwide. To date, the highest level of PBDEs was found in a toddler’s blood in a California study. Despite the fact that PBDEs are associated with adverse health effects, and highest levels of PBDEs in North Americans, Deca-BDE is still manufactured, used and imported in the United States. There is an urgent need of new federal regulatory policy to ban completely the production, importation and use of all commercial mixtures of PBDEs. ...|$|R
