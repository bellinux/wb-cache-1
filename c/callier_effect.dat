To optimize these reactions and to minimize pollution, turbulence is a funda- mental tool. Several factors are at the origin of turbulence in the complex flows, among these factors, we can quote the effect of wings in the rotating flows. The interest of this work is to model and to simulate numeri- <b>cally</b> the <b>effect</b> of wings on the level of turbulence in the flow between two contra-rotating cylinders. We have fixed on these two cylinders eight wings uniformly distributed and we have varied the height of the wings to have six values from 2 mm to 20 mm by maintaining the same Reynolds number of rotation. The numerical tool is based on a statistical model in a point using the closing of the second order of the transport equations of the Reynolds stresses (Reynolds Stress Model: RSM). We have modelled wings effect on the flow by a source term added to the equation tangential speed. The results of the numerical simulation showed that all the average and fluctuating variables are affected the value of the kinetic energy of turbulence as those of Reynolds stresses increase with the height of the wings...|$|R
40|$|Many {{areas in}} the western U. S. are being thinned to reduce fire hazard and spread. Often the most {{economical}} solution for the disposal of the thinned biomass is to grind and leave the material onsite. These treatments are assumed to reduce {{the ability of the}} forest to carry a crown fire, but the effects of the added material on forest ecosystems are poorly known because such treatments do not have a natural analogue. Managers and the public are interested in understanding the impacts of the addition of this woody material on forest ecosystems so they can evaluate the benefi ts against the potential ecological costs of these treatments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the ecological effects of mulching treatments in a broadly replicated study in the dominant coniferous forest types for the southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau. The study specifi <b>cally</b> targeted the <b>effects</b> on fuel loading, vegetation response (understory, species richness, and exotics), tree regeneration, soil microclimate and soil nitrogen, and carbon storage...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{recognition}} cues {{are used}} to discriminate among species, con-specifics, and potentially between patrilines in social insect colonies. There is an ongoing debate about the possible persistence of patriline cues despite evidence for the mixing of colony odors via a “gestalt” mechanism in social insects, because patri- line recognition could lead to nepotism. We analyzed the variation in recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons) with different mating frequencies or queen num- bers in 688 Formica exsecta ants from 76 colonies. We found no increase in the profile variance as genetic diversity increased, indicating that patriline effects were absent or possibly obscured by a gestalt mechanism. We then demonstrated that an isolated individual’s profile changed considerably relative to their colony pro- file, before stabilizing after 5 days. We used these isolated individuals to eliminate the masking effects of the gestalt mechanism, and we detected a weak but statisti- <b>cally</b> significant patriline <b>effect</b> in isolated adult workers and also in newly emerged callow workers. Thus, our evidence suggests that genetic variation in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of F. exsecta ants (n-alkanes and alkenes) resulted in differences among patrilines, but they were obscured in the colony environment, thereby avoiding costly nepotistic behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cue-exposure therapy (CET) {{has proven}} its effi cacy in {{treating}} patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder who {{are resistant to}} standard treatment. Furthermore, incorporating virtual reality (VR) technology is increasingly considered a valid exposure method that may help to increase the effi cacy of standard treatments {{in a variety of}} eating disorders. Although immersive displays improve the benefi cial effects, expensive technology is not always necessary. Method: We aimed to assess whether exposure to food related virtual environments could decrease food craving in a non-clinical sample. In addition, we specifi <b>cally</b> compared the <b>effects</b> of two VR systems (one non-immersive and one immersive) during CET. We therefore applied a one-session CET to 113 undergraduate students. Results: Decreased food craving was found during exposure to both VR environments compared with pre-treatment levels, supporting the effi cacy of VR-CET in reducing food craving. We found no signifi cant differences in craving between immersive and non-immersive systems. Conclusions: Low-cost non-immersive systems applied through 3 D laptops can improve the accessibility of this technique. By reducing the costs and improving the usability, VR-CET on 3 D laptops may become a viable option that can be readily applied in a greater range of clinical contexts...|$|R
40|$|Liquefaction {{may have}} large inﬂuence on {{performance}} of anchored quay walls and {{is important to}} include in seismic design. Design codes provide evaluation methods that provide hardly any insight in the actual development of excess pore pressures and the don’t consider soil structure interaction. There {{is a need for}} tools that include these aspects, since performance based design principles are more often adopted in earth- quake engineering. In this research effects of excess pore pressures on dynamic earth pressures and dynamic behaviour of an anchored are investigated. Different evaluation methods are analysed on their performance. Initially prescribed pseudo-static methods in design codes are applied, followed by a dynamic analysis using ﬁnite element model PLAXIS. After a broad literature overview of available pseudo-static methods and sensitivity analysis. A case study in Akita Port is adopted where two similar anchored quay walls were both hit by the Nihonkai Chubu Earthquake in 1983. One quay wall survived the seismic event, the other suffered severe damage. Damage was related to occurrence of liquefaction in the backﬁll. Pseudo-static- and dynamic analyses are applied to assess both structures. Performance of both analyses is evaluated and effects of liquefaction are investigated. Pseudo-static analysis of the quay wall without liquefaction are, after reduction of the seismic coefﬁcient, rea- sonably in correspondence with observations. Active earth pressures are well predicted, while passive earth pressures are overestimated. The relatively simple method is however suitable to give a ﬁrst indication of failure/non-failure of the structure. On the other hand the pseudo-static method is not capable to realisti- <b>cally</b> include <b>effects</b> of excess pore pressures. Large stiffness differences between layers lead to exaggerated bending moments and displacements, again passive resistance is overestimated. Since Mononobe-Okabe is a limit equilibrium method, it is not well able to capture progressive failure. By performing a dynamic analysis, using the ﬁnite element model PLAXIS, insight is obtained in the actual soil structure interaction. The Hardening Soil small strain (HSsmall) constitutive material model is adopted to model the static and dynamic behaviour of soil not vulnerable to liquefaction. A calibrated dynamic cal- culation lead to reasonable accurate for the case without liquefaction. Bending moment distribution and displacements are in line with observations. Different earthquake motions lead to relatively large spread in displacement of the structure, less differences are found for bending moment distribution. To include effects of liquefaction the user-deﬁned UBC 3 D-PLM constitutive material model is assigned to potential liqueﬁable layers. Liquefaction resistance depends on the type of soil and on the stress state of the soil. By calibrating the UBC 3 D-PLM model a reasonably accurately prediction of the onset of liquefaction can be obtained for the considered stress state. Performance of the model deteriorates for variation of the stress state, especially for initial static shear stresses. Therefore a calibration method is developed to get around this limitation. Initially zones with a speciﬁc stress state are identiﬁed around the structure. Subsequently the model is calibrated to accurately predict the onset of liquefaction for each considered stress state, leading to a calibrated model parameter set for each zone. After adopting all parametersets for each zone a calibrated dynamic calculation is performed of the system, leading to reasonably accurate results of the development of excess pore pressures around the structure. Calculated displacements and bending moments are in line with observations in the ﬁeld and the failure mode is well predicted. Insight is gained in the development of excess pore pressures in time at different locations. Leading {{to the conclusion that the}} UBC 3 D-PLM model is capable to reasonable accurately evaluate liquefaction and corresponding effects on an anchored quay wall. Finally link is made between the followed procedure and applicability of this procedure for performing a dy- namic analysis including liquefaction for one of the anchored quay walls in the Eemshaven in Groningen. Important aspects that are typical for Groningen are the location of the bedrock and corresponding transla- tion of the earthquake motion and characteristics of the motion.
