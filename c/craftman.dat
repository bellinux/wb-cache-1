40|$|ABSTRACT   Sambas {{traditional}} woven clothes {{produced in}} Sumber Harapan Village, Sambas Regency, {{are not known}} in neighboring sub-district and regency areas, but also in Pontianak City and even in Malaysia. Although many mid-scale and large organizations went bankrupt because of the tough economic crisis, this small-scale businesses remain operating without any serious hindrance. This proved that small-scale industries do not assign our government any burdens. Concerning this fact, {{it is recommended that}} these industries should be empowered. Underlined by these fact, this study is intend to investigate: (1) Some attempts of sambas woven clothes <b>craftmen</b> to raise their empowerment in order to optimize their business potentials, (2) Sambas Regency Government and private sector roles, and (3) sambas traditional woven clothes empowerment process in Sumber Harapan Village, Sambas Regency. The results identify that the <b>craftmen</b> attempts in optimizing their business potentials contain the following values: (a) economical values, covering income raise, family welfare and family existence and their business; (b) social values, covering aspects of increasing <b>craftmen</b> dignity and social status in which they should operate their own business instead of being workers; (c) cultural values, covering their braveness, struggle, creativity, productivity and will to improve woven cloth design. The small-scale industries have provided economic sources, but they still cannot improve <b>craftmen</b> economic continuously. Sambas Regency Government roles as facilitator agency for the small-scale business has made some efforts by releasing some policies and small-scale industries empowerment. Unfortunately, these efforts has produced optimal outcome. To make the same efforts, private business offers partnership plan through merchandising and production patters. The <b>craftmen</b> empowerment is applied through three phases: initial, guidance, help, and establishment. The <b>craftmen</b> position from their initial existence up to economic crisis of 1997 - 1998 is emansipatory position. This position has improved into empowerment process at the second year of the economic crisis. Keywords: Small-Scale Industry, Empowerment, Rural areas</p...|$|R

40|$|Gamelan melting process (casting) {{plays a role}} in {{the process}} of making Balinese gamelan. Furnace is a major {{component}} in this melting process. <b>Craftmen</b> use traditional melting furnace with an open form in which the air flow is needed in the injector fuel combustion using the straight shape. Injector of this model provides less air flow evenly so that the combustion process takes quite a long time. Ergo thermal injector has been introduced in service activities in the village <b>craftmen</b> group Tihingan Banjarangkan District of Klungkung. This furnace has the airflow coming out of the blower which then flows in a flow-shaped convergent-divergent. The function of this model is that the pressure of the incoming air flow passes into the air injectors to increase and spread evenly in the furnace chamber. <b>Craftmen</b> were trained directly how to make this model kitchen and directly transform traditional stoves with models furnace injector is introduced. The results showed that the combustion of fuel use was decreased by 12. 96 %. Fuel savings resulting from the latest injector models can provide the required distribution of air in the combustion process fuel (charcoal) to be more perfect and resulting high temperatures generated high.
