5|$|Banagher has two bow-fronted Georgian {{buildings}} {{dating from}} the mid-to-late 18th century and both are listed as protected structures. One is a detached seven-bay, two-storey building, called <b>Crank</b> House, due to its location {{on the corner of}} Main Street and <b>Crank</b> Road. It was restored in the early 1990s by the Offaly West Enterprise Co-operative Society and opened in 1992. It now houses an exhibition hall, tourist office, retail and enterprise units and a hostel. It was formerly used as the headquarters for Crann, an NGO dedicated to planting native trees and protecting Ireland's woodlands. It is now used by the West Offaly Partnership as a Community Enterprise Centre.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a <b>crank.</b> A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the <b>crank</b> was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the <b>crank</b> handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of <b>crank</b> handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the <b>crank</b> handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

5|$|Commercially {{prepared}} old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, {{which may}} be prepared by simply adding cold water to the mix. Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand <b>crank,</b> drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler <b>crank</b> arm, an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cranks</b> were {{formerly}} {{common on}} some {{machines in the}} early 20th century; for example almost all phonographs before the 1930s were powered by clockwork motors wound with <b>cranks.</b> Reciprocating piston engines use <b>cranks</b> to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. Internal combustion engines of early 20th century automobiles were usually started with hand <b>cranks</b> (known as starting handles in the UK), before electric starters came into general use.|$|R

5|$|Redheffer {{moved to}} New York City {{and set up}} a similar scam after {{rebuilding}} his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. He discovered that the machine was operated by a man using a <b>crank</b> in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear <b>crank</b> axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|The Mutoscope {{worked on}} the same {{principle}} as a flip book, with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user-operated hand <b>crank.</b> The cards were lit by electric light bulbs inside the machine, a system devised by Arthur Marvin's brother, Henry, {{one of the founders}} of the Biograph company. Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the <b>crank</b> axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a <b>crank</b> and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the <b>crank,</b> a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible <b>crank</b> mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of <b>crank</b> mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E
5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside cranks were set at 120°, with the inside <b>crank</b> displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated valve gear derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of valve gear between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a <b>crank.</b> Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E

5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the <b>Crank</b> Road.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a <b>crank,</b> he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Manufacturers of {{uncoupled}} cycling <b>cranks</b> {{claim that}} their use will increase economy of motion and gross efficiency. Purportedly, this occurs by altering the muscle-recruitment patterns {{contributing to the}} resistive forces occurring during the recovery phase of the pedal stroke. Uncoupled <b>cranks</b> use an independent clutch design by which each leg cycles independently of the other (ie, the <b>cranks</b> are not fixed together). However, research examining the efficacy of training with uncoupled <b>cranks</b> is equivocal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of short-term training with uncoupled <b>cranks</b> on the performance-related variables economy of motion, gross efficiency, maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), and muscle-activation patterns. Methods: Sixteen trained cyclists were matched-paired into either an uncoupled-crank or a normal-crank training group. Both groups performed 5 wk of training on their assigned <b>cranks.</b> Before and after training, participants completed a graded exercise test using normal <b>cranks.</b> Expired gases were collected to determine economy of motion, gross efficiency, and VO 2 max, while integrated electromyography (iEMG) was used to examine muscle-activation patterns of the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius. Results: No significant changes between groups were observed for economy of motion, gross efficiency, VO 2 max, or iEMG in the uncoupled- or normal-crank group. Conclusions: Five weeks of training with uncoupled cycling <b>cranks</b> had no effect on economy of motion, gross efficiency, muscle recruitment, or VO 2 max compared with training on normal <b>cranks...</b>|$|R
