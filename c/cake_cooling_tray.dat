50|$|The {{price of}} a golf cart can range {{anywhere}} from under US$1,000 to well over US$20,000 per cart, depending on several factors. These factors may include {{whether or not a}} fleet of carts is being purchased for a golf course or a country club, for example, and whether the carts are new or used. Other factors may include options such as equipment requirements, and how many people the cart is meant to transport. With the rise in popularity of golf carts, many golf clubs or country clubs offer storage and energy options to golf cart owners. This has led to the modification of golf carts to suit use at the particular golf course. Typical modification includes windshields, ball cleaners, <b>cooler</b> <b>trays,</b> upgraded motor or speed controller (to increase speed and/or torque), and lift kits.|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{fractional}} distillation, a liquid mixture is heated in the distilling flask, {{and the resulting}} vapor rises up the fractionating column (see Figure 1). The vapor condenses on glass spurs (known as trays or plates) inside the column, {{and returns to the}} distilling flask, refluxing the rising distillate vapor. The hottest tray is {{at the bottom of the}} column and the <b>coolest</b> <b>tray</b> is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray reach an equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gas form all the way to the top, where it may then proceed through a condenser, which cools the vapor until it condenses into a liquid distillate. The separation may be enhanced by the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.).|$|R

40|$|Bio-crude {{pyrolysis}} oil is obtained {{by a process}} called fastpyrolysis, in which almost any organic-based feedstock is thermally processed at moderate temperatures, {{in the range of}} 400 - 600 °C, in the absence of oxygen at short residence times.

In this communication we are reporting a concept on improving the acidic properties, by means of a combined catalyzed and adsorption approach. We found that fast pyrolysis oil can be upgraded through alcoholysis using bio-based alcohols, n-BuOH and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, that are biomass derived bulk chemicals. The reaction is acid catalysed, whereas water is continuously separated from the condensate mixture by a molecular sieve adsorption. Under optimal conditions, the ultimate acidity and water content of the upgraded product are marginal...|$|R

50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{shown in}} the diagram represents a batch distillation {{as opposed to a}} continuous distillation. The liquid feed mixture to be distilled is placed into the round-bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules, and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. As the mixture is heated and boils, vapor rises up the column. The vapor condenses on the glass platforms (known as plates or trays) inside the column and runs back down into the liquid below, thereby refluxing the upflowing distillate vapor. The hottest tray is {{at the bottom of the}} column and the <b>coolest</b> <b>tray</b> is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray is at equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gaseous form all the way to the top. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, where it cools until it condenses into a liquid. The separation can be enhanced with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.). The process continues until all the most volatile components in the liquid feed boil out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the rise in temperature shown on the thermometer. For continuous distillation, the feed mixture enters in the middle of the column.|$|R

40|$|For head {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, local gradient coils {{are often used}} to achieve high solution images. To accommodate the human head and shoulder, the head gradient coils are usually designed in an asymmetric configuration, allowing the region-of-uniformity (ROU) close to the coil 2 ̆ 7 s patient end. However, the asymmetric configuration leads to technical difficulties in maintaining a high gradient performance for the insertable head coil with very limited space. In this work, we present a practical design configuration of an asymmetric insertable gradient head coil offering an improved performance. In the proposed design, at the patient end, the primary and secondary coils are connected using an additional radial surface, thus allowing the coil conductors distributed on the flange to ensure an improvement in the coil performance. At the service end, the primary and shielding coils are not connected, to permit access to shim <b>trays,</b> <b>cooling</b> system piping, cabling, and so on. The new designs are compared with conventional coil configurations and the simulation results show that, with a similar field quality in the ROU, the proposed coil pattern has improved construction characteristics (open service end, well-distributed wire pattern) and offers a better coil performance (lower inductance, higher efficiency, etc) than conventional head coil configurations...|$|R

The raw material was varied by adding corn flour to the rice (IR- 36 and IR- 42) flours to get the proportions of 100, 75, 50, 25 % and 0 % (100 % corn flour). Higher amilose content of the flours (IR- 42 rice 15. 1 %, IR- 36 18. 4 %, and corn 26. 8 %) gave higher moisture content of the raw rice crackers produced by the simplified method, smaller expansion of the fried product with a consequence of smaller higroscopicity, but resulted in poorer crispiness.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Strawberries are an {{extremely}} valuable crop, {{but they are}} also very sensitive to decay if not cooled and maintained at proper temperatures. Strawberries are typically packaged in the field and quickly transported to a cooling facility, where they are precooled by forcing cold air through the vents of the packaging. Over the last several years, there has been a shift in the packaging used for strawberries. Many of the open-top pint baskets have been replaced by clamshell designs with hinged lids and less vent area. In addition, there has been an increased retail demand for a larger tray that fits five trays to a pallet layer rather than six trays per layer. In this work, strawberries packaged in clamshell containers and a variety of tray designs were precooled in commercial cooling systems. To determine the speed of cooling for each treatment, both the 7 / 8 th cooling time and the cooling coefficient were calculated. It was found that the control package combination (with a design that fits six trays per pallet layer) cooled significantly faster than the other treatments, which fit five trays per pallet layer. It is thought that the cross-orientation of trays that occurs in the five trays per layer configuration may slow cooling if the vents are not designed properly. No major differences were found for <b>cooling</b> using corrugated <b>trays</b> versus returnable plastic containers. It was found that the clamshell container and tray should be designed together and chosen properly to allow maximum air-to-product contact during cooling. Variations in air temperature during commercial cooling tests may cause errors in determining 7 / 8 th cooling times...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} a review from David Jeffries of AllMusic. David Jeffries responded, [...] "Few mainstream artists {{can keep the}} lazy release schedule Don Hathaway's daughter does and retain a strong fan base. It's been a whole decade since Lalah Hathaway released {{one of her own}} albums and half that long since she joined Joe Sample for The Song Lives On. It's her warm voice, smooth delivery, and allegiance to fad-free R&B that keeps the faithful patiently waiting. Delivering on all counts, Outrun the Sky is a fan's dream and the singer's best showcase since her debut. While The Song Lives On was more ambitious and in turn brought more fans, Outrun the Sky is a better showcase. Not only does Hathaway cover a wider spectrum of tones and moods but she also producers and writes most of the highlights of the album. Her stream-of-consciousness lyrics for the title track give a more personal picture of the artist and paint her as an approachable dreamer who's as unsure as anyone. Hathaway's inspired writing is responsible for many of the other warm and reflective winners but it's the closing [...] "Boston" [...] that best illustrates how this husky voiced siren can conjure up a cosmopolitan song and deliver it with heart. Including her smoky take on Luther Vandross' [...] "Forever, for Always, for Love" [...] from the Forever, for Always, for Luther tribute is the icing on this <b>cool</b> <b>cake.</b> The ballad-heavy album still has its fair share of grooves that are rooted in R&B but the overall easy temperament isn't going to alienate any of Hathaway's smooth jazz converts.
