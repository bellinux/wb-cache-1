50|$|In 1961, {{he took a}} {{snapshot}} of a dustbin. The quadrille photo was implemented and expanded on the canvas. Shortly after seeing a painting by Franz Kline, Artschwager discovered Celotex, a rough-textured fiberboard used on ceilings as acoustic paneling, as a medium to enhance the load gesture. Handle (1962) was the breakthrough piece. A rectangle 4 feet wide and 30 inches high is crafted from a cylinder of honed and polished wood. Although three-dimensional like a sculpture, it hangs on the wall like a painting, only enclosing {{a view of the}} wall behind it. That same year, he directed his first <b>combination</b> <b>work,</b> using painting and Celotex sculpture (Portrait I and Portrait II). Also from 1962 Artschwager painted grey acrylic monochrome pictures, basing his images on black-and-white photographs, characteristically of modern buildings as shown in property advertisements, as in Apartment House (1964).|$|E

5000|$|Hunnigale {{started his}} career as bass guitarist with the Vibes Corner Collective. In 1983, LGR Records issued his debut release as a singer, [...] "Slipping Away", which was {{followed}} by [...] "Got To Know You" [...] on the Street Vibes label, a label that Hunnigale set up with Fitzroy Blake, who had also {{been a member of}} the Street Vibes Collective). He topped the UK reggae chart in 1987 with [...] "Be My Lady", which was followed by his debut album, In This Time. A string of hits followed, and he enjoyed another UK reggae number one with [...] "Ragamuffin Girl", a combination single recorded with Tippa Irie. The single was also voted Best British Reggae Record by Echoes newspaper at the end of the year. He won a Best Newcomer award at the Celebrity Awards in 1987, and won Best British Reggae Album at the British Reggae Industry Awards the same year. The success of the single led to further <b>combination</b> <b>work</b> with Irie, including two albums - The New Decade on Island Records and Done Cook and Currie for Rebel MC's Tribal Base label. The latter was produced by Hunnigale and he also played all the instruments on it. He also recorded in Jamaica, with producers such as Gussie Clarke. Hunnigale's second solo album, Mr. Vibes, followed in 1992. In 1993, he again linked up with Tippa irie for the [...] "Shouting For The Gunners" [...] single, a celebration of the football club that they both supported, Arsenal FC. 1994 saw Hunnigale moving in a more rootsy direction with Mr. Government, recorded with Neil [...] "Mad Professor" [...] Fraser. Hunnigale again linked with Irie in 1995 for a version of [...] "Declaration of Rights" [...] recorded for his Nah Give Up compilation. Nah Give Up won the Best Reggae Album MOBO Award in 1996, one of several awards Hunnigale won during the mid-1990s. He also recorded duets with Dennis Brown ("Cupid"), Lloyd Brown ("Lonely Girl"), and Janet Lee Davis ("We Can Work It Out"). In 1996, Hunnigale performed at Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash festival. Towards the end of 1996, Hunnigale performed as part of Passion, along with Glamma Kid and Nerious Joseph, spending eight weeks at number one in the UK reggae chart with [...] "No Diggity".|$|E
5000|$|Lashara is the 12-year-old {{ruler of}} the Shtrayu Empire. The sudden death of her father causes her to inherit the throne, but as the series begins she is {{traveling}} away {{to school in the}} Holy Land. She slowly loses her position of power to Babalun as the series progresses. She is notorious for being extremely tight with and concerned about spending money (a trait, according to a remark made by one of Ulyte's operatives, possibly inherited from her mother), and when not busy with other tasks she is usually seen busily adding up her finances with an abacus (as her kingdom is currently in debt) and she is always on the lookout to make some [...] "easy money" [...] without the outlay of any capital. She refuses to pay Kenshi's wages as her attendant from the Shtrayu national budget, and at one point she is questioned about why Kenshi's Holy Land earnings have not been paid to him; her reaction intimates that she may be keeping the money for herself. She takes Kenshi in as an attendant after he fails to follow through on an attempt to assassinate her, and along with Chiaia she keeps Kenshi's identity a secret until he shows his capabilities in battling the Sacred Mechanoids of Dagmyer and his cronies. Lashara is the niece of Queen Flora and always refers to herself was if she is actually two people, using terms such as [...] "we, or us" [...] (it is, in fact, majestic plural). It is hinted that she is most likely in love with Kenshi, but given her circumstances, she is not allowed to show such feelings to others. She shows a bit of curiosity towards the opposite sex, as shown in episodes 2 and 3 where she is shown to be a little perverted about Kenshi (especially in allowing Mexiah to turn Kenshi into a [...] "massage machine"). Despite her mature-like behavior, she claims that she acts this way because of her upbringing and former education, not because she was like that initially. Her personal vessel is the Swan (Suwan). From episode 10 onwards, there are clear signs of feelings for Kenshi, especially when she breaks down into tears and pleads for him not to leave her side. Her name is a reference to Lashara Moon and Photon Earth from Kajishima's earlier work, Photon. She also uses Kenshi as a <b>combination</b> <b>work</b> horse and method of tying other rich people to her in various ways.|$|E

40|$|Domain-specific {{languages}} (DSLs) {{are typically}} implemented by code generation, in which domain-specific constructs are translated to a general-purpose “host ” language. Aspect-oriented languages go one step further. An aspect weaver doesn’t just generate code, it transforms code {{in the host}} language. In both cases, {{one of the major}} challenges in building and using the DSL is achieving good integration between the code generator and the host language. Generated code should be type safe, and any errors should be reported before generation. Partial evaluation and multi-stage languages are excellent tools for implementing ordinary DSLs which satisfy these requirements. Combining partial evaluation with reflection could potentially yield a system which is strong enough to perform aspect weaving as well. This paper discusses some of the technical hurdles which must be overcome to make such a <b>combination</b> <b>work</b> in practice. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our approach}} of coupling the interactive software verification system KIV [Reif et al., 1997] with the Model Elimination based, complete automated theorem prover PROTEIN [Baumgartner and Furbach, 1994]. In {{order to make}} this <b>combination</b> <b>work</b> in practice, we propose to incorporate domain knowledge readily given from the KIV domain into PROTEIN. More specifically, we extend Model Elimination by a concept of simplification based on conditional rewrite rules. The extension is defined {{in such a way}} that rewrite rules as given from the KIV system can easily be accommodated. This yields better performance for proof automatisation and thus relieves the system engineer from more interactions. In the paper, we describe the new simplification technique, show completeness, and demonstrate with practical practical experiments from the KIV domain the benefits. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to design and build a work cell that utilized a robotic vision system to assemble a micro motor. The work cell design consisted of an Adept SCARA robot with a vision system, end-of-arm tooling, and a <b>combination</b> <b>work</b> surface/ lighting system. On-screen vision tools were applied to images of the parts, both binary and gray scale, to assist in accurate part recognition. Using these images, retained by the vision system as reference, the robotic vision software was programmed to enable the robot {{to pick up the}} various parts in random positions within the cell and assemble them into the micro motor. The techniques used allow for accurate identification of the parts with no concern for orientation during part presentation for pickup or placement. The micro motor assembly involves three parts, two of which mate intimately with one another and have close clearances. The whole assembly is complicated by the small size of the individual parts. The assembly of the motor was quite difficult to accomplish and had numerous problems associated with it that needed to be overcome...|$|E
