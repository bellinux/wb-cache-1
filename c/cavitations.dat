25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is {{closely tied to}} fog availability; taller trees become less {{frequent}} as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem. Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when <b>cavitations</b> form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E

Typical <b>cavitation</b> instabilities occur {{in the range of}} <b>cavitation</b> number where the inducer head is not affected by <b>cavitation.</b> This type of <b>cavitation</b> instability is caused by the cavity volume increase due to the increase of incidence angle and is treated in section 1.
