2500|$|Starting in 1941 and {{continuing}} through 1999, Oldsmobile used a two digit model designation. As originally implemented, the first digit signifies the body size {{while the second}} represents the number of <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Body</b> sizes were 6, 7, 8, and 9, and six- and eight-cylinder engines were offered. Thus, Oldsmobiles were named [...] "66" [...] through [...] "98".|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{properties}} of artillery shell such as normal force and pitching moment reach peak values {{in a narrow}} transonic Mach number range. In order to compute these quantities, numerical techniques {{have been developed to}} obtain solutions to the three-dimensional transonic small disturbance equation about slender bodies at angle of attack. The computation is based on a plane relaxation technique involving Fourier transforms to partially decouple the three-dimensional difference equations. Particular care is taken to assure accurate solutions near corners found in shell designs. Computed surface pressures are compared to experimental measurements for circular arc and cone <b>cylinder</b> <b>bodies</b> which have been selected as test cases. Computed pitching moments are compared to range measurements for a typical projectile shape...|$|R

50|$|For double-acting, double-rod {{cylinders}}, {{when the}} piston surface area is equally {{covered by a}} rod of equal size {{on both sides of}} the head, there is no force difference. Such cylinders typically have their <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> affixed to a stationary mount.|$|E
50|$|The No 20 had two variants, the Mk I and II. The Mk I had a {{solid steel}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>body,</b> {{very similar to the}} No 3, while the Mk II used a {{weldless}} steel tube and had circumferential grooves for fragmentation.|$|E
5000|$|Rodless air cylinders: These have no piston rod. They are {{actuators}} {{that use}} a mechanical or magnetic coupling to impart force, typically {{to a table}} or other body that moves {{along the length of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>body,</b> but does not extend beyond it.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report an}} altered {{geometrical}} configuration of some basal <b>body</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a normal, apparently healthy cow. Defective basal {{bodies of the}} so-called 'half-centriole' are described. Only one microtubular pattern is composed of ten triplets encircling an apparently symmetric lumen. In medical literature {{there are a few}} documented cases of basal <b>body</b> <b>cylinder</b> defects. Most of them have been described in ciliary pathology. This paper deals with the first cases of basal body abnormalities observed in a healthy domestic animal...|$|R
40|$|This project further {{develops}} {{recent work}} which proposes {{a new theory}} that predicts the forces on slender bodies, and slender and thin wings. A steady, incompressible uniform field for high Reynolds numbers (although aerodynamically low-speed) is assumed, through which a slender body with elliptic cross-section moves at a steady constant velocity. The forces on this manoeuvring slender body through fluid at high Reynolds number have been determined in this work. The theory is developed within Oseen flow and models the viscous and vortex wake. The newly developed theory {{has been applied to}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>bodies</b> with elliptic cross-section and comparison with experiments and standard Alien and Perkins method has been made. The numerical analysis using ANSYS CFX has been done. The comparison between new theory, experimental results, and numerical analysis has also been done in this work. Xll...|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> is to hold cylinder pressure. The cylinder barrel is mostly made from a seamless tube. The cylinder barrel is ground and/or honed internally with a typical surface finish of 4 to 16 microinch. The piston reciprocates in the cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|In January of 2006 Vurtego {{released}} its first pogo stick, the V1. The V1 {{was the first}} air-powered extreme pogo stick ever sold and was capable of jumping more than seven feet high. The V1 utilized a custom extruded plastic <b>cylinder</b> <b>body,</b> billet aluminum footpegs, a non-rotating stainless steel shaft, and a nylon piston.|$|E
50|$|The {{wind machine}} is {{constructed}} {{of a large}} cylinder made up of several wooden slats which measures approximately 75-80 centimeters in diameter. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> of the instrument rests upon a stand and is typically covered with silk, canvas, or other material which is in a fixed position. A crank handle, used by the player to rotate the cylinder and create the sound, {{is attached to the}} cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The key design {{features}} were an all alloy block and head with twin-camshafts, finger follower 24-valve actuation, one throttle and injector per <b>cylinder</b> (throttle <b>body</b> EFI), equal length tubular exhaust manifolds dual 3-way catalytic converters and a dry sump lubrication system allowing {{the engine to}} be mounted lower in the vehicle chassis. These features enabled the engine to provide lightweight, compact dimensions, extremely fast throttle response and high peak horsepower.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{spinning}} {{design of the}} satellite, {{the exterior of the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> of the satellite was covered with solar cells, forming a solar power generating array. As the satellite spun in orbit, some part of the array would always be lit by the sun and provide power to the satellite power bus. On Marisat the cylindrical solar panel, covered with approximately 7000 solar cells, supplies each satellite with primary power of 330 watts.|$|E
50|$|Welded body {{cylinders}} have {{a number}} of advantages over tie rod style cylinders. Welded cylinders have a narrower body and often a shorter overall length enabling them to fit better into the tight confines of machinery. Welded cylinders do not suffer from failure due to tie rod stretch at high pressures and long strokes. The welded design also lends itself to customization. Special features are easily added to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>body,</b> including special ports, custom mounts, valve manifolds, and so on.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic type}} {{consists}} of a steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>body,</b> a plunger on the top, a spring, a pair of step-cut locks, and a spreader bar. A special type of pliers are used to push in the spring-loaded plunger. This pushes down on the step-cut locks, which pushes {{them away from the}} spreader bars and allows them to come together. This allows the user to slip the locking jaws through a hole made through multiple sheets of material. When the plunger is released the spring pulls the locking jaws back towards the spreader bar, which separates the two jaws. The material sheets are then squeezed in between the step-cut area and the steel cylinder. This keeps the holes in the separate sheets aligned.|$|E
50|$|The {{pin index}} safety system uses a face seal between the {{cylinder}} valve {{and the associated}} yoke clamp. There are two holes in specific positions on the <b>cylinder</b> valve <b>body</b> below the outlet port , in positions associated with the gas mixture, which prevent connection of the cylinder to a yoke or pressure regulator with a mis-matched set of pins. The holes accept pins 4 mm diameter by 6 mm long which are correctly aligned with the holes.|$|R
40|$|The device {{consists}} {{of a number of}} light deflectors which are arranged flat and in parallel to one another and which consist of a body (1) made of transparent material. Each deflector body has a shape of a hollow cylinder which is bisected along its longitudinal axis, the cutting surfaces (S 1,S 2) of the bisecting cut plane facing the incoming light. Several bisected hollow <b>cylinder</b> <b>bodies</b> with different <b>cylinder</b> radii may be stacked concentrically one in the other, so that the light deflecting components have approximately the shape of a half full cylinder. The inner and outer (r,R) radii of the hollow cylinder and the refraction index of the transparent material in relation to the refraction index of the material surrounding the transparent material are selected; so that incoming light is deflected by multiple total reflection on the inner and outer cover surface of the bisected hollow cylinder to the other bisecting cut surface. USE - Mainly for buildings with large glass areas. ADVA NTAGE - Incoming light is totally reflected backwards within specific predetermined angle area, with total reflecting area being enlargeable and adjustable within wide limits...|$|R
30|$|The wheel {{assemblies}} are {{coupled to}} each other by the HIS system. In the body bounce motion shown in Figure  1, {{the top and bottom}} chambers are compressed and extended, respectively. Owing to the asymmetry of the hydraulic cylinders, every hydraulic circuit contains a small amount of fluid flowing into the accumulators. This leads to a small pressure change in the two hydraulic circuits. Thus, the actuators could generate an additional hydraulic force to restrict the bounce motion of the sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass. In the body pitch motion, all the front and rear suspensions are compressed and extended, respectively. The front and rear <b>cylinder</b> <b>bodies</b> move downward and upward relative to the piston rod, respectively. It reduces the volume of the front top and rear bottom chambers, and simultaneously increases the volume of the front bottom and rear top chambers. Thus, the fluid in circuit B flows into the corresponding accumulator B, and the fluid in the corresponding accumulator A flows into circuit A. Consequently, the pressures in circuits A and B are increased and decreased, respectively. It in return generates the large pitch restoring moment to prevent the vehicle body pitch motion relative to the unsprung mass.|$|R
50|$|The M34 body steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>body.</b> It {{contained}} 15 {{ounces of}} White Phosphorus {{with a small}} bursting charge to rupture the body and dispense the WP, which would ignite when it {{came in contact with}} air. When detonated the body simply split open. The M34 used an M206A2 Fuse. Overall the grenade weighed a total of 27 ounces. The M34 could be used for target marking, screening (it created a rapidly developing smoke screen), or clearing fortifications, rooms, and other enclosures. It could not be thrown as far as fragmentation grenades owing to its weight and stray burning WP gobs and particles could be blown back on friendly troops. The body was light green with a yellow band (for containing a explosive charge), and red markings. Early grenades had a light gray body, yellow band, and black markings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Little People {{went through}} six major styles of body (base) configurations, and even within each major classification {{there may be}} one or more minor style variations. By 1961, the figures were produced with wood; plastic was used for their vehicles and buildings. A few years later, the typical happy face of the traditional Little People debuted in a [...] "straight-body" [...] format. All of the people had a basic <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> with the female figures only identifiable {{by the addition of}} slanted, oval eyes and eyelashes. By 1965, the Little People consisted of a small cylindrical base and a wider cylinder shape for boys and men and a conical upper shape for the girls. Adult women had a kind of hourglass-shaped upper body. The bottom portions of the bodies were indented slightly (allowing for placement in the corresponding holes in various furniture, cars and other vehicles, in which the figures were able to [...] "sit").|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} extension latch {{attached to}} the probe <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> engaged and retained the probe center piston in the retracted position. Before vehicle separation in lunar orbit, manual cocking of the twelve ring latches was accomplished. The separating force from the internal pressure in the tunnel area was then transmitted from the ring latches to the probe and drogue.In undocking, {{the release of the}} capture latches was accomplished by electrically energizing tandem-mounted DC rotary solenoids located in the center piston. In a temperature degraded condition, a single motor release operation was done manually in the Lunar Module by depressing the locking spool through an open hole in the probe heads, while release from the CSM was done by rotating a release handle {{at the back of the}} probe to rotate the motor torque shaft manually.When the Command and Lunar Modules separated for the last time just before re-entry, the probe and forward docking ring were pyrotechnically separated, leaving all docking equipment {{attached to the}} lunar module. In the event of an abort during launch from Earth, the same system would have explosively jettisoned the docking ring and probe from the CM as it separated from the boost protective cover.|$|E
5|$|Breathing gas {{containers}} for offshore use may be coded and marked according to IMCA D043. IMCA colour coding for individual <b>cylinders</b> allows the <b>body</b> of the <b>cylinder</b> {{to be any}} colour that {{is not likely to}} cause misinterpretation of the hazard identified by the colour code of the shoulder.|$|R
40|$|Finite {{water depth}} effect for wave-body {{problems}} are studied by continuous Rankine source method and non- desingularized technique. Free surface and seabed surface profiles {{are represented by}} continuous panels rather than a discretization by isolated points. These panels are positioned exactly on the fluid boundary surfaces and therefore no desingularization technique is required. Space increment method is applied for both free surface source and seabed source arrangements to reduce computational cost and improve numerical efficiency. Fourth order Runge-Kutta iteration scheme is adopted on the free surface updating at every time step. The finite water depth effect is studied quantitatively {{for a series of}} cylinders with different B/T ratios. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model are validated by comparison with published numerical results and experimental data. Numerical results show that hydrodynamic coefficients vary for <b>cylinder</b> <b>bodies</b> with different ratios of B/T. For certain set of B/T ratios the effect of finite water depth increases quickly with the increase of motion frequency and becomes stable when frequency is relatively large. It also shows that water depths have larger hydrodynamic effects on cylinder with larger breadth to draft ratios. Both the heave added mass and damping coefficients increase across the frequency range with the water depths decrease for forced heave motion. The water depths have smaller effects on sway motion response than on heave motion response...|$|R
50|$|Welded <b>body</b> <b>cylinders</b> have no tie rods. The barrel is welded {{directly}} to the end caps. The ports are welded to the barrel. The front rod gland is usually threaded into or bolted to the cylinder barrel. That allows the piston rod assembly and the rod seals to be removed for service.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} lock pick uses trial-and-error {{methods to}} find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the lock cylinder without sending the bottom pins up into it. The snap gun strikes all of the bottom pins at once with a strong impact, and then withdraws again. The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the top pins and come to a complete stop without penetrating the lock housing. The driver pins are {{thrown out of the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> entirely up into the lock housing. Until the springs force the driver pins back into the cylinder, the lock cylinder is momentarily unobstructed. The physical effect of the impact is similar to the game of billiards, where the cue stick first strikes the cue ball, transferring kinetic energy into the cue ball. The cue ball then strikes a target ball. Since the two balls are very elastic, and since the target ball is free to move, the cue ball (representing a bottom pin) comes to a complete stop at the point of impact and the target ball (representing a driver pin) continues moving with most of the kinetic energy that was formerly in the cue ball.|$|E

Mold fi lling and solidifi cation process of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> was simulated by using of Z-CAST software. The casting method was improved based on the simulation results. In order to create effective feeding passage, the structure of casting was modifi ed by changing the location of strengthening ribs at the bottom, without causing any adverse effect on the part’s performance. Inserting copper billet at suitable location of the die is a valid way to create suitable solidifi cation sequence that is benefi cial to the feeding. Using these methods, the shrinkage defect was completely eliminated at the critical location...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} and mechanism of parallel polygonal line groove multilayer winding drum were investigated by an experimental approach. Strain-electricity method {{was used to}} test the stress of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> and the end plates of the drum. Experimental results show that the distribution of the axial bending stress on <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> is symmetric in the radial symmetry section. The largest axial bending stress appears in the symmetry plane; however the minimum stress is in the sections close to the end plates on both sides. The axial bending stress of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>body</b> is found to grow with the number of layers wrapped around the drum increasing, while the increment of the stress decreases. When the layer number of the wire rope increases from 4 to 5, the increment of the stress is less than 3 [MPa]. Intorduction With the fast development of the marine engineering, cross-river and cross-ocean bridge construction, port transportation and construction of hydropower stations, the demand of high-lifting hoisting machinery is increasing. In order {{to solve the problem of}} high-lifting, the parallel polygonal line groove multilayer winding drum is used, which can make wire rope wind around grooves formed by anterior layer wire rope loops, improve contact conditions of wire rope and prolong wire rope’...|$|E
