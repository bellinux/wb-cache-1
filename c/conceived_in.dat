5|$|Columbia Park was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1970 {{and built}} in 1983. In 1985, the park's designer, Paul Saito, {{received}} an achievement {{award for the}} design and installation of Columbia Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{project to}} build the tower was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1762 by the banker Henry Hoare II (1705-1785). The tower was also {{intended}} to commemorate {{the end of the}} Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III.|$|E
2500|$|Garfield's debut had a {{cinematic}} impact {{difficult to}} <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> retrospect. As biographer Lawrence Swindell put it: ...|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches {{have been}} used for space tests. A {{cockroach}} given the name Nadezhda was sent into space by Russian scientists as part of a Foton-M mission, during which she mated, and later became the first terrestrial animal to produce offspring that had been <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> space.|$|E
5|$|Dotty, {{whose real}} name is Kirsty, was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> a one-night stand between Nick Cotton (John Altman) and an {{alcoholic}} woman named Sandy (Caroline Pegg). While serving time in prison, Nick {{received a letter from}} Sandy telling him that she had given birth to their daughter. Upon his early release in April 2008, Nick took custody of Dotty, telling her that Sandy had died in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|Maniac Mansion was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1985 when Lucasfilm Games {{employees}} Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick {{were assigned}} to create an original game. Gilbert had been hired the previous year as a programmer for the game Koronis Rift. He befriended Winnick over their similar tastes in humor, film, and television. Company management provided little oversight {{in the creation of}} Maniac Mansion, a trend to which Gilbert credited the success of several of his games for Lucasfilm.|$|E

5|$|Order of the Amaranth The {{ritual of}} the Order of the Amaranth was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1860 to be {{loosely based on}} a society with a similar name instituted over two centuries earlier by Queen Christina of Sweden. Open to master masons and their female relatives, members were once {{compelled}} to join the Order of the Eastern Star first, but the two organisations became separate in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Macao Science Center in Macau was {{designed}} by Pei Partnership Architects in association with I. M. Pei. The project to build the science center was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 2001 and construction started in 2006. The center was completed in 2009 and opened by the Chinese President Hu Jintao.|$|E
5|$|The McLaren M2B was the McLaren team's first Formula One racing car, {{used during}} the 1966 season. It was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1965 and preceded by the M2A {{development}} car. Designed by Robin Herd, the innovative but problematic Mallite material was used in its construction. The car was powered by Ford and Serenissima engines but both lacked power and suffered from reliability issues.|$|E
30|$|The issue arises {{of what to}} do {{in women}} who do not <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> {{response}} to CC. Current evidence suggests that laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is effective in inducing ovulation in women with anovulatory PCOS who fail to <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> response to CC [3, 4]. LOD {{has been shown to be}} as effective as gonadotrophins in these women [2, 5, 6]. In most studies, the pregnancy rate after LOD has been reported to be in the region of 50 %, with a cumulative pregnancy rate of 54 – 70 % over a 12 -month period [4, 7].|$|R
5000|$|The Mishnah in Seder Moed Rosh Hashanah 1:1 {{indicates}} {{there are}} four New Year's Day festivals (Rosh Hashanot) that take place {{over the course of}} the year: [...] "The first of Elul is the Rosh HaShanah for tithing behemah (domesticated animals)." [...] A minority opinion holds that the festival occurs on the first of the month of Tishrei. This disagreement is explained in the Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashanah 8a as a difference of opinion between Rabbi Meir, who holds that the animals <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> the month of Adar, and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, who hold that the animals <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> the month of Nissan and give birth in Elul.|$|R
5000|$|On July 3, 2006, Fraser married Christopher Hines. [...] After {{years of}} {{fertility}} struggles, the couple used donor eggs and <b>in</b> vitro to <b>conceive.</b> <b>In</b> January 2013, Fraser {{gave birth to}} twins Kaden James Hines and Bryce Harrison Hines.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1998 when Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen first {{thought of the}} idea of making a film based on Ip Man's life. Donnie Yen signed onto the project, hoping to star as Ip, with Stephen Chow co-starring as Bruce Lee. Yen had signed the contract and received part of the acting fee. However, the studio producing the film closed, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1997 by Revolution. Though serious in tone, The Smoking Mirror {{incorporates}} some humour and graphics animated {{in the style}} of classic animated films. It was the fourth and last game built with the Virtual Theatre engine, which was used to render the locations of the game's events.|$|E
5|$|This indie PC game is {{the debut}} {{production}} by Source Studio, a Newfoundland-based company. The {{idea for the}} game was originally <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 2007 when Alex Brown, Rob Rees, and Albert Chaulk, the three co-founders of Source Studio, were engineering students together at Memorial University.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} thee not, Edward," [...] {{said the}} monk, [...] "nor can I <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> what way thy brother's supposed murder should have affected thee with such unnatural joy--Surely the sordid desire {{to succeed him}} in his small possessions----" ...|$|R
60|$|I was a lover, I {{kissed the}} woman I loved, and God of horror, I was kissing also myself. I was {{a father and}} a begetter of children, and oh, oh horror, I was begetting and <b>conceiving</b> <b>in</b> my own body.|$|R
40|$|Under captive conditions, some 50 % {{of female}} black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus colum-bianus) fawns <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> their first year. Wild fawns first <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> their {{second year of}} life. The growth of wild and captive fawns was similar until mid-October. Wild fawns then ceased to grow. Captive fawns that {{subsequently}} gave birth in June grew faster than captive fawns that did not reproduce. During the breeding season of November-December the range of body weights of samples of wild fawns, of captive fawns which bred and of captive fawns that did not breed, all overlapped. It is suggested that the timing of puberty is regulated by photoperiodic influences and that fawns can first conceive when they reach their individual critical body weight if nutrition is adequate...|$|R
5|$|Through the 1930s, new incarnations of Longren Aircraft {{appeared}} briefly, {{according to}} Longren's energies and financial state. The last and most substantial iteration was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1938 solely as a fuselage manufacturer, with headquarters in Torrance, California. It persevered long after its founder's departure, until April 1959, {{when it was}} acquired by Aeronca.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conceived</b> <b>in</b> {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Plot== In the {{aftermath}} of a highway mishap, photo model Simone (Pascale Bussières) goes full-tilt existential and decides that conceiving a baby with old flame Philippe (Alexis Martin) {{is the only way to}} give her vacant life some meaning. Philippe reluctantly agrees with the proviso that they <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> a desert.|$|R
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|His {{youngest}} sister Princess Amelia was <b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> {{the months}} after Alfred's death, born almost exactly a year after he died. The first of George III and Queen Charlotte's children to die, Alfred died nearly seventy five years before his older sister Mary, who was the last survivor of George III and Queen Charlotte's fifteen children. Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (<b>conceived</b> <b>in</b> contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
60|$|Now we all, I trust, hold God to be supremely good. We ascribe to Him, in perfection, {{every kind}} of {{goodness}} of which we can <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> man. We say God is just; God is truthful; God is pure; God is bountiful; God is merciful; and, in one word, God is Love.|$|R
30|$|In all {{patients}} studied, we calculated endometriosis scores in five categories: cul-de-sac, peritoneum, ovaries, tubal, and grand total. After excluding patients who <b>conceived</b> with IVF-ET (<b>in</b> whom pregnancy is not secondary to surgery), we compared these scores <b>in</b> patients who <b>conceived</b> {{and those who}} failed to <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> each group and in the total population studied. In addition, after excluding 31 patients who conceived after IVF/ET, the data were then analyzed {{with respect to the}} effect of the underlying etiology.|$|R
30|$|While {{waiting for}} {{the highest level of}} evidence, {{according}} to prospective and retrospective epidemiological studies, it seems that hysteroscopic resection of uterine septum may improve either the pregnancy outcome or the outcome of ART techniques and may shorten the time to <b>conceive</b> <b>in</b> couples with primary or secondary infertility [18 – 21, 31, 36].|$|R
