Institutional economics precisely relies on such a triptych and reveals to be an appropriate theoretical and practical reference to deal with today's major economic {{issues such as the}} 2007 - 08 systemic crisis. Therefore the article suggests an institutional analysis that points to the role of institutional-regulatory framework and the rationale of social control principles in the stabilization of the working of capitalist finance.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} atmospheric pollution concentra-tion downwind from its source, meteorological models (numerical, analytical, or graphical) are usually employed. Included {{in the model}} inputs are atmospheric stability and mixing height, which are not routinely mea-sured in the marine environment. On the basis of rela-tionships amongst gust factor, turbulence intensity, and stability parameter, methods are developed for rapid esti-mation of these two inputs. It is found that, based on the stability classification of the Offshore and Coastal Dispersion Model, when the gust factor (0, which is the ratio of peak gust to the sustained wind speed) is between 1. 15 and 1. 45, the stability is near-neutral. When G is less than 1. 15, it is stable, and for G greater than 1. 45, unsta-ble.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{represents}} {{a departure from}} the conventional methods of design and analysis of clocked storage elements that rely on minimizing a fixed energy–delay metric. Instead it establishes a systematic comparison in the energy–delay design space based on the parameters of the surrounding blocks. We define the composite energy-efficient characteristic over all storage element topologies and identify the most efficient storage element depending on its position on the <b>composite</b> <b>characteristic</b> relative to other topologies within a pipeline stage. Thus, we show that an optimal design could use a mixed variety of clocked storage elements (CSEs) depending on their placement in the pipeline and critical path. Since a well-designed system has hardware intensities balanced for a given cycle, a CSE choice will be made depending on the pipeline and path intensities. We show that a meaningful comparison can be carried out only by acknowledging that the optimal design and choice of the clocked storage elements depends heavily on the application, and by analyzing the energy and delay of the clocked storage elements in context of this application. The analysis in the energy–delay space allows us to understand some intuitive design choices in a quantitative way and to identify the optimal storage element topologies for an arbitrary system specification.

Four types of facial pigmented skin lesions (FPSLs) constitute diagnostic challenge to dermatologists; early seborrheic keratosis (SK), pigmented actinic keratosis (AK), lentigo maligna (LM), and solar lentigo (SL). A retrospective analysis of dermoscopic images of histopathologically diagnosed clinically-challenging 64 flat FPSLs was conducted to establish the dermoscopic findings corresponding to each of SK, pigmented AK, LM, and SL. Four main dermoscopic features were evaluated: sharp demarcation, pigment pattern, follicular/epidermal pattern, and vascular pattern. In SK, the most specific dermoscopic features are follicular/epidermal pattern (cerebriform pattern; 100 % of lesions, milia-like cysts; 50 %, and comedo-like openings; 37. 50 %), and sharp demarcation (54. 17 %). AK and LM showed a <b>composite</b> <b>characteristic</b> pattern named “strawberry pattern ” in 41. 18 % and 25 % of lesions respectively, characterized by a background erythema and red pseudo-network, associated with prominent follicular openings surrounded by a white halo.

40|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} that fairness {{plays a role in}} redistribution. Individuals want to compensate others for their misfortune, while they allow them to enjoy the fruits of their effort. Such fairness considerations have been introduced in political economy and optimal income tax models with a focus on income acquisition. However, actual tax-benefit systems are based on much more information. We introduce fairness in a tax-benefit scheme that is based on several characteristics. The novelty is the introduction of partial control. Each characteristic differs in terms of the degree of control, i. e., {{the extent to which it}} can be changed by exerting effort. Two testable predictions result. First, the tax rate on partially controllable characteristics should be lower compared to the tax rate on non- controllable tags. Second, the total effect of non-controllable characteristics on the post-tax outcome should be equal to zero. We estimate implicit tax rates for different characteristics in 26 European countries (using tEU-SILC data) and the US (using CPS data). We find a robust tendency in all countries to compensate more for the uncontrollable <b>composite</b> <b>characteristic</b> (based on sex, age and disability in our study) compared to the partially controllable one (based on family composition, immigration status, unemployment and education level). We also estimate the degree of fairness of tax-benefit schemes in different countries.

40|$|Additive’ {{goods and}} {{services}} are defined as those that improve with use. They are not naturally rival, or even non-rival, but are “anti-rival. ” Information is an example. Information can be made excludable {{through the use of}} patents and copyrights, however this does not necessarily lead to socially optimal production and allocation. A more flexible, open access, and decentralized process for the production and allocation of information could improve social welfare. This dissertation describes the challenges and problems with privatizing and restricting access to information and reviews alternative mechanisms for its allocation. Two particular issues at opposite ends of the access spectrum are: (1) strict barriers to private industry databases and (2) quality perception and control of open access information. The first chapter discusses our current system of producing and distributing information and potential ways to stimulate the transition to a new regime. This paper concludes that some of the ideas to seed such a transition include: (1) redefining wellbeing metrics; (2) ensuring the wellbeing of populations during the transition; (3) reducing complexity and increase resilience within institutions; (4) expanding the “commons sector”; and (4) using the internet to remove communication barriers and improve democracy. The second chapter discusses our current system of determining which information to produce, which resources to allocate towards the production of information, and how to distribute that information once produced. The paper concludes that alternative incentive methods, both inside and outside of the market, of producing information and new methods for distributing it to those that can make best use of it, would improve social welfare. These include: (1) prizes; (2) non-monetary incentives; (3) capping salaries; (4) research consortium; and (5) publicly funded research. Chapter 3 explores the difficulty in determining basic energy information under the current proprietary information system using an analysis of the energy return on investment (EROI) of wind energy. It utilizes a meta-analysis of the energy return on investment (EROI) to obtain basic information about the energy inputs and outputs necessary for the manufacturing, installing, operating, and decommissioning of wind turbines. This analysis shows an average EROI for all studies (operational and conceptual) of 25. 2 (n= 114; std. dev. = 22. 3). It concludes that making information proprietary severely limits the accuracy of EROI estimates and increases the difficulty of making the best social choices. Chapter 4 explores the perceived credibility of web-based information using an experiment with Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, and the Encyclopedia of Earth. Compared to Encyclopedia Britannica, both Encyclopedia of Earth and Wikipedia were found to provide a statistically negative perception of credibility.

Their usage can replace high cement shares in individual cases and is, however, favourable due to the production costs reduction and environment burden decrease, including the decreased emission of greenhouse gases as well as lower energy use.
