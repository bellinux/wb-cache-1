5000|$|CL was {{initially}} described in Florida {{in the early}} 1900s, where it was called “scaly bark”. [...] However, the disease appears to have disappeared from Florida since the 1960s, perhaps due to reduction of vector population caused by freezing weather and intensive sulfur application. [...] There is evidence that CL {{was caused by the}} nuclear type. [...] The first report of CL in South America was in 1920 in Paraguay, later it was reported in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. [...] CiLV-C has been detected in Bolivia, Venezuela, and Colombia, and it is spreading northward through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. CiLV-N has also been reported from the states of São Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Minas Gerais in Brazil, Boquete in Panama, and in the state of Querétaro, Mexico. Recently, a mixed infection of the same plant with the two viruses CiLV-N and CiLV-C2, was reported in Casanare, Colombia. The recent establishment of citrus leprosis in Central America represents a potential threat to <b>citriculture</b> in North America, where the vector is also present.|$|E
50|$|Huanglongbing (HLB), called citrus {{greening}} {{within the}} industry, {{is recognized as}} the deadliest citrus disease the Florida citrus industry has ever faced. This {{can be attributed to}} the economic costs of implementing new care-taking strategies, and overall tree loss creating a loss of revenues. A look at total Florida citrus growing acreage provides a tangible impression to the hardships citrus greening provides; in 2000 there was 665,529 commercially producing citrus acres, while in 2011 there were 473,086 commercially producing citrus acres in Florida. Every year citrus reports indicate a continued loss of citrus production. Citrus greening is being attributed for a total output impact of -4.51 billion, and a loss of 8,257 jobs within the state of Florida. The disease has now spread throughout the entire state, and affects every Florida citrus grower. The disease is spread through an insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid. The psyllid was previously introduced into Florida in 1998. At this time citrus greening was never found within the state, thus the psyllids spread was left unchecked. By the time citrus greening had reached Florida psyllid populations were well established throughout the state of Florida. The first positive case of greening disease was in August 2005, when a greening positive citrus tree was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It was at this time the entire Florida citrus industry changed its <b>citriculture</b> practices overnight. Intensive pesticide applications, aggressive removal of citrus greening positive trees, and the complete switch from outdoor to indoor citrus nursery operations transpired.|$|E
5000|$|CiLV {{produces}} localized {{symptoms in}} leaves, stems, and fruits. In leaves, characteristic lesions are often circular (from 5 to 12 mm in diameter), chlorotic or necrotic, colored light yellow to dark brown. In older lesions, a darker central point {{can also be}} observed. [...] In young stems, lesions are small, chlorotic and shallow; with time they become darker brown or reddish and prominent. In old stems lesions can join together and appearing larger. In fruits, dark and depressed lesions are found in large numbers and affecting only the external part. [...] Commercial losses result from undesirable appearance and fruits falling. Some differences in symptoms produced by CiLV-C and CiLV-N have been reported; in leaves and fruits, lesions caused by the nuclear type are smaller and more numerous than those caused by the cytoplasmic type. Lesions caused by CiLV-C shows additional halos, making them look larger.This disease is considered an important problem in <b>citriculture</b> in countries {{where it has been}} established, and is considered the major viral disease in citrus in Brazil. [...] Damage by leprosis in plants and in orange production has caused an annual cost of approximately US$90 million for miticides to control the disease, this represents about 40% of fertilizer and pesticide expenses and about 16% of the total costs of a grove. [...] Because of its widespread occurrence and potential for high damage, the disease can cause 100% yield losses, depending on the susceptibility of the citrus variety, isolate and control of the vector. [...] Because CL is considered a quarantine disease, international marketing is restricted to those regions where the disease is not reported.|$|E

The parameters used were the Net Present Value (NPV), the Modified Internal Rate of Return(MIRR), and the Discounted Payback. To evaluate the risk conditions we built a probabilistic model of pseudorandom numbers generated with Monte Carlo method. The results showed that the activity analyzed provides a risk of 42. 8 % to reach a NPV negative; however, the yield assessed by MIRR was 7. 7 %, higher than the yield from the reapplication of the positive cash flows. The financial investment pays itself after the fourteenth year of activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Citriculture</b> is an {{important}} segment of world food production and nutrition. Oranges account for 67 % of total worldwide citrus production. Oranges are consumed, principally {{in the form of}} juice, {{at an annual rate of}} approximately 17 kilograms per person (The Almanac of the Canning, 1979). A major problem in the citrus industry worldwide is the formation of bitterness in citrus juice and products within hours after extraction from the fruit. The problem occurs in certain varieties of oranges (including mandarins), grapefruits, and lemons. The problem is estimated to cause losses for California <b>citriculture</b> of $ 6 million to $ 8 million per year (anon., 1986 a). The primary cause of the “delayed bitterness ” in oranges is the presence of an intensely bitter group of compounds called limonoids, principally limonin and nomilin (Figure 1). The extent of bitterness imparted by limonin has been studied by Levi and coworkers (Levi et al., 1974), who obtained the values shown in Table I. Much research has been focused on preventing the formation of limoni...|$|E
40|$|<b>Citriculture</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{activities}} of the Brazilian agribusiness found throughout the entire country in different production environments. The presence of the Huanglongbing (HLB), reported in Brazil in 2004, has led to severe losses in important producing regions, challenging the sustainability of the citrus chain. Current control strategies are based on the use of healthy nursery trees, scouting and systematic eradication of symptomatic plants and chemical control of the insect vector. Research is being carried out at Embrapa and other Brazilian institutions aiming HLB resistance through genetic breeding via biotechnology. However, the inherent limitations to these actions determine that non-excluding and additional propositions could be considered in order to mitigate the effects of the HLB. Horticultural practices for immediate use in the <b>citriculture</b> are presented in order to complement the confrontation to this disease. The following propositions are discussed: selection of naturally occurring tolerant materials, evaluation of new regions for citrus production, unusual concepts of screened nursery trees, repellent and attractive plants, low- input production systems, use of resistance elicitors, protected cultivation, intercropping and ultra high density...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{descriptive}} study {{provides an overview}} of the health surveillance of rural workers aiming to describe the agricultural structure and working conditions of <b>citriculture</b> workers in the region of Lagarto/SE and reflect the relationship between <b>citriculture</b> work and the workers mental health, expressed through the alcohol abuse. Method: This is an exploratory study of empirical nature with qualitative approach developed from documental study, observation and interviews in four services that are directly or indirectly involved in the scope of the comprehensive health care of workers. Data collection occurred in the period of December 2014 to March 2015. Results: The study evidenced the lack of a database with information on citrus growers in the municipality, demonstrating a weakness in the effectiveness of actions towards workers’ health. The discussion addressed the Psychodynamics of Work by Dejours, reflecting on the work organizational aspects that affect the workers’ psyche, which can significantly contribute to the alcohol abuse. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the link between mental health and work, as the process of becoming ill is specific to each individual, taking into account their daily life. Conclusion: From this we can infer that the occupational therapist plays a differentiated role in the workers’ healthcare, as they take into consideration the historical, economic and social dimensions to understand the world of work.

30|$|For nurseries, {{there is}} an urgent need to motivate private and {{governmental}} sectors to satisfy the requirement of our national certified strawberry seedlings. A strawberry nursery certification program against PPNs, especially RKNs, should include strict sanitation practices especially both site approval and pre-movement certification of strawberry seedlings before they leave the nurseries. Similar citrus certification program {{has been successful in}} Florida, USA (Inserra et al. 2005). Therefore, all stakeholders in Egypt should tackle the problem collectively and, in particular, allocate sufficient funds for certified seedlings and provide relevant experts who can apply similar adopted procedures. Regrettably, most farmers are forced to obtain seedlings from informal sources such as local private markets since certified seedlings are costly and not easily available. Limitation in distribution of certified seedlings is further aggravated by both their small-scale production and the lack of awareness of these nematodes by many resource-poor farmers. As suggested with <b>citriculture</b> (Abd-Elgawad et al. 2016), regulation on certifiable pathogens of strawberry-propagating material may also include bacteria, fungi, and other transmissible pathogens in Egypt.|$|E
