Symmetric Enumeration reducibility (≤se) is a subrelation of Enu-meration reducibility (≤e) {{in which}} both the {{positive}} and negative informa-tion content of sets is <b>compared.</b> <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> with Turing reducibility (≤T) however, {{the positive and negative}} parts of this relation are separate. A basic classification of ≤se in terms of standard reducibilities is carried out and it is shown that the natural embedding of the Turing degrees into the Enumera-tion degrees easily translates to this context. A generalisation of the relativised Arithmetical Hierarchy is achieved by replacing the relation c. e. in by ≤e and ≤T by ≤se in the underlying framework of the latter. 1...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{involvement}} in an intervention study, the paper proposes a robust, heteroscedastic generalization {{of what is}} popularly known as Cohen's d. The approach has the additional advantage of being readily extended to situations where {{the goal is to}} compare more than two groups. The method arises quite naturally from a regression perspective in conjunction with a robust version of explanatory power. Moreover, it provides a single numeric summary of how the groups <b>compare</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> to other strategies aimed at dealing with heteroscedasticity. Kulinskaya and Staudte [16] studied a heteroscedastic measure of effect size similar to the one proposed here, but their measure of effect size depends on the sample sizes making it difficult for applied researchers to interpret the results. The approach used here is based on a generalization of Cohen's d that obviates the issue of unequal sample sizes. Simulations and illustrations demonstrate that the new measure of effect size can make a practical difference regarding the conclusions reached. ...|$|R

The microstructure and wear behavior of two high speed steel grades (M 2 and ASP 30) has been <b>compared.</b> <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> a variation in chemical composition or microstructure of HSS tool material generally did not change the dominant wear mechanism.
