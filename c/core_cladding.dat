Two different types of polariton, part-light, part-matter quasiparticles, namely exciton-polaritons and Tamm plasmon-polaritons (a type of surface plasmon-polariton) are considered. The conditions required for the strong coupling of optical whispering gallery modes and bulk excitons in submicron spheres are ascertained for the materials gallium arsenide, gallium nitride and zinc oxide. It is shown that the strong coupling regime may be accessed by optical modes with a low decay constant, typically exhibited by those modes with higher angular momentum quantum numbers. Tamm plasmon-polaritons have previously been shown to exist at the boundary between a metal and a planar Bragg reflector structure. The conditions required for the formation of Tamm plasmon-polaritons in cylindrical multilayer structures with a metal <b>core,</b> <b>cladding</b> or metal in both of these locations are determined.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} various diameters of laser fibers from various {{manufacturers}} and {{compare them with}} the advertised diameter. METHODS: Fourteen different unused laser fibers from 6 leading manufacturers with advertised diameters of 200, 270, 272, 273, 365, and 400 μm were measured by light microscopy. The outer diameter (including the fiber coating, cladding, and <b>core),</b> <b>cladding</b> diameter (including the cladding and the fiber core), and core diameter were measured. Industry representatives of the manufacturers were interviewed about the diameter of their fibers. RESULTS: For all fibers, the outer and cladding diameters differed significantly from the advertised diameter (P <. 00001). The outer diameter, which is of most practical relevance for urologists, exhibited a median increase of 87. 3 % (range, 50. 7 %- 116. 7 %). The outer, cladding, and core diameters of fibers with equivalent advertised diameters differed by up to 180, 100, and 78 μm, respectively. Some 200 -μm fibers had larger outer diameters than the 270 - to 273 -μm fibers. All packaging material and all laser fibers lacked clear and precise fiber diameter information labels. Of 12 representatives interviewed, 8, 3, and 1 considered the advertised diameter to be the outer, the cladding, and the core diameter, respectively. Representatives within the same company frequently gave different answers. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that, at present, {{there is a lack}} of uniformity between laser fiber manufacturers, and most of the information conveyed to urologists regarding laser fiber diameter may be incorrect. Because fibers larger than the advertised laser fibers are known to influence key interventional parameters, this misinformation can have surgical repercussions...|$|E

The construction of this fiber is based on our successful Semiconductor Cylinder Fibers (SCF). A schematic representation of a LiN bo, Cylinder Fiber. These fibers can be used as light modulators, sonar detectors and in other applications. The core diameter of the fiber is sufficiently small compared to the light wavelength and the indices of refraction of the core and cladding glasses are sufficiently close in value so that there is sufficient light at the <b>core</b> <b>cladding</b> boundary to interact with the LiNbO 3 layer. This fiber functions best when just a single light mode propagates through the fiber. The idea for a LiNbO 3 Cylinder Fiber came from Dr. Tracee Jamison of NASA. The optical properties of LiNbO 3 can be changed with strain or the application of an electric field. Thus these fibers can be used as acoustic sensors as for example in a sonar. They can also be used as electric field operated light modulators. However, for this application the fibers would be made with a cross section {{in the form of a}} "D".

Two metal contacts would be deposited on the flat portion of the fiber on either side of the core.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of supercomputers, routers, and switches are envisioned to have hundreds and thousands of optical interconnects among components. An optical interconnect attains a bandwidth-distance product as high as 90 GHz. km, about 200 times higher than can be attained by a copper interconnect. But defects (such as dust or scratches) as small as 1 micron on the connector endfaces can seriously degrade performance. Therefore, for every mate and de-mate, optical connectors must be inspected to ensure high performance data transmission capabilities. The tedious and time consuming task of manually inspecting each connector {{is one of the}} barriers to adoption of optics in the backplanes of large card-based machines. This thesis provides a framework and method for in-situ automatic inspection of backplane optical connectors. We develop an inspection system that fits into the envelope of a single daughter card, moves a custom microscope objective in three degrees of freedom to image the connector endfaces, and detects and classifies defects with major diameter of one micron or larger. The inspection machine mounts to the backplane {{in the same manner as}} a daughter card, and positions the microscope with better than 0. 2 micron resolution and 15 micron repeatability in three degrees of freedom. Despite tight packaging constraints, the ultra-long working distance custom microscope objective attains 1 micron Rayleigh resolution via deconvolution.

30|$|Intermodal {{dispersion}} (also called modal dispersion) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of intermodal dispersion can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a step-index profile the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on multimode fibers, intermodal dispersion can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating intermodal dispersion is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but intermodal dispersion can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where intermodal dispersion is minimized. In case of graded index fiber, critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to <b>core</b> <b>cladding</b> interface. The wave which is internally reflected near axis travel less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no intermodal dispersion.|$|E

The working principle of CCMIs involves a mechanism to realize coupling and re-coupling between modes of the fiber core and fiber cladding.

Due to the optical phase difference (OPD) between the core and cladding modes, the CCMI {{could be used to}} measure various environmental parameters related to the ambience. This dissertation is concerned with the development of a simple and low cost fiber optics sensor based on interferometry modulated In-line Mach Zenhder Interferometer (IMZI). The proposed MZI structure is used to detect changes in relative humidity and various biochemical concentrations in distilled water. First, two main sensing methods are investigated; intensity modulation and interferometric technique are evaluated for RH measurements. A mixture of HEC and PVDF is used as a coating material for the tapered fiber. Then, the performance of the various sensors is investigated and compared. Next, a new sensor which is a dumbbell-shaped inline MZI is developed using an arcing process of a fusion splicer. The sensor probe consists of two bulges separated by a tapered waist that generates a good reflected interference spectrum.
