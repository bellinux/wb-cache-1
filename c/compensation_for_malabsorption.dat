40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated or {{a consequence of}} auditory processes. Smits (2001 a) had shown that <b>compensation</b> occurs <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in a fricative caused by a following rounded vowel in Dutch. In a first experiment, the possibility that compensation is due to general auditory processing was investigated using nonspeech sounds. These did not cause context effects akin to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation, although nonspeech sounds influenced speech sound identification in an integrative fashion. In a second experiment, a possible phonological basis <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation was assessed by using audiovisual speech. Visual displays, which induced the perception of a rounded vowel, also influenced <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in the fricative. These results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated. This result is discussed {{in the light of}} other compensation-for-coarticulation findings and general theories of speech perception...|$|R

40|$|Fructose {{malabsorption}} came {{to prominence}} in the pediatric arena as so-called "apple juice diarrhea," with excess consumption of fructose being linked to gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Over {{the past two decades}} the amount of fructose in children's diets has been increasing in the United States. A test <b>for</b> fructose <b>malabsorption</b> has yet to be fully validated, due mainly to the lack of an established etiology. In animal models, however, the fructose transporter GLUT 5 is developmentally regulated, and this could be consistent with the greater susceptibility of children, especially toddlers, to fructose malabsorption. Additionally, the available evidence indicates the fructose breath hydrogen test has no apparent diagnostic utility in infants younger than 1 year; it may, therefore, be advisable to test <b>for</b> <b>malabsorption</b> by dietary exclusion in these patients. The present review aims to expound on the biological basis <b>for</b> fructose <b>malabsorption</b> in children and evaluate the current evidence for diagnostic procedures in order to identify clinical testing strategies that can be recommended and areas where further investigation is required.

The second chapter is dedicated to formation of duty to provide <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> damage, especially to particular elements of tortious liability and then to defences. The third chapter is focused on general liability in tort, entities with duty to provide <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> damage, manner and extent of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> harm to assets and non-pecuniary harm. The fourth chapter describes cases of special tortious liability.

40|$|Purpose: Lung injury from {{mechanical}} ventilation {{is one of}} the major pathogenetic factors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Permissive hypercapnia (PH) {{is one of the}} strategies for reducing lung injury. However, PH is frequently infeasible in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) due to their immature renal <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> respiratory acidosis. The purpose of this study was to identify time when metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnia begin to occur in VLBWIs. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from 82 VLBWI who were admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2011 to December 2012. The postnatal day when the difference between actual bicarbonate and expected bicarbonate levels became less than 2. 0 mmol/L consistently for the first time under hypercapnea (> 40 mmHg) was defined as the time when metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnea occurred. Results: Metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnea occurred on 9. 1 ± 3. 9 postnatal day. The younger the gestational age (GA) was and the smaller the birth weight was, the later metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnea occurred. Late metabolic compensators (≥ 9 days) were significantly younger in GA (P= 0. 001), lighter at birth (P= 0. 041), intubated longer (P= 0. 002), and less frequently afflicted with respiratory distress syndrome (P= 0. 036) compared to early metabolic compensators (< 9 days). However, logistic regression analysis revealed only young GA was associated with late metabolic compensation with marginal significance (P= 0. 068). Conclusion: Metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnea occurred 9 days after birth on average. PH strategy for reducing lung injury should be considered after renal metabolic <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> hypercapnea occurs in VLBWI...|$|R
