5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence <b>criminals</b> <b>to</b> life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence.

5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} {{means for the}} player to earn money. For example, the player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} religious leader in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for marketable items, killing wanted <b>criminals</b> <b>to</b> earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were <b>criminals</b> <b>to</b> be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E

It had been the policy of Great Britain to send convicted <b>criminals</b> <b>to</b> the Americas, so Franklin suggested that they thank the British by sending rattlesnakes to England.|$|E
