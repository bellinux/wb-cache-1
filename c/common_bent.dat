5|$|The {{majority}} of the site {{is made up of}} species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), <b>Common</b> <b>Bent</b> (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis).|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, <b>common</b> <b>bent,</b> drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was clear}} to White that as Benham progressed with this major part of his research, he was more and more possessed {{by the idea that}} he was not making his own {{personal}} research alone, but, side by side with a vast, masked, hidden and once unsuspected multitude of others; that this great idea of his was under kindred forms the great idea of thousands, that it was breaking as the dawn breaks, simultaneously to great numbers of people, and that the time was not far off when the new aristocracy, the disguised rulers of the world, would begin to realize their <b>common</b> <b>bent</b> and effort. Into these latter papers there creeps more and more frequently a new phraseology, such expressions as the [...] "Invisible King" [...] and the [...] "Spirit of Kingship," [...] so that as Benham became personally more and more solitary, his thoughts became more and more public and social.|$|E
60|$|The perilous {{experiment}} {{of bringing}} together two families for once succeeded. Mr. Smith's two eldest daughters, Jean and Janet, fervent in piety, unwearied in kind deeds, were well qualified both to appreciate and {{to attract the}} stepmother; and her son, on the other hand, seems to have found immediate favour {{in the eyes of}} Mr. Smith. It is, perhaps, easy to exaggerate the ready-made resemblances; the tired woman must have done much to fashion girls who were under ten; the man, lusty and opinionated, must have stamped a strong impression on the boy of fifteen. But the cleavage of the family was too marked, the identity of character and interest produced between the two men on the one hand, and the three women on the other, was too complete to have been the result of influence alone. Particular bonds of union must have pre-existed on each side. And {{there is no doubt that}} the man and the boy met with common ambitions, and a <b>common</b> <b>bent,</b> to the practice of that which had not so long before acquired the name of civil engineering.|$|E

5000|$|American fur trappers {{headed into}} the western {{frontier}} in 1811 and encountered the Utes. The Santa Fe Trail was opened in 1821 by William Bucknell; passage of goods through Ute territory became <b>common.</b> William <b>Bent</b> and Ceran St. Vrain complete Bent's Fort in 1834 on the Arkansas River, a trading stop along the Santa Fe trail. In 1848 the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ends the Mexican-American War and New Mexico and southern Colorado are ceded to the United States. The next year, the first United States treaty is made with Utes made at Abiquiú, New Mexico; Utes acknowledge United States authority and the United States agrees to pay the Utes $5,000 per year to keep the peace. [...] Americans recruited Southern Utes to aid them in conflicts with the Navajos, which the Ute saw as an economic need. Ironically, in 1868 both the Navajo and Ute tribes were removed to reservations.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedLinear attacks against cryptosystems can be defeated when combiner functions {{are composed of}} highly nonlinear Boolean functions. The highest nonlinearity Boolean functions, or bent functions, are not common- especially when they have many variables-bent functions are difficult to find. Understanding what properties are <b>common</b> to <b>bent</b> functions will help ease the search for them. Using the SRC- 6 reconfigurable computer, functions can be generated or tested at a rate much higher than a PC. This thesis uses the SRC- 6 to characterize data for functions with 4, 5 and 6 variables. The data compiled showed trends based on the order, homogeneity, balance, and symmetry of Boolean functions. The transeunt triangle is used to convert a Boolean function into Algebraic Normal Form, so that the properties are easily determined. The first known proof that the transeunt triangle correctly converts between the two Boolean functions' representations is included. The SRC- 6, while capable of pipelining code so that it runs up to six thousand times faster than a PC, {{is limited by the}} speed of the FPGA, 100 MHz. Functions with up to six variables were tested. Predictions on this data, as well as ways to improve the computing capability of the SRC- 6, are included. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that schemes used within {{developing countries to}} allocate textile export quota among domestic producers typically have more severe negative effects on developing country economic performance than the MFA export quotas themselves. We summarize allocation schemes in 17 countries, highlighting <b>common</b> 'lock-in' and <b>'rent</b> dissipation' effects of such schemes. We then use a global general equilibrium model to evaluate the effects of MFA removal with and without these additional effects. Results indicate that estimates of gains to developing countries from an MFA removal are larger and by significant orders of magnitude (we suggest a factor of 8) when internal quota allocation schemes are also included. Removing {{the negative effects of}} quota allocation schemes thus seems to clearly dominate traditional access benefits to developing countries from MFA removal. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} Anne Hyde has dated {{the moment}} when the Cheyenne chief White Thunder realized a <b>common</b> interest with <b>Bent.</b> In November 1833, they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne believed that the celestial event was a signal {{of the end of the}} world; it was subsequently referred to as [...] "the Night the Stars Fell". White Thunder saw it as a new beginning. He sought a truce with the Pawnee and the return of the four sacred arrows which they had captured in a battle with the Cheyenne earlier that year. To achieve this, White Thunder made a solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village to seek peace and returned with two of the arrows and an agreement.|$|R

5000|$|Hyde has dated {{the moment}} that White Thunder {{realized}} a <b>common</b> interest with <b>Bent.</b> In November 1833 they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne who were gathered with them believed that this celestial event was a signal {{of the end of}} the world and it was subsequently referred to as [...] "the Night the Stars Fell".

Partially successful, he returned from his solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village with two of the arrows and an agreement for peace. He also realized that a formal marital alliance with Bent, and in particular the children that would result from such a relationship, would represent another element of the new beginning, of peace for the Cheyenne and indeed the region.|$|R
40|$|A simple, {{affordable}} light-source {{rotation system}} provides automatic detection and defect-angle estimation of bent pins. Many electronic components rely on rows of pins {{to establish an}} electric connection with circuits. A <b>common</b> defect is <b>bent</b> pins, which compromise the electric connection {{and can lead to}} de-fective circuits and systems. Controlling the quality of pinned components can help assure the correct functioning of most appliances we use daily. Methods to detect bent pins already exist. Some rely on testing by contact, while others use vision systems in optimized illumi-nation conditions. However, because they usually need special-ized hardware or precise experimental settings, existing systems are often large or expensive. We developed one with simple ele-ments tomake detection affordable for small- andmedium-sized companies. The system also allows estimating defect angles to quantify the bends. The photometric stereo principle, the observation of a fixed object with a fixed camera during changing illumination conditions, has been used successfully to measure the sur-face of objects. 1 The method works especially well on ob-jects presenting a specular or mirror-like reflection 2 for which the reflected light and illumination directions are symmetri-cal to the surface normal vector or reflection. Because com-ponent pins are metallic, they reflect light specularly. Us-ing light-source rotation and the geometrical constraints of specular reflection, it is easy to distinguish bent pins from normal ones and to estimate their angle. We want to detect and quantify vertical bends, the most com-mon defects. A vertical bend pin has a surface plane that has been abnormally rotated around the x vector (see Figure 1). The idea is to move a light source around the component in a vertical plane while a camera in the same plane observes the reflected light of the pins during rotation. Because of the mirror-like geometry, the reflected light will reach maximum intensity, and at that point bent and normal pins will shine with Figure 1.
