5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} {{industrial expansion}} started earlier {{than that of}} the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

40|$|The broad {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{interdisciplinary}} analysis {{of the relationship between}} creativity and visualization. More specifically, the research engages with artistic, cultural, technical and scientific modes of recognizing and evaluating creativity. The thesis explores the potential for new visualization technologies to represent, communicate or interactively engage with theories <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in order to extend our understanding <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and its application across differing domains. The research has been developed from two parallel but previously under-related discourses. The first informs a discussion of general problems in the study <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> across different domains, while the second focuses more on studies <b>of</b> artistic <b>creativity</b> using computer technologies. The thesis gives an overview of various creative theories and the neuroscience approach to creativity. It demonstrates that most studies on creativity focus on the process <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and measuring <b>creativity.</b> The process <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> includes where the creative thought is produced which involves consideration of individual, social and environmental factors. The measurement <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> focuses on evaluating the individual ability <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The subject <b>of</b> much study on creativity is human and other elements related to the human ability <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> artistic <b>creativity</b> engaging with computer technologies in the form of case studies raise questions on how to understand the “machine’s creativity” and {{what is the role of}} the “machine as creator” in the study <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> This investigation <b>of</b> art practice engaging with technology indicates a contribution of the "machine as creator” to a new knowledge <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The above analysis of the various definitions, theories and concepts <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and visualization indicates that there is a gap in a creative technology-based approach to creativity. The subsequent investigation of visualization technology indicates that the technology itself plays a key role in transforming or interpreting data into visual media for scientific findings. The result of the study also indicates some future directions for research in this emerging interdisciplinary field...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} how a convergence creativity program affected to student’s creativity and relationships among motivation, {{satisfaction of the}} program, creative self-efficacy and levels <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> Participants were 27 middle school students who enrolled a convergence <b>creativity</b> program <b>of</b> Busan Cultural Foundation in August 2013. In order to identify {{the effectiveness of the}} program, students’ creativity was assessed by utilizing Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) and compared changes in creativity scores between pre-tests and post-tests. Also, the scales such as creative self-efficacy, motivation of creative performances, and satisfaction toward the program were developed for the study. As a result, firstly, the program was effective for increasing <b>creativity</b> ability <b>of</b> the students. The sub-factors <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> such as originality, fluency, and flexibility showed significant differences between preand post-tests. Second, creative self-efficacy related to the level <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> However, satisfaction <b>of</b> the program and motivation for improving creativity were not statistically related to the level <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> clos...|$|R
5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

5|$|Frank Womack's {{captaincy}} and the <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie contributed much to Birmingham winning {{their second}} Division Two title in 1920–21. Womack {{went on to}} make 515 appearances, a club record for an outfielder, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old Joe Bradford, {{who went on to}} score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs {{to make up for the}} lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} a study <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> under the glass ceiling {{was to make a}} {{contribution}} to a viable theory <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> Six case studies were constructed in which each of six women talked about an individual experience of creative work in a distinct domain. These data were not fully included in the early development of a contextual theory <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The initial proposal of a contextual theory <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> was developed by asking questions of visibly creative people. Because women were not found in sufficient numbers at the top of many domains or professions, these important questions were not asked of them. When women�s data appeared in the research they were not valued. In this way contextual theory failed to show a complete understanding <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> phenomena and was not tested on diverse populations. The six stories came from interviews with women who demonstrated a serious commitment to their work in different domains. The interviews and the analysis were structured on the contextual framework developed by Csikszentmihalyi and Gardner. The cases challenged the contextual view <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> by using the contextual framework with women and by trying to determine whether the contextual theory could accommodate these and other different experiences <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the case studies showed that the women�s experience <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> was captured and explained by the contextual framework. The new dimensions <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> discovered by this research extend the theory, enabling greater flexibility in further testing on other populations and situations. This study <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> under the glass ceiling offers support for a social theory <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> that is inclusive of varied experiences of creative enterprise. The theory, made inclusive by this process, provides a more comprehensive understanding of creative phenomena...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the main issues relating to the creativity or creative ability of management in organisations and business. A definition and circumscription <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> is developed from which the relevance <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> to management can be qualitatively assessed. The role and functions of management are then discussed. With the definition and circumscription <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> as reference, and the roles and functions of management described, the need for <b>creativity,</b> and benefit <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> to management is investigated. Specific references to creativity and management roles and functions are assessed, and the importance <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in performing these functions determined. The specific objectives of this research can be stated as follows: To determine a definition and compile a circumscription <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> that is suitable for the evaluation and assessment of the importance <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> or creative ability in management. The definition and circumscription will include all aspects <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> such as the nature <b>of</b> <b>creativity,</b> the traits <b>of</b> creative people, the characteristics of the creative process and creative products, ideas or responses. To describe the role and functions of management at all levels in the organisation. This will include a description of management philosophies and paradigms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the research is to reveal 5 - 6 -year-old children's observation of rules generally accepted in culture. We assumed that children {{with a high level}} <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> display less compliance with rules in comparison with children having a low level <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The results <b>of</b> the research have confirmed this assumption: children with high creativity have less degree of compliance with cultural rules. The empirical research reveals <b>creativity</b> through studying <b>of</b> children's drawings when the child is offered to finish the drawing of the given figures. Child's compliance with rules – cultural congruence - is found out by means of the technique based on parents’ expert evaluations. The revealed connection between creativity and cultural congruence is of practical value {{when it comes to the}} assessment of the child's behavior with a high level <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The obtained results can be used in the psychological follow-up of gifted children with a high level <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> experiencing difficulties <b>of</b> non-compliance with typical cultural rules in the standard social interaction...|$|R
40|$|Humanist thought {{has long}} {{considered}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in workers but the dominant framework for conceptualising creativity, rooted in psychological theory, has provided inadvertent limits on {{who might be}} considered creative at work. This is because creativity is commonly defined through the recognition of produced and valued novelty. This definition obscures all that is unrecognised, unrealised, unexercised, and currently in potential from being considered as creativity. Given that creativity can sometimes exist in potential, and that some workers have their creativity actively prevented from being recognised, researching and understanding the unrecognised creative person {{can be seen as}} an important goal for humanist scholars. The goal of this paper then is to unpick the contradiction between unrecognised creativity and dominant definitions <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in order to enable a deeper understanding <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> at work. The paper proceeds with an immanent critique of the dominant framework and its definition <b>of</b> <b>creativity,</b> before proposing a critical realist inspired ontology <b>of</b> <b>creativity,</b> including an augmented definition <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> The consequences <b>of</b> this research for understanding creativity in organisations are briefly reflected upon. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{study on}} {{architectural}} education in Australasia, Ostwald and Williams (2008 a; 2008 b) identified three key issues: (1) {{there is a lack}} of understanding of pedagogical dimensions <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in design; (2) there is no appropriate strategies to understand where different levels <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> occur and how they should be assessed; and (3) {{there is a lack of}} appropriate models or tools to support assessment of creative works. Closely related to these problems is a lack of an unambiguous disciplinary definition <b>of</b> <b>creativity,</b> as well as an assumed relationship between creativity and design. This paper explores this relationship and questions how <b>creativity</b> forms part <b>of</b> design and design processes.
