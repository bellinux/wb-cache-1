5|$|It {{is notable}} for a <b>carved</b> roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly <b>carved</b> by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden <b>carved</b> roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square <b>carved</b> panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with <b>carved</b> bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each <b>carved</b> with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E

5|$|Easter Island has {{the richest}} {{assortment}} of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been <b>carved,</b> including {{the stone walls}} of some houses {{and a few of}} the famous mo‘ai statues and their fallen topknots. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of chimeric bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the tangata manu ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred komari (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by <b>carved</b> divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were <b>carved</b> over simpler outline forms and in turn <b>carved</b> over with komari. Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.|$|E
40|$|Very often, art {{teachers}} {{find it difficult}} to obtain relevant <b>carving</b> tools for their students. These tools are usually costly and difficult to obtain. Therefore, to help {{art teachers}} overcome the problem of getting the relevant <b>carving</b> tools, this RESAM <b>Carving</b> Kit was designed to provide an alternative tool for teaching <b>carving</b> as part of Visual Art Education syllabus. These <b>carving</b> tools are made from the twigs of Resam tree (Dicranopteris linearis). They are hard and durable which makes it easy to carry, cost effective and can be sharpened when blunt. This tree can also be found easily by the roadsides of the highway. The emphasis of the <b>carving</b> syllabus at the secondary school is more on the techniques and processes. Therefore, this RESAM <b>Carving</b> Kit can provide a good alternative for students to learn the <b>carving</b> techniques. Students and teachers can also make the <b>carving</b> tools themselves. These 10 pieces of RESAM <b>Carving</b> Kit are labelled individually with numbers for easy identification. These numbers signify the various shapes of each <b>carving</b> tool and the <b>carving</b> effect that it can produce. The <b>carving</b> points of each RESAM <b>Carving</b> Kit are shaped very similar to the metal <b>carving</b> tools used for wood <b>carving.</b> Although this was inspired by the manuscript pen, the researcher finds that it is a good invention and innovation in education as it provides good quality tool for <b>carving.</b> It is very easy to obtain and very practical. A study was done among art teachers and students in one of the schools in Shah Alam and the results showed that the students and teachers found the RESAM <b>Carving</b> Kit to be very helpful in the process of teaching and learning of <b>carving...</b>|$|R

50|$|Root <b>carving</b> is {{different}} from engraving. It combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, {{at the same time}} they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of wood <b>carving,</b> sculpture, stone <b>carving</b> and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root <b>carving</b> mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root <b>carving</b> is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by shaping images merely through <b>carving.</b>|$|R
