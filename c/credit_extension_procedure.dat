40|$|This study {{undertakes}} {{to apply}} the statistical technique of sequential decision process to a specific range of problems of (trade) credit management. In particular, the study examines two problems: first, <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> policy on a specific request or account; and second, construction of indices measuring the effectiveness of such a policy. The end goal {{is to establish a}} control system which has heretofore resisted analytical solution. Since management exercises its discretion primarily during the credit-extension phase, and since subsequent phases of credit policy are closely related to this particular phase, attention is focused on this aspect of credit policy. However, the analysis does not ignore other important aspects of credit policy, such as bad-debt level, length of the credit period, collection activities, and level of lost sales. The above situation is then reversed: indices in terms of bad-debt level, receivable level, etc., measure the impact of <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> <b>procedures</b> on the subsequent phases of credit policy. The strength of the suggested approach lies in the logical relationship between the operating decision rules, that meaningfully take into account past experience, and the control indices. Thus it helps management in framing the optimal credit policy. The limitations of the study, such as the implied assumption of linearity of cost data and the neglect of cash discount policy or an integrated investment scheme, do not detract from the operational usefulness of the suggested approach. ...|$|R

Of particular interest is to isolate the components of disaggregated <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> that show a strong relationship with the measure of financial distress. The empirical results reveal that aggregate total domestic <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> is robustly positively correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress, {{while there is a}} mixed relationship between the components of disaggregated <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> and the composite indicator of financial distress. In particular, the study finds that total domestic <b>credit</b> <b>extension,</b> instalment sale <b>credit,</b> loans and advances to households, investments and total loans and advances are highly correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress. Therefore,the study conjures that these components could be aggregated into a single measure of <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> that could be usedfor financial stability purposes in South Africa.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} the behaviour {{of alternative}} measures of <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> for countercyclical buffer decisions in South Africa. These measures include the deviation of {{the ratio of}} private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> to gross domestic product from its long term trend, the deviation of the logarithm of private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> from its long term trend {{as well as the}} annual percentage change in private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension.</b> The cyclical properties of these measures are examined over the economic and the financial cycles. The results show that the deviation of the ratio of private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> to gross domestic product from its long term trend is countercyclical with the economic cycle. The results further show that the deviation of the logarithm of private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> from its long term trend is procyclical with both the economic and the financial cycle. The results finally show that the annual percentage change in private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> generally performs poorly in cyclical terms with both the economic and the financial cycle. Consequently, of the three alternative measures of private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> considered, the deviation of the logarithm of private sector <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> from its long term trend {{could be used as a}} common reference guide for implementing the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions in South Africa.

This paper picks up the critique of Behrendt (2016), namely that such estimations may lead to misleading results, as the change of the stock is not only driven by extended loans, but also by repayments, write-downs, revaluations and securitisation activity. This paper specifically applies a variable of new <b>credit</b> <b>extensions</b> for eight Euro area countries in a simultaneous equation panel model to evaluate potential determinants for <b>credit</b> <b>extension,</b> and compares the findings with a conventional specification using the outstanding stock.

(Economics) There {{has been}} {{increasing}} focus on banking system stability worldwide, particularly due to the recent financial crisis experienced and the resultant adverse economic effects. In {{the case of a}} developing country like South Africa (SA), the stability of the banking system is even more important as it is crucial for the achievement of the country’s development goals. <b>Credit</b> <b>extension</b> is also a core component for facilitating economic and social development in the country. The downside risk attached to <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> is that once it reaches a point of being excessive it can have a destabilising effect on the banking system and the economy. SA has experienced a rapid increase in <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> since 2001, which prompted the implementation of the National Credit Act (NCA), with the intention of regulating the credit industry and improving the practices therein. More recently, further concerns have been raised by regulatory authorities around the possibility of an asset bubble in the SA economy {{as a result of the}} level of unsecured credit extended in the country. The objective of this study therefore is to investigate the impact of the NCA on risk, both credit and systemic, in the banking system. This is important, as investigating and understanding the impact of credit controls, like the NCA, on risk in the banking system is critical to supporting the SA development agenda. The findings of this study show that the NCA has been successful in reducing credit risk in the banking system, even though this was by default and not through the stated intention of the Act. This was achieved through the introduction of the affordability requirement into the credit assessment process. This study highlights however, that there are still areas of improvement which can be made to the NCA to increase its effectiveness in preventing excessive <b>credit</b> <b>extension...</b>|$|R

40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} the behaviour of <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> over the economic cycle in South Africa to assess its usefulness {{as a common}} reference guide for implementing the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions in South Africa, paying {{special attention to the}} recent proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements has identified <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> as one of the major causes of the financial crises. It therefore came up with several proposals in the form of Basel III to strengthen the financial system to make it more resilient to future financial crises. One of the key proposals of Basel III is to implement the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions using <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> as a common reference guide to limit credit procyclicality and its associated systemic and economic risks. This study seeks to establish how the proposed reference guide for setting countercyclical buffers that is based on the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector credit to gross domestic product gap and its long term trend behaves during periods of expansions and contractions in the economic cycle. The study also seeks to establish how this common reference guide for setting countercyclical capital buffers behaves during periods of upturns and downturns in the economic cycle. The empirical results reveal a statistically significant positive relationship of the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector credit to gross domestic product and its long term trend relative to its recent past during the busts in the economic cycle, while such a relationship cannot be established during the periods of economic cycle booms. The empirical results further reveal a statistically significant positive relationship of the gap between the ratio of aggregate private sector credit to gross domestic product and its long term trend relative to its recent past during the downturns in the economic cycle, while such relationship turns negative during the economic cycle upturns. The conclusion is that the use of the proposed common reference guide to determine the level of the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions may not be appropriate in South Africa given that it would tend to increase capital requirements during the economic downturns, exacerbating the procyclicality of <b>credit</b> <b>extension</b> with dire consequences for the economy...|$|R
