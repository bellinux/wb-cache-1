Data analysis discovered approaches to HRM that influenced positively total efficiency of organizational change programs. These approaches do not <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> frequently used ones and combine â€žhardâ€œ and â€žsoftâ€œ HRM practices, focused on managing both individual employee and internal co-operation in company.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} {{contributions}} of routing dynamics to the duration of long-lived end-to-end Internet path failures. Studies have shown that end-to-end Internet failures (periods of prolonged packet loss) are widespread. These failures are typically attributed to either congestion or routing dynamics. Unfortunately, {{the extent to which}} congestion and routing dynamics contribute to long-lasting path failures, and the effect of routing dynamics on end-to-end performance, are not well understood. This paper uses a joint analysis of active measurements and routing data to characterize end-to-end failures observed over one month on a topologically diverse Internet testbed. We find that routing dynamics <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> prolonged end-to-end failures, suggesting that routing dynamics contribute significantly to the duration of these failures. We also find that most long-lived end-to-end path failures that <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> routing dynamics are caused by BGP convergence or instability. Our results provide new insights into the effects of routing instability on end-to-end Internet path performance. I...|$|R

30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} in literature to solve the drum transcription problem. Following the categorisation made in [3, 4], majority of the methods can be viewed to be either segment and classify or separate and detect approaches. The methods in the first category operate by segmenting the input audio into meaningful events, and then attempt to recognise {{the content of the}} segments. The segmentation can be done by detecting candidate sound onsets or by creating an isochronous temporal grid <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> of the onsets. After the segmentation a set of features is extracted from each segment, and a classifier is employed to recognise the contents. The classification method varies from a naive Bayes classifier with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) [5] to support vector machines (SVMs) [4, 6] and decision trees [7].|$|R
40|$|Immobilization hypercalcaemia {{has been}} {{documented}} in adolescents on prolonged bed rest, particularly after traumatic fractures or spinal cord injuries. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms which produce the syndrome are unknown. Unstressed bone relinquishes calcium stores and the resulting hypercalcaemia leads to disturbances of many organ systems. Medical emergencies may occur if hypercalcaemia is unchecked. Medical management does not alter the underlying bone resorption, which follows a self-limited course, but can prevent serious complications and permanent renal damage. Acute rehabilitation professionals should be knowledgeable regarding immobilization hypercalcaemia as vague symptom presentations make recognition difficult. Also, immobilization hypercalcaemia occurs in time frames which <b>coincide</b> <b>with</b> <b>most</b> acute rehabilitation efforts and the syndrome can impede progress in reaching rehabilitation goals. Mobilization remains the only effective means to halt hypercalcaemia, although other therapeutic interventions may lessen its deleterious effects...|$|R
