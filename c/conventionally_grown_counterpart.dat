40|$|Organic food {{is growing}} in popularity, enjoying a 15 to 20 % {{increase}} in sales, yearly, since about 1997, according to the Organic Trade Association. Organic produce makes up about 2 % of the United States' total food sales - and because it doesn't rely on synthetic pesticides or herbicides, some view it as more environmentally friendly than its <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>counterpart.</b> But it's a complicated way to farm. A truly organic method of farming, according to Sir Albert Howard, the British grandfather of organic methods, uses crop rotation, compost as fertilizers, and grows a plethora of produce. Organic produce is expensive to grow in this way, and it hits consumer pocketbooks with a wallop. Produce from large-scale organic farms is less expensive, but those large-scale farms do not challenge the way food has been grown, says University of California - Santa Cruz professor Julie Guthman. They grow in monocultures, like conventional farms, and use large amounts of organic fertilizer and pesticides. They also take advantage of migrant labor. And after this, customers can expect to pay up to 50 % more for an organic diet compared to a conventional one, according to Consumer Reports. If we eventually switch over to a more sustainable way of growing our food, we could, says MIT agricultural historian Deborah Fitzgerald, experience the gentrification of our food system. by Morgan Sherburne.

40|$|Organic wheat retails {{at higher}} market prices than the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In view of fair {{competition}} and sustainable consumer confidence, the organic nature of organic wheat {{needs to be}} assured. Amongst other controls this requires analytical tests based on discriminating traits. In this paper, phenolic acids were examined by liquid chromatography analysis as biomarkers for discriminating {{between the two groups}} by means of a controlled grown full factorial design Danish wheat sample set. By combining baseline and retention-time correction pre-treatments and principal component analysis, discrimination between organic and conventional produce was found to be expressed in the first principal component (93 %), whilst the second principal component accounted for the production year (4 %). Upon examination of the loadings plot, a single chromatographic peak was found to account for a large part in the discrimination between the two wheat production systems. This was further underpinned by statistically significant differences found in concentrations between the organic and conventional production systems of this phenolic acid (ANOVA, P</p...|$|R
40|$|It {{is evident}} that the growing {{interest}} in organically grown produce has correspondingly necessitated {{the debate on the}} nutritional supremacy between organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> produce. A study was carried out to determine and compare vitamin C, calcium and potassium in organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> cabbage, carrots, Cos lettuce and Valencia oranges. Samples were purchased from local supermarkets within Central Coast, New South Wales in Australia from late March to early April 2007. Vitamin C content was determined by 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol titrimetric method while calcium and potassium were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results from the study showed inconsistent pattern with respect to vitamin C, calcium and potassium contents in the <b>conventionally</b> and organically <b>grown</b> samples. No significant differences were observed in vitamin C content in <b>conventionally</b> and organically <b>grown</b> cabbage, carrots and Cos lettuce while significant differences were observed in Valencia oranges which showed higher vitamin C content in organic Valencia oranges as compared to conventional ones (51. 8 to 43. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). Results on calcium and potassium contents showed significant differences in all the samples with the trend of higher values for organically grown cabbage, carrots and Cos lettuce as opposed to their <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> <b>counterparts.</b> However, for Valencia oranges, results showed that the calcium and potassium contents were significantly higher in conventional Valencia oranges compared to the organic Valencia orange (54. 5 and 192. 0 mg to 51. 8 and 189. 5 mg/ 100 g, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of ethanol extracts of some organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> leafy vegetables. Methods: The ethanol extracts of kailan (Brassica alboglabra), bayam (Amaranthus spp.) and sawi (Brassica parachinensis) were tested for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC) and the antioxidant {{capacity of the}} extracts measured using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay. Results: In TPC test, sawi extract showed the highest phenolic content while bayam contained the least phenolic content for both organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> types. In TFC test, organically grown sawi extract showed the highest flavonoid content, while organically grown kailan extract showed the least flavonoid content among all types of vegetables. The flavonoid content of the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> types of vegetable extracts was the highest in kalian and the least in sawi. For 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, the activity increased with the increasing concentration of each extract. All <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetable extracts showed higher antioxidant activity compared to their organically <b>grown</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Extracts of <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> sawi showed the highest percentage inhibition followed by <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> kailan and organically grown sawi. There were no correlation between TPC, TFC, TAC and IC 25 of both organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetables. However, there was a correlation between TAC and IC 25 of <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetable extracts. The results showed relatively similar polyphenol content between organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetable extracts. However, the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> vegetables extracts generally have higher antioxidant activity compared to the organically grown extracts. Conclusions: These results suggested that {{the different types of}} agricultural practice had a significant contribution to the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity in the vegetables...|$|R
40|$|Organic fruits are {{perceived}} {{to have a higher}} nutritional content than <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> fruits, but currently literature is rather ambiguous on the accuracy of this claim. Using vitamin C concentration as a nutritional marker, we found no clear or significant difference in the nutritional content between organically <b>grown</b> and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> fruit. The fruits analyzed were: oranges, mangoes, kiwi, lemons, gala apples, and red delicious apples. Of the six types of fruits analyzed by cyclic voltammetry only one, lemon, demonstrated a significantly higher vitamin C concentration for organically <b>grown</b> versus <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> fruit.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to compare the effects on antioxidant activity and on DNA damage of organic and <b>conventionally</b> produced apples <b>grown</b> under controlled conditions in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Six healthy volunteers consumed either organically or <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> apples (Golden Delicious, 1000 g) from two neighboring commercial farms in a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over study. The average content of total identified and quantified polyphenols in the organically and conventionally produced apples was 308 and 321 Âµg/g fresh weight, respectively. No statistically {{significant differences in the}} sum of phenolic compounds or in either of the polyphenol classes were found between the agricultural methods. Consumption of neither organically nor <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> apples caused any changes in antioxidant capacity of low-density lipoproteins (lag time test), endogenous DNA strand breaks, Fpg protein-sensitive sites, or capacity to protect DNA against damage caused by hydrogen peroxide. However, a statistically significant decrease in the levels of endonuclease III sensitive sites and an increased capacity to protect DNA against damage induced by iron chloride were determined 24 h after consumption in both groups of either organic or <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> apples, indicating the similar antigenotoxic potential of both organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> apples...|$|R

The skin, seed and juice of both organically and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> blueberry extract were analyzed for antioxidant content using both the Hydrophilic and Lipophilic Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assays. Results from the Hydrophilic ORAC test showed that <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> blueberries had a higher antioxidant capacity across all samples, while the Lipophilic ORAC assay showed that the antioxidant concentration of organically cultivated blueberry juice was highest, but <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> blueberry seed and skin extract showed higher antioxidant content. The vitamin C content of both conventional and organic blueberries was analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), where the organic blueberries showed a higher vitamin C concentration.

40|$|Nocardia asteroides GUH- 2 was {{administered}} either intranasally or by intravenous inoculation into (i) <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown,</b> (ii) germfree, and (iii) lipopolysaccharide-treated germfree NIH:S mice. The number of bacteria within the lungs, brain, kidneys, adrenals, liver, spleen, and blood was quantitated at 3, 24, 72, and 168 h after infection. Further, the histological changes {{that occurred in}} each of these organs after infection were studied. The data demonstrated that germfree mice were significantly more susceptible to the acute phase of infection caused by N. asteroides than the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> animals. The brains and lungs of these mice were affected most dramatically. Pretreatment of the germfree mice with lipopolysaccharide completely reversed this enhanced susceptibility and rendered the animals more resistant to infection than the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> mice. These observations establish further the role of macrophage activation and the development of cell-mediated immunity in host resistance to nocardia. In addition, the presence of a resident microflora within the host appears to be important in the development of resistance to systemic nocardial infections...|$|R

40|$|Authentic {{samples of}} commercially {{produced}} organic and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> tomatoes, lettuces, and carrots were collected and analyzed for their Î´ 15 N composition {{in order to}} assemble datasets to establish {{if there are any}} systematic differences in nitrogen isotope composition due to the method of production. The tomato and lettuce datasets suggest that the different types of fertilizer commonly used in organic and conventional systems result in differences in the nitrogen isotope composition of these crops. A mean Î´ 15 N value of 8. 1 â° was found for the organically grown tomatoes compared with a mean value of â 0. 1 â° for those <b>grown</b> <b>conventionally.</b> The organically <b>grown</b> lettuces had a mean value of 7. 6 â° compared with a mean value of 2. 9 â° for the <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> lettuces.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine attitudes and {{perceptions}} about organic cotton of Mississippi cotton growers and producers in comparison to fashion-conscious consumers, including advantages/disadvantages of growing and production processes, quality control, consumer preferences, and competitive price structures/profit margins. A sample size of 16 local Mississippi growers and/or producers and 44 undergraduate students at a mid-major Southeastern university were chosen to participate in the study. Instruments were developed based on current research and the definition of organic cotton production defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. Results indicate 75 % of growers and producers do not perceive a quality difference between organic and <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> cotton, while 72. 7 % of the consumers report organically grown cotton is capable of producing a higher quality product compared to <b>conventionally</b> <b>grown</b> cotton. Even with an increase in organic cotton prices (25 - 40 % higher premium), only 25 % of growers and producers would be willing to convert, while a majority (52. 3 %) of consumers would not be willing to spend more than 25 % extra for an organically grown cotton product.
