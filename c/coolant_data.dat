These data were distributed to the scientific community {{in the frame of}} the VVER- 1000 Coolant Transient Benchmark Phase 2. The measured data was recorded during the non-symmetrical core heat-up test caused by the closure of the isolation valve of the steam line of the loop- 1. Since plant data for code validation is rather scarce, this <b>coolant</b> mixing <b>data</b> is very much appropriate for the qualification of the 3 D thermal hydraulic models of the TRACE code. A detailed multidimensional model for the RPV of the VVER- 1000 was elaborated using the 3 D VESSEL component of TRACE. The complete model consisted of more than 1000 3 D thermal hydraulic cells. Using this model a post test analysis of the heat-up test was performed with the TRACE version V 4160 in a Linux cluster.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} data {{uncertainties}} and with model uncertainties of a nonlinear dynamical system subjected to seismic loads. The nonparametric probabilistic model of random uncertainties recently published and extended to nonlinear dynamical system analysis {{is used in}} order to model random uncertainties induced by the model errors which concern the linear part of the finit element model. The nonlinearities are due to restoring forces whose parameters are uncertain and are modeled by the parametric approach. Jayne's maximum entropy principle with the constraints defined by the available information allows the probabilisticmodel of such random variables to be constructed. Therefore, a nonparametric-parametric formulation is developed in order to model all the sources of uncertainties in such a nonlinear dynamical system.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of researching {{hydrocarbon}} (HC) emissions in a direct-injection spark ignited (DISI) engine, five experiments were performed. These experiments clarified the role of coolant temperature, injection pressure, and injection timing in HC emissions; the final two experiments illustrated the effect of coolant temperature and injection pressure on separate sweeps of injection timing and the subsequent HC levels. The first three experiments were performed with isopentane. All five of the experiments were repeated with two fuels: UTG 91, a typical research gasoline, and a fuel with a high driveability index (DI), i. e. a less volatile fuel. The results showed less-than intuitive results for the response of HC to varying coolant temperature and varying injection pressure. For the <b>coolant</b> temperature <b>data,</b> the deviation from intuition is discussed and is probably due to vaporization problems. For the injection pressure results, the counterintuitive trend {{is expected to be}} the balance of two negative effects of high and low fuel pressure: high droplet velocities and large droplet diameters. Finally, the injection timing results were more logical. The early injections are high for this engine due to late exhaust valve closing, and the late injections have high HC because of a decreasing time to vaporize and poor mixing caused by the lack of intake air motion. by Michael S.

40|$|AbstractHyperVapotron beam {{stopping}} {{elements are}} high heat flux devices able to transfer {{large amounts of}} heat (of the order of 10 – 20 MW/m 2) efficiently and reliably making them strong candidates as plasma facing components for future nuclear fusion reactors or other applications where high heat flux transfer is required. They employ the Vapotron effect, a two phase complex heat transfer mechanism. The physics of operation of the device are not well understood and {{are believed to be}} strongly linked to the evolution of the flow fields of coolant flowing inside the grooves that form part of the design. An experimental study of the spatial and temporal behaviour of the flow field under isothermal conditions has been carried out on two replicas of HyperVapotron geometries taken from the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) and the Joint European Torus (JET) experiments. The models were tested under three isothermal operating conditions to collect <b>coolant</b> flow <b>data</b> and assess how the design and operational conditions might affect the thermal performance of the devices for single phase heat transfer. It was discovered that the in-groove speeds of MAST are lower and the flow structures less stable but less sensitive to free stream speed perturbations compared to the JET geometry. The MAST geometry was found to suffer from hydrodynamic end effects. A wake formation was discovered {{at the top of the}} groove entrance for the JET geometry, while this is absent from the MAST geometry. The wake does not affect significantly the mean operation of the device but it may affect the coolant pumping load of the device. For the JET variant, there is evidence that the typical operation with free stream flow speed of 6 m/s is advantageous...|$|R

This ability for cars to sense, infer, and act facilitates data-driven improvements in occupant experience and vehicle design. This thesis explores informed individual vehicle improvements and proposes a secure and efficient architecture supporting connected vehicle applications. Applying On-Board Diagnostic and smartphone data, I built {{a suite of}} prognostic applications. Engine <b>coolant</b> temperature <b>data</b> supports inference of oil viscosity and remaining life. A linear SVM using Fourier, Wavelet, and Mel Cepstrum audio features provides 99 % accurate engine misfire detection. PCA-transformed Fourier acceleration features and GPS data inform decision trees attaining 91 % wheel imbalance and 80 % tire pressure and tread depth classification accuracy. These applications demonstrate the ability for local vehicle and peripheral device data to proactively improve individual vehicle reliability and performance. Connectivity facilitates crowdsourced data to further improve current vehicles and future designs. Exploring vehicular connectivity, I consider data timeliness, availability and bandwidth cost {{in the context of}} an efficiency-improving idle time predictor. This predictor uses contextual information to eliminate short idle shutoffs in Automatic Engine Start/Stop systems, minimizing driver annoyance and improving compliance. These applications reveal an opportunity to address excess resource consumption and system insecurity in Connected Vehicles and other constrained devices. I introduce a secure and efficient model-based Internet of Things (IoT) architecture consisting of a "Data Proxy" utilizing a Cloud-run estimator to mirror an object with limited sensor input. The use of digital duplicates abstracts physical from digital objects, allowing the use of a mediating "Cognitive Layer" consisting of firewall and supervisory elements. These "Cognitive" elements apply the system model to monitor system evolution and simulate the impact of commands against known and learned limits. Finally, I propose incorporating this architecture into the CloudThink digital object duplication platform. Proxies maximize data collected per unit cost, while the firewall and supervisory elements will allow increased actuator access and to support generalized Cloud-based prognostics. I discuss how CloudThink's data ownership policies and privacy visualization tools combine with this architecture to address consumer privacy and security concerns, improving consumer acceptance of Connected Vehicles. by Joshua Eric Siegel.

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} work {{was performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} rod surface roughening on the thermal-hydraulic behavior of rod array type, nuclear fuel elements. Experimental data was obtained using a grid-spaced, 37 -rod hexagonal test section with both a smooth and a rough rod array. The rods were 0. 331 inch (8. 41 mm) diameter with a pitch/diameter of 1. 30. The roughened surface used trapezoidal ribs 6 -mils (0. 15 mm) high with a rib pitch/height of 12. Velocity profiles taken at the flow exit plane indicated that when comparing the rough array results with the smooth, the gap velocities were lower, the peak-to-average velocities were higher: and the peripheral subchannel velocities were higher. Axial static pressure profiles. were used to determine rod array friction factors and grid loss coefficients. The friction factor results were in agreement with predictions using tube data. The friction factor multipliers were strongly Reynolds number dependent and grid losses were apparently 10 % higher in the rough rod array. Detailed pressure profiles were taken in the axial vicinity of the grid spacers. <b>Coolant</b> mixing <b>data</b> using a salt solution tracer was obtained for smooth and rough arrays. Flow scattering at the spacers was responsible for most of the smooth array tracer dispersion. In the rough array, turbulent interchange was considerably higher. The grid-spaced, rough array, dimensionless mixing coefficient was estimated to be 0. C 20 + 0. 005. Flow scattering at the grids prevented the determination of geometry and Reynolds number effects, as well as, the smooth array mixing coefficient. By neglecting coolant mixing and radial pressure gradients, an equation was developed to determine the flow rate in the subchannels of a nuclear fuel element with roughened surfaces and gas-cooling. Relative subchannel flow rates were influenced by flow regime, fuel element geometry, fuel rod surface roughening, Reynolds number and coolant property variations. Two simple models were discussed which estimate the "equivalent friction factor" in partially roughened flow passages. Computational results obtained using the RUFHYD code showed that fuel element thermal-hydraulics are influenced by both rod array design parameters and operating conditions. Calculational results included axial subchannel flow distributions, optimum subchannel design estimates, and peripheral subchannel flow sensitivities to changes in rod-to-wall gap. "August 1975.
