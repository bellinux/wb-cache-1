40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) on soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and on earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. An artificial soil was incubated for 4 weeks with earthworms fed with vegetable residues contaminated by NPs, consisting of Ag, Co, Ni and TiO 2. After the treatments, soils were analysed for MBC and total and water soluble metal-NPs, whereas earthworms were purged for 28 days and then analysed for fatty acids (FAs) and total metal-NPs. Longitudinal sections of earthworms were investigated by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), to provide insights about the retention and localization of NPs within earthworms. The nanoparticles reduced the MBC content in the following order Ag>Co>Ni, whereas TiO 2 did not affect it. The ESEM-EDS analysis confirmed NP retention in earthworm guts and tissues. The solid/water <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> suggested that NPs interfered with living organisms due to their presence in suspension. Among the 27 FAs identified in earthworm tissues, the eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 ω 3) was the most abundant. The degree of unsaturation of FAs was reduced by supplying NP-contaminated food...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to understand the equilibrium relationship between the heavy metals concentrations in superficial water and pore water. At water-sediment interface, the equilibrium rapidly changed and it is influenced by chemico-physical parameters of aquatic ecosystems. The hydraulic safety of Bologna plain (North Italy) depends on network of artificial canals and they are related with natural rivers of Reno basin (Reno river and its tributaries). The natural and artificial water courses flowed in agricultural, urban and industrial land. The heavy metals concentration in water and sediment discriminated the human pressure on the land and their spatial distribution in sediment could predict the hazard of pollution in aquatic ecosystems. We compared the heavy metals concentrations in pore water and superficial water determined in natural rivers and artificial canals, and more pollution in artificial canals than natural rivers was found. Furthermore, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> (log Kd) between water and sediments was calculated to evaluate the bioavailability of heavy metals adsorbed on the sediments.

The Italian Legislative Decree n. 156 / 2006 implements the WFD establishing a monitoring system which foresees a detailed detection of several physical, chemical and microbiological parameters {{in order to assess}} the qualitative status of the water body. This study reports the freshwater quality in the Reno river basin (North Italy) from 2003 to 2011. The Reno superficial water was classified as “good” in the mountain stations and at the closed basin while in all the other stations of the Po plain the quality was from “mediocre” to “poor”. The decrease of water quality was due to the flowing of artificial canals that collect discharges the wastewater of sewage treatment plants, drainage and run-off from the urban, industrial and agricultural lands. In spring-summer 2011, characterized by severe drought, a study on the distribution of pollutants and nutrients in water of the Renoriver and its tributaries highlight the impact of highway (Via Emilia) that closes the mountain basin of water courses. Along this street cities and industrial and craft have developed, increasing discharges of pollutants and nutrients in rivers. An increase of metals and nutrients was found from upstream to downstream, furthermore the concentration of the microb i ological faecal indicators were two to three times higher than those determined in the water upstream of urban/industrial settlements. The thresholds of Italian Law for Hg and Pb were exceed ing in all most rivers. The sediments analysis was also performed because they can be considered a sink and/or source for pollutants. In many monitoring sites the metals concentrations was higher than the thresholds of Italia Low (data not shown), but the availability of these metals was tested with mixtures of different strength extracting (EDTA, DTPA and water).

40|$|Problem statement: Aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to determine <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> K D between soil and groundwater for five hydrophobic organic pollutants (benzene, chlorobenzene, trichloroethylene-TCE, perchloroethylene-PCE and toluene) in an Italian aquifer material characterized by a low organic carbon content (f OC = 0. 00262) by means of laboratory batch tests. Initial aqueous concentrations (quite different among the five compounds) were representative of the pollution level of considered site. Approach: Adsorption data for five afore mentioned compounds were obtained by means of laboratory tests: Multi-contaminant adsorption tests were performed putting in contact 50 g of dried soil together with 200 mL of a contaminant solution for 72 h {{in order to achieve}} the equilibrium. After 72 h, supernatant was then analyzed by means of headspace gaschromatography providing the equilibrium concentration of the contaminants of interest in liquid phase. The concentration of contaminants of interest in solid phase (adsorbent) was determined taking advantage of a mass balance performed on each contaminant. Results: Results showed that both linear isotherm (in form of Henry isotherm) and Freundlich isotherm were able to fit experimental points for benzene, chlorobenzene, TCE and PCE in a satisfactory way; as for these four contaminants, PCE is more strongly adsorbed than TCE and TCE, in its turn, is more strongly adsorbed than benzene and chlorobenzene. On the other hand, Langmuir model appeared to be the most suitable in fitting toluene experimental points. The comparison between real distribution coefficient K D obtained fitting experimental points with an Henry-type isotherm and K D obtained on grounds of a theoretical model, like Linear Free Energy Relationships (LFER-based model), showed that LFER model uniformly underestimate the sorption process over whole concentration range, with the only exception of toluene. In case of toluene, LFER-based model fitted the sorption data very well; besides, Henry-type K D is very close to that calculated from LFER correlation over the tested concentration range: Difference between two KD values is the smallest among five considered contaminants (K D toluene theoretical LFER = 0. 520 L kg - 1; K D toluene experimental = 0. 465 L kg - 1). Conclusion: The important practical implication of results came from batch tests was that the calculation of K D based on theoretical models, like LFER, may give a wrong sorption estimation in some aquifers with a relatively low f OC content...|$|E

Some tests of cluster validity operate by comparing all possible partitions from a tree with a reference partition. We propose an exhaustive search procedure to compare all partitions from one dendrogram with all partitions derived from the other to detect hierarchical levels at which the two dendrograms show maximum agreement. The method is illustrated using RAPD and microsatellite data in order to detect clones in reed populations. The utility of our approach is its ability to reveal extra information in different genetic data sets which would be hidden otherwise. The method is also useful in any field of science where hierarchical clustering is the main research tool and comparison of results is an objective.

In fact, when the expected value of the Poisson distribution is 1, then Dobinski's formula says that the nth moment equals the number <b>of</b> <b>partitions</b> <b>of</b> a set of size n.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently, {{the first}} author {{generalized}} a formula of Nekrasov and Okounkov which gives a combinatorial formula, in terms of hook lengths <b>of</b> <b>partitions,</b> for the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> certain power series. In {{the course of this}} investigation, he conjectured that A 000731 (n) = 0 if and only if A 033687 (n) = 0 (Conjecture 4. 6 in [4]). The numbers A 000731 (n) are given in terms of hook lengths <b>of</b> <b>partitions,</b> while A 033687 (n) equals the number <b>of</b> 3 -core <b>partitions</b> <b>of</b> n. Here we prove this conjecture...|$|R
