This development brought new prosperity and growth, as local farmers had a means to market and transport their produce. The pine forests were harvested for turpentine and wood, which was transformed into ship masts, lumber and other wood products. As the pines were cut and land subsequently <b>cleared,</b> <b>cotton</b> was cultivated as a staple of the local economy. The crops were devastated by the boll weevil in the early 1900s.|$|E

Tents had been erected as hangars, however a permanent presence at the airfield was not established until 7 May when 700 men arrived. A week later, the population had grown to 4,000. Construction of the facility was rapid, with the United States now at war and the mission of the new airfield was to train aviators to be sent to the Western Front in France. The ground was cleared and scores of buildings - hangars, barracks, mess halls, a street system, electrical and plumbing systems, warehouses, machine shops were all constructed during the summer.|$|E

In {{order to}} get <b>clear</b> <b>cotton</b> {{rustling}} sound signal, which will be analyzed to provide information at a certain stage of fabric processing for developing cotton products, before analysis of the data, it {{is the need for}} de-noising processing. The two de-noising methods, the median filtering method and the wavelet method are proposed in this paper. Their principles and algorithms are described. The cotton sound signals are exposed to interference and influence of some kinds of noise signal in the process of the data measured. So in practical applications, the two de-noising methods are used to process cotton rustling sound. The results of the process show the methods of processing the cotton sound signal are effective. The clear signal is getting to the next research...|$|R

50|$|Alvaston Park is a picturesque, {{riverside}} park covering 85 acres. As well as {{the sports}} facilities mentioned below, it has a lake with fishing and a model boat club, a science garden, play area and a new café. The park {{opened to the public}} in 1913 after William Curzon of Breedon Hall made some of his land available. It was landscaped by William Barron and Son of Borrowash - a firm founded by the young Scotsman who laid out the park at Elvaston Castle for Lord Harrington in 1830. A five-acre lake was added in 1923 but in 1934 it was found to be badly polluted and the town council had to urgently <b>clear</b> <b>Cotton</b> Brook to restore the water purity of the lake in time for the carnival. During the Second World War the park was used as a prisoner of war camp, part of which was for Germans and the other for Italians. The Italians worked in the fields of local farmers and the Germans worked at the ordnance depot on Sinfin Lane. A further 61.8 acres was added after the Second World War for use as playing fields.|$|R
50|$|Initially, timber was {{the basis}} for the local economy, but this was supplanted by cotton {{production}} after the nearby forests were <b>cleared.</b> One <b>cotton</b> gin operated in Idabel in 1904, but six were in business in 1930.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) and Hylon VII {{due to the}} formation of an inclusion complex is studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and circular dichroism (CD). The results confirm the close interaction among the different functional groups of vanillin and its host. In addition, a second case study was carried out with an amylose 							 1 from a different source (100 % amylose [APT III]).). As a result, remarkable differences were found in the vanillin complexation capability of this amylose, which is only shown in solution by circular dichroism spectroscopy studies through a <b>clear</b> <b>Cotton</b> effect. This finding confirms the value of using CD studies, which allow finding that, depending of the amylose source, inclusion complexes can be found only in solution, or both in solution and the coexisting precipitates, when this is shown using other techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, solubility assays and complexation of both starches with iodine and subsequent absorption spectroscopy studies gives more information regarding the possible source of the starch encapsula- tion capability. Thus, Hylon VII shows higher capacity as vanillin encapsulant than APT III, showing the formation of inclusion complexes both in solution and solid phase, whereas APT III complexes are only perceivable in solution.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Hail is a {{significant}} threat to aircraft both {{on the ground and}} in the air. Aeronautical engineers are interested in better understanding the properties of hail to improve the safety of new aircraft. However, the failure mechanism and mechanical properties of hail, as opposed to clear ice, are not well understood. A literature review identifies basic mechanical properties of ice and a failure mechanism based upon the state of stress within an ice sphere is proposed. To better understand the properties of Simulated Hail Ice (SHI), several tests were conducted using both <b>clear</b> and <b>cotton</b> fiber reinforced ice. Pictures were taken to show the internal crystal structure of SHI. SHI crush tests were conducted to identify the overall force-displacement trends at various quasi-static strain rates. High speed photography was also used to visually track the failure mechanism of spherical SHI. Compression tests were done to measure the compression strength of SHI and results were compared to literature data. Fracture toughness tests were conducted to identify the crack resistance of SHI. Results from testing clear ice samples were successfully compared to previously published literature data to instill confidence in the testing methods. The methods were subsequently used to test and characterize the cotton fiber reinforced ice...|$|R

The concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 −), abscisic acid (ABA) and the pH value of leaf and root xylem saps, biomass and WUE were measured. Results showed that PRD plants produced larger biomass and higher WUE than non-PRD plants, with significant changes in leaf xylem ABA, leaf and root xylem NO 3 − concentrations and pH values, under heterogeneous soil moisture conditions. Simultaneously, high-N treated plants displayed larger changes in leaf xylem ABA and higher root xylem NO 3 − concentrations, than in the medium- or low-N treated plants. However, the WUE of plants in the low-N treatment was {{higher than that of}} those in the high- and medium-N treatments. PRD and nitrogen levels respectively induced signaling responses of ABA/NO 3 − and pH in leaf or root xylem to affect WUE and biomass under different watering levels, although significant interactions of PRD and nitrogen levels were found when these signal molecules responded to soil drying. We conclude that these signaling chemicals are regulated by interaction of PRD and nitrogen status to regulate stomatal behavior, either directly or indirectly, and thus increase PRD plant WUE under less irrigation...|$|R

40|$|The entire Piedmont of the Southeastern United States, {{where the}} Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory (CCZO) is located, {{experienced}} {{one of the}} most severe erosive events of the last two centuries. Forested areas were <b>cleared</b> to cultivate <b>cotton,</b> tobacco, and other crops during the nineteenth and early twentieth century and these land use changes, together with intense rainfalls, initiated deep gullying. An accurate mapping of these landforms is important since, despite some gully stabilization and reforestation efforts, gullies are still major contributors of sediment to streams. Mapping gullies in the CCZO area is hindered by the presence of dense canopy, which precludes the identification through aerial photogrammetry and other traditional remote sensing methods. Moreover, the wide spatial extent of the gullies makes the identification and characterization of entire gullies through field surveys a very large and expensive proposition. This work aims to develop a methodology to automatically detect and map gullies based on a set of algorithms and morphological characteristics retrieved by very high resolution (VHR) imagery. A one-meter resolution LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used to derive different morphometric indices, which are combined by using spatial analysis methods and fuzzy logic rules, building up a tool able to automatically identify gullies. This spatial model has been calibrated using, as reference, the perimeters of two relatively large gullies that have been measured during a recent field survey. The entire procedure aims to provide estimates of gully erosion patterns, which characterize the entire CCZO area, and to develop an objective method to measure characteristic features of gullies (i. e., depth and volume) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a large-scale study designed to monitor the impact arising from the introduction of insect-resistant Bt cotton in the Makhathini Flats, Republic of South Africa. Bt cotton provides a degree of resistance to cotton bollworm complex (Lepidoptera). Data were collected on the use of insecticides (type and quantity) as well as the farm-level economics of production from over 2200 farmers in three growing seasons (1998 / 1999, 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001). and the results are discussed within the context of environmental impact brought about by insecticide. Over the three seasons of the study it was <b>clear</b> that Bt <b>cotton</b> provided benefits in terms of higher yield and gross margin relative to farmers growing conventional (non-Bt) cotton, and the benefits were particularly apparent for the smallest producers. Bt growers also used significantly less insecticide than growers of non-Bt cotton. Once quantities of insecticide applied to Bt and non-Bt cotton were converted into a Biocide Index and an Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) in order to allow for differences in terms of toxicity and persistence in the environment, it was apparent that the growing of Bt had a less negative impact on the environment. While this points to beneficial impacts on agricultural sustainability there are wider concerns regarding the vulnerability of resource-poor farmers in an area with limited (as yet) marketing options for their product and options for livelihood diversification both within and outside agriculture. Cotton producers in Makhathini are vulnerable as they rely on just One company for inputs (including, credit) and for their market. While Bt cotton provides benefits it does not in itself address some of the structural limitations that farmers face. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Integrated soil {{fertility}} management combining additions of organic and mineral fertilizers and reduced ploughing frequencies is a prospective option for sustainable cropping systems. In the cotton cultivation area of Burkina Faso the agricultural land is gradually degrading due (at least in part) {{to increases in}} mechanization {{and the use of}} mineral fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. The objective of the work underlying this thesis was to test soil management techniques to improve {{soil fertility}}, and the productivity of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and maize (Zea mays). For this purpose, a research program was initiated in 2003 at Bondoukuy in the western cotton growing zone of the country. On-farm experiments combining two tillage regimes - annual ox-ploughing (AP) and ox-ploughing/hand hoe scarifying in alternate years, referred to as reduced tillage (RT) - with or without compost addition in a cotton-maize rotation were carried out on two common soil types (a Ferric Lixisol and a Ferric Luvisol). We investigated the effects of the treatments on: (i) soil aggregate stability, (ii) soil infiltrability, and (iii) crops nutrient uptakes and yields. Reduced tillage resulted in greater macroaggregate stability than annual ploughing in both soil types. The compost addition treatments (in combination with annual ploughing or reduced tillage) increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) compared to the annual ploughing without compost addition (control). The soil nutrient status was related to organic and mineral fertilizer inputs, and soil carbon and nitrogen contents were highest (ca 0. 6 % C and 0. 05 % N) in plots where compost was applied, after the third year of the experiment. Reducing tillage had no <b>clear</b> effect on <b>cotton</b> and maize nutrient uptake, but compost applications increased N and P uptake by cotton in both soil types. On both soil types, the cotton fibre yields under the reduced tillage regime with compost additions were higher than those obtained under the control, although the differences were not always statistically significant. The trend of maize production was: higher production under the annual ploughing with compost addition than the control on the Lixisol, while it was the reduced tillage with compost addition, on the Luvisol. The results supported earlier conclusion that the effects of soil management techniques on crop production depend on the seasonal rainfall pattern. In spite of the short term of the experiment, reduced tillage with compost addition seems to be a suitable option for the smallholder farmers. As recommendation; soil fertility management regimes in the cotton maize rotation system should mix compost application or other organic matter source with mineral fertilizer, and should consider ploughing frequency...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of farm women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences offers new perspectives on American agricultural communities. Rebecca Sharpless adds {{to our knowledge}} with this book on the women who worked the cotton fields of the east Texas Blackland Prairies {{in the first four}} decades of the twentieth century. The six chapters about family relations, housekeeping, food production, field work, communities, and the decline of the rural population spare no detail of poverty, racial discrimination, or the hopeful but constant and unrewarding migration of tenant families. Written with warmth, Sharpless 2 ̆ 7 s account is not at all romantic or sentimental. The organization suggests patterns that framed the lives of farm women everywhere, but the rich detail drawn from oral histories and personal interviews creates a <b>clear</b> picture of <b>cotton</b> farm life and women 2 ̆ 7 s roles distinct from those of women in other types of agricultural economies. The appeal of Fertile Ground, Narrow Choices nearly obscures some flaws. Sharpless tries to include the perspectives of white landowners and white, African American, and Hispanic tenants, but it becomes evident quickly that the resources do not adequately address the history of African American tenant families; and Hispanic tenant families are nearly invisible. Though landownership makes a great difference for these women, the stories of landowning women are entwined with those of the tenants, resulting in the blurring of class and race distinctions that were not only more visible, but often painful to the women of the tenant classes. Sharpless 2 ̆ 7 s chapter on women 2 ̆ 7 s field labor is her best. Here she demonstrates that women 2 ̆ 7 s field work enabled tenant families to make a living, unveiling as she does so the ways women justified field work and violations of the gender concepts of their own race and class. This labor is portrayed in an apparently static economy, however. The reader with a general understanding of agricultural history will ask how a fluctuating farm economy and changing agricultural technology affected women 2 ̆ 7 s lives on cotton farms, a matter raised only briefly in the final chapter. Detailing relationships among women of varying social groups, Sharpless reveals the bonds formed between women who could seldom count on finding the same neighbors down the road from year to year as well as the racial and class barriers that prevented women from offering friendship to one another. This perhaps is the characteristic that distinguishes cotton farm culture in the Blackland Prairies from other farming groups: multiple layers of division along lines of race and class in spite of ties of gender in a common economy and community. Sharpless concludes with an assessment of migration to towns and cities. The children of tenant farmers and landowners found city life and paychecks more appealing. Their parents often moved to town at retirement as well. In spite of new opportunities to earn money, there was also a sense of loss, which Sharpless mentions but does not elaborate. She seems to favor the move to the city as relief from the hardships of cotton farming and the crop-lien system, but gives little consideration to the difficulties of urban life and work...|$|R
