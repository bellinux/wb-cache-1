5|$|Eichmann's trial {{before the}} Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961. The legal {{basis of the}} charges against Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law, under which he was indicted on 15 {{criminal}} charges, including crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership in a <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation.</b> The trial was presided over by three judges: Moshe Landau, Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak Raveh. The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner, assisted by Gabriel Bach of the Department of Justice and Tel Aviv District Attorney Yaakov Bar-Or. The defence team consisted of German lawyer Robert Servatius, legal assistant Dieter Wechtenbruch, and Eichmann himself.|$|E
5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|The story sees Bond {{pitted against}} the global <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> Spectre and their leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bond {{attempts}} to thwart Blofeld's plan {{to launch a}} global surveillance network, and discovers Spectre and Blofeld were behind {{the events of the}} previous three films. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever with Christoph Waltz playing the organisation's leader. Several recurring James Bond characters, including M, Q and Eve Moneypenny return, with the new additions of Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann, Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh, and Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra.|$|E

5|$|Thunderball {{begins with}} a meeting between Bond and his superior, M, during which the agent is told that his latest {{physical}} assessment is poor because of excessive drinking and smoking (up to sixty cigarettes a day). M sends Bond on a two-week treatment at the Shrublands health clinic to improve his health. At the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe, {{a member of the}} Red Lightning Tong <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> from Macau. When Bond learns of the Tong connection, Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with a spinal traction machine. Bond, however, is saved by nurse Patricia Fearing and later retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath, resulting in the Count's second-degree burns and a week's stay in hospital.|$|E
5|$|With a {{director}} finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script, which {{had gone through}} several revisions by numerous writers. The initial villain of the film was Ernst Stavro Blofeld; however Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball forced an injunction on Eon Productions against using the character of Blofeld, or his international <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation,</b> SPECTRE, which delayed production of the film further. The villain was later changed from Blofeld to Stromberg so that the injunction would {{not interfere with the}} production. Christopher Wood was later brought in by Lewis Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested that no elements from his original book be used, the film characters of Jaws and Sandor are based on the novel characters Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morant, respectively. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear bald head.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioner}} then tasks Sam and Max with infiltrating the Toy Mafia, a <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> {{operating from}} a casino. The commissioner's mole in the organisation has gone quiet; {{he wants the}} Freelance Police {{to find out what}} happened to the mole. Sam and Max quickly discover that the Toy Mafia are responsible for the toy bear that hypnotised Myra. As they gain the Mafia's trust, they ascertain that the mole has switched sides and is now leading the outfit. After discovering that the casino is a front for a factory producing the hypnotizing bears for mass distribution, the Freelance Police sabotage the factory and destroy the operation. Soon after, the US President starts bringing in bizarre policies; Max is particularly concerned about the introduction of gun restrictions, while Sam believes the President has been hypnotized. At the White House, Max decapitates the President, revealing him to be a mechanical puppet designed to hypnotize the nation through TV broadcasts. The President's bodyguard, none other than the now-fallen Toy Mafia's pit boss, activates a giant robot disguised as the statue at the Lincoln Memorial to run in an emergency election against Max. Sam discredits Lincoln's campaign, resulting in Max winning the presidential election. Lincoln begins a destructive rampage through Washington D.C., but is neutralized when Max fires an intercontinental ballistic missile at him.|$|E

5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It {{is only in the}} successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed as the head of an international <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation.</b> His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

25|$|The bombings {{also caused}} a major rift within the D-Company, the most {{powerful}} <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> in the Mumbai underworld, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation, taking most of the leadership-level Hindu aides such as Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan with him. Rajan's split divided the Mumbai underworld along communal lines and pitted Chotta Rajan's predominantly Hindu gang against Dawood Ibrahim's predominantly Muslim D-Company. The ensuing gang war took the lives {{of more than a}} hundred gangsters and is still going on in 2017. Seven of the accused (Salim Kurla, Majeed Khan, Shakil Ahmed, Mohammed Jindran, Hanif Kadawala, Akbar Abu Sama Khan and Mohammed Latif) were assassinated by Chotta Rajan's hitmen.|$|E
25|$|Having had {{a lengthy}} {{association}} with the <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation</b> known as The Firm, Den's involvement escalates over the summer of 1988. He hands over the tenancy of the Vic to Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and takes over Strokes wine bar, which he runs with Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem). The wine bar is merely a front to the Firm's illegal gambling den. When Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) is raped by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), Den manipulates a Firm member, Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), to burn down The Dagmar (Wilmott-Brown's wine bar) in revenge, but this is against the Firm's wishes so when the police investigation starts suspecting the Firm's involvement and what the Strokes wine bar is really used for, The Firm's bosses force Den to take {{the blame for the}} arson in order to distance their organisation from the attack. They take Den to a safe house in Manchester, promising to alter his identity, but Den realises this is a cover and that the Firm are planning to kill him. Den escapes and hands himself in to the police to save his life and is remanded in custody in September 1988 at Dickens Hill prison.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{questioned}} how Baader and Raspe managed to obtain {{a gun in the}} high-security prison wing specially constructed for the first generation RAF members. Independent investigations showed that the inmates' lawyers were able to smuggle in weapons and equipment despite the high security, something that the lawyers themselves denied, arguing that every meeting with their clients was observed by jailers. The claims were based primarily on the testimonies of Hans-Joachim Dellwo, brother of RAF prisoner Karl-Heinz Dellwo, and Volker Speitel, the husband of RAF member Angelika Speitel, who were arrested on 2 October 1977 and charged with belonging to a <b>criminal</b> <b>organisation.</b> The fact that they both received lighter sentences, and after release were given new identities, raises the question as to whether they were acting under police pressure and immunity proposal (as {{was the case with the}} ex-RAF members and perjurers Karl-Heinz Ruhland and Gerhard Müller). However based on these testimonies, the defense attorneys Armin Newerla and Arndt Müller were tried in 1979 and one year later they were convicted of weapon smuggling receiving three and a half years and four years and eight months sentences respectively.|$|E
