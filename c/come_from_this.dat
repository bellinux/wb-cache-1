5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least {{developed}} countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and {{more than one-third of}} GDP and 90% of export revenues <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this.</b> In the past, the economy has been dependent on substantial economic aid from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other countries. Malawi was ranked the 119th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{contribution}} that thrips make to their ecosystem is the damage {{they can cause}} during feeding. This impact may fall across a broad selection of prey items, as there is considerable breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a described host remain. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, {{and the majority of}} pest thrips <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> family. For example, Thrips tabaci damages crops of onions, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that {{more than one-third of the}} most reliable spottings <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E

25|$|Behavior {{therapy is}} a rich tradition. It is well {{researched}} with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict {{the way we think}} and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tradition.|$|E

25|$|King {{finally got}} out of Germany in 1939, {{with the help of}} German friends. One helped her get a visa for England.

With his Bernoldus Niemand character, James managed to cross the language division and influence {{a whole range of}} Afrikaans speaking musicians to the same punk ethic that had inspired him, and an important Afrikaans alternative rock scene grew from this influence.|$|E

25|$|Previously, in 1462, the King {{sent word}} to his equerry {{that he should}} hire 8,000 cavalry to start a holy war against the Ottoman Empire only if the Venetians – {{according}} to their promise – covered the expenses (unfortunately for the Hungarians, this financial aid was postponed from time to time). The first major and mass conscription of mercenaries appeared during the Bohemian Wars (1468–78), whereas {{the core of his}} royal infantry, a force of 6,000–8,000 armed men, were incorporated into the Black Army (the origins of the moniker could also <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> era).|$|E
25|$|In 1874, {{during the}} Black Hills Expedition led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, the {{discovery}} of gold in the region sparked the Black Hills Gold Rush. As prospectors located valuable sources of gold along Deadwood and Whitewood Creeks, thousands more prospectors entered the area looking to stake their claim. In April, 1876, a gold outcropping was discovered near Lead, South Dakota. This gold claim became the Homestake Mine and was {{the primary source of}} the placer gold being mined from the surrounding area. Over the next century, ten percent of the world's gold supply would <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> site.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the notable}} things about Star Fleet Battles {{is that it}} has always {{endeavored}} to keep a consistent background that all the ships and empires <b>come</b> <b>from.</b> <b>This</b> started out as the distillation of current Star Trek lore, but soon started adding its own touches as gaps were perceived in structure. With the rebirth of Star Trek as an active film franchise, the 'SFU' started diverging sharply from canon Star Trek, as the producers ignored anything from fan productions, and SFBs own licence did not allow them to use the new material. Due to several factors, the SFU has re-interpreted several things, and in some places only bears a passing resemblance to the show that gave it birth.|$|E

25|$|The dots {{were used}} to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the Tula artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name, Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd, however a time of disillusionment {{followed}} as artists were criticised by their peers for having revealed too much of their sacred heritage. Secret designs restricted to a ritual context were now in the market place, made visible to Australian Aboriginal painting. Much of the Aboriginal art on display in tourist shops traces back to this style developed at Papunya. The most famous of the artists to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> movement was Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri.

25|$|The {{most prestigious}} {{track and field}} {{contests}} occur within athletics championships and athletics programmes at multi-sport events.

Track and field events have become the most prominent part of major athletics championships and many famous athletes within the sport of athletics <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> discipline. Discrete track and field competitions are found at national championships-level and also at annual, invitational track and field meets. Meetings range from elite competitions – {{such as those in}} the IAAF Diamond League series – to basic all comers track meets, inter-sports club meetings and schools events, which form the grassroots of track and field.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the city of Bern proper begins with its {{founding}} by Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen in 1191. Local legend has it that the duke vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, {{which turned out to be}} a bear. Both the name of the city (Bern can stand for Bär(e) n, bears) and its heraldic beast, <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> legend. At that time, much of today's Switzerland (then considered part of southern Burgundy) was under the authority of the house of Zähringen. The Zähringer leaders, although with no actual duchy of their own, were styled dukes by decree of the German king and exercised imperial power south of the Rhine. To establish their position there, they founded or expanded numerous settlements, including Fribourg (in 1157), Bern, Burgdorf and Morat.|$|E
