50|$|Shape risk {{in finance}} {{is a type}} of basis risk when hedging a load profile with {{standard}} hedging products having a lower granularity. In other words a commodity supplier wants to pre-purchase supplies for expected demand, but can only buy in fixed amounts that are bigger than the demand forecasted. This means it has to either over order or under order and make up the difference at the time of delivery at the spot price which might be much higher.

40|$|The article {{examines}} whether <b>commodity</b> <b>risk</b> is priced in the cross-section of global equity returns. We employ a long-only equally-weighted portfolio of commodity futures and a term structure portfolio that captures phases of backwardation and contango as mimicking portfolios for <b>commodity</b> <b>risk.</b> We find that equity-sorted portfolios with greater sensitivities to the excess returns of the backwardation and contango portfolio command higher average excess returns, suggesting that when measured appropriately, <b>commodity</b> <b>risk</b> is pervasive in stocks. Our conclusions are robust to the {{addition to the}} pricing model of financial, macroeconomic and business cycle-based risk factors...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} the problematic of derivatives {{which can be}} applicable for <b>commodity</b> <b>risk</b> hedging. The futures contracts and options are utilized for hedging <b>commodity</b> <b>risk</b> on oil market. For purposes of this work is designed a trading strategy, which consists of exponential moving average and expiration cycle of the options. The strategy is tested on historical oil prices. Because the strategy shows promising outputs it was employed on setting options strategy as well. The hedging options strategy collar is tested on historical prices of oil. Testing on historical prices discovered that it is profitable for processor to hedge the oil price by futures contracts. For producer it is more profitable to hedge the price by employing standard collar strategy. On the other side the bear collar strategy generated quite unconvincing outputs for processor. When the out-the-money bear collar war modified into in-the-money bear collar the outputs were satisfactorily profitable...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} have recently responded to high and volatile commodity prices by setting up commodity funds. In several cases, these funds have proved effective in stabilising government spending and boosting savings, {{but on the whole}} they have unfortunately not achieved the hoped-for results. In many cases, resources initially allocated to sovereign funds were later commandeered by the government and ultimately squandered. In this paper we review past experiences with commodity funds and discuss incentives {{that can be used to}} ensure that <b>commodity</b> <b>risk</b> is managed with greater efficiency and that funds are more autonomous, a vital prerequisite to meeting their original aims. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{investigating}} {{the origins of}} the recent increase in <b>commodity</b> price <b>risk</b> exposure to farmers, there are some explanations including the role of macroeconomic forces (Karali and Power 2013) and monetary policy action and communication (Hayo et al. 2012). In microeconomic theory, the weakness of short-term production and consumption elasticities in responding to economic shocks are cited as contributory factors (Gilbert 2006; Gilbert and Morgan 2010). Food producers are particularly vulnerable to <b>commodity</b> price <b>risk</b> as they must commit resources for the duration of a production cycle whereas consumers may have the opportunity to switch their consumption patterns in the short run (Sandmo 1971; Bellemare 2015). In developed countries, the exposure of consumers to <b>commodity</b> price <b>risk</b> is therefore usually considered less problematic than the exposure of farmer producers. Barrett and Bellemare (2011) have concluded that from a consumer perspective, “the world does not necessarily face a price volatility problem. It faces a high food price problem”.|$|R
