50|$|In the United States, {{most states}} have {{two levels of}} trial courts, and two levels of appellate courts. The {{jurisdiction}} of the lower trial court in such jurisdictions is typically restricted to hearing minor claims and trying minor offenses, while the higher court may hear claims without an upper limit on the amount in controversy, and may try all crimes. The higher trial court may also have some power of appellate review over the lower. In Virginia, for example, {{the lowest level of}} court is the Virginia General District Court, which can hear claims of up to US$25,000, and can try misdemeanors.

50|$|To {{address these}} issues, Congress {{introduced}} the Price-Anderson Act in 1957. The Act required companies {{to obtain the}} maximum possible insurance cover against accidents, determined to be $60 million, and provided a further government commitment of $500 million to cover any <b>claims</b> <b>in</b> <b>excess</b> of the private insurance. Companies were relieved of any liability beyond the insured amount for any incident involving radiation or radioactive releases regardless of fault or cause. The act {{was intended to be}} temporary, and to expire in August 1967 as it was assumed that once the companies had demonstrated a record of safe operation {{they would be able to}} obtain insurance in the private market. At the same time, Congress encouraged the insurance industry to develop a way that power plant operators could meet their financial protection responsibilities. The insurance industry responded by creating an insurance pool called American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which today includes 60 U.S. property and casualty insurance companies who represent some of the largest insurance companies in the country.|$|E

There are procedures in the statute for remedying certifications that do not exactly mimic the required certification language. For claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer is required to issue a decision within 60 days of receipt of the claim provided the contractor requests a decision within that time period. For <b>claims</b> <b>in</b> <b>excess</b> of $100,000, the Contracting Officer is required, within 60 days, either to issue a decision or notify the contractor when a decision will be issued. All decisions should be issued within a reasonable time, taking into account the nature of the claim, and, if they are not, the contractor may either request a tribunal to direct the Contracting Officer to issue a decision within a specified time or treat the failure to issue a decision as an appealable [...] "deemed" [...] denial of the claim.|$|E

40|$|The {{liability}} to employees in a defined benefit pension {{plan is the}} present value of vested benefits, {{the present value of}} the benefits that employees would receive on the immediate termination of the pension plan. This is the literal and simple definition of the liability. Although it leads {{to an understanding of the}} economics of the promise of a pension, several common provisions of pension plans make it necessary to expand the definition. Anomalies such as vesting, early retirement benefits, lump sum provisions, and ad hoc increases in benefits for retired employees indicate that employees accrue benefits that exceed their benefits on a termination of the plan. These anomalies, however, can be explained by requiring that employees as a group possess specific human capital. Although losing one or a few employees from the group would be a small loss, losing the group of employees would be a great loss. In this group model, employees bargain with the stockholders over the compensation of the entire group; they allocate. their compensation according to marginal product, returns from previous equity investments in the human capital of the group, and to purchases and sales of claims on this capital. The model explains the anomalies as a natural outgrowth of the transactions of members within the group. In addition, the model explains the use of defined benefit pension plans, and how employees could have <b>claims,</b> <b>in</b> <b>excess</b> of vested benefits, on the assets in the pension plan. ...|$|E

These early PLAs focused on establishing standard rates of pay and preventing work stoppages. PLA projects that followed included Cape Canaveral in the 1960s, Disney World from 1967-71 and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from 1973-77. During this period and subsequently, the unionized share of the construction industry precipitously declined as construction users sought more open competition.
