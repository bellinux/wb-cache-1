After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids <b>cyfluthrin</b> and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance.

METHODS: A group of 1003 workers exposed to methylparathion or ethylparathion (alkyl phosphates), propoxur (carbamate), or <b>cyfluthrin</b> (pyrethroid) was investigated. After exposure to methylparathion or ethylparathion the methylparathion or ethylparathion and methylparaoxon or ethylparaoxon concentrations in plasma, the p-nitrophenol concentration in urine, and the activities of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase were measured. For exposure to propoxur the propoxur concentration in plasma, the 2 -isopropoxyphenol concentration in urine, and the cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase activities were measured.

40|$|Given the {{widespread}} use of insecticides in the environment, it is important to perform studies evaluating their potential effects on humans. Organophosphate insecticides, such as chlorpyrifos, are being phased out; however, the use of pyrethroids in household pest control is increasing. While chlorpyrifos is relatively well studied, much less is known about the potential neurotoxicity of <b>cyfluthrin</b> and other pyrethroids. To gain insights into the neuro-toxicity of <b>cyfluthrin,</b> we compared and evaluated the toxicity profiles of chlorpyrifos and <b>cyfluthrin</b> in primary human fetal astrocytes. We found that at the same concentrations, <b>cyfluthrin</b> exerts as great as, or greater toxic effects on the growth, survival, and proper functioning of human astrocytes. By using microarray gene expression profiling, we systematically identified and com-pared the potential molecular targets of chlorpyrifos and cyflu-thrin, at a genome-wide scale. We found that chlorpyrifos and <b>cyfluthrin</b> affect a similar number of transcripts. These targets include molecular chaperones, signal transducers, transcriptional regulators, transporters, and those involved in behavior and development. Further computational and biochemical analyses show that <b>cyfluthrin</b> and chlorpyrifos upregulate certain targets of the interferon-g and insulin-signaling pathways and that they increase the protein levels of activated extracellular signal– regulated kinase 1 / 2, a key component of insulin signaling; inter-leukin 6, a key inflammatory mediator; and glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of inflammatory astrocyte activation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{spinosad}} exposure on the susceptibility of pyrethroid- and organophosphate-resistant populations of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to insecticides {{was investigated in}} broiler house farm and laboratory studies. A field pyrethroid- and organophosphate-resistant population showed a 3. 6 -fold increase in susceptibility to γ-cyhalothrin following spinosad treatment. Overall, cyfluthrin- and fenitrothion-resistant field populations were more susceptible to these insecticides following spinosad treatments, but populations that were not resistant showed no change in susceptibility following spinosad treatment. In a related study, three broiler farm beetle populations with very similar levels of <b>cyfluthrin</b> and γ-cyhalothrin resistance and similar susceptibilities to spinosad were used to investigate temporal effects of spinosad field treatments on the susceptibility to pyrethroids. Farm insecticide regimes applied {{at the start of}} each flock differed: the control broiler house received no insecticide applications, another house was systematically treated with <b>cyfluthrin</b> at the start of each study flock, and the third house was systematically treated with spinosad at the start of five flocks. Afterwards, treatments reverted to <b>cyfluthrin</b> on all farms. At the end of flocks, beetles were tested with <b>cyfluthrin,</b> γ-cyhalothrin, and spinosad. The control and <b>cyfluthrin</b> house beetles did not change susceptibility to pyrethroids over the period of the study. In the spinosad house, spinosad had no effect on spinosad susceptibility but dramatically increased <b>cyfluthrin</b> and γ-cyhalothrin susceptibilities. These new susceptibilities were maintained while spinosad applications continued, but pyrethroid susceptibility declined once spinosad applications ceased. This study provides evidence of a synergistic interaction between spinosad and pyrethroids in pyrethroid-resistant beetles.

30|$|Beta-cyfluthrin (and the racemic mixture, <b>cyfluthrin)</b> is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid insecticide. <b>Cyfluthrin</b> {{is a mixture}} of four isomers (two cis and two trans) while beta-cyfluthrin only contains the two active isomers (one cis and one trans) [13]. Since the two isomers that are left out are not active, we assume that the ecotoxicological effect of beta-cyfluthrin and <b>cyfluthrin</b> is the same. This group of chemicals has a neurological mode of action in insects (e.g. [14]). The effects of <b>cyfluthrin</b> on rainbow trout were evaluated in 1985 in an early life stage (ELS) study using constant exposure, conducted for regulatory purposes (Bayer AG, unpublished; hereafter referred to as ‘Experiment 1 ’). In this study, substantial mortality was observed in mean measured (mm) concentrations of 31.8 ng/L and higher, and significant effects on growth were observed in concentrations of 17.7 ng/L (mm) and higher. In later publications it has been concluded that pyrethroids in general tend to be neurotoxic to fish [15] and that they have been found to induce locomotory abnormalities in rainbow trout [16]. Using the adverse-outcome pathway (AOP) concept, Groh et al. [17] highlighted that locomotion impairment by pyrethroids results in reduction in food intake and consequential reduced growth.

Differences in formulation effects of <b>cyfluthrin</b> were noted for cowpea aphids, spotted alfalfa aphids and alfalfa caterpillars at one day post treatment. At four days post treatment formulation {{significant differences were}} evident for numbers of bigeyed bugs, while at seven days after application formulations differed in numbers of spotted alfalfa aphids. Usage of dimethoate with a lower rate of cyfluthin resulted in less control of threecornered alfalfa hoppers throughout the study, improved initial control of spotted alfalfa aphids and clover leafhoppers, an increase in leafminer flies at four days post treatment and reductions in numbers of bigeyed bugs and spiders on this sample date, as well as significant reductions of lygus bugs later in the study compared with <b>cyfluthrin</b> only treatments...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malaria {{is still}} one of the health {{problems}} in Iran. Resistance of Anopheles stephensi -the principal vector of the disease in the southeast of Iran- to insecticides such as DDT, malathion and dieldrin has been reported in south of the country. The present study was designed to estimate the persistence and residue of deltamethrin and <b>cyfluthrin</b> on different surfaces. Methods: After testing the surface of selected locations for previous insecticides, 4 locations were sprayed with deltamethrin (25 mg/m 2) and <b>cyfluthrin</b> (20 mg/m 2). A total of 22 conical tubes were installed and fixed on surfaces of walls and ceilings made from plaster, mud and wood. In each conical tube, 10 An. stephensi were released and after half an hour exposure these mosquitoes were transmitted to sterile cups. After 24 hours, the obtained results were recorded according to the survival and mortality rate of mosquitoes. These tests were carried out from 5 days after spraying and repeated every 15 days until the mortality rate decreased to 60 - 65 %. Results: Persistence and residue rate of deltamethrin 5 % with the scale of 25 mg/m 2 of effective substance was 3 months at most. Afterwards persistence and residue effect of this insecticide decreased on absorbent and nonabsorbent surfaces. Persistence and residue rate of deltamethrin 10 % with the scale of 20 mg/m 2 on absorbent and nonabsorbent surfaces in Sistan & Baluchistan province climate was estimated 2. 5 months. Afterwards, its persistence and residue effect decreased significantly. In the sprayed locations with deltamethrin, there was no correlation between the An. stephensi mortality and absorbent (plaster and muddy) and nonabsorbent (wooden) surfaces (P> 0. 05). Also, in locations sprayed with <b>cyfluthrin</b> there was no significant correlation between the two types of surfaces, however, the mortality rate was significantly different between plaster and muddy surfaces (P= 0. 007). Moreover, from the point of residual efficacy, there was a remarkable correlation between deltamethrin and <b>cyfluthrin</b> (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: Both deltamethrin and <b>cyfluthrin</b> have adequate residual effect on absorbent and nonabsorbent surfaces, though deltamethrin shows a higher efficiency in comparison to <b>cyfluthrin</b> in control program for malaria vector...|$|E
40|$|Pheromone-based {{population}} suppression {{methods for}} stored-product insects can {{reduce or eliminate}} application of chemical insecticides near finished food products. The responses of adult male Indianmeal moth males (IMM), Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), to the attract-and-kill formulations of a gel, a flat wax panel, and a plastic cylinder device, mixed or sprayed with the pyrethroid insecticides permethrin, <b>cyfluthrin,</b> or organically compliant natural pyrethrin, combined with the synthetic female sex pheromone (Z,E) - 9, 12 tetradecadienyl acetate, were evaluated in a laboratory wind tunnel. The wax panel and cylinder, which utilized controlled-release pheromone lures, were more attractive to IMM males {{over the course of}} an eight-week aging period than was the gel, which had the pheromone incorporated into the gel matrix. The contact time for responding males was longer on the wax panel and plastic cylinder than on the gel formulation. The percentage of mortality of males was higher with wax panels formulated with <b>cyfluthrin</b> at 6. 0 % AI, permethrin at 6. 0 % AI and the cylinder formulated with <b>cyfluthrin</b> at 2. 0 % AI, compared to the gel over the eight-week study. These same formulations had the greatest impact on egg-laying by females paired with treated males and on the percent of eggs that hatched. Of all the attract-and-kill formulations tested, the most promising for field applications to suppress IMM pest populations was the wax panel containing 6. 0 % AI of either <b>cyfluthrin</b> or permethrin...|$|E
40|$|In {{laboratory}} trials, concrete {{was treated}} with <b>cyfluthrin</b> wettable powder (WP) at 40 mg active ingredient [AI] <b>cyfluthrin</b> WP/m 2, then heated for 4, 8, or 16 h at either 451 C or 551 C, or treated but not heated (seven treatment combinations). Bioassays were conducted by exposing adult Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) for 0. 5, 1, and 2 h. Survival of T. castaneum was generally greater on unheated concrete compared with the heating treatments, and survival appeared to decrease as heating time increased at both 451 C and 551 C. In a second laboratory trial, concrete {{was treated with}} hydroprene (Gentrol) at the label rate of 1. 9 103 mg [AI]/cm 2, and bioassayed by exposing late-instar T. castaneum larvae on the treated surface. There were significant differences between untreated controls and the heat treatment regimes (Po 0 : 05) {{with respect to the}} percentage of live emerged adults, the percentage of those adults with deformities, and the percentage of dead adults, but heating did not reduce efficacy of hydroprene. In a field trial, concrete was treated with <b>cyfluthrin</b> at 2 mg [AI] <b>cyfluthrin</b> WP/m 2, and placed in a flour mill undergoing an experimental heat treatment and in an unheated office. Treated concrete was bioassayed by continually exposing adult T. castaneum for 0. 5 – 120 h. The effect of heating time on insect mortality was not significant (PX 0 : 05).

40|$|House {{dust and}} {{airborne}} particles (PM) were sampled before (T 1) and 1 day (T 2), 4 - 6 months (T 3) {{as well as}} 10 - 12 months (T 4) after a pest control operation (PCO). <b>Cyfluthrin</b> was applied in 11, cypermethrin in 1, deltamethrin in three and permethrin in four interiors. The pyrethroid concentrations in house dust and PM were measured by GC/MS with a detection limit for all pyrethroids of 0. 5 mg/kg house dust and of 1 ng/m 3 PM for deltamethrin and permethrin and 3 ng/m 3 PM for <b>cyfluthrin</b> and cypermethrin. A general background concentration of permethrin (95 th percentile: 5. 9 mg/kg) and <b>cyfluthrin</b> (95 th percentile: 34. 9 mg/kg) in house dust was found. In general, an appropriately performed PCO {{lead to an increase}} of pyrethroids in house dust as well as in PM, in some cases up to 1 year after application. One day after the application the <b>cyfluthrin</b> concentration increased significantly from 0. 25 (T 1) to 33. 8 mg/kg house dust (T 2) and up to 4. 9 ng/m 3 in PM. The permethrin concentration increased significantly from 4. 3 to 70 mg/kg in house dust and up to 18. 1 ng/m 3 in PM, deltamethrin increased to 54. 5 mg/kg and 20. 8 ng/m 3 and cypermethrin to 14 mg/kg and 45. 7 ng/m 3. Thereafter a continuous decrease could be observed during the time course of 1 year.

40|$|Using of {{insecticides}} depend {{largely on}} {{the knowledge of the}} susceptibility levels of malaria vectors to these chemical. In this study, the susceptibility levels of Anopheles stephensi to DDT 4 %, dieldrin 0. 4 %, fipronil 1 %, deltamethrin 0. 05 %, permethrin 0. 75 %, lambdacyhalothrin 0. 05 % and <b>cyfluthrin</b> 0. 15 % were determined according to WHO methods in three endemic malarious regions; Sistan and Baluchistan, Hormozgan and Fars provinces. The LT 50 values of different insecticides were calculated using the probit regression line for each strain. The results showed that An. stephensi is resistant to DDT, dieldrin and fipronil in all regions; however Bandar Abbas strain showed the highest level of resistance to these three insecticides. All the tested strains were sensitive against four pyrethroid insecticides. The LT 50 of Bandar Abbas strain against <b>cyfluthrin</b> and deltamethrin with 5. 46 and 3. 22 min were the highest and the lowest values respectively. The highest and the lowest mortality rates of the Kazeroon strain of An. stephensi were against lambdacyhalothrin and permethrin with 6. 80 and 0. 682 min, respectively. In Iranshahr region, the figures for deltamethrin, permethrin, lambdacyhalothrin and <b>cyfluthrin</b> were 3. 50, 5. 10, 3. 95 and 5. 38 min, respectively. The results of the study suggested a possible cross-resistance between dieldrin and fipronil. Regarding the sensitivity of An. stephensi to different pyrethroids in the malarious regions of Iran, using pyrethroids is still suggested. Performing complementary tests with <b>cyfluthrin</b> on Bandar Abbas strain and with permethrin on Iranshahr strain seems to be necessary...|$|E
