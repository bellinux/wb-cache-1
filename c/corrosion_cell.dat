50|$|Pipe {{supports}} are fabricated from {{a variety}} of materials including structural steel, carbon steel, stainless steel, galvanized steel, aluminum, ductile iron and FRP composites. Most pipe supports are coated to protect against moisture and corrosion. Some methods for corrosion protection include: painting, zinc coatings, hot dip galvanizing or a combination of these. In the case of FRP composite pipe supports, the elements required to form a <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> aren't present, so no additional coatings or protections are necessary.|$|E

Interpretation of electrode potential measurements to determine the potential at the interface between the anode of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> and the electrolyte requires training and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of measurements done in laboratory work.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion is a {{traditional}} problem but {{still one of the}} most serious problems in industry. To reduce the huge economic loss caused by corrosion, tremendous effort has been made to understand, predict and prevent it. Corrosion phenomena are generally explained by the formation of <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> at a metal-electrolyte interface. However, experimental verification of their nanoscale distribution has been a major challenge owing to the lack of a method able to visualize the local potential distribution in an electrolytic solution. In this study, we have investigated the nanoscale corrosion behavior of Cu fine wires and a duplex stainless steel by in situ imaging of local <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> by open-loop electric potential microscopy (OL-EPM). For both materials, potential images obtained by OL-EPM show nanoscale contrasts, where areas of higher and lower potential correspond to anodic areas (i. e., corrosion sites) and cathodic areas, respectively. This imaging capability allows us to investigate the real-time transition of local corrosion sites even when surface structures show little change. This is particularly useful for investigating reactions under surface oxide layers or highly corrosion-resistant materials as demonstrated here. The proposed technique should be applicable to the study of other redox reactions on a battery electrode or a catalytic material. The results presented here open up such future applications of OL-EPM in nanoscale electrochemistry. © 2016 American Chemical Society. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

50|$|Organic {{coatings}} are {{a common}} way to protect a metallic substrate from corrosion. Up until ~1950 {{it was thought that}} coatings act as a physical barrier which disallows moisture and oxygen to contact the metallic substrate and form a <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell.</b> This cannot be the case because the permeability of paint films is very high. It has since been discovered that corrosion protection of steel depends greatly upon the adhesion of a noncorrosive coating when in the presence of water. With low adhesion, osmotic cells form underneath the coating with high enough pressures to form blisters, which expose more unprotected steel. Additional non-osmotic mechanisms have also been proposed. In either case, sufficient adhesion to resist displacement forces is required for corrosion protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{company is}} {{inspired}} by the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> which consists of four parts: (1) anode, (2) cathode, (3) conductive or metallic path, and (4) electrolyte. Removing {{any one of these}} parts stops or slows corrosion. These four parts form the X in the logo. The symbols within the logo represent elements which affect corrosion such as soil, water, fire, and wind. Thus the laboratory developed the metallurgical lab to deal with the anode and cathode analysis, forensic field investigations locate underground or above ground anodic (corroding) locations, confirm unknown conductive paths due to metal/graphite connections or failed coatings or failed dielectric unions. The soil and water testing lab was developed to be able to determine external and internal corrosion origins due to electrolytes, similar to a blood test to determine an illness.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanical}} adaptations, such as tip geometry and surface roughness, {{to aid in}} neural implant design have been investigated and implemented in recent years. The geometry of an electrode affects {{the shape of the}} electric field emitted. The electric field shape, in turn, affects the current density produced by the electrode. Determining optimum surface roughness for neural implants proves to be a challenging topic. Smooth surfaces may be preferable to rougher ones as they may decrease the likelihood of bacterial adsorption and infection. Smooth surfaces would also {{make it more difficult for}} the initiation of a <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell.</b> However, creating a rougher, porous surface, may prove beneficial for at least two reasons: decreased potential polarization at the electrode surface as a result of increased surface area and decreased current density, and a decrease in fibrous tissue encapsulation thickness due to opportunity for tissue ingrowth. It has been determined that if interconnected pores with sizes between 25 and 150 micrometers, ingrowth of tissue can occur and can decrease the exterior tissue encapsulation thickness by a factor of approximately 10 (compared to a smooth electrode such as polished platinum-iridium).|$|E
40|$|Migrating soluble {{chlorides}} {{within the}} reinforcement layer can cause corrosion if a critical limit is exceeded. This limit is often quoted as 0, 40 M. -% of the cement content. In practice often higher chloride concentrations {{have been noted}} without inducing corrosion. In {{order to determine the}} critical chloride concentration <b>corrosion</b> testing <b>cells</b> have been produced at the Institute of Building Research (ibac), Aachen. In the following the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> were covered with chloride solutions. Particular interest was given to the mechanism of chloride penetration within the concrete. Measurement of the current and the potential between the anode and the cathode determined the time of depassivation. Analysis of the drilling powder gave clues as to the critical chloride concentration point. These results allow to make a statement about the relations between concrete composition or environmental conditions and the critical chloride concentration. Specially examinated were: the type of cement, the amount of the cement, the water/cement ratio, the curing of concrete, the chloride concentration and the climate. (orig.)

Both the resistance in the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> and the bulk resistivity of the mortar mixtures were determined. A comparison of the results showed no direct correlation.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} defects at the steel-concrete interface, the {{exposure}} regime, and the cement type, on {{the initiation of}} pitting corrosion in specially designed concrete <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> were investigated. Concrete/mortar <b>corrosion</b> <b>cells</b> with cast-in mild steel electrodes representing the reinforcement were exposed for wetting-drying cycles or submerged in NaCl solution. ParalIei field exposure testes were carried out in sea water. The microstructure of the steel-concrete interface was altered by introduction of a filter paper on the steel surface, by bending of the steel electrode and by compaction voids or cracks formed at or close to the steel surface. The results indicated that corrosion in most cases was initiated in deformed parts of steel electrodes. Defects introduced at or close to the steel surface had a strong negative influence on the chloride threshold for concrete exposed to wetting and drying and for field exposed concrete exposed submerged or in the splash zone, but not for submerged laboratory exposed concrete. The negative effect of filter paper and vo ids or cracks at the steel surface was stronger for slag cement concrete as compared to concrete with sulphate resisting Portland cement with O or 5 % silica fume in the binder. The results {{support the idea that}} chioride induced pitting corrosion of steel in concrete is enforced mainly under conditions of variable exposure conditions and in the presence of defects at the steel surface. The results also indicate that reinforced slag cement concrete is more sensitive to the formation of, and the effect of, cracks and other defects at the steel - concrete interface as compared to concrete bas ed on sulfate resisting cement with O or 5 % silica fume in the binder...|$|R

40|$|Pitting {{corrosion}} {{is a form}} {{of highly}} localized corrosion that can lead to crack and failure of a structure. Study on pitting corrosion is necessary in order to predict and prevent the risk of failure of structure susceptible to corrosion. In this thesis, a combination of Cellular Automata (CA) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) was developed to simulate pitting corrosion growth under certain environment. It is assumed that pitting corrosion can be simplified to electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell.</b> The distribution of potential around this <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> can then be simulated by BEM. This distribution potential represents cathodic and anodic reactions around the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell.</b> A CA model was developed that uses transition rules reflecting mechanism of pitting corrosion. The CA model has two types of cell states, one reflecting BEM simulation results and the other reflecting the status of <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> (anode, cathode, and passive metal’s surface). For every CA iteration, the CA decides the state of the corrosion cells (the location and size of anode, cathode) while BEM simulate the level of electrochemical activity at discrete location on the surface (represented by potential distribution). In order to demonstrate the methodology, a simple case of rectangular <b>corrosion</b> <b>cell</b> with varied dimensions and under different polarization functions is considered. Results show certain shapes tend to grow at certain type environment and these pits are comparable to commonly observed pit shapes. In addition, stress analysis was carried out to investigate the severity of corrosion pits of varying shapes and sizes.

The number of corrosion pits in the AA 6063 aluminium alloy is more than that in the near eutectic Al-Si-Mg alloy, but the pits in the latter alloy are much larger and deeper.
