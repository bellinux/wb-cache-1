50|$|At certain times, the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> {{represents}} only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> {{represents only}} the V signal. (This {{is the nature}} of the quadrature amplitude modulation process that created the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal.)</b> About 70 nanoseconds later still, -U, and another 70 nanoseconds, -V.|$|E
5000|$|... and [...] are the amplitudes of the {{orthogonal}} {{components of}} the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} subcarrier sidebands is {{also known}} as [...] "chroma" [...] or [...] "chrominance". Physically, this <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> is a 3.58 MHz(NTSC) or 4.43 MHz(PAL) sine wave which, in response to changing U and V values, changes phase as compared to the subcarrier, and also changes amplitude.|$|E
5000|$|In S-MAC the {{luminance}} is compressed by 2:1 {{and the two}} <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> by 4:1 so {{that all}} three may occupy the same line.|$|R
50|$|M had {{a similar}} 4-head {{recording}} system to Betacam, but the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> were recorded as two FM subcarriers of the main chrominance track FM carrier.|$|R
50|$|SECAM {{is unique}} in not having a colorburst <b>signal,</b> since the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> are encoded using FM rather than QAM, thus the signal phase is {{immaterial}} and no reference point is needed.|$|R
50|$|In {{composite}} video, {{the signals}} co-exist on different frequencies. To achieve this, the luminance signal must be low-pass filtered, dulling the image. As S-Video maintains the two as separate signals, such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary, although the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> still has limited bandwidth relative to component video.|$|E
50|$|To provide {{sufficient}} bandwidth for the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal,</b> yet interfere {{only with the}} highest-frequency (and thus least perceptible) portions of the luminance signal, a chrominance subcarrier near 3.6 MHz was desirable. 227.5 = 455/2 times the line rate {{was close to the}} right number, and 455's small factors (5 × 7 × 13) make a divider easy to construct.|$|E
50|$|In {{composite}} video signals, the U and V signals modulate a color subcarrier signal, and {{the result}} {{is referred to as the}} chrominance signal; the phase and amplitude of this modulated <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> correspond approximately to the hue and saturation of the color. In digital-video and still-image color spaces such as Y′CbCr, the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.|$|E
50|$|Since analog {{video is}} {{recorded}} by frequency-modulation {{of the video}} signal, the FM capture effect shields the signal against this noise; however, the linear audio and (depending on format) <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> of a video cassette may have some print effects.|$|R
25|$|Another use of {{weighting}} is in television, {{where the}} red, {{green and blue}} components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers, and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> for transmission.|$|R
50|$|A gated and {{filtered}} signal {{derived from the}} color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, {{is added to the}} horizontal blanking interval of each line, excluding the vertical sync interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals.</b> The burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference subcarrier.|$|R
50|$|Note that ghosts are {{a problem}} {{specific}} to the video portion of television, largely because it uses AM for transmission. SECAM TV uses FM for the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal,</b> hence ghosting only affects the luma (video) portion of its signal. TV is broadcast on VHF and UHF, which have line-of-sight propagation, and easily reflect off of buildings, mountains, and other objects.|$|E
50|$|Each {{line of the}} {{displayed}} {{image is}} transmitted using a signal as shown above. The same basic format (with minor differences mainly related to timing and the encoding of color) is used for PAL, NTSC and SECAM television systems. A monochrome signal is identical to a color one, with the exception that the elements shown in color in the diagram (the color burst, and the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal)</b> are not present.|$|E
50|$|However, no {{comb filter}} can totally {{eliminate}} NTSC artifacts {{and the only}} complete solutions to dot crawl are not to use NTSC or PAL composite video, maintaining the signals separately by using S-Video or component video connections instead, or encoding the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> differently as in SECAM or any modern digital video standard {{as long as the}} source video has never been processed using any video system vulnerable to dot crawl.|$|E
50|$|The PAL {{colour carrier}} is {{modulated}} {{making use of}} correlation between 2 fields, {{in order to give}} a cleaner Y/C separation in the PAL-plus receiver. It is used with signals with high horizontal luminance frequencies (3 MHz) that share the spectrum with the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals.</b> Colour pictures on both standard and PAL Plus receivers are enhanced.|$|R
50|$|Video {{was split}} among the C and Y tracks: Luminance was simply {{frequency}} modulated and written {{solely to the}} Y track. The two <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals,</b> Pr and Pb, were combined by chrominance time compressed multiplexing (CTCM), which {{is a type of}} time division multiplexing. The resulting CTCM signal was frequency modulated and combined with the FM audio carriers, and written to the C track.|$|R
40|$|A new {{adaptive}} method is {{developed for the}} enhancement of subsampled colour images. The system use edge information in the luminance channel to aid {{the reconstruction of the}} <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> such that edges between the luminance and the chrominance channels are well aligned. A technique exploiting the luminance information effectively is developed. The method is computationally efficient. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the new technique...|$|R
5000|$|These {{sideband}} frequencies {{are within}} the luminance signal band, {{which is why they}} are called [...] "subcarrier" [...] sidebands instead of simply [...] "carrier" [...] sidebands. Their exact frequencies were chosen such that (for NTSC), they are midway between two harmonics of the frame repetition rate, thus ensuring {{that the majority of the}} power of the luminance signal does not overlap with the power of the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|A color TV {{signal is}} almost {{the same as a}} {{monochrome}} signal, except that the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> (a subcarrier modulated by the color information) is superimposed on the monochrome signal (luminance). In a studio environment the total video level while showing a color at maximum saturation (such as yellow) may exceed 1 V. But for transmission, maximum amplitude is limited by the use of the various matrix values in the PAL or NTSC encoder.|$|E
50|$|Analogue color video signals {{comprise}} two components: chrominance and luminance. The {{luminance component}} describes {{the brightness of}} {{each part of the}} picture, while the chrominance component describes the color tone. When displayed on a black-and-white monitor, the luminance signal produces a normal black-and-white image, while the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> manifests as a fine pattern of dots of varying size and intensity overlaid over the black-and-white picture. A related phenomenon is dot crawl, which can produce visual artifacts in color pictures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we present}} a new digital signal {{processor}} developed for digital camcorder applications. Taking the digital image signal from A/D converter, the signal processor generates luminance and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> of the image using an efficient RGB interpolation algorithm and histogram accumulation. We propose a low-cost RGB interpolation algorithm that has little image degradation and show the usefulness of histogram accumulation implemented in the signal processor. I...|$|R
50|$|In some analog color CRT displays, {{starting}} in 1956, the brightness control signal (luminance) is fed to the cathode connections {{of the electron}} guns, and the color difference <b>signals</b> (<b>chrominance</b> <b>signals)</b> are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later solid state designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.|$|R

50|$|SECAM {{is free of}} both hue and {{saturation}} errors. It is {{not sensitive}} to phase shifts between the color burst and the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal,</b> {{and for this reason}} was sometimes used in early attempts at color video recording, where tape speed fluctuations could get the other systems into trouble. In the receiver, it did not require a quartz crystal (which was an expensive component at the time) and generally could do with lower accuracy delay lines and components.|$|E
50|$|On VHS tapes, the {{luminance}} signal is recorded {{in its original}} form (albeit with some reduction of bandwidth) but the PAL or NTSC <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> is too sensitive to small changes in frequency caused by inevitable small variations in tape speed to be recorded directly. Instead, it is first down converted to the lower frequency of 630 kHz, and the complex nature of the PAL or NTSC sub carrier means that the down conversion must be done via heterodyning to ensure that information is not lost.|$|E
50|$|A {{vectorscope}} uses an overlaid circular reference display, or graticule, for visualizing chrominance signals, {{which is}} the best method of referring to the QAM scheme used to encode color into a video signal. The actual visual pattern that the incoming <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> draws on the vectorscope is called the trace. Chrominance is measured using two methods—color saturation, encoded as the amplitude, or gain, of the subcarrier signal, and hue, encoded as the subcarrier's phase. The vectorscope's graticule roughly represents saturation as distance {{from the center of the}} circle, and hue as the angle, in standard position, around it. The graticule is also embellished with several elements corresponding to the various components of the standard color bars video test signal, including boxes around the circles for the colors in the main bars, and perpendicular lines corresponding to the U and V components of the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> (and additionally on an NTSC vectorscope, the I and Q components). NTSC vectorscopes have one set of boxes for the color bars, while their PAL counterparts have two sets of boxes, because the R-Y chrominance component in PAL reverses in phase on alternating lines. Another element in the graticule is a fine grid at the nine-o'clock, or -U position, used for measuring differential gain and phase.|$|E
50|$|The CTIA/GTIA {{receives}} Playfield graphics {{information from}} ANTIC and applies colors to the pixels from a 128 or 256 color palette {{depending on the}} color interpretation mode in effect. CTIA/GTIA also controls Player/Missile Graphics (aka sprites) functionality including collision detection between displayed objects (Players, Missiles, and ANTIC's Playfield), display priority control over objects, and color/luminance control of all displayed objects. CTIA/GTIA outputs separate digital luminance and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals,</b> which are mixed to form an analogue composite video signal.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{coding system}} {{for reducing the}} high data rate of a digital HDTV signal (approximately= 1 Gbit/s) is described. Spatio-temporal subsampling of the interlaced source signal is {{used in conjunction with}} an intrafield DPCM of the remaining samples. For the luminance signal two well-known sampling patterns, fieldquincunx and linequincunx, are proposed; both provide a 2 : 1 subsampling. Prior to subsampling, a digital filter which adapts itself to the movement in the scene, adjusts the three-dimensional spectrum of the television signal to some reduced region supported by the sampling pattern and the properties of the human visual system. Different filter structures are suggested for prefiltering and for interpolation of the missing samples in the receiver. The <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> are horizontally bandlimited before digitization. A modified linequincunx sampling structure is used for subsampling the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals.</b> Two-dimensional digital prefilters and interpolators are required. Then predictive coding with a fixed quantizer and predictor is applied to the picture elements which remain in the luminance and chrominance paths after subsampling. Sixteen quantization levels are used for the luminance and for each chrominance component to reduce the whole data rate to less than 280 Mbit/s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Subsampling <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} used in colour imaging systems to reduce the storage and transmission requirements. The lossy nature of the process, however, inevitably introduces colour artifacts.

5000|$|In December 1953 the FCC {{unanimously}} approved what is {{now called}} the NTSC color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible color standard retained full backward compatibility with existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz or 3.58 MHz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal line-rate modulation components of the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> would fall exactly in between the horizontal line-rate modulation components of the luminance signal, thereby enabling the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> to be filtered out of the luminance signal with minor degradation of the luminance signal. Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. [...] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers.|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> was missing, or {{deliberately}} ignored, the focusing {{system was}} disconnected and its power {{added to the}} gun. This produced a slightly stronger and unfocused beam, which hit all three colored strips and produced a B&W image. [...] The spaces between the stripes meant the overall image would be about as bright as a conventional B&W set. A shadow mask set required all three guns to be powered to produce a B&W image, and since the color spots were small, their power {{had to be very}} high.|$|E
5000|$|In the '70s, the Israeli {{government}} {{considered the}} import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the Israel Broadcasting Authority to cease broadcasting in color. As it was impractical to strip out the <b>chrominance</b> <b>signal</b> from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the burst phase signal from the broadcast. The [...] "damaged" [...] signal triggered the [...] "color killer" [...] mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named mekhikon (מחיקון [...] "eraser").|$|E
40|$|A common video {{indexing}} technique is to segment video shots by identifying scene changes {{and then to}} extract features. This paper discusses a novel algorithm for detecting fade-in and fade-out using statistical features of both luminance and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals.</b> The ratio between incremental change in {{the mean of the}} luminance <b>signal</b> to the <b>chrominance</b> (average sum of Cr and Cb) is considered to identify fade-in and fade-out. Results show that the algorithm is capable of detecting all fade regions accurately even the video sequence contains other special effects...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not unusual}} to see the term S-VHS {{incorrectly}} {{used to refer to}} S-Video connectors (also called Y/C connectors), even in printed material. This may be due to S-VHS having been one of the more common consumer video products equipped with the S-Video connector. However, S-Video connectors became common on many other video devices: DVD players and recorders, MiniDV and Hi8 camcorders, cable/satellite set-top boxes, TV-compatible video outputs on computers and video game consoles, and inputs on TV sets themselves. Where the S- in S-VHS means [...] "super", the S- in S-Video refers to the [...] "separated" [...] luminance and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reversible}} algorithm to convert color images to gray images with keeping chroma and spatial resolution. K. Braun and R.

Our algorithm succeeded to solve those problems by devising a color embedding technique. By replacing a subband of a luminance component by quantized high-pass and <b>chrominance</b> <b>signals,</b> semi-invariant algorithm for chroma and spatial resolution can be realized. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can recover vivid color images with keeping spatial resolution from textured gray images...|$|R
