30|$|From Figure  4 c, a bending tester {{was used}} to study the dynamic fatigue of the PET-based <b>conductive</b> silver <b>line.</b> During the test, the <b>conductive</b> <b>line</b> makes a {{periodic}} bending movement from I to V, and every period needs 2 s. The details also {{can be seen from}} the set in Figure  3 b. It is very interesting to find that the resistivity of the <b>conductive</b> silver <b>lines</b> also increases with the increase of the bending angle. From I to III, the resistivity increases from 5.2 to 5.76 Ω. It can be explained that when bending, the silver thin film was stretched and became thin, especially on the top point of the <b>conductive</b> <b>line,</b> so the stack density and conductivity decreased. From III to V, the resistivity was back to 5.2 Ω, and after a periodic movement like this for 1, 000 times, the resistivity did not significantly increase due to the good ductility of the metal silver. Generally speaking, compared with other printing technologies, this method also shows good adhesion between the silver thin film and PET, showing good results.|$|R

30|$|Compared to inkjet printing, {{spray coating}} has an obvious {{advantage}} on fabricating accurate patterns. Figure 2 a shows the wave-like edge of inkjet-printed patterns, which is mainly {{attributed to the}} drop-to-drop distance and component of the solvent. As depicted in Figure 2 b, the 10 -μm inkjet-printed line is along the 1.5 [*]~[*] 3 -μm scalloped edge. If the adjacent <b>conductive</b> <b>lines</b> were set closer than 3 μm, the wave-like edge {{would result in the}} crosstalk of electrical signal or even worse[25]. Figure 2 c reveals a spray-coated silver line with a width of 20 μm, while the edge of the silver line is only 1 μm. It also shows that the edge of the spray-coated line is composed of a mass of silver dots, resulting from the inevitable diffraction of the spraying process. The enlarged view exhibits that the majority of divergent dots are isolated with each other. This indicates that the edge of spray-coated patterns is not conductive, which guarantees the potential of spray-coated silver nanoparticle inks for fabricating accurate patterns in the scale of nanometer.|$|R

50|$|Different {{parts of}} a system may be best {{implemented}} in different formats. Transitions between the various formats are therefore required. Transitions between formats using unbalanced <b>conductive</b> <b>lines</b> are straightforward enough, this is mostly {{just a matter of}} providing continuity of the conductor through the transition and ensuring a good impedance match. The same can be said for transitions to non-planar formats such as coaxial. A transition between stripline and microstrip needs to ensure that both ground planes of the stripline are adequately electrically bonded to the microstrip ground plane. One of these groundplanes can be continuous through the transition, but the other ends at the transition. There is a similar issue with the microstrip to CPW transition shown at C in the diagram. There is only one ground plane in each format but it changes {{from one side of the}} substrate to the other at the transition. This can be avoided by printing the microstrip and CPW lines on opposite sides of the substrate. In this case the ground plane is continuous on one side of the substrate but a via is required on the line at the transition.|$|R
40|$|Non-contact {{printing}} techniques are receiving increasing {{interest in the}} field of printed electronics, because they can be used to pattern various inks on arbitrary substrates without applying mechanical pressure or damaging pre-patterned components. The ink-jet process is frequently used for non-contact printing of various conductive inks. However, the ink-jet printing process is restricted by the viscosity of the ink, because the nozzle can become clogged by high-viscosity inks. Here we successfully demonstrate a non-contact printing technique for high-viscosity and high-concentration silver precursor inks using the laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) process. The process conditions for LIFT printing, including the triazene polymer sacrificial layer thickness, the laser fluence, and the donor-acceptor distance, have been investigated in detail.

It can be obtained that between 20 °C and 100 °C, the largest variable quantity of the resistivity is just about 0.28 Ω. After linear fitting, {{the slopes of the}} heating curve and the cooling curve, which can be called temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), approximately have the same slope (kh = kc = 0.0007 aR/°C− 1), indicating the good thermal stability of the <b>conductive</b> silver <b>line.</b> The TCR is a little different compared with the TCR of bulk silver (0.0038 aR/°C− 1). This phenomenon is mainly caused by the complex microstructure of the silver thin film which will bring more barriers during the electron-transfer process. Moreover, it also can be seen that though the heating curve and cooling curve have the same TCR, the cooling curve is always below the heating curve. This is mainly because the natural cooling process (about 28 min) needs more time than the heating process (15 min).|$|R
