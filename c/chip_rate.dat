Two additional binary data sources, each having a bit rate that is not restricted by the <b>chipping</b> <b>rate</b> of the first carrier, quadriphase, digitally modulate a suppressed carrier wave having a second frequency. The first and second frequencies are only slightly displaced so that there is overlap in the frequency bands which modulate the two carriers. The two suppressed carrier waves are linearly combined and transmitted from a first station to a second station so that the amplitude of the transmitted first wave is controlled so as not to degrade the detectability of the second wave at the second station...|$|R

Attention is focussed {{on the development}} of receivers based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE). Due to the cyclostationarity of the multirate signal, a representation of the multirate signal in terms of the Fourier basis is possible. This expansion facilitates construction of the MMSE receivers. Both variable spreading gain as well as variable <b>chipping</b> <b>rate</b> DS-CDMA access schemes are considered.

Unlike TD-CDMA (UTRA-TDD 3.84 Mcps High <b>Chip</b> <b>Rate,</b> UTRA-TDD HCR) which complements W-CDMA (UTRA-FDD), it is suitable for both micro and macro cells. However, the lack of vendors' support is preventing it from being a real competitor.|$|E

50|$|A final {{interesting}} {{case is that}} of mobiles {{covering the}} DS-WCDMA and MC-CDMA 3G variants of the CDMA-2000 protocol. Initially, the <b>chip</b> <b>rate</b> of these phones was incompatible. As part of the negotiations related to patents, it was agreed to use compatible chip rates. This should mean that, {{despite the fact that}} the air and system interfaces are quite different, even on a philosophical level, much of the hardware for each system inside a phone should be common with differences being mostly confined to software.|$|E
5000|$|Binary Offset Carrier {{modulation}} (BOC modulation) {{was developed}} by John Betz, PhD, {{in order to allow}} interoperability of satellite navigation systems.

40|$|Optimum near-far {{resistance}} is studied for synchronous dual-rate DS/CDMA systems. Three multi-rate access schemes are considered: multi-code (MC) access where high-rate users multiplex their data bits onto multiple codes {{and form a}} single-rate system; variable spreading length (VSL) access where the spreading lengths of signature sequences are inversely proportional to users' data rates; and variable <b>chipping</b> <b>rate</b> (VCR) access where the <b>chipping</b> <b>rates</b> of the signature sequences are proportional to users' data rates. In order to remove the influence of signature sequences in the comparison of the three schemes, random signature sequences are assumed. Optimum near-far {{resistance is}} then averaged over all possible realizations. Two types of code sets are considered for the VSL system: general random codes and random repetition codes.

40|$|Minimum-mean squared error (MMSE) {{receivers}} {{are designed}} and analyzed for multiple data rate direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. The inherent cyclostationarity of the DS-CDMA signal is exploited to construct receivers for asynchronous multipath channels. Multiple- and single-bandwidth access are treated for both single and multicarrier scenarios. In general, the optimal receiver is periodically time-varying. When {{the period of}} the optimal receiver is large, suboptimal receivers are proposed to achieve a lower complexity implementation; the receivers are designed {{as a function of the}} cyclic statistics of the signals. In multiple <b>chipping</b> <b>rate</b> systems, complexity of receivers for smaller bandwidth users can also be controlled by changing their front-end filter bandwidth. The effect of front-end filter bandwidth on receiver performance and system capacity is quantified for a variable <b>chipping</b> <b>rate</b> system.

50|$|In these systems, {{the symbol}} {{rate of the}} {{physically}} transmitted high-frequency signal rate is called <b>chip</b> <b>rate,</b> which also is the pulse rate of the equivalent base band signal. However, in spread spectrum systems, the term symbol may also be used at a higher layer and refer to one information bit, or a block of information bits that are modulated using for example conventional QAM modulation, before the CDMA spreading code is applied. Using the latter definition, the symbol rate is equal to or lower than the bit rate.|$|E
