40|$|To {{improve the}} fuel {{consumption}} of a motor grader, {{a method for}} shifting the power curve of the grader engine is proposed. The working principle, calculation method, and design procedure of the novel method are depicted. Considering the nonlinear and time-varying uncertainty of the load of a motor grader, the fuzzy adaptive control is provided to shift the power curve. The shifting action is decided by the gears and the <b>corresponding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> together with the displacements of both the hydraulic pump and motor. As a result, the power line adapts to the frequent changes in different external loads. A prototype motor grader is developed to test the above-mentioned energy conservation method in different working conditions. The {{results show that the}} fuel consumption of the prototype motor is reduced by 23 %– 34 % and the skip ratio is decreased by 10 % compared with the traditional grader with only one power curve. The proposed shifting power curve method can be widely applied to other heavy-load construction machinery also...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the main {{geometric}} parameters, operating variables and experimental results of engines with different size and characteristics, as well as simulation predictions at operating conditions for which the working fluid may evidence real gas effects. The concept of dimensionless quasi-static indicated work, introduced previously, is computed assuming both ideal and real gas models. Both values are compared with the Schmidt's model prediction, to evaluate separately how the mechanism simplification and the equation of state affect. The influence of physical gas properties are also analysed regarding the gas circuit performance and mechanical efficiency. Pending of experimental corroboration, some simulations show the possibility of obtaining interesting operating conditions under real gas effects. Semi-empirical equations and experimental correlations are proposed as preliminary design criteria. The ratio between the dimensionless values of the maximum indicated power (a sort of ‘indicated’ Beale number) and the quasi-static indicated work is analysed. The procedure to estimate the maximum indicated power is completed by analysing the characteristic Mach number (dimensionless rotation frequency). Analogous procedure is applied for the maximum brake power and <b>corresponding</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Use of dimensionless variables facilitates the generalization of analyses by means of dynamic similarity criteria...|$|E
40|$|A first {{generation}} open cycle Brayton engine concept {{for use in}} full scale solar module testing was defined. The concept extended to include solar/fossil hybrid capability. The combustion system defined for hybrid operation consists {{of a wide range}} combustor liner, a single airblast atomizer, an ignitor and a high-voltage ignition unit.

50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (drive-on, drive-off) launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, hydraulic oil tank for the front axle, hydraulic pumps, cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the dead-man control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground <b>speed</b> which <b>corresponds</b> to <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|R

50|$|To {{maximize}} acceleration, the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of {{an automobile}} {{must be kept}} near that where maximum power is developed. For this reason, vehicles utilize transmissions; as the vehicle's speed increases such that the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> exceeds {{the speed at which}} maximum power is developed, the driver shifts to a higher (numerically lower ratio) gear, which reduces <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and allows continued acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, reduced <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{has benefited}} the sport {{because there is}} more racing, fewer {{accidents}} and breakdowns and racing fans get more value for their time and money invested in watching races.

Still, Formula One is very much {{out of step with}} most [...] "mainstream" [...] motorsports where larger dispacement engines and lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> dominate. When compared to much larger engines producing much higher torque output at far lower <b>engines</b> <b>speeds</b> and powering much heavier vehicles to similar speeds, the diminishing returns of very high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and small displacements become apparent. And while many other motorsports, such as NASCAR, feature racing with the engines and cars spending the majority of their events at high speeds, Formula One cars spend much less time at full vehicle and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and typically the maximum <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are seen while downshifting going into and exiting corners rather than in [...] "high gear" [...] for lengthy periods of time.|$|R

40|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} signals in the engine management system of a combustion engine. The signal is used to control the fuel injection, estimate the engine torque, and to generate reference values. Combustions in the cylinders result in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> oscillating around a momentary average, and many applications are depending on stable estimates of this average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and the average acceleration. This thesis provides a signal model based method to estimate the momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration. The estimation of momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration is complicated by imperfections in the process of measuring the <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Limited accuracy in the measurements causes quantization distortion in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> signal. The effects of these errors are investigated and quantified. A signal model representing the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is developed and used to estimate the momentary average and acceleration using a Kalman filter. The regular Kalman filter cannot provide estimates with low noise levels at steady state and at the same time be fast enough to track the signal during transient behavior. This problem is overcome by extending the Kalman filter with a change detection algorithm. While this signal model based method gives a satisfying result, it is computationally complex. To evaluate its performance, it is compared to a moving average FIR filter, which is computationally less expensive but does not succeed as well as the signal model based method in filtering out all oscillations...|$|R

5000|$|Engine builders, {{engineers}} and tuners read dynamometer results as {{a map of}} engine performance rather than a chart of data points.

Beyond peak horsepower <b>speed,</b> additional <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> only wastes fuel and increases wear and tear on the engine and other powertrain components. Horsepower and high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are grossly overestimated as indicators of performance in most applications, and high horsepower numbers that are dependent primarily upon <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> rather than torque output have to be offset by increasing torque via torque-converter design, transmission gearing, differential gearing and tire size so that available torque is used and multiplied most effectively.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Errors in the {{estimation}} of friction torque in modern spark ignition automotive engines necessitate the development of real-time algorithms for adaptation of the friction torque. Friction torque in the engine control unit {{is presented as a}} look-up table with two input variables (the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and indicated <b>engine</b> torque). The algorithms proposed in this paper estimate the engine friction torque via the crankshaft speed fluctuations at the fuel cut-off state and at idle. A computationally efficient filtering algorithm for reconstruction of the first harmonic of a periodic signal is used to recover an amplitude which <b>corresponds</b> to <b>engine</b> events from the noise-contaminated <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> measurements at the fuel cut-off state. The values of the friction torque at the nodes of the look-up table are updated, when new measured data of the friction torque are available. New data-driven algorithms which are based on a stepwise regression method are developed for adaptation of look-up tables. The algorithms are verified by using a spark ignition six-cylinder prototype engine...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the performance and emissions characteristics of a turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine operated with natural gas as primary fuel, and diesel fuel as ignition source.

The effects of diesel-natural gas substitution ratios, <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and load on the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are examined for natural gas-diesel fuel operation and, afterward, compared with the original diesel operation. The results show that, over a wide range of operating conditions (<b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> load), the dual fuel engine clearly shows the benefits of reduced NOX emissions. However, under low loads, the results indicate high CO and HC emissions and a higher BSFC when compared to those of the <b>corresponding</b> diesel <b>engine...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation to investigate the in-cylinder flow characteristics of 2 D combustion chamber for a hydrogen-fuelled four-stroke internal combustion engine.

The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from 1000 to 3000 rpm, the range of equivalent ratio from 0. 6 to 1. 0 and the crank angle from 0 to 720 degrees in this study. The effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and equivalence ratio on the flow-field characteristics and volumetric efficiency are investigated in the motoring condition. The increase of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> gives a more efficient diffusion process for hydrogen and gives a more homogeneous air–fuel mixture structure.
