However, the MDA cannot address individual pixels; it only works in text mode, limiting its choice of display patterns to 256 characters.

In the MDA-compatible text mode, however, these pixels were not individually addressable. The graphics mode simply made all pixels directly addressable. This translated to a resolution of not 720&times;350, but only 720&times;348 pixels (at 1 bit per pixel) because, for technical reasons (see below), the screen height had to be a multiple of four.

50|$|Technical {{lettering}} is {{the process}} of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the <b>character</b> <b>height</b> (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{current study}} derived seven {{descriptors}} from the pixel matrix of 5401 Chinese {{characters in the}} commonly used Ming, Kai, Li, and Hei fonts. A factor {{analysis was used to}} reduce the number of descriptors for a validation experiment. The three-factor solution (number of strokes, <b>character</b> <b>height,</b> and character width) explaining 89. 54 % of the variance was derived from 5401 characters in four fonts. A 4 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment using fonts, number of strokes, <b>character</b> <b>height,</b> and character width as the independent variables was conducted to evaluate the impact of each critical factor on the legibility of Chinese characters. Each tested character was chosen from the 500 most commonly used characters to minimize the effect of familiarity and ensure that all participants could recognize the character if it was legible. The sixteen university students who participated in the experiment were asked to identify a Chinese character initially displayed on a PC screen at its minimum size and enlarged gradually until the participant could recognize it. The analysis of variance suggests that all the main effects of font, number of strokes, <b>character</b> <b>height,</b> and character width are significant. The legibility thresholds of the four type styles from the most to the least legible are in the Hei, Ming, Kai, and Li sequence. Number of strokes is the only significant factor in predicting the legibility threshold for each individual font. However, if predicting the legibility threshold across four fonts, <b>character</b> <b>height</b> is the other significant factor with about the same predictive power as number of strokes. The legible threshold is increased by the number of strokes and decreased by the <b>character</b> <b>height</b> and character width...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective: The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{evaluate}} the visual angle and ambient illumination effects on visual fatigue and performances while viewing from a projected screen for 40 minutes. Methods: Visual angle (16, 24 and 48 min arc of Chinese <b>character</b> <b>height)</b> and ambient illumination (200 and 750 lux) were the independent variables in this study. Change in critical flicker frequency (c_CFF), subjective visual fatigue, proofreading accuracy, and film-watching performance in the experimental trials were obtained from 30 young adults. Each experimental trial took 40 minutes, including a 10 -min proofreading test and a 30 -min film watching task. Results: Visual angle had a significant effect on proofreading accuracy. An increased proofreading accuracy tendency was found with increasing visual angle. Higher ambient illumination (750 lux) had a positive effect on c_CFF. A significantly higher film-watching performance was also found at the higher ambient illumination (750 lux) compared to that of the lower one (200 lux). Conclusion: We suggest that (a) the ambient illumination should be controlled at about 750 lux for better audiencesâ attention and visual comfort; (b) a greater visual angle (24 ~ 48 min arc of <b>character</b> <b>height)</b> is more suitable for Chinese text-reading on a projected screen as compared with 16 min arc; and (c) if the visual tasks with a projected screen mostly contain video and voice, the visual angle of <b>character</b> <b>height</b> will have little effect on performance...|$|E
