5|$|At a party, Bruce Wayne meets Debra Kane, a <b>caseworker</b> with Child Protective Services. He asks to {{join her}} while she visits clients. She agrees and shows him the varying degrees of child abuse she {{encounters}} {{in the course of}} her job. Wanting to understand the factors behind child abuse, Bruce, as Batman, breaks into Hellgate Prison and talks with an informant who points him to a child pornography and prostitution ring. Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, had been secretly investigating a similar child prostitution ring, and that the sex traffickers ordered the murders of Bruce's parents in order to silence her.|$|E

Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his wife Delia, a sculptor; and his goth {{daughter}} Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own <b>caseworker,</b> Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove counterproductive, despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E

Paperwork in county welfare bureaucracies, however, is often taken-for-granted by <b>caseworkers</b> and researchers studying welfare. In this case study of a county welfare program in rural North Carolina, I focus on how <b>caseworkers</b> use paperwork through document analysis, interviews, and observation data.

25|$|During {{another meeting}} with his <b>caseworker</b> (which {{regularly}} takes place at his employers' house), Tender gets frustrated and tells {{her that if she}} wants to help him, she can start by scrubbing the shower tiles. Burnt out over a decade of lost suicide cases, the <b>caseworker</b> quickly grows obsessed with cleaning and soon takes over Tender's job, drifting more and more away from helping him confront his past. She reveals at this time that many of the Creedish suicides were really murders masked to look like suicides to encourage more survivors to kill themselves.|$|E
25|$|Tender soon {{learns that}} he {{has become one of}} the last two {{survivors}} of the Creedish Church. The <b>caseworker</b> has him go over photos of dead Creedish to see if he can identify the other survivor, but he already knows it to be his brother Adam. He begins receiving phone calls from journalists and agents wanting his story. The <b>caseworker</b> manages to suffocate on a chemical solution of ammonia and chlorine that she was using to clean the fireplace, which had been secretly mixed together by Adam, and whose intended target was Tender. Adam steals the caseworker's files on the Creedish suicides immediately after the murder. The police suspect Tender, but he claims innocence and slips away. Tender, meanwhile, calls an agent and takes a flight to New York that very night. Thus begins his road to stardom.|$|E

The experiment was designed such that <b>caseworkers</b> retained full discretion about the choice of active labour market programmes, and the evaluation results showed that <b>caseworkers</b> largely did not follow the statistical support system. This indicates that stronger incentives are needed for <b>caseworkers</b> to comply with statistical profiling and targeting systems.|$|R

Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent the same way he killed the <b>caseworker,</b> so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the three part.|$|E

30|$|The {{implementation}} of a voucher system alters the tasks faced by <b>caseworkers</b> and managers. Prior to the reform, the <b>caseworkers</b> were responsible for assigning unemployed individuals to training courses. Consequently, the reform resulted {{in a loss of}} authority in the allocation of training courses that may in turn lead to negative attitudes towards the reform. A positive impact {{can be seen in the}} reduced workload for <b>caseworkers.</b> To ensure that training providers offer courses that match the regional demand, <b>caseworkers</b> and managers are expected to publish an annual regional demand forecast for training measures for which vouchers will be issued. Since <b>caseworkers</b> are not allowed to influence voucher recipients’ decision as to where to redeem their voucher, problems may occur if, for example, too many training providers offer the same courses in line with the demand forecast while too few training vouchers are redeemed at each particular provider to make the course profitable.|$|R

25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Ol' Dirty Bastard gained notoriety when, as he was being {{profiled}} for an MTV biography, he took two of his seven children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to cash a $375 welfare check and receive food stamps; his latest album {{was still in the}} top ten of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide. Although he had recently received a $45,000 cash advance for his first solo album and was earning a cut of the profits from the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Ol' Dirty Bastard was still listed as eligible for welfare and food stamps {{due to the fact that}} he had not yet filed his taxes for the current year. His <b>caseworker</b> revoked his eligibility after seeing the MTV segment, and the incident was viewed as an example of the welfare abuses that led to the significant welfare reforms enacted in 1996.|$|E

25|$|Adam Branson : Adam is Tender's older twin brother. Because {{he was the}} firstborn, Adam got {{to stay in the}} Church {{community}} in Nebraska and marry, while Tender was among those sent to earn a living for the Church in the outside world. Adam is the person who leaked the community's illegal activities to the police ten years {{prior to the start of}} the novel, which was the event that instigated the community's mass suicide. Since then, Adam has been traveling the country, killing surviving members of the Church and masking the murders as suicides in order to motivate further suicides. His motivations are unclear. His goal seems to be to completely eradicate the Creedish beliefs and challenge the Church at its core. He also may see his actions as merciful to the victims of the cult brainwashing. In the course of the novel, he also kills the <b>caseworker</b> and the agent, making Tender the prime suspect in both murders. Adam and Fertility help Tender escape from the police as they come to arrest him, and as the brothers travel north in hiding, they return to the Creedish Church Compound, which is now the Sensitive Materials Sanitary Landfill. As they argue over their memories of the Creedish way of life, Tender crashes the car, which sends a dashboard figurine (of Tender) into Adam's eye.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study was to examine six <b>caseworkers</b> and two clients’ {{experiences}} of interaction in the investigative work of social assistance. Moreover, how the interaction between <b>caseworkers</b> and clients are affected by the structure of the social assistance unit. The study also wanted to show how interaction rituals contribute to the change in assessment procedure in the investigative work. The study even aimed to highlight the ways in which social exclusion occurs in investigative work from <b>caseworkers</b> and client’s capital and gender. Finally, the study intended to look at how <b>caseworkers</b> and client’s positions as superior and subordinate affect the interaction of the investigative work and what roles are shaped during their meeting and how the roles form the interaction. The questions were examined using qualitative methodology in the form of semi-structured interviews. I´ve based the paper on social exclusion processes and applied organizational sociology. The theoretical perspectives used in this thesis work is moreover Ahrne’s organization theory, Collins’s theory of interaction rituals, Goffman’s role theory, Bourdieus’ theory of distinction and capital concept and Mulinari and de los Reyes intersectionality concept. Main conclusions I could draw from the survey results and analysis are that the <b>caseworkers</b> and clients’ experiences tend to resemble each other in many aspects. Overall the <b>caseworkers</b> and clients experience that the interaction is multidimensional; however, the interaction is founded in the authority structure. The interaction is represented by the <b>caseworker’s</b> dominant position, where their overall superior role exists in which the underlying dual roles as helpers and personal authorities also occur. Unlike the <b>caseworkers</b> the clients hold a dominated position, where their overall subordinate role exists in which the underlying dual roles as clients and as individuals occur. This means that the interaction is primarily governed by the <b>caseworkers</b> and client’s freedom of movement is restricted. Clients welfare and their meaningfulness of everyday life including their financial situation are thereby affected by the interaction of the investigative work as a result of the interaction leading toward that the client is justified social assistance or not...|$|R

We are particularly interested in whether the <b>caseworkers</b> allocate the unemplyoyed to services in ways that will maximize the program-induced changes in their employment probabilities. Our econometric analysis uses unusually informative informative data originating from administrative unemployment and social security records. For the estimation we apply matching estimators adapted to the case of multiple programmes. The number of oberservations in this database is sufficiently high to allow for this nonparametic analysis to be conducted in narrowly defined subgroups. Our results indicate that Swiss <b>caseworkers</b> do not {{do a very good job}} of allocating their unemployed clients to the subprograms so as to maximize their subsequent employment prospects. Our findings suggest one of three possible conclusions.

Second, <b>caseworkers</b> may have a goal other than efficiency, such as allocating the most expensive services to the least well-off clients, that is not explicit in the law regulating active labour market policies.
