5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they <b>could</b> <b>let</b> themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Northern Water Tribe, Katara {{continues}} teaching Aang Waterbending while the group searches for an Earthbending teacher. They meet Toph Beifong, a twelve-year-old, blind tomboy and Earthbending prodigy who wants independence from her upper-class family. Pursued by Azula, Zuko and Iroh lead new {{lives in the}} Earth Kingdom as wanderers and refugees {{in the capital city}} of Ba Sing Se. At a library guarded by the spirit Wan Shi Tong, Aang and his group learn that an imminent solar eclipse <b>could</b> <b>let</b> them stop the Fire Nation before Sozin's Comet arrives. They journey to Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of this information. In the city, they find that the Earth King Kuei is being manipulated by Long Feng, leader of the Dai Li secret police. After Aang's group exposes Long Feng's political machinations, Toph is captured but manages to escape by learning to bend metal. The Dai Li join Azula to instigate a coup d'état of Ba Sing Se, and Zuko, who has spent his time in Ba Sing Se trying {{to come to terms with}} his identity, ultimately sides with his sister Azula. During a face off in the catacombs underneath the ancient city, Azula nearly kills Aang, forcing the protagonists to retreat with help from Iroh, leaving the Earth Kingdom under the control of the Fire Nation.|$|E

The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users.

500|$|So John left Epiphany in Ireland and {{returned}} to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she <b>could</b> <b>let</b> him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called [...] "A Long Journey's End" [...] surrounded by people, {{in front of a}} shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody <b>could</b> <b>let</b> go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E
500|$|Though Cushing, as Minister of Public Works, was {{initially}} responsible for railway policy, on November 1, 1909 Rutherford {{created a new}} ministry of Railways, which he appointed himself to head. [...] In February 1910, Cushing resigned as Minister of Public Works, expressing disagreement with Rutherford's policy of offering loan guarantees to private railway builders, including the Alberta and Great Waterways (A) Railway. [...] He stated in his letter of resignation that this policy had been adopted without his knowledge or consent. [...] Rutherford accepted the resignation with regret, but publicly disagreed with Cushing's claim {{that he had been}} kept unaware of government railway policy. [...] On February 25, Cushing gave his account of the events leading to his resignation In the legislature: after responsibility for railways was removed from his department, Rutherford had offered the A guarantees of $20,000 per mile of railway constructed. [...] In making this guarantee, Rutherford had not consulted government engineers in the department of Public Works about construction costs, relying instead on the A's engineer. [...] Cushing felt that guaranteeing $20,000 per mile, regardless of actual construction costs, was unwise, and further believed that the government's reliance on the A's engineer <b>could</b> <b>let</b> the company get away with building a sub-standard railway.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I <b>could</b> <b>let</b> it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} when Moses ascended {{to receive the}} Torah from God, Moses found God writing [...] "longsuffering" [...] among the words with which [...] {{describes}} God. Moses asked God whether God meant longsuffering with the righteous, to which God replied that God is longsuffering even with the wicked. Moses exclaimed that God <b>could</b> <b>let</b> the wicked perish, but God cautioned Moses that Moses would come to desire God's longsuffering for the wicked. Later, when the Israelites sinned at the incident of the spies, God reminded Moses that he had suggested that God be longsuffering only with the righteous, to which Moses recounted that God had promised to be longsuffering even with the wicked. And that is why Moses in [...] cited to God that God is [...] "slow to anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Board of Agriculture was {{established}} by Act of Parliament in 1889. [...] Although rationing during the First World War {{was limited to the}} end of 1917 and 1918, a change of mood arose about food security, and the Ministry of Food was created in 1916. [...] There was a national feeling that a man who had fought for his country should be entitled to retire to a smallholding on British land that would provide him with a livelihood. [...] This led to various initiatives, collectively called Homes for Heroes. [...] By 1926 agricultural law had become openly redistributive in favour of ex-servicemen. County Councils had compulsory purchase powers to requisition land they <b>could</b> <b>let</b> as smallholdings. [...] Ex-servicemen were the preferred tenants. [...] The tenant could then buy the land and could ask the Council to lend them money to fund the purchase as a mortgage. [...] The Council could not refuse without the Minister of Agriculture's permission.|$|E

2500|$|One {{commentator}} {{laid out}} the likely outcome should the Matteen case not be judged on its merits, saying one day a non-Christian would appear before a North Carolina judge and would [...] "create an impasse in court when he refuses to swear on the Bible and declines to affirm an oath, insisting he {{should be allowed to}} place his hand on the Quran or some other holy book and promise before his God to tell the truth". The judge could then [...] "hold the uncooperative witness in contempt, in effect punishing a person who simply asks that his religious beliefs be granted the same respect as those of a Christian. ... While holding the witness in contempt, the judge also could bar the testimony that would have been offered—thereby jeopardizing the case of one party or the other. ...Or the judge <b>could</b> <b>let</b> the witness testify without swearing or affirming to tell the truth.

2500|$|Cougar Town {{was created}} by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. Following the {{cancellation}} of Dirt, Courteney Cox wanted to return to television and do another comedy.

While developing the concept of the show, Lawrence thought he would do a tryout with Cox on Scrubs, by guest starring in the first three episodes of the eighth season. Lawrence and Biegel, who worked together writing episodes on Scrubs, came up with the concept of the show with Cox as a 40-year-old newly single woman because he thought that it was a real [...] "zeitgeist-y topic". He drew inspiration from his real-life wife, actress Christa Miller who also stars in the show as Ellie; Miller had previously worked with Cox as part of the story-arc of the three part Scrubs tryout. Lawrence told Cox that the show could be [...] "high risk, high reward", although Cox decided to go for it.

[...] According to Gentleman's Magazine of 5 Feb 1751, Trigg's will stated that he supposed that he would return to life after 30 years and then his estate would revert to him, and that he ordered that the barn be locked with the key inside his coffin so that he <b>could</b> <b>let</b> himself out. Shortly before he died, Trigg had negotiated with the parish authorities to rent his barn as the town's workhouse.|$|E
