The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> paths of either good or evil, {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} was first {{applied to the}} hydrolysis reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential {{in areas that are}} farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} Mortal Kombat II, {{along with the}} first Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 {{fighting}} game Mortal Kombat, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel to revisit the tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change the future {{in the aftermath of}} Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode of this game <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> same order of bosses as in MKII (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of MKII. Classic costumes from MKII were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters in the PlayStation Vita version.|$|E

25|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} {{the burning of}} the city started soon after the war ended. General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton, which had been stacked in the streets. General Sherman denied ordering the burning, though he did order militarily significant structures, such as the Confederate Printing Plant, destroyed. Firsthand accounts by local residents, Union soldiers, and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbia's and South Carolina's pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the Union. Today, tourists <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> path General Sherman's army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire.|$|E
25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas.|$|E

25|$|The Sitaras Method {{consists}} in an initial comprehensive evaluation system (which can take between 6-12 sessions) for assessing flexibility, cardio-respiratory fitness, strength, endurance, and body fat. Sitaras {{takes into account}} the unique musculature of the person, isolating differences between right and left sides of the body, different parts of each muscle, and the two major muscle fiber types (those for strength, and those for endurance), in order to design a workout tailored to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and goals. An important goal is to develop muscular balance, which is the foundation for more specific goals such as aesthetics, strength and flexibility gains, or developing a more powerful athletic ability. The students must commit to working out at least twice a week, and are subject to a background check. They resume the muscle evaluation every three months with a variety of tools including digital scales, body fat and flexibility readers, and proprietary fitness software that helps track the clients strength gains over time. Based on the muscle evaluation, the fitness programs are adjusted or redesigned. The trainees too <b>can</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> detailed physical changes of their body, giving them motivation and stimulation.|$|E
